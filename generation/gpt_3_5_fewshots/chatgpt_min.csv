0,0,"The 2021 Taliban offensive in Afghanistan continues to make significant gains, with the capture of Zaranj, the provincial capital of Nimruz Province, marking the first major capture of a provincial city by the group since the 2001 invasion. The lack of reinforcements from the central government has been blamed for the city falling into Taliban control. This comes as the Taliban controls over half of Afghanistan's districts and continues its offensive against government forces. The Afghan government has vowed to retake all captured districts, while neighboring countries such as Tajikistan and Turkmenistan have deployed troops and heavy weapons to their borders to prevent a spillover of the conflict. The international community, including the United States and China, have expressed concern over the rising violence and civilian casualties in Afghanistan."

Wildfires continue to ravage Greece, forcing mass evacuations in the northern suburbs of Athens as the flames spread to the outskirts of the capital. The wildfires, which have been fueled by an intense heatwave, have already claimed the lives of two people, including a volunteer firefighter who was struck by a fallen electricity pylon. Another man died in a factory fire caused by the blazes. In addition to the fatalities, 20 people have been injured. Dozens of homes have been destroyed, and authorities are working around the clock to contain the largest fires in Attica, Olympia, Messenia, and Euboea."

Queensland's COVID-19 situation has taken a sudden turn as Cairns and Yarrabah have been placed under a snap three-day lockdown due to an ""unexpected"" case of COVID-19. The infected person is a taxi driver from Kanimbla who was infectious in Far North Queensland for 10 days. The lockdown was put in place to prevent further transmission of the virus. The rest of Queensland is still monitoring the situation closely as the state aims to maintain its low fatality rate, which has been the lowest among any sizeable jurisdiction with its own policing and health powers in the world. As of July 2021, Queensland had only recorded the death of seven patients with COVID-19. The Queensland government continues to implement strict measures, such as the use of the ""Check in Qld"" QR code sign-in/contact tracing app and mask mandates in certain areas, to curb the spread of the virus."

Palau, which registered its first case of COVID-19 on 31 May 2021, has achieved herd immunity as 80% of its population aged 12 and above have been fully vaccinated against the virus. The country began vaccinating its citizens in January 2021, and with the help of vaccines from Operation Warp Speed, emerged as one of the countries with the highest vaccination rates in the world. By the time the first case was detected, 97% of the adult population was vaccinated, while an estimated 96% of adults above 18 years old had been fully vaccinated by 26 May. Plans were announced to expand the vaccination campaign by inoculating adolescents aged 12 to 17.

At the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the Palauan government implemented stringent border controls to prevent the spread of the virus. Its President, Thomas Remengesau Jr., issued an executive order that suspended all charter flights from China, Macau, and Hong Kong, eventually closing down the country's borders in March 2020. Schools were also shut down, and travel to Palau was suspended. These measures helped mitigate the impact of the virus in the country. 

The country's tourism industry, which accounts for a significant portion of its economy, was badly affected, leading to plans easing the restrictions on travel as vaccination rates continued to rise. By 1 April 2021, Palau agreed to establish a travel bubble with Taiwan, allowing people to travel between the two countries with restrictions. Plans are underway to reach similar agreements with other low-risk countries.

With the high vaccination rate, the risk of COVID-19 entering the country has diminished, allowing Palau to cautiously reopen. The country's government has urged tourists to follow safety protocols to keep the population safe, and with vaccination campaigns aimed at adolescents, the government hopes to further reduce the risk of transmission."

Egypt and Russia have a long history of bilateral relations, dating back to before the 16th century. The relationship suffered following the death of former Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, as his successor Anwar Sadat moved the country towards the West. Relations were restored in 1984 under President Hosni Mubarak, and since the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office in 2013, the two countries have worked towards strengthening military and trade ties. Russia accounts for 31% of Egypt's imports of major weapons from 2009 to 2018. In December 2017, the two countries signed deals for Russia to build Egypt's first nuclear reactor and construct a Russian Industrial Zone along the Suez Canal. 

On November 28, 2015, Egypt and Russia signed an agreement to allow their warplanes to use each other's airbases and airspace, reflecting a close relationship between the countries. In summer 2020, Egypt received five Su-35 jets from Russia, despite the threat of sanctions from the United States. However, the revelation of the transaction by a Russian journalist resulted in his detention for disclosing a state secret. 

In the most recent development, direct commercial flights between Russia and Egypt resumed in 2020 for the first time since the Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing in 2015, which killed 224 people, mostly Russian tourists. The resumption of flights marks a significant step in restoring tourism and economic ties between the countries. Russians constitute the largest group of outsiders to visit Egypt, while Egypt is the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroad. Additionally, the Egyptian Russian University was opened in Badr City, Cairo, in 2006, offering training in pharmacy and engineering."

As of the fourth consecutive day, the country is trying to manage a total of 69 fires that have spread rapidly. Firefighting aircraft has not been readily available, causing distant villagers to flee or resort to using basic tools like buckets and branches to try and halt the spread of the flames. The wildfires have destroyed olive trees, killed cattle, and burned down homes. On August 11, 2021, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune declared three days of national mourning to remember the victims of the devastating wildfires in northern Algeria."

Lebanon's ongoing liquidity crisis continues to worsen as the Central Bank decides to end fuel subsidies, which will likely lead to a significant increase in fuel prices. The crisis started in August 2019 and has been further compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Beirut port explosion in 2020. The Lebanese pound has been pegged at 1,507.5 LBP per USD since 1997, but due to several financial hardships, the black market exchange rate started diverging from the official exchange rate in August 2019. In March 2021, the black market exchange rate reached 14,000 LBP per USD, indicating acute USD shortages in Lebanon. This shortage has caused 785 restaurants and cafes to close, resulting in 25,000 employees losing their jobs. The country's GDP has fallen from about 55 billion USD to 44 billion USD, and consumer goods prices have increased by 580% since October 2020. Lebanons sovereign debt has become junk rated, and the debt to GDP ratio is now at 170%. On 1 June 2021, the World Bank reported that the economic crisis in Lebanon is at risk of becoming one of the three most severe since the mid-19th century if significant reforms are not implemented. The crisis has also affected the banking sector, with depositors unable to access their deposits and turn to real estate and share purchases instead."

On September 20, 2021, Canada will hold a federal election to select members of the House of Commons for the 44th Canadian Parliament. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau requested Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve the parliament for the election on August 15, 2021. As per the fixed-date provisions of the Canada Elections Act, the latest possible election date is the third Monday of October in the fourth calendar year after the previous election's polling day. However, since the current government holds a minority, the election can occur earlier if the Governor General dissolves the parliament due to a motion of no confidence or the Prime Minister calls for a snap election. The dissolved parliament also led to the cancellation of the by-election in Haldimand-Norfolk.

In the previous 2019 federal election, the Liberal Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, lost its majority while winning the most seats in the House of Commons. The Conservative Party remained the Official Opposition, with Andrew Scheer temporarily serving as its leader until he resigned to trigger a leadership election. The Bloc Québécois became the third-largest party, and the New Democratic Party lost seats but retained its status as an official party. The Green Party increased its seats in the House of Commons but failed to secure the required twelve MPs for official party status.

Several MPs have announced that they will not run in the upcoming federal election. The Leaders' Debates Commission has proposed recommendations for future election debates, calling for a permanent and publicly funded commission to organize debates and set criteria for participation.

Among the notable events leading to the election include Trudeau's request for dissolution, the cancellation of a by-election, and the announcement of MPs not running in the election. The Canadian public will select members of the House of Commons for the 44th Canadian Parliament on September 20, 2021."

The Panjshir conflict, which is a political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban, is showing signs of escalating as resistance forces loyal to Amrullah Saleh have reportedly re-captured Charikar and surrounding areas in Parwan Province from the Taliban. The conflict began following the Fall of Kabul (2021), and as of August 2021, the Panjshir Valley was the only region out of Taliban's hands. Prior to the fall of Kabul, the Panjshiris had moved military equipment such as helicopters and armored vehicles into Panjshir Province, where they were joined by commanders of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. On 17 August 2021, citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, Amrullah Saleh declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Mohammadi. As of 17 August 2021, the Panjshir Valley was under siege on all sides but had not come under direct attack. Russian intelligence sources reported the latest development in the conflict on an undisclosed date."

On September 8th, gunmen opened fire at a mosque in the village of Theim in southwestern Niger, killing 16 people who were praying. The attacks began in January of this year and have escalated in frequency, especially in the western region of Tillabéri. Over the course of the year, the attacks have left more than 450 people dead and countless others injured. These indiscriminate attacks have primarily been carried out by Islamist militants who arrived in the villages while crossing the border from Mali, leaving Niger struggling to protect its citizens. These attacks are the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. Fear and tension continue to grip the region as Niger's military presence patrols the borders and villages where these attacks have taken place."

Operation Allies Refuge was launched by the Biden administration to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan. The operation is concurrent with the larger American military withdrawal from the country. On July 14, the operation's name was officially unveiled. 

As of August 22, the United States has evacuated 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans, from Afghanistan in the past few weeks. The first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing on July 30, with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants remaining in the process of being relocated. 

After the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated, on August 12, the Biden administration announced that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to the Kabul International Airport to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. Following the fall of Kabul on August 15, the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. The U.S. military took control over the air traffic control of the airport later in the day. 

On August 16, a C-17 cargo plane safely evacuated roughly 823 people to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The head of U.S. Central Command, General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., met Taliban leaders based in Qatar's capital, Doha, and the Taliban officials agreed to terms set by McKenzie for refugees to flee using Kabul Airport. 

Approximately 1,100 people were evacuated on 13 flights on August 17, and more than 2,000 people were evacuated on 12 flights on August 19. On August 18, approximately 2,000 people were evacuated, and on August 20, approximately 5,700 people were evacuated on 16 flights. The Department of Defense ordered the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet on August 22 to assist in the evacuation, with 18 planes from various commercial airlines deployed to transport thousands of Afghans who are arriving at U.S. bases in Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. 

During the evacuation, at least eight people were killed at the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes. The Pentagon said that two armed men who fired into a crowd were killed by U.S. troops, and at least two people were seen falling to their deaths from the sky after clinging to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane. Additionally, at least three people clinging to the side of an Air Force jet were killed after being run over, and remains of another dead Afghan were found in the landing gear of the American C-17, after the pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in a nearby country because they were unable to retract the landing gear."

The conflict between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban-controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has escalated as Ahmad Massoud, the leader of the Panjshir resistance, and self-proclaimed acting president Amrullah Saleh refuse to surrender the Panjshir Valley. The valley remains the only region out of the Taliban's control, largely due to its strong natural defences and the support of local civilians and anti-Taliban forces, including remnants of the Afghan National Army. Ahmad Massoud claims to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and armored humvees in the valley but acknowledges differences between his forces and those loyal to Saleh. While Massoud is open to negotiating with the Taliban, Saleh is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani. As of now, war seems ""unavoidable"" if the Taliban refuse dialogue on the formation of a comprehensive government.

The 2021 Niger attacks continue to occur with increasing frequency, resulting in the deaths of over 500 people and leaving more than 100 others injured. The attacks, which began in January, have taken place primarily in the western region of Tillabéri. Prior to 2021, major attacks in Niger had taken place during the 2010s and 2020. However, this year marks the first time that over 100 civilians have been killed in single incidents, with the January attack and 21 March attack being the deadliest against civilians in Niger since the insurgency in the Maghreb began.

The January attacks occurred in the villages of Tchombangou and Zaroumdareye, resulting in 105 deaths. The attackers were Islamist militants who crossed the border from Mali. The exact terrorist organization responsible for these attacks is not yet known. 

In February, seven members of an electoral commission were killed and three others were wounded in a landmine explosion in Tillabéri. This attack, which targeted individuals involved in Niger's presidential election, occurred on the same day as the election's second round. 

On 16 March, armed men attacked a convoy returning from a market in Banibangou, killing 58 people. 

The deadliest attack occurred on 21 March when militants riding motorbikes attacked three villages in the Tahoua Region, killing 137 people. This attack was the deadliest committed by suspected jihadists in Niger's history.

In August, gunmen attacked a military post in Diffa, killing 16 soldiers and wounding nine others. In the ensuing gun battle, around 50 Boko Haram militants were killed. 

These attacks are believed to be carried out by various Islamist militant groups, including Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa.

On 26 August 2021, a devastating suicide bombing took place at an entrance of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing at least 90 Afghan civilians and 13 American servicemembers. More than 150 others were wounded in what is being described as one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul in recent years. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP), who had previously threatened the airport, have claimed responsibility for the attack.

The airport had become the only secure escape route from Afghanistan after the Taliban took control of the country on 15 August, leading to a mass evacuation effort by foreign troops and humanitarian organizations. Security concerns were already high due to the escape of hundreds of ISIL-KP members from Bagram and Pul-e-Charkhi jails. Hours before the attack, US diplomats in Kabul had warned American citizens to leave the airport due to terrorism threats. UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey had also warned of an imminent attack by ISIL-KP.

The first suicide bomber detonated his explosive at an entrance gate, followed by a second bomb attack at the nearby Baron Hotel, which had been used as a gathering point for American citizens and a processing center for Afghan refugees. The explosions triggered gunfire and chaos, with all gates at the airport being shut down.

Leaders across the world have condemned the attacks and offered condolences to the victims and families. French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged full support for coordinating with ""American allies"" in responding to the bombings. The Taliban, who have taken control of Afghanistan, have also condemned the attacks, saying that ""evil circles will be strictly stopped."""

However, the United States launched an airstrike in Nangarhar on August 27, killing two ISIL-KP members and injuring a third, one of whom was believed to be planning further attacks in Kabul. The Taliban condemned the attack and announced their intention to capture ISIL-KP leader Shahab al-Muhajir.

Since the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, relations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the United States have been tense. While the US does not officially recognize the Taliban as a government, they have stated that they would be willing to recognize a government that respects basic human rights.

On August 27, the Taliban appointed Khalil Haqqani, a designated terrorist with a US$5 million bounty on his head, as head of security in Kabul. This move was met with criticism from the United States.

Following the 2021 Kabul airport attack, both the US and the Taliban condemned the attack, with the Taliban later announcing their intention to capture the ISIS-K leader responsible for the attack. In response, the US launched an airstrike on August 27, killing two ISIS-K planners and facilitators.

The airstrike was met with condemnation from the Taliban, who considered it a ""clear attack on Afghan territory"". The situation between the US and the Taliban remains tense as the Islamic Emirate seeks international recognition for their new government."
21,43,"UPDATED VERSION:

Since the Taliban successfully reclaimed power in August 2021, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has been hit by three known drone strikes. The latest attack, which occurred recently, targeted a vehicle in Kabul and resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people, including seven children. The driver of the vehicle was an aid worker for the U.S. based organization Nutrition and Education International, who was returning from a water collection trip for his family. Many of the victims had previously worked for international organizations and held visas for the United States. Along with other civilians, they lost their lives to the attack. 

The previous two drone strikes took place in late August 2021. The first, which occurred on August 27, targeted an ISIS-K member in Nangarhar Province, resulting in the deaths of at least two high-profile members of the group. A day later, on August 28, a U.S. airstrike targeted a vehicle carrying a family of nine people, who were mistakenly identified as ISIS-K members. All occupants of the vehicle, including six children, died in the attack.

The U.S. has not released an official statement regarding the latest drone strike, but the country has faced criticism for its reliance on drones in Afghanistan and the resulting civilian casualties. As the situation in the country continues to be unstable, it remains uncertain what the future holds for Afghanistan and its people."

The Panjshir conflict, which started following the fall of Kabul and Amrullah Saleh declaring himself Afghan President and initiating the Panjshir Resistance, remains ongoing, but the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan has announced that their fighters have killed eight Taliban members in recent clashes in the Panjshir Valley. The Taliban forces have deployed heavily around the valley. However, negotiations are also ongoing between the two sides to end the conflict. The valley has previously been known for its natural defenses and never fell to the Soviets or the Taliban during previous conflicts. The Panjshir Valley is currently the only region that is outside of Taliban control following their takeover of Afghanistan. The majority of the Taliban are Pashtuns while the people in the valley are mostly made up of ethnic Tajiks. Originally, Saleh had declared himself president of Afghanistan from the valley and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. The forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud have differences, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, while the latter has had good relations with Pakistan, which was supportive of the Taliban. As a result, Massoud was more willing to negotiate with the Taliban. Despite the ongoing conflict, it appears that there has been no public support from the international community as the US and other countries focus on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul and seek the Taliban's cooperation to do so."
23,47,"UPDATED VERSION:

The Panjshir conflict, which began after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021, has escalated with the group entering the Panjshir Valley to confront resistance forces led by Ahmad Massoud. The Taliban claims to have gained some territory, while both sides reported heavy casualties in the clashes. The valley, which is largely controlled by former Afghan President Amrullah Saleh and Massoud, is well known for its natural defences and has never fallen to either the Soviets or the Taliban previously. The population of the Panjshir valley is mostly ethnic Tajik, while the Taliban is predominantly Pashtun. The Panjshir conflict has not gained much international support, with most countries preoccupied with evacuating their citizens and allies from Afghanistan. Some analysts suggest that the resistance's successes could inspire other anti-Taliban groups to resist their rule."

Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation that aimed to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants. The operation was carried out alongside the American military's withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans. The U.S. military airlifted SIV applicants to the United States, where they were housed by the military temporarily while they completed their SIV requirements.

The operation was officially named on July 14, 2021, by the Biden administration. In July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs (ALLIES) Act to expedite the Afghan SIV process and increase the visa cap for Afghan interpreters.

Fast forward to August 31, when the United States concluded its military withdrawal from Afghanistan. However, following the withdrawal, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain announced that around 100 Americans remained in Afghanistan and that the Biden administration would continue efforts to rescue them.

During the operation, which began on August 12, the U.S. military deployed 3,000 troops to Hamid Karzai International Airport to help evacuate embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. The military airlifted thousands of people from the airport to various international destinations, including 5,000 from Afghanistan on August 19 alone. Between August 15 and August 31, the U.S. evacuated over 120,000 people from Afghanistan, including 6,000 American citizens and 78,000 Afghan citizens.

However, the evacuation was not without casualties. At least 195 people were killed at or near the Kabul airport, including 13 U.S. service members who died in a suicide bombing attack on August 26. The attack, carried out by ISIS militants, also killed 169 Afghan civilians and wounded over 200 others.

As of September 2, a nine-month-old baby was reported to have died after arriving in the United States, becoming the first death of an evacuee on American soil.

Despite the challenges and the tragic loss of life during the operation, the U.S. military successfully evacuated tens of thousands of people from Afghanistan, including vulnerable Afghans and U.S. citizens. The Biden administration vowed to continue efforts to rescue the remaining Americans in Afghanistan."

On September 7th at 20:47 local time, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake rocked the coast of Guerrero, Mexico, just outside the popular city of Acapulco. The earthquake, which had an estimated intensity of VII on the MMI scale, occurred on the four-year anniversary of the devastating 2017 Chiapas earthquake that killed at least 100 people. The earthquake is believed to have been a thrust faulting event, located on or near the subduction zone boundary of the Caribbean Plate and Cocos Plate. The US Geological Survey states that earthquakes of this size have a rupture size of 40x20 km. 

The earthquake hit the southern extent of the Guerrero Gap, a seismic gap capable of generating an 8.0 magnitude earthquake. In Acapulco, just 3 km from the epicenter, buildings swayed and sustained damage, and numerous power outages and gas leaks were reported. The governor of Guerrero, Héctor Astudillo, confirmed that one person was killed in Coyuca de Benítez due to a falling pole.

A tsunami measuring 0.37 meters (1.2 feet) was recorded in Acapulco. More than 1.6 million people were left without electricity, and authorities are assessing the situation. Acapulco Mayor Adela Román urges residents to remain calm."

Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation aimed at evacuating at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants from Afghanistan. The operation ran concurrently with the larger American military withdrawal from the country and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans. As part of the operation, SIV applicants were airlifted to the United States, where they were temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their SIV requirements.

Initially unveiled by the Biden administration on 14 July 2021, the operation's name became synonymous with the massive airlift efforts to evacuate people from Kabul after the Taliban took over the country in mid-August 2021. U.S. personnel worked with NATO and regional allies to evacuate thousands of people from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, including American citizens, permanent residents, and refugees, as well as Afghan interpreters and applicants for Special Immigrant Visas.

The evacuation effort involved a massive airlift operation, with military and commercial planes transporting people to military bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. From there, they were flown to Germany, Italy, Spain, and other locations before ultimately arriving in the United States. The initial efforts saved thousands of lives, though efforts were also affected by multiple obstacles, such as Taliban checkpoints, overcrowding at the airport, and suicide bombings that killed more than 180 people.

As the operation continued, more U.S. military bases were set up to house Afghan nationals applying for SIVs or considered ""at risk"" from the Taliban. The activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet also assisted in the evacuation of people.

On 5 September, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said around 100 Americans remained in Afghanistan, and the Biden administration was looking for ways to rescue them. Then, on 7 September, the last U.S. military plane departed from Kabul airport, marking the end of the evacuation operation. 

As the situation in Afghanistan remains unstable and uncertain, Operation Allies Refuge and the massive airlift efforts will be remembered as a critical turning point in the country's recent history. On 9 September, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed that 21 Americans have been evacuated from Afghanistan."

Since January 2001, the United States government has conducted multiple drone strikes in Afghanistan, with at least 13,074 strikes resulting in the deaths of 4,138 people, including 310 civilians and 73 children as of 2021. The use of drone strikes increased at a pace of four to five times during the presidency of Donald Trump compared to his predecessor, Barack Obama. The Afghan Air Force also carried out airstrikes in the region. The U.S. has faced criticism for the number of civilian casualties resulting from drone strikes. In September 2021, Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. acknowledged that a drone strike conducted near Kabul International Airport on August 29 killed 10 civilians instead of ISIL-K militants. The U.S. government has ordered a review of its targeting procedures in Afghanistan. Amnesty International USA has also questioned the legality of drone attacks."

On September 18, 2021, a rally was held near the United States Capitol to show support for the people who were arrested for their involvement in the January 6 attack on the building. The event was organized by Look Ahead America, a non-profit organization led by former Trump campaign staffer Matt Braynard. The rally, known as the ""Justice for J6"" event, drew a small crowd of around 400 to 450 people. 

Law enforcement officials and lawmakers had expressed concerns about the rally, and preparations were made to ensure the safety of the Capitol building. A fence was erected around the building, and multiple congressional offices were closed on September 17. Despite these measures, at least four participants in the rally were arrested for various offenses. One man was found to be in possession of a knife, while another was found to be in possession of a gun.

Former President Donald Trump had urged his supporters not to attend the rally, calling it a ""setup"" for Republican voters. Far-right groups like the Proud Boys also urged members not to attend the event. Despite this, the rally went ahead, with organizers criticizing the security measures put in place as an attempt to discourage participants.

In summary, the ""Justice for J6"" rally was held on September 18 near the United States Capitol to show support for those arrested for their roles in the January 6 attack. Security measures were put in place, and four participants were arrested for various offenses.

After being postponed multiple times, the first ever general elections in Qatar were held on October 2, 2021. Men and women over the age of 18 were eligible to vote for 30 out of the 45 seats in the Consultative Assembly, while the remaining seats were appointed by the Emir. A total of 284 candidates ran for the 30 seats, with 29 women participating. Political parties were banned, and all the candidates ran as independents. The electoral law mandated the thirty members to be elected from single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, and candidates had to be at least thirty years old and 'of Qatari origin'. However, this limited the eligibility of people descended from those who held citizenship in 1930 and resulted in protests. The announcement of the elections came from Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in November 2020. The previous retiring Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani had postponed the elections in June 2013 until at least 2016, and they were repeatedly postponed until the current Emir announced they would finally be held in 2021."

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) shook up the world on October 2, 2021, when they announced the release of the Pandora Papers, a staggering 11.9 million leaked documents exposing hidden wealth, tax evasion, and money laundering among politicians, celebrities, and billionaires worldwide. This is the largest offshore data leak in history, dwarfing the infamous Panama Papers leak of 11.5 million documents.

The Pandora Papers implicate 330 politicians, including 35 national leaders, and numerous celebrities, with 130 billionaires among the 29,000 beneficiaries spanning 27,000 companies. The first leaks, released on October 3, 2021, named over 100 billionaires, 30 current and former leaders, and 300 public officials. The ICIJ has described the document leak as their most expansive exposé of financial secrecy to date.

Although not illegal, the papers revealed that Tony Blair, former Prime Minister of the UK, saved £312,000 in Stamp Duty on the purchase of a £6.45million property in London by purchasing Romanstone International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company.

The Pandora Papers have sparked worldwide debates about financial transparency and accountability, with governments and international bodies calling for reforms to prevent such practices. The ICIJ's release of the Pandora Papers is a monumental move towards greater accountability for those in power and a massive stride towards transparency in the notoriously secretive world of offshore finance."

The largest offshore data leak in history has been exposed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), who published 11.9 million leaked documents comprising 2.9 terabytes of data on October 3, 2021. This data leak reveals hidden wealth, tax evasion, and money laundering among 29,000 beneficiaries among 27,000 companies, including 330 politicians, 130 billionaires, and numerous celebrities worldwide.

The Pandora Papers expose 35 national leaders, 400 officials from nearly 100 countries, and more than 100 billionaires. The ICIJ worked with journalists in 117 countries, including news organizations such as The Washington Post, L'Espresso, Le Monde, El País, Süddeutsche Zeitung, PBS program Frontline, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, The Guardian, and the BBC's Panorama.

The documents were leaked from 14 offshore service providers that help clients establish companies in secrecy jurisdictions, with Panamanian law firm Aleman, Cordero, Galindo & Lee (Alcogal) creating at least 14,000 shell companies and trusts in tax havens. Alcogal was mentioned more than any other offshore provider in the leaked documents.

Among the notable figures revealed in the Pandora Papers are former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Montenegrin President Milo Đukanović, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim, Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba, and Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso. Other global names mentioned include Shakira, Claudia Schiffer, Sachin Tendulkar, Alexandre Cazes, Pakistan's finance minister Shaukat Fayaz Ahmed Tarin, and several family members of Pakistan's top generals, the CEO of Channel One Russia Konstantin Ernst, and celebrities like Miguel Bose, Pep Guardiola, and Julio Iglesias.

The documents show how King Abdullah II of Jordan invested over $100 million in property across the UK and the US, with properties in London, Malibu, Washington, DC, and Ascot. A UK company controlled by Cherie Blair was shown to have acquired a £6.45 million property in London through purchasing a British Virgin Islands company, and Tony Blair's name appears in a statement of joint income for the associated mortgage. The papers also reveal how an office block owned by the Aliyev family was sold to the Crown Estate for £66 million in 2018, netting the Aliyevs a £31 million profit.

In response to the Pandora Papers, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that all citizens mentioned in the leaked documents would be investigated, and appropriate action would be taken in case of wrongdoing. The ICIJ described the documents as their most expansive exposé of financial secrecy yet, surpassing their previous release of the Panama Papers in 2016 by nearly half a million documents."

A 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan's Balochistan province near the city of Harnai on October 7, 2021, killing at least 24 people and injuring around 200. The deadly earthquake occurred near the anniversary of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, which killed 87,000 people. Pakistan is directly influenced by the ongoing oblique convergence between the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate. Thrust faulting in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya region is the direct result of the plate interaction. The convergence is highly oblique in the Balochistan region, involving the large Chaman Fault; a strike-slip structure and many thrust faults. The earthquake occurred during the rupture of a thrust fault under the Sulaiman Mountains and Central Brāhui Range, as reported by the U.S. Geological Survey. It was followed by a magnitude 4.6 aftershock. This earthquake was the largest in Pakistan since the major tremor in 2013 which occurred nearby and killed at least 800 people.

The earthquake struck early in the morning, just after 03:00 local time, collapsing many homes where residents were asleep. Most of the 24 victims were women and children. An unspecified number of residents were buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings and rescued by survivors. The number of injured people is around 200, with many hospitals in Balochistan overwhelmed by the influx of patients. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) (PDMA) reported severe damage in the Harnai District and Shahrag area, where at least 70 homes were affected. Damage was also reported in the cities of Sibi and Quetta.

Following the earthquake, troops from the Pakistan Army were dispatched in Harnai to aid in rescue and relief operations. At least nine injured victims in need of medical treatment were transported via helicopters from the affected region to Quetta. The Inter-Services Public Relations, army, medical personnel, response workers, and officials are working together to coordinate rescue and relief works. A team of search and rescue individuals from Rawalpindi was sent to Harnai to find survivors among the wreckage."

The killing of MP Sir David Amess, who was stabbed to death on 15 October 2021 at a constituency meeting in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, has been declared a terrorist incident by police. Amess was an instantly recognizable member of the Conservative Party, and a long-serving politician who had entered Parliament in 1983 as the MP for Basildon. He had campaigned in favor of Brexit, for stronger animal welfare protections, and to award Southend-on-Sea city status. The motivation of the attacker remains unknown. A 25-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder, and a knife was recovered. Essex Police later announced that the investigation had been handed over to counter-terrorist officers. The suspect is a British national who may have Somali heritage. In light of Amess's death, campaigning activities on behalf of the Conservative Party have been suspended nationwide until further notice, and the security of MPs will be reviewed. Various parliamentary groups and current and former politicians from across the political spectrum expressed shock and offered condolences, as did relatives of Jo Cox. A vigil for Amess was held in his Southend West constituency, and BBC One changed its evening schedule out of respect."

Protests by Kosovo Serbs against the government's decision to ban Serbian license plates began on September 20, 2021, and ended on October 2, 2021, after an agreement was reached in Brussels. Following the ban on Serbian license plates, drivers were required to switch to Kosovar license plates at a government registration center, which impacted around 9,500 vehicles in North Kosovo. The ban was intended to mirror the former ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia, as the Republic of Serbia does not recognize the Republic of Kosovo and considers the Kosovo-Serbia border temporary.

The protests involved blocking traffic near border crossings, with around hundreds of local ethnic Serbs protesting daily, and vehicles serving as barricades. The protests were largely peaceful, although two government vehicle registration centers were attacked by arson on September 25, 2021, and three people unrelated to the protests were allegedly injured by the Kosovo Police on September 23, 2021.

The agreement between the governments of Kosovo and Serbia mediated by the European Union (EU) Representative for the Balkan-Pristina Dialogue, Miroslav Lajčák, ended the ban on Serbian license plates and Kosovar license plates in Serbia. According to the agreement, the national symbols of Kosovo on RKS license plates and the national symbols of Serbia on Serbian license plates in Kosovo would be covered with a sticker. On October 4, 2021, the ban was lifted, and KFOR troops replaced the police units. The working group consisting of negotiators from the governments of Kosovo and Serbia also met for the first time in Brussels, aimed at finding a more permanent solution to the license plate issue. If negotiations are successful, the group will announce their proposals in six months.

The ban on Serbian license plates and the ongoing protests prompted Serbian authorities to raise the combat readiness of the Serbian Armed Forces, transport military equipment to the border area, and describe the ban as a ""criminal action."" The President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, made the withdrawal of the Kosovar special police as a condition for starting EU-mediated negotiations to resolve the dispute. In contrast, the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Albin Kurti, accused Serbia of inciting and supporting the attacks on government buildings, exploiting Kosovo citizens to provoke an international conflict."

Sir David Amess, a British Conservative Party politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for Southend West, was fatally stabbed multiple times during a political surgery at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex on October 15, 2021. Following the attack, a man named Ali Harbi Ali was arrested at the scene and charged later for murder and the preparation of terrorist acts. He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court and the Old Bailey, where he was charged with the murder of David Amess and was remanded to Belmarsh prison. Ali is set to be tried on March 7, 2022.

Amess served as an MP for Basildon from 1983 and was known for his socially conservative views, support of animal welfare, and a campaign to award city status to Southend-on-Sea, Essex. He was a devout Catholic who opposed abortion, supported capital punishment, and campaigned for Brexit.

Following the attack, British political leaders expressed shock and offered condolences, while a vigil for Amess was held in his Southend West constituency. The Speaker of the House of Commons announced that the security of MPs will be reviewed, and there were calls to enact a law to crack down on online targeting of MPs and end anonymity.

In the days following Amess's death, a number of MPs voiced their support for a campaign to give Southend-on-Sea city status as a way of honoring Amess's memory. On October 18, the Prime Minister announced that the Queen had agreed to Southend being given city status.

Amess's death triggered a by-election to fill his former seat, and major and minor parties announced that they would not stand a candidate to oppose the Conservatives, as a sign of respect, following the precedent set in the 2016 Batley and Spen by-election.

The trial of Ali Harbi Ali for the murder of David Amess is set to take place on March 7, 2022."

Solar cycle 25 began in December 2019 with a minimum sunspot number of 1.8 and is expected to continue until around 2030. Initially, there were widely varying predictions regarding the strength of the cycle, from very weak to strong. However, most scientific literature now predicts that solar cycle 25 will be weaker than average. The Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel predicted in December 2019 that the cycle would be similar to the previous cycle 24, and the number of sunspots would reach a maximum of 115 in July 2025. 

Early signs of the new cycle included polarward reversed polarity sunspots suggesting a transition to cycle 25 was in process, and in November 2019, two reversed polarity sunspots appeared, signaling the onset of the cycle. Bipolar magnetic regions observed in December 2019 also represented early signs of the new cycle. 

Solar activity has continued to increase throughout 2020 and 2021, with the first C-class and M-class solar flares of cycle 25 taking place in May 2020. By November 2020, flares were taking place on a near-daily basis, and an M4.4 flare on November 29, the strongest of the cycle to date, indicated that the solar cycle would be more active than initially thought. In December 2020, a small coronal mass ejection hit Earth, causing bright aurorae at high latitudes. 

In 2021, an X-class solar flare, the second of the current solar cycle, erupted. An associated coronal mass ejection may graze Earth on October 30 or 31, causing bright aurorae and interfering with satellite communications. The number of spotless days continues to decrease, with 18% of days in 2021 being spotless as of August 28, compared to 52% in 2020 and 75% in 2019. 

Overall, solar cycle 25 is expected to be weaker than average but has shown greater activity than predicted in recent months."

In the 2021 New Jersey gubernatorial election, Incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy won a second term as Governor, defeating Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli. Murphy announced his intention to run for re-election on October 1, 2020, and won the Democratic nomination unopposed. Ciattarelli was chosen as the Republican nominee after winning the primary, which eliminated candidates like Brian Levine, Phil Rizzo, and Hirsh Singh.

The general election, which took place on November 2, 2021, saw Murphy easily defeat Ciattarelli, making him the first Democratic Governor of the state to be re-elected since Brendan Byrne in 1977. Five other candidates also ran in the election, including Libertarian Gregg Mele, Green Party candidate Madelyn Hoffman, Socialist Workers' nominee Joanne Kuniansky, and Ed Forchion of the Legalize Marijuana Party. However, Murphy and Ciattarelli were the main contenders.

Although New Jersey State Law gives until September 1, 2021, for independent gubernatorial candidates to fundraise $490,000 to qualify for the debates, the invitees of the first debate were definitively stated at around July 20, 2021, which was over a month before the deadline. All mention outside the actual written law was subsequently deleted or rendered impossible to find through search browsers. Despite the third-party candidates being ineligible to debate in any debates that were sponsored by the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, the New Jersey Globe held another debate for third-party Lieutenant Governor candidates on October 11, 2021.

In terms of running mates, Murphy had incumbent Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver by his side, while Ciattarelli chose former state senator Diane Allen to run with him. Primaries for the election took place on June 8, 2021, with Murphy winning the Democratic nomination and Ciattarelli clinching the Republican one.

In conclusion, the 2021 New Jersey gubernatorial election saw Incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy win a second term as Governor, defeating Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli. Murphy's triumph marks the first time since 1977 that a Democratic Governor has been re-elected in the state of New Jersey."

The mortuary at Connaught Hospital has received 92 bodies so far. Many of the injured are in critical condition, and about 30 victims with severe burns are not expected to survive, according to a staff member of the hospital's intensive care unit. President Julius Maada Bio offered condolences to the victims' families and pledged support. Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals to assess the situation. Journalist Omar Fofana reported that the hospital services in Freetown are stretched. Freetown, a port city with over 1 million people, has faced several disasters in the past, including mudslides in 2017 that killed over 1000 people and a massive fire in March that left more than 5000 people displaced."

The cause of death is still under investigation, but drug overdose is being investigated as a potential cause of cardiac arrest for some of the victims. Twenty-three others were hospitalized and more than 300 people were treated for injuries at the festival's field hospital. The second night of the festival was cancelled following the incident. Gov. Greg Abbott expressed his condolences to the victims and their families, while Travis Scott stated he would support the investigation and help heal the Houston community. Kylie Jenner, Scott's girlfriend, faced criticism for her Instagram posts depicting the crowd, including one with an ambulance attempting to make its way through the crowd. The incident occurred during the first night of the annual Astroworld Festival, which had around 50,000 attendees, but it is not the first time a stampede has occurred during the event. In 2019, three people were injured in a stampede at the festival. The Houston Fire Department had 55 in-service units present at the festival, including 367 police officers and 241 security officers.

A fuel tanker explosion that occurred at a busy junction in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, on November 5, 2021, has now claimed the lives of 115 people, according to new information. The collision between a petrol fuel tanker and a lorry caused an explosion and fire that engulfed vehicles, people, and nearby shops, overwhelming the city's medical services. The incident occurred at a popular intersection known as ""PMB"" in the city's main industrial district. The tanker collided with a lorry carrying granite, causing fuel leakage. Petrol spilled from the tanker, and locals attempted to collect it, leading to an explosion that created a huge fireball. Many of the victims were trapped in vehicles, including a bus that was intensely burnt, killing all its passengers. Footage broadcast by local media outlets showed charred bodies surrounding the tanker. The event has been described as first of its kind in the densely populated city of more than 1.2 million people and is one of several similar high-casualty fuel tanker explosions across sub-Saharan Africa. President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, offered condolences and promised support to the victims' families. The vice president visited hospitals, where services have been overwhelmed, and about 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive. Mohamed Lamrane Bah, the director of the National Disaster Management Agency, stated that rescue efforts at the scene had ended, with the injured transferred to hospitals and the bodies collected."

Israel's COVID-19 vaccination programme, dubbed ""Give a Shoulder"" (Hebrew: לתת כתף), has been hailed for its speed and success in vaccinating a high proportion of its population. As of June 26, 2021, around 64% of eligible Israelis have received at least one dose, and 60% are fully vaccinated, making Israel one of the populations with the highest vaccination rates in the world per capita. The programme focused on the elderly, healthcare workers, and other high-risk groups, and utilized the country's centralized government and health maintenance organizations to coordinate national vaccination drives using databases of personal information to contact residents directly.

In August 2021, Israel rolled out a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to people over the age of 60, based on data showing significant waning immunity from infection over time for those with two doses. The country expanded the availability to all Israelis over the age of 12, five months after their second shot. Israel's coronavirus czar announced that Israelis who had not received a booster shot within six months of their second dose would lose access to the country's green pass vaccine passport.

Recently, Israel's pandemic advisory board approved the usage of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11. This decision is seen as a significant step in the country's efforts to combat the virus and protect its population, especially as concerns grow about the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant. 

However, the distribution of vaccines to Palestinians has been less thorough than to Israeli citizens, with many Palestinian laborers receiving their doses only in March 2021. Haredi Jews and Arab-Israelis also had a lower rate of vaccination and were comparatively more likely to be hesitant or skeptical about taking the vaccine. Israeli authorities also faced early distribution issues, including scheduling appointments and lack of sufficient distribution to less-populated villages and Arab-Israeli communities. However, Israel addressed these issues through messaging, incentives, extensions to the initial vaccine delivery system, and other measures.

Despite these challenges, Israel's vaccination programme has produced evidence that the Pfizer vaccine works to stop transmission of the virus, including asymptomatic infections, and curbed deaths in the country. The success of the programme has been credited to the centralized systems its health maintenance organizations maintained and the country's organized response in attaining, storing, and distributing vaccines. With approval for vaccination of children as young as five, Israel continues to prioritize its population's health and safety in its battle against COVID-19."

A taxi explosion that occurred on November 14, 2021, outside the Liverpool Women's Hospital in Liverpool, England, has been declared a terrorist incident by the police. The explosion caused the death of the bomber, who was carrying an improvised explosive device of his own making, and injured the taxi driver, who had noticed the device and locked the bomber in the vehicle before the explosion. The driver was treated for injuries and later released. 

Merseyside Police, along with the bomb squad, fire, and ambulance crews, attended the scene, and the hospital was put under lockdown, with roads closed and a cordon in place around the hospital. Three arrests were made under the Terrorism Act, and police raided a property in the Sefton Park area, which is within walking distance of the hospital. MI5 joined the investigation in a support role for local police, and the UK terror threat level was raised from substantial to severe.

The incident was reported internationally, including by CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the taxi driver for his bravery and presence of mind, while shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth apologized for a misreading of the news that led him to believe the dead man was an innocent member of the public."

On 18 November 2021, Tongans headed to the polls to elect 17 out of the 26 seats of the Legislative Assembly of Tonga in the general elections. The 2017 general elections saw a significant victory for the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands, with ʻAkilisi Pōhiva re-elected as Prime Minister, defeating former Deputy Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni 14 votes to 12. However, in September 2019, Pohiva passed away, and his successor, Pohiva Tuʻiʻonetoa, became Prime Minister with the support of nobles, independent MPs, and five former members of the DPFI. His cabinet included three nobles who had previously been excluded during Pohiva's tenure.

In December 2020, Democratic Party leader Semisi Sika submitted a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Tuʻiʻonetoa. The motion was supported by Deputy Prime Minister Sione Vuna Fa'otusia, who subsequently resigned from Cabinet. However, the Legislative Assembly rejected the no-confidence motion 13-9 on 12 January 2021.

The Tongan electoral system is comprised of up to 30 members, 17 of which are elected directly through first-past-the-post voting from single-member constituencies. The island of Tongatapu has ten constituencies, Vavaʻu three, Haʻapai two, and ʻEua and Niuatoputapu/Niuafoʻou one each. Nine seats are reserved for members of the nobility who elect representatives from amongst themselves. The Cabinet, formed by the Prime Minister, can include up to four members who were not elected to the Assembly, but who automatically become members of the legislature.

A total of 75 candidates, including 12 women, registered to contest the election. However, one candidate, Sione Fonua, withdrew, while another passed away, leaving a total of 73 candidates. Despite a week-long lockdown due to a COVID-19 case, the election was not delayed. Tongans now await the outcome of the election, which will determine the makeup of the new government."

The Solomon Islands have been hit by a series of violent protests and riots that started on November 24, 2021. The protests began peacefully but soon turned violent, resulting in the burning down of buildings near the Solomon Islands Parliament Building in Honiara. The unrest has been linked to the political division over the island's relations with China and Taiwan, with Malaita province remaining a supporter of Taiwan, in opposition to the central government's stance on the issue.

Most of the protesters came from Malaita province, and the violence has predominantly affected the Chinatown suburb of Honiara. Schools and businesses were closed as police and government forces clashed with protesters. Mobs rampaged through the city, looting and setting alight shops, buildings, and warehouses. The Royal Solomon Islands Police Force reported just two arrests despite two police stations also being burned down. Australia has deployed its Federal Police and Defence Force personnel to support the Solomon Islands Police Force, in order to maintain order and protect vital infrastructure as per the Australia-Solomon Islands Bilateral Security Treaty. Papua New Guinea has also sent 34 peacekeepers to help stem the violence.

Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare vowed to take action against the rioters and blamed ""foreign powers"" for the unrest in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The government of the People's Republic of China expressed its concern about the attacks and supported the Solomon Islands Government's attempt to quickly restore order and stability. The country's Deputy Director of Foreign Affairs, Zhao Lijian, emphasized the importance of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Solomon Islands, stating that any attempt to undermine them would be futile.

The situation in the Solomon Islands remains unstable, and the region is under a nighttime curfew starting at 7:00 p.m. local time. The Australian Federal Police are attempting to restore order and protect the vital infrastructure of the island. Meanwhile, the political division over relations with China and Taiwan remains a key factor in the ongoing unrest."

The 2021–2022 European windstorm season marks the seventh instance of seasonal European windstorm naming in Europe. This season is unique as Greece, Israel, and Cyprus (Eastern Mediterranean Group) and Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Malta (Central Mediterranean Group) have joined the seasonal naming scheme, naming storms affecting their areas. The Netherlands will also participate for the third time, joining the meteorological agencies of Ireland and the United Kingdom (Western Group), and collaborations between the Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Belgian meteorological agencies will continue, along with the addition of the Luxembourgish meteorological agency (South-western Group).  

The storm names for this season were released on September 1, 2021, and will include any storms that occur until August 31, 2022. Two main naming lists exist, one created by the national meteorological agencies of the Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands) and another created by the equivalent agencies from France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Former Atlantic hurricanes will retain their names as assigned by the National Hurricane Center of the United States.

The Storm Naming Scheme also includes those systems of tropical origins. For instance, ex-Hurricane Lorenzo of 2019 made landfall in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and all tropical storms and hurricanes can be found on the National Hurricane Centre website. The naming scheme of European storm warnings is part of the ""Name our Storms"" project, which the Met Office and Met Éireann launched and called for a public suggestion for storm names in 2015. The first list of names for 2015–2016 through to 2017–2018 was created, which was common to both the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Multiple storms have occurred since the commencement of this season. Cyclone Apollo and Storm Blas caused major flooding and landslides in many countries in their pathway, such as the Mediterranean coast, Italy, Libya, and Algeria. Along with this, three people were killed in Algiers, six people in Eastern Sicily and the Balearic Islands, and two people in Germany and Poland. Many places lost power, and extensive damage and travel disruptions were witnessed.

Recently, Storm Arwen hit the British Isles, killing at least three people and causing widespread damage, extensive disruptions in Scotland and North East England, and leaving around 100,000 people without electricity. Red warnings for winds were also issued in North-Eastern parts of the UK, along with extensive orange and yellow warnings throughout Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and most parts of England. Dangerous waves were also predicted, with disruptions to ferry services. On November 26, the Network Rail halted running trains north of Newcastle, and at 5 pm GMT, closed the rail lines north of Berwick-upon-Tweed, due to the alarming situation."

The Semeru volcano in East Java, Indonesia erupted on December 4, resulting in one death and 41 injuries. The eruption occurred when a lava dome at the summit collapsed due to heavy precipitation, triggering a pyroclastic flow that descended the volcano's slopes. The eruption sent a plume of ash 40,000 feet (12,000 meters) into the air and affected six sub-districts in the Malang Regency and eight villages in the Lumajang Regency. The Gladak Perak Bridge was destroyed, blocking access to villages in the area, while power outages affected over 30,000 people. Lahars destroyed at least 30 homes in the Pronojiwo District, and heavy ashfall buried many village homes and vehicles. Some 300 families were evacuated.

Initial reports indicated that three people went missing when the Gladak Perak Bridge collapsed, but the number later increased to 10. One person was killed, and 41 others were injured, with many suffering burns caused by pyroclastic flows. The injured were treated at the Penanggal Health Center, and four of them were in serious condition and admitted to the intensive care unit. On December 5, a second death was confirmed at Dr. Haryoto Hospital due to severe burns. The death toll has since increased to 14, with many of the victims dead from burns.

Authorities have warned residents to stay at least 5 km away from the main summit crater to avoid large pyroclastic flows, while approaching the crater within 1 km is strictly prohibited. Volcanic activity and ashfall continue to be a concern in some villages, and residents are urged to evacuate. Rivers originating from Semeru are also transporting volcanic debris, and residents should avoid them.

As of December 5, over 5,200 people were affected, with 1,300 residents in Lumajang displaced. The BNPB provided meals, ready-to-eat packs, blankets, mattresses, masks, and refugee tents, as well as medical supplies, water, and instant food. The Yogyakarta International Airport, Adisumarmo International Airport, and Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport were unaffected by the eruption.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the Lumajang Regency on December 5 to lead the BNPB in post-eruption recovery efforts, while the Governor of East Java relocated her office to aid in the evacuation process. Rescue operations for missing miners are set to begin once activity on the volcano decreases."

In a tragic incident on 4 December 2021, the Indian Army's Assam Rifles unit mistakenly opened fire on a group of miners returning home from work in Nagaland, India. Believing the miners to be militants, the soldiers killed 13 civilians, while a soldier and seven miners lost their lives in a subsequent confrontation with angry locals. The incident has sparked public outrage in Nagaland, with calls for the repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA).

According to reports, the army had received intelligence regarding the movements of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang-Yung Aung) (NSCN (K-YA)) militants. However, instead of the militants, the army unit killed the innocent coal mine workers returning in a similarly described vehicle.

The Indian government has formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the incident, and the Nagaland Police have registered a case against the 21 Para Special Forces. The National Human Rights Commission of India has sent notices to the Central and State governments regarding the incident.

Following the tragedy, protests were organized across Nagaland on 5 December 2021, with more than 200 people attacking and vandalizing the Assam Rifles army camp in Mon Town. Section 144 was imposed in Mon District, with restrictions on public assembly and movement, as well as the suspension of mobile internet and bulk SMS services.

The Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO), which represents six tribes, withdrew from the ongoing annual Hornbill Festival at Kisama near Kohima, while the Nagas hoisted black flags on all Morungs at the festival.

The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis, which started in late October 2021, has seen escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, drawing attention from the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The crisis began as a result of the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against DPR formations in late October/early November. This was accompanied by reported violations of the ceasefire regime and repeated attempts by the Ukrainian military to muffle the signal of its drones used for monitoring. In November 2021, Russia was accused of pulling troops near Ukraine's borders by the Western media, which Russian officials denied, stating that Ukraine was planning aggressive actions against Donbass. Against this backdrop, Ukraine has intensified its diplomatic efforts with various international leaders, including the head of the European Council and the U.S. Secretary of Defense. Talks between the U.S.-Russia and NATO-Russia are also scheduled to take place in January 2022. 

In more recent news, Ukrainian authorities revealed that an alleged Russian intelligence agent had been arrested for attempting to recruit others to launch attacks in the port city of Odessa. The situation between Russia and Ukraine remains a source of international concern, especially as reports of military buildups near the border continue."

The Russo-Ukrainian crisis that began in late October 2021 continues to escalate, with talks between NATO and Russia reaching a breaking point. The crisis has caused international tension involving the United States, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States, with Poland warning of the possibility of war. The military confrontation and international crisis between Russia and Ukraine began with the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations. The situation has been aggravated by violations of the ceasefire regime, movements of military equipment, and muffled signals from UAVs used to monitor the terrain. 

Recent developments include the formation of a consolidated rapid response unit of 600 fighters in the UK for transfer to Ukraine, and the arrest of an alleged Russian military intelligence agent in Odessa by the Ukrainian government. Ukraine has intensified its diplomatic efforts, holding talks with the heads of the European Council and the US Secretary of Defense. 

Harsh statements from Kyiv and Moscow continue to be heard amidst a deadlock on all existing negotiating platforms. Russia continues to accuse Ukraine of provocative actions in the conflict zone, while Ukraine warns of a large-scale escalation from Russia. The situation remains threatening, with major elements of the Russian army being repositioned closer to the Ukrainian border and the potential for further military buildups. 

The latest warning from Poland regarding the possibility of war highlights the gravity of the situation and the urgent need for all parties to engage in constructive dialogue to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Talks between NATO and Russia must continue, and diplomatic efforts must be intensified to prevent a catastrophic escalation of the conflict."

The Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of the year, is set to take place at Melbourne Park from 17-30 January 2022. The tournament, which will be the 110th edition, is part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category, and will feature both men's and women's singles and doubles draws, as well as mixed doubles events. In addition, there will be singles and doubles events for both boys and girls, which are part of the Grade A category of tournaments. The junior competitions will return after a year of absence. Meanwhile, there are also singles, doubles, and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category.

The tournament will be played on hard courts and take place across a series of 25 courts, including the four main show courts of Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena, Margaret Court Arena, and 1573 Arena. 2022 will mark the debut of Kia Arena, which will now make five main tennis arenas.

The Australian Open total prize money for 2022 has increased by 4.5% to A$75,000,000 – the highest in the tournament's history. A series of tables for each of the competitions has been released, showing the ranking points offered for each event.

In the lead-up to the tournament, there has been a vaccination and visa controversy involving defending champion Novak Djokovic. After being granted a medical exemption from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination by Tennis Australia and the health department of the state of Victoria, Djokovic was detained by the Australian Border Force upon arriving in Australia on 5 January 2022, as his visa did not meet the country's entry requirements for unvaccinated travellers.

Despite requesting an injunction against deportation in order to appeal the visa refusal, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Alex Hawke, used his ministerial powers under the Migration Act 1958 to cancel Djokovic's visa on ""health and good order grounds"". Djokovic was detained in a detention hotel pending the outcome of the appeal, but on 10 January, the Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in favour of Djokovic, ordered his release from detention, and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses. The reason for the ruling was that when Djokovic was in immigration holding before his visa was cancelled, Australian officials reneged on an agreement to give Djokovic sufficient time to contact his lawyers and tennis authorities before his official interview, leading the Australian government to concede that they treated Djokovic unreasonably.

More than two dozen players and staff members had applied for a medical exemption, and a handful of applications had been granted. Among those, two people with the same type of visa and exemption as Djokovic had reportedly been allowed into the country. Player Renata Voráčová, who was one of those granted an exemption, was allowed into the country and participated in a warm-up tournament, but she was subsequently detained in the same hotel as Djokovic and deported on 8 January 2022. A tennis official with an exemption was also allowed entry but left the country voluntarily.

The decision to grant an unvaccinated athlete entry while many Australians remain stranded overseas due to the pandemic, in order to participate in an event that spectators cannot attend unless fully vaccinated, has been met with negative public opinion in Australia."

The synagogue is a Reform Judaism congregation led by Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker. The assailant entered the building around 10:41 a.m. by posing as a homeless man in need of shelter. Reports of the hostage situation came in around 11:30 a.m., and police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation quickly responded. The situation lasted for over 12 hours, during which the assailant demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui as part of his negotiation demands. However, law enforcement officials did not identify the assailant as Siddiqui's brother. 

The hostage-taker and four hostages, including the synagogue's rabbi, were in the middle of a bar mitzvah when the incident occurred. During the incident, one congregant who was livestreaming the services heard the assailant using anti-Israel epithets. Negotiations between the assailant and authorities continued for hours. At some point after 5:00 p.m., one of the hostages was released and declared not to be in need of medical attention. It was also reported that several gunshots and a loud bang were heard around 9:21 p.m. Later, the assailant was shot and killed by the police.

The incident drew national attention, prompting the attention of the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, and Alternate Prime Minister of Israel Yair Lapid. Aafia Siddiqui's attorney stated that she was not involved in the situation and strongly condemned the hostage-taking, urging the assailant to release all hostages and turn himself in.

After more than 12 hours under siege, all four hostages were freed alive and safe, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced the end of the crisis through his Twitter account. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and further information has yet to be released."

A massive eruption of the Hunga Tonga volcano in Tonga on January 15, 2022, caused a series of tsunamis across the Pacific Ocean, affecting several countries. The initial eruption occurred on December 20, 2021, after being relatively dormant since 2014, and the volcanic activity increased over time. On January 14, 2022, a large eruption sent clouds of ash 20 kilometers (12 miles) into the atmosphere, and a significantly larger eruption occurred the following day at approximately 17:00. The eruption caused significant seismic activity, sending tsunamis in Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, the United States, Canada, Chile, and Ecuador.

The tsunami caused damage and casualties in several places. In Lambayeque, Peru, two people were killed by a small tsunami. Some islands in Vanuatu observed ""destructive"" tsunami waves of 1–2.5 meters (3 ft 3 in – 8 ft 2 in), and some areas in the Philippines were put on a tsunami watch. Coastal evacuations were issued in 14 of the 16 regions in Chile, and strong currents were reported in Half Moon Bay, California. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology issued marine and land warnings, and Japan's Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning, along with evacuation orders in several prefectures.

The eruption ejected a large amount of volcanic material into the stratosphere, and a scientist from the University of Auckland described it as a one-in-1000-year event. Little information is available on the extent of damage and casualties due to communication issues. Tongan geologists near the volcano observed explosions and a 5-kilometer (3.1 miles) wide ash column. Atata, a small island off the capital city, was reportedly submerged, and rescue operations are underway. There are reports of residents in Tonga struggling to breathe as a result of the ash. The Tonga government has not confirmed any casualties from the eruption and tsunami.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are discussing the provision of aid to Tonga, and rescue operations are underway at Atata Island. The Mineral Resources Department in Fiji issued advisories to people living around the coastal areas to stay away from the shores, and evacuations were made on the Lau Islands after wave activity was observed in the sea. Samoa issued a tsunami advisory, and the PTWC issued a warning for American Samoa. The National Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami advisory along the West Coast of the United States and British Columbia, Canada, while Hawaii issued a tsunami advisory for the entire state. Beaches were closed, and coastal residents were requested to move to higher grounds."

A large-scale attack by ISIL militants on the Al-Sina'a prison in the northern Syrian city of Al-Hasakah has resulted in the freeing of prisoners and ongoing clashes that have claimed the lives of 67 people. The attack, which is the largest committed by ISIL since the loss of its last key Syrian territory in 2019, began on January 20th with a car bomb targeting the prison and ground fighters opening fire with heavy weapons. The ensuing prison riot allowed inmates to obtain weapons from the armoury and led to a full-blown attack on prison staff. Several prisoners managed to escape and the prison was subsequently occupied by armed inmates. The clashes continued into January 21st, by which time the ISIL fighters had spread to the Al-Zouhour area of Al-Hasakah city and solidified their control of the prison. In response, the International Coalition dispatched military aircraft to support Kurdish forces who were fighting on the ground. SDF forces have since announced that they were able to track down and arrest 89 of the escaped prisoners. Reports indicate that the electricity supply to parts of the city has been cut off due to the ongoing clashes between ISIL and Kurdish forces. The situation remains tense as both sides continue to battle for control of the prison and surrounding areas."

Singapore, the world's most-vaccinated country against COVID-19, has announced the extension of the vaccine booster dose to young people aged 12-17 from March 14 onwards. According to the Ministry of Health, the booster shots will be given to those who have completed their initial two-dose vaccination at least six months ago. This move aims to further protect young people against the virus as Singapore prepares for the reopening of schools and reduces restrictions. The country's vaccination campaign began on December 30, 2020, and has reached more than 88% of the total population and 91% of eligible people, with vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and CoronaVac. Singapore, meanwhile, recognizes all WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines, and since August 2021, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has issued a tamper-proof vaccination sticker that can serve as proof of vaccination for those who have been vaccinated under WHO's Emergency Use Listing."

For centuries, Iceland has been a hub for whaling, but the country has now decided to end the controversial practice. The country's only two whaling companies have recently announced that they will no longer hunt whales, with one of them having already stopped in 2020. The decision comes as the price for whale meat has been declining in recent years, making it increasingly difficult for the companies to stay afloat financially. Although Iceland has been one of a few countries that formally object to the International Whaling Commission's moratorium on whaling, the country has been facing mounting international pressure to end the practice. Additionally, the country's growing whale watching tourism industry has been a lucrative source of income and has been operating in tension with the whaling industry. With this recent announcement, the country is expected to fully phase out whaling by 2024."

The ongoing jihadist insurgency in Burkina Faso has taken a deadly turn again as four civilians were killed during a clash between French troops and Ansar ul Islam, a militant group. The battle also resulted in ten militants being neutralized, with support from an attack helicopter. The insurgency started in 2015 as an offshoot of the Maghreb insurgency and has since claimed over 1,300 civilian lives, with thousands more displaced. Both government forces and the insurgent groups have been accused of committing human rights abuses, including summary executions and massacres of civilians. Schools have also been targeted by the rebels, with an estimated 300,000 children deprived of access to education. Despite recent successes by government forces, the situation remains dire, with the UNHCR estimating that six in ten displaced people in the Sahel"

In a recent development, Canada has withdrawn its military advisors from Ukraine and transferred them to an undisclosed location within Europe. Additionally, the nation has moved its diplomatic staff to Lviv, putting a halt to all operations at its embassy in Kyiv. This change comes as tensions between Ukraine and Russia escalate, with the Russian military buildup near the Ukrainian border raising concerns of a potential invasion.

Operation Unifier, the Canadian military's training mission in Ukraine, has been in operation since 2015. With the recent relocation of military advisors, it's unclear what impact this will have on the operation moving forward. The mission formed part of the Multinational Joint Commission, involving nations like the US, UK, Canada, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania, and Denmark aimed at military reform in Ukraine. 

Before the relocation, the Canadian contribution to Operation Unifier's training efforts was provided by about 200 soldiers, rotating every six months, and increased to 260 in January 2022, and now has the increased complement of another 60. As of November 2018, over 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers received training through Operation Unifier. 

Members of the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada have positively welcomed Canada's efforts towards reforming Ukraine's military as part of Operation Unifier. In 2018, the Band of the Ceremonial Guard performed a Ukrainian military march known as ""Shchob shabli ne braly, shchob Kuli mynaly"" (Щоб шаблі не брали, щоб кулі минали) in front of Ukrainian members during a daily guard mounting ceremony on Parliament Hill. 

The Canadian government has not commented on the reasons or duration of this relocation but has stated its commitment to supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation, a regulation of the European Union and Euratom aimed at linking disbursements from the European Union's budget to adherence to rule of law standards, has seen a major development. The European Court of Justice has dismissed Hungary and Poland's legal challenges against the regulation, confirming that it is in compliance with the treaties of the European Union. This decision will now allow the European Commission to suspend funds from the EU budget to member states that violate the principles of the rule of law enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. The regulation could therefore prove to be a valuable tool in addressing democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland, which has been a major concern for the European Union since the 2010s. The European Parliament has already called on the Commission to avoid any further delays in its application of the regulation and to keep the Parliament regularly informed."

The fight against terrorism in Australia involves the designation of terrorist organisations by the government, with a list first established under the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002. The Attorney-General's Department maintains the list, and organisations may be designated as terrorist through court prosecution or by regulation under Division 102 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. As of November 2021, there are 29 foreign organisations on the list, including Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham, and the Guardians of Religion Organization. The entirety of Hamas, including its political wing, has also been designated as a terrorist organisation in Australia. Anti-terrorism financing laws in Australia prohibit the financing of terrorism and mandate monitoring of financial transactions involving terrorist organisations by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Prosecution of terrorism offences falls to the Australian Federal Police, State police forces, and Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions."
