The Taliban has captured its first major provincial city since 2001, taking control of the capital of Nimruz Province, Zaranj. The capture was confirmed by a spokesperson for the local police, who blamed the central government's lack of reinforcements for the fall of the city. The 2021 Taliban offensive has resulted in the group seizing control of half of Afghanistan, including major border crossings with Tajikistan, Iran, and Turkmenistan. Civilians and military personnel have suffered significant casualties during the clashes, with reports of insurgents carrying out massacres of Afghan troops who surrender. Despite vowing to reclaim all districts seized by the Taliban, the Afghan government has struggled to push back the offensive without support from foreign powers, with many foreign countries withdrawing their troops from Afghanistan in recent months. The international community has expressed concern over the escalating conflict, with Russia, China, and other nations calling for a transitional government in"
Wildfires in Greece continue to spread, with mass evacuations being carried out in the northern suburbs of Athens as flames encroach on the outskirts of the capital. A volunteer firefighter has tragically lost their life due to a fallen electricity pylon, and another man has died in a factory. The fires have also left twenty more people wounded, adding to the devastation already caused by the blaze. The country has been grappling with the aftermath of a historical heatwave that has fueled the fires, with dozens of homes destroyed and several villages and towns having been evacuated. The largest fires are concentrated in Attica, Olympia, Messenia, and Euboea. The Greek authorities are continuing their efforts to combat the wildfires and protect communities from further damage."
Queensland's battle with COVID-19 continues as the state enters another snap lockdown. Cairns and Yarrabah have been ordered to shut down for three days following an ""unexpected"" case of COVID-19 in a taxi driver from Kanimbla. The driver was reportedly infectious in Far North Queensland for 10 days before testing positive for the virus. This comes amid rising concerns about the highly contagious Delta variant, which has been responsible for recent outbreaks in other states. The outbreak in Queensland is closely being monitored, as it has consistently recorded some of the lowest COVID-19 cases in the world. However, authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant and get vaccinated as soon as possible to avoid any potential surge in cases."
Palau, a small island nation in the western Pacific, has achieved herd immunity against COVID-19 as around 80% of its population aged 12 and above are fully vaccinated against the virus. This milestone has been reached after Palau had closed its borders early on and efficiently rolled out its vaccination program, receiving vaccines from Operation Warp Speed due to its Compact of Free Association with the United States. Plans have now been announced to start vaccinating adolescents from 12 to 17. The achievement comes amid efforts to reopen tourism in the country, which have been curtailed due to the pandemic."
Egypt-Russia relations have a long history dating back to before the 16th century. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1943, and although the relationship has been rocky at times, it has seen significant improvement in recent years. Since 2013, both countries have worked closely to strengthen military and economic ties. In November 2013, the two countries' leaders exchanged four-way visits in both Cairo and Moscow, culminating in a preliminary deal to purchase arms worth $3.5 billion. As of 2021, Egypt is the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroad, and the Director of Russia's Federal Agency for Tourism has expressed hope for the resumption of direct flights between the two countries. In February 2021, direct commercial flights between Russia and Egypt resumed for the first time since the Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing in 2015, which killed 224 people."
Northern Algeria is grappling with a devastating wave of wildfires since 9 August 2021, as the death toll rises to 65 - comprising 37 civilians and 28 soldiers. Reports suggest that the country is battling a total of 69 fires for the fourth consecutive day. Distant villages are struggling to contain the blazes themselves, with many fleeing while others try to resist the flames using rudimentary tools. Destroying olive trees, killing cattle, and chickens, multiple fires burned Mediterranean trees on 10 August 2021. Unfortunately, firefighting aircraft were not available at the time. In response to the tragic incident, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune declares three days of national mourning for the wildfire victims. Algerian authorities have also deployed soldiers to assist citizens with evacuations and other necessary measures in the affected areas."
The ongoing financial crisis in Lebanon, which started in August 2019, has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Beirut port explosion in 2020. The crisis has caused acute shortages of USD within Lebanon, leading to a significant devaluation of the Lebanese pound. Since 1997, the Lebanese pound has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1,507.5 LBP per USD, but the black market exchange rate has diverged from the official exchange rate due to financial and economic hardships. The crisis has resulted in social unrest, mass protests, and the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet. Consumer goods prices have increased by 580%, and Lebanon's gross domestic product has fallen from about 55 billion USD to about 44 billion USD. Restaurants, cafes, and businesses have closed down, resulting in 25,000 employees losing their jobs. Lebanon's sovereign debt has been downgraded to junk status, and the country defaulted on its Eurobond debt in March 2020. Foreign currency inflows have slowed down, and the country's commercial banks have imposed tough restrictions on dollar withdrawals and transfers to maintain reserves. The shortage of U.S. dollars and the crash in the value of the pound have undercut the country's ability to pay for imports, including essentials such as wheat and oil. Banks no longer provide businesses with U.S. dollars for imports, forcing people to turn to the black market. In June 2021, the World Bank released a report warning that the economic crisis in Lebanon risked becoming one of the three most severe since the mid-19th century if the country's bankrupt economic system wasn't reformed. The latest development is that the Central Bank of Lebanon has ended fuel subsidies, replacing them with credit lines for fuel imports based on the market price for the Lebanese pound. The decision is likely to result in a significant increase in fuel prices amid the country's economic crisis. The liquidity crisis also created a barrier to every single person who had accounts in Lebanese banks, as they are unable to access their deposits, and they can withdraw them only in the national currency. This led to depositors turning to buying real estate and shares in the Solidere company, which saw a rise of 500% between the start of the liquidity crisis and April 2021."
Canada is set to hold a federal election on September 20, 2021, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau obtained the dissolution of the House of Commons. The election was called earlier than the scheduled date, as the current government is a minority government, and a motion of no confidence in the government or a recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada could dissolve the Parliament. The election will be held to elect members of the House of Commons to the 44th Canadian Parliament. The 2019 federal election resulted in the Liberals losing their majority but winning the most seats, while the Conservatives continued as the Official Opposition with Andrew Scheer temporarily remaining as Leader of the Opposition until his resignation triggered a leadership election. In the current standings, many of the incumbents are not running for reelection."
The Panjshir conflict, a political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban, has seen new developments as of recent. According to Russian intelligence sources, Panjshir resistance forces led by Amrullah Saleh have recaptured Charikar and surrounding parts of Parwan Province from the Taliban. Prior to the fall of Kabul in 2021, Panjshiri militants had been moving military equipment, such as helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. Since then, Saleh declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, and began rallying remnants of the Afghan National Army to resist Taliban rule. As of now, the Panjshir Valley still remains under siege on all sides, but no direct attacks have been reported. The valley is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and serves as the only region currently out of Taliban control. The situation in Panjshir remains fluid, and discussions for a negotiated end to the political impasse are ongoing. However, this recent development shows that the resistance forces are still able to assert their presence in the region."
The 2021 Niger attacks have continued with fresh incidents of violence being reported. Gunmen attacked civilians who were praying at a mosque in the village of Theim, in southwestern Niger, killing 16 people. The attacks have mainly occurred in the western region of TillabeÃÅri and have left 439 people dead and more than 100 others injured. The January and March attacks have been the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. Attacks have been carried out with frequency throughout the year, and as of August, attacks were carried out every month of 2021. The government of Niger dispatched soldiers to the border after the attacks, and Islamist militants are suspected to be the perpetrators. The exact terrorist organization who carried out the attacks is not clear."
Operation Allies Refuge is an ongoing United States military operation aimed at evacuating selected at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants from Afghanistan. The operation is conducted concurrently with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan. On July 14, the Biden administration officially unveiled the operation's name. As of August 23, the United States has evacuated approximately 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans, in the past few weeks. On July 30, 2021, the first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing. However, there are still at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants in the process of being relocated. Following the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced on August 12 that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to the Kabul International Airport in order to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. On August 15, the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. The United States military took control over the air traffic control of the airport later in the day. On August 16, a C-17 cargo plane safely evacuated approximately 823 people to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The head of U.S. Central Command, General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., reportedly met with Taliban leaders based in Qatar's capital Doha, who agreed to terms set by McKenzie for refugees to flee using Kabul Airport. On August 17, approximately 1,100 people were evacuated on 13 flights. The White House said more than 3,200 U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and refugees, along with nearly 2,000 Afghan interpreters, were flown to the U.S. for SIV processing. On August 18, approximately 2,000 people were evacuated, with the State Department saying U.S. military flights had evacuated nearly 5,000 people from the country. On August 19, more than 2,000 people were evacuated on 12 flights. The Pentagon said it had evacuated about 7,000 people from the country. On August 20, approximately 5,700 people were evacuated on 16 flights, with the Pentagon saying it had evacuated about 12,700 people from the country. On August 22, the Department of Defense ordered the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation. The current activation involves 18 planes from United Airlines, American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines, Omni Air, and Hawaiian Airlines, which will transport thousands of Afghans who are arriving at U.S. bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. From the bases in the Middle East, the airliners will augment military flights carrying Afghans to Germany, Italy, Spain, and other stops in Europe, and then ultimately to the United States. The evacuation efforts have faced significant challenges, with at least eight people being killed at the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes. The deaths include at least two people seen falling to their deaths from the sky after clinging to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane, while at least three people clinging to the side of an Air Force jet were killed after being run over. Remains of another dead Afghan were found in the landing gear of the American C-17, after the pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in a nearby country because they were unable to retract the landing gear. The Pentagon said that two armed men who fired into a crowd were killed by U.S. troops."
Operation Allies Refuge is the ongoing United States effort to airlift at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, out of Afghanistan in light of the Taliban's takeover of the country. On August 12, President Biden announced that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to Kabul International Airport to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. Following the fall of Kabul on August 15, the number of U.S. troops at the airport expanded to almost 6,000, and the military took control over air traffic control. From August 16 onwards, military planes, including a C-17 cargo plane, safely evacuated thousands of people from Afghanistan to various countries, including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and U.S. bases in the Middle East. The Taliban agreed to allow refugees to use the Kabul Airport to flee the country. As of August 22, nearly 12,700 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan, including more than 3,200 U.S. citizens and permanent residents and nearly 2,000 Afghan interpreters who were flown to the U.S. for SIV processing. The U.S. Department of Defense has announced that it will activate the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for the third time, sending 18 planes to assist the evacuation effort. However, the evacuation has not been without casualties. At least eight people have been killed at the Kabul International Airport, and some have resorted to forcibly boarding planes or clinging to the landing gear of departing aircraft in desperate attempts to flee the country. Two armed men who fired into a crowd were killed by U.S. troops. Despite the challenges, the U.S. continues to work to evacuate vulnerable Afghans and maintain control of the airport as the Taliban asserts control over the country."
Operation Allies Refuge, the United States military operation to airlift at-risk Afghan civilians, including U.S. embassy employees, interpreters, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa applicants, from Afghanistan, continues amid the larger American military withdrawal from the country. On August 22, the Department of Defense activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation with at least 18 planes, and commercial airline pilots and crews will transport thousands of Afghans who are arriving at U.S. bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Fox News has evacuated 24 people from Afghanistan, including three Afghan nationals who assisted with the network's coverage of the war. The situation at Kabul International Airport has been dangerous, with multiple casualties including eight people killed and two seen falling to their deaths from the sky after clinging to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane. The Pentagon has confirmed that two armed men who fired into a crowd were killed by U.S. troops. As of August 20, the Pentagon has evacuated approximately 12,700 people from the country, with nearly 5,000 of those evacuated by U.S. military flights."
Operation Allies Refuge, the U.S. military operation to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians including interpreters, embassy employees, and other Special Immigrant Visa applicants from Afghanistan, continues amid the larger American military withdrawal from the country. The operation's name was unveiled on July 14 by the Biden administration. As the security situation in Afghanistan deteriorated in August, the operation pivoted to focus on evacuating embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and Afghan refugees, with thousands of people being evacuated each day from Kabul International Airport, now under U.S. military control. On August 22, the Department of Defense activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation effort. The activation included 18 planes from commercial airlines such as United, American, Delta, and Omni Air, which will transport refugees arriving in the Middle East to European countries and ultimately to the United States. U.S. President Joe Biden announced that American troops may remain in Afghanistan beyond the August 31 deadline, and that in the past 36 hours, 11,000 people were evacuated from the country. However, the situation remains volatile, with reports of violence and chaos at the airport and surrounding areas, and concerns about the fate of those who remain in Afghanistan. The operation Allies Refuge continues, as the U.S. works to evacuate as many people as possible from Afghanistan."
The Panjshir conflict, which began on 17 August 2021 after the fall of Kabul, is ongoing between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Panjshir resistance, and the Taliban-controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The Panjshir Valley, largely controlled by ethnic Tajik people, is the only region that remains out of the Taliban's hands and is defended by a disparate anti-Taliban force of 7,000 to 10,000 personnel. Ahmad Massoud and self-proclaimed acting president Amrullah Saleh are leading the resistance and refuse to surrender. Massoud has called for dialogue with the Taliban on the formation of a comprehensive government, but says that war is unavoidable if they refuse. The resistance has already secured access to helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military and is focused on training and defending the Panjshir Valley. Reports indicate that the resistance plans to seize a northern highway to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Negotiations for a peaceful resolution have been attempted, including the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government, but a mediated resolution remains elusive. The USA and Western forces are lowly supportive of this movement due to ongoing evacuation of Kabul, as they depend fully on the Taliban's benevolence.

As of August 22, President Joe Biden announced that 11,000 people had been evacuated over the past 36 hours, and U.S. troops may remain in Afghanistan past the initial August 31 deadline. The U.S. military, NATO, and regional allies have been conducting airlifts from the airport, with assistance from commercial airline pilots and crew via the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet. Tragically, the operation has also seen casualties. On August 26, a security guard was killed and three others were wounded in a gunfight between an unknown gunman and Afghan forces at the north gate of Kabul airport. German and American forces were also involved in the shooting. Prior to this, at least eight people had been killed at the airport amid chaotic scenes, with thousands of people trying to forcibly board planes. At least two people fell to their deaths from the sky, after clinging to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane, while others were tragically killed while clinging to the side of an Air Force jet. Overall, the operation aims to evacuate as many at-risk individuals as possible from Afghanistan amid the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the country."
The 2021 Niger attacks continue to ravage the country, with Boko Haram militants recently attacking a military post in Diffa, Niger. The attack resulted in the death of 16 soldiers and injuries to nine others. However, in the ensuing gunfight, around 50 Islamist insurgents were killed. These attacks are part of a series of ongoing attacks by militants on civilians and soldiers, mainly in the western region of TillabeÃÅri. The attacks have left 508 people dead and over 100 others injured so far this year. Several major attacks have occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020, but this year marks the first time that such a high number of civilians were killed in single incidents, with the January attack and 21 March attack being the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. Attacks have been carried out with increasing frequency every month of 2021, mainly by Islamist militants arriving from Mali. These attacks have prompted the Nigerien government to deploy soldiers to the border to counter them."
On 26 August 2021, a devastating suicide bombing occurred at an entrance of the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. The attack killed at least 90 Afghan civilians and 13 American servicemembers, and left more than 150 others wounded. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ‚Äì Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP), which had threatened the airport in recent days, has claimed responsibility for the attack. The explosions took place at the Abbey Gate and Baron Gate, with one of the bombers detonating his explosives at the crowded and chaotic Abbey Gate entrance, where many Afghans had gathered to seek evacuation. The suicide attack came as the United States and other countries were rushing to evacuate their citizens and Afghan allies before the 31 August deadline, after which the Taliban will take full control of the country. The airport had become the only safe exit point for thousands of desperate Afghans, including women, children, and the elderly, who fear Taliban reprisals. The attacks have further complicated the already chaotic evacuation efforts, which have been marred by Taliban checkpoints, stampedes, and inadequate resources. The bombings have outraged the international community and triggered a wave of condemnation and grief. US President Joe Biden has vowed to hunt down the perpetrators and said he would not be deterred by such attacks. Many world leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and French President Emmanuel Macron, have also strongly condemned the attacks and pledged to continue their evacuation efforts. The Taliban, who have recently seized power in Afghanistan, have condemned the bombings and promised to provide security for foreign forces and embassies, as well as Afghan civilians trying to leave the country."
Following the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan and their announcement to re-establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, there has been a recent drone strike against the country. On August 27, 2021, the United States conducted an airstrike in Nangarhar Province targeting an ISIL-KP member who was allegedly planning further attacks in Kabul. The strike was carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper drone with guided munitions to minimize civilian casualties, and two Islamic State members were killed while a third was wounded. The US Central Command stated that they do not believe any civilians were harmed in the attack. This comes as tensions remain high in Afghanistan, with the Taliban now in control of the capital city of Kabul."
On 26 August 2021, a suicide bombing took place at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of at least 182 people, including 13 members of the United States military and 28 members of the Taliban. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ‚Äì Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) claimed responsibility for the attack. The incident occurred during the evacuation from Afghanistan, as the airport was the only secure exit after the Taliban took control of the country on 15 August 2021. US President Joe Biden had received several reports warning of a possible terrorist attack, and warnings from various embassies and officials were issued prior to the event. After the attack, many nations expressed condemnation and solidarity with the victims and troops conducting evacuations at the airport. The government of the United Kingdom said civilian evacuations would continue in spite of the attack, and german Chancellor Angela Merkel cancelled an upcoming trip to Israel to monitor the evacuation of German troops. President Biden made a public address following the attack, expressing his deep sorrow for the Afghan victims and honoring the American service members who were killed. He also stated that the US would continue to hunt down those who wished harm upon the country. On 27 August, the United States launched an airstrike in Nangarhar Province, killing two Islamic State members and wounding a third. One of those killed was reported to be planning more attacks in Kabul. The attack was carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper drone, and according to CENTCOM, no civilians were harmed. The Taliban, who are enemies of ISIL-KP, condemned the attack and later announced measures to capture ISIL-KP leader Shahab al-Muhajir. The Taliban has reportedly denied involvement in the attack, and General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., head of the US Central Command, said there was no indication that the Taliban allowed the attack to happen. Former Chief Executive of Afghanistan Abdullah Abdullah condemned the attack, and some civilians claimed that the event had strengthened their resolve to evacuate from the country. The attack was the largest single loss of life of US military personnel since the 2011 Afghanistan Boeing Chinook shootdown and the first US service deaths in Afghanistan since February 2020."
Relations between the United States and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan have recently started but are not officially recognized. After the Taliban seized control of Kabul in August 2021, they proclaimed their intention to re-establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The US has stated it will only recognize a government in Afghanistan that respects basic rights. On August 27, the Taliban appointed Khalil Haqqani, a designated terrorist veteran of the Soviet-Afghan War and war on terror, as head of security in Kabul. Despite this, following a suicide bombing at Kabul airport on the same day by ISIS-K that killed over 100 Afghans and 13 US service members, the Taliban condemned the attack and pledged to capture ISIS-K leader Shahab al-Muhajir. The United States responded with an airstrike that killed two ""high-profile"" ISIS targets and injured a third person. The Taliban spokesperson, however, responded by condemning the US airstrike, considering it a ""clear attack on Afghan territory."""
Following the return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan, the country has witnessed two known drone strikes that have caused casualties. The latest strike, which occurred on September 17, targeted a vehicle driven by an aid worker for US-based Nutrition and Education International, who was delivering water to his family. The airstrike resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people, including seven children, and has sparked outrage and calls for accountability from the international community. Some of those killed in the attack had worked for international organizations and held visas allowing them entry to the US. Reports suggest that civilians were also among the casualties, most of whom were residents of the area. This airstrike follows a previous attack on August 27, which targeted an ISIS-K member in Nangarhar Province, resulting in the deaths of two militants and injury to a third. The airstrikes have fuelled concerns about the escalating violence and civilian casualties in Afghanistan under the Taliban's new regime."
The conflict in the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan continues after the Fall of Kabul in August 2021. The region, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province, remains the only area outside of Taliban control. The National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance, is currently engaged in clashes with the Taliban. The most recent update states that the resistance fighters killed eight Taliban members in the valley, while the Taliban have deployed a large number of forces near the region. Negotiations are ongoing to resolve the conflict, but the situation remains tense. The Panjshir Valley is known for its natural defenses and the majority of its population consists of ethnic Tajik people, while the Taliban are mostly Pashtuns. The disparity in ethnicities has led to differences between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud. The former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, while the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan, which was supportive of the Taliban. Massoud's group has stated that they would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict under the condition that a future government implemented a system of ""decentralization"" and ""equal rights"" across the country. The international community has not shown public support for the resistance, and the US and other potential allies are currently focused on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul."
The Panjshir conflict between the Taliban and the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, led by Ahmad Massoud, has intensified as the Taliban entered the Panjshir Valley and clashed with resistance forces. Both sides have reported heavy casualties and the Taliban claims to have gained some territory. The conflict began on 17 August 2021 when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and a few days later, Amrullah Saleh declared himself Afghanistan's acting president from the Panjshir Valley. The Valley has a majority of ethnic Tajik people and has been known for its natural defenses as it never fell to the Soviets during the 1980s invasion nor to the Taliban during the 1990s civil war. Saleh's claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi. Anti-Taliban forces, comprising of Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, ex-Mujahideen, and other anti-Taliban activists, regrouped in Panjshir Province and were estimated to have 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid-August 2021, according to a Russian estimate. On 22 August 2021, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered around 9,000 fighters and a few armored humvees in the valley. However, there were differences between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud as the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan, which was supportive of the Taliban. The resistance confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. The fighting resulted in heavy casualties and the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan reported that it captured Pol-e-Hesar, Deh Salah, and Banu districts, while the Taliban claimed to have recaptured all three districts in Baghlan that fell to the resistance forces a week before. Ceasefire talks between the Taliban and the resistance were held on 26 August 2021, and a Taliban spokesman said that he was ""80 percent confident of a solution without war in the Panjshir Valley."" However, talks broke down on 1 September 2021, and the Taliban gave an ultimatum to surrender. Ahmad Masoud rejected the ultimatum, and the Taliban dispatched ""hundreds"" of its forces to the Panjshir Valley. Mullah Amir Khan Motaqi, the head of the Taliban‚Äôs commission for guidance and encouragement, stated on 1 September that attempts at reaching a negotiated settlement were ""unfortunately all in vain."" As of 1 September 2021, there has been no public support from the international community, as the US and other potential allies focus on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul and seek Taliban cooperation to do so. The potential support of anti-Taliban forces outside Afghanistan is being discussed as Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan have volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it can be deemed illegal. Erika Simpson, president of the Canadian Peace Research Association, suggested that it's better to support anti-Taliban resistance groups based overseas."
Operation Allies Refuge was a massive military operation, launched by the United States in July 2021, to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan in the wake of the Taliban takeover of the country. The operation proceeded concurrently with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans. Under the operation, SIV applicants were airlifted to the United States, where they were temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their SIV requirements. The operation's name was unveiled on July 14, 2021, by the Biden administration. On July 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs (ALLIES) Act to increase the visa cap for Afghan interpreters and to expedite the Afghan SIV process. On July 30, the first group of 221 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing, with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants still to be moved from Afghanistan. As the Taliban made swift territorial gains and eventually seized control of Kabul, the operation was expanded to include the evacuation of all SIV applicants, embassy personnel, American nationals, and eligible Afghans seeking to flee the country.  The operation saw a massive airlift effort by the U.S. military, with the number of troops in Afghanistan rising from around 2,500 in mid-July to over 5,000 by August 14, a day before the Taliban took over Kabul. U.S. embassy staff in Kabul were destroying sensitive materials and items featuring embassy logos or U.S. flags, standard procedure during a drawdown. Helicopters shuttled people between the embassy compound and Kabul International Airport. On August 15, following the fall of Kabul, the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops, and U.S. military took control over security and air traffic control of the airport. At this point, the airlift operation became the primary focus of the U.S. military. In the initial days of the Kabul airlift, the U.S. military was able to evacuate over 7,000 people from Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and refugees, as well as Afghan interpreters who were flown to the U.S. for SIV processing. As the airlift continued, the U.S. government faced a number of challenges, including the tragic deaths of numerous Afghans who tried to forcibly board planes, suicide bombings at the airport carried out by ISIS militants, and the ongoing threat posed by the Taliban. On September 2, it was reported that around 100 Americans remained in Afghanistan following the August 31 deadline for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops. White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain stated that the Biden administration would still try to rescue them.  Despite significant challenges, Operation Allies Refuge was able to evacuate tens of thousands of people out of Afghanistan, and the U.S. government is continuing its efforts to assist Afghan refugees and to provide them with resources and support as they start new lives in the United States."
On September 7 at 20:47 local time, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit the coast of Guerrero, Mexico close to the city of Acapulco. The earthquake had an estimated intensity of VII on the MMI scale and left more than 1.6 million people without power. As of the latest reports, at least one person has been confirmed dead due to a falling pole in Coyuca de BeniÃÅtez. The earthquake is said to have been a thrust faulting event located on or near the subduction zone boundary of the Caribbean Plate and Cocos Plate. The U.S. Geological Survey states that earthquakes of this size are 40x20 km in rupture size. The earthquake also occurred on the anniversary of the 2017 Chiapas earthquake which measured Mw 8.2 and killed at least 100 people. Although a tsunami measuring 1.2 feet or 0.37 meters was recorded in Acapulco, the damage was relatively minimal with only a few buildings being damaged and many gas leaks reported. Adela RomaÃÅn, the mayor of Acapulco, has urged residents to remain calm while the situation is being assessed."
Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation that aimed to airlift at-risk Afghan civilians, particularly interpreters, embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants from Afghanistan. The operation began concurrently with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans. The operation's name was unveiled on July 14, 2021, by the Biden administration.  Initially, SIV applicants were airlifted to the United States, where they were temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their SIV requirements. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs (ALLIES) Act on July 22 to increase the visa cap for Afghan interpreters and to expedite the Afghan SIV process. The situation in Afghanistan rapidly deteriorated following the continued Taliban victories across the country, prompting on August 12, the Biden administration to deploy 3,000 U.S. troops to Hamid Karzai International Airport to help evacuate embassy personnel, American citizens, and SIV applicants. The Taliban seized control of Kabul on August 15, forcing the U.S. military to expand its presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops to secure it. Since then, U.S. military flights have evacuated about 28,000 Americans and Afghan nationals from Afghanistan since August 15, according to President Joe Biden, including 21 Americans in the latest evacuation. The U.S. military has evacuated about 82,300 people from Afghanistan to date. The ongoing conflict and stampedes at the airport have caused significant casualties, including at least 212 people killed and hundreds more wounded, as of August 26. The casualties include 13 U.S. service members who were killed in a suicide bombing attack at the Kabul airport on August 26. At least 21 people were injured in the attack. The U.S. military is continuing its evacuation efforts from Afghanistan despite the attack. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense has ordered the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation. The current activation includes 18 planes provided by various commercial airlines. The Pentagon is also using three more U.S. military bases to house up to 50,000 Afghan nationals applying for SIVs or are deemed ""at risk"" from the Taliban. The bases are Fort Pickett, Holloman Air Force Base, and Marine Corps Base Quantico. As of September 5, around 100 Americans remain in Afghanistan, according to White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. The Biden administration is looking for ways to rescue them. Overall, the mission of Operation Allies Refuge remains to evacuate all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans from the country amid the ongoing conflict and chaotic circumstances."
Since January 2001, drone strikes by the United States government in Afghanistan have resulted in numerous casualties, including civilians and unintended targets. In August 2021, the U.S. military conducted a drone strike near Kabul International Airport, which was originally believed to have targeted ISIL-K militants, but actually killed 10 civilians, according to Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. This mistake highlights the ongoing concern regarding the legality and effectiveness of drone strikes in conflict zones. The United States government has faced significant criticism for the number of civilian casualties resulting from its drone strikes. Amnesty International USA has called into question the legality of drone strikes and the lack of accountability in cases of mistaken targeting. As of 2021, there have been at least 13,074 airstrikes conducted by the U.S. government in Afghanistan, resulting in at least 4,138 deaths, including 310 civilians and 73 children. The Afghan Air Force has also carried out airstrikes in Afghanistan since at least June 2016, with at least 41 strike-capable operations conducted. The ongoing use of drones in military operations remains a contentious issue, with concerns over the potential for unintended casualties and the lack of transparency and accountability in their use."
On September 18, 2021, a rally was held near the United States Capitol in support of the individuals who were arrested and charged for their involvement in the January 6 riot. The event, titled ""Justice for J6"", was organized by Look Ahead America, a nonprofit led by former Trump campaign staffer Matt Braynard. Despite concerns over potential violence, the small rally of around 400 to 450 people proceeded peacefully. However, the Metropolitan Police Department had activated their security measures as a precautionary measure, erecting a fence around the Capitol and closing down multiple congressional offices. Four participants were arrested during the rally on various felonies, including one who was found to be in possession of a knife and another who was in possession of a gun. Leading up to the event, the Department of Homeland Security shared an intelligence briefing memo with state and local law enforcement agencies, warning of potential violence at the rally and the day before. Although no specific or credible plot was identified, law enforcement officials were concerned about confrontations between participants and counter-protestors. Former president Donald Trump commented on the rally, calling it a ""setup"" for Republican voters and suggesting that the security measures were designed to deter participants. The rally has faced criticism and distancing from some within the Republican party, while far-right groups like the Proud Boys urged against their members attending the event. In response to the event, a fence was erected around the Capitol as concerns over potential violence grew. Nevertheless, the rally proceeded without any significant incidents."
A suspected mass murder in Killamarsh, Derbyshire, England, on September 19, 2021, led to the discovery of three children and one adult dead inside a residential property. On September 22, the Derbyshire Constabulary charged 31-year-old Damien Bendall of Killamarsh with four counts of murder in connection with the incident. The victims were identified as siblings Lacey Bennett (11) and John Paul Bennett (13), their mother Terri Harris (35), and Lacey's friend Connie Gent (11). Killamarsh, a former coal mining town located in far northern Derbyshire, has become an outer commuter suburb of Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The police investigation into the incident is ongoing."

Qatar held its first-ever legislative elections on October 2, 2021, after they were postponed multiple times since their original scheduling in 2013. The country's 30-member Consultative Assembly was up for election, with 30 candidates being elected from single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting. All candidates ran as independents since political parties are banned in Qatar, and the law required contestants to be at least thirty years old and of Qatari origin. The remaining 15 seats in the Assembly were appointed by the Emir of Qatar. Although men and women over 18 were eligible to vote, the 2005 nationality law limited voting to those descended from individuals who held Qatari citizenship in 1930, leading to protests. A total of 284 candidates contested the election, with 29 women running."
Tragedy struck on 3 October 2021 in San Donato Milanese, Lombardy, Italy, as a Pilatus PC-12 plane crashed into an unoccupied building. All eight individuals on board the aircraft lost their lives in the horrific incident."
The Pandora Papers have caused a worldwide uproar after 11.9 million leaked documents were published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) on October 2, 2021. The documents have exposed hidden wealth, tax evasion, and money laundering among 330 politicians, including 35 national leaders, and numerous celebrities worldwide, including 130 billionaires, and a total of 29,000 beneficiaries among 27,000 companies. This makes it the largest offshore data leak in history, surpassing the Panama Papers by nearly half a million documents. On October 3, 2021, the ICIJ released the first wave of names, which included over 100 billionaires, 30 current and former leaders, and 300 public officials. The organisations described the document leak as their most expansive exposeÃÅ of financial secrecy yet. One of the prominent names to come out of the leaks is the former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who was shown in the papers to have saved ¬£312,000 in Stamp Duty on the purchase of a ¬£6.45million property in London by purchasing Romanstone International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company. While this action was not illegal, it has sparked yet another debate on transparency in financial dealings by politicians and public figures. The Pandora Papers have once again brought attention to the issue of offshore tax havens and their potential misuse. The ICIJ has promised to release more information in the coming days, which is likely to lead to further investigations and possibly more damning revelations."
The Pandora Papers represent the largest offshore data leak in history, with 11.9 million leaked documents published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. These documents reveal hidden wealth, tax evasion, and money laundering among 330 politicians, including 35 national leaders, and numerous celebrities worldwide, including 130 billionaires, totaling 29,000 beneficiaries among 27,000 companies. This release surpasses the Panama Papers in 2016 by nearly half a million documents, making the leak their biggest exposeÃÅ of financial secrecy to date. The documents were obtained from 14 offshore service providers that helped clients establish companies in tax havens across the globe. The ICIJ worked with over 600 journalists across 117 countries, including news organizations such as The Guardian, The Washington Post, and the BBC‚Äôs Panorama, to publish the data. Notable individuals named in the leak include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Chilean President SebastiaÃÅn PinÃÉera, and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, as well as celebrities such as Shakira and Claudia Schiffer. In addition to individuals, the papers also highlight five major international banks accused of facilitating money laundering for some of their clients. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has stated that all citizens mentioned in the Pandora Papers will be investigated, and appropriate action will be taken in case of wrongdoing."
A global outage of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus began on October 4, 2021, at 15:39 UTC and is still ongoing.

More updates are expected as Facebook continues to investigate the cause of the outage."
A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 hit the Harnai district of Balochistan province, Pakistan on October 7, 2021, killing at least 24 people and injuring 200 others. The earthquake struck during the early morning hours, causing the collapse of many homes where residents were asleep. Most of the casualties were women and children, while an unspecified number of people were also trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. The earthquake occurred near the anniversary of the devastating 2005 Kashmir earthquake, which claimed the lives of more than 87,000 people. Pakistan lies within a tectonically active region, where the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate converge. The convergence is highly oblique in the Balochistan region, involving the large Chaman Fault and many thrust faults, resulting in frequent earthquakes in the area. Balochistan experienced a major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 in 2013, which killed at least 800 people and caused extensive damage in the province. Following the recent earthquake, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) (PDMA) reported severe damage in the Harnai District and Shahrag area, where at least 70 homes were affected. The cities of Sibi and Quetta also suffered from the quake, with hospitals overwhelmed by the influx of patients. The Pakistan Army deployed troops to the affected area to assist in rescue and relief operations. Medical personnel, response workers, and officials are working together to coordinate the efforts. A team of search and rescue individuals from Rawalpindi was sent to Harnai to find survivors among the wreckage. The earthquake was the largest to hit Pakistan since a major tremor in 2013 that occurred nearby."
A violent incident occurred yesterday in Kongsberg, Viken, Norway, as a man used a bow and arrow to attack people in the streets. The attack left five people dead and two others injured. The responsible individual has been taken into custody by authorities. The brutal killings reportedly took place at multiple locations in Kongsberg. The motive behind the attack remains unclear. Victims have not been identified yet. The police are investigating the incident, and local authorities have expressed their condolences to the families of the victims."
On October 13, 2021, a 37-year-old Norwegian man and Danish citizen, identified as Espen Andersen BraÃäthen, attacked several locations in Kongsberg, Viken, Norway, using a bow and arrow, killing five people and injuring three others. BraÃäthen, who had previously converted to Islam and had been previously flagged by police for concerns about his possible radicalization, was eventually arrested and confessed to the attack. Police initially responded to the first reports of a person walking around Kongsberg with a bow and arrows, and armed officers confronted the perpetrator six minutes later but he fired several arrows at them and escaped. The attack occurred in multiple locations, with BraÃäthen firing arrows inside a Coop Extra supermarket and then moving across a large area. A warning shot was fired during his arrest, and the attack prompted a large emergency response from police and medical personnel. The attack was the deadliest in Norway since the 2011 attacks by Anders Behring Breivik, and Norwegian police constables were ordered to temporarily carry firearms nationwide in response. Flags were flown at half-mast and candles were lit in memoriam on the steps of Kongsberg Church the day after the attack. BraÃäthen, who had several prior criminal convictions, was born to a Norwegian father and Danish mother and had lived his entire life in Norway. The Norwegian Police Security Service launched a terrorism investigation following the attack."
The death toll from the recent suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Kandahar, Afghanistan, has risen to at least 65, with over 70 others injured. The attack, which occurred on 15 October 2021 during Friday prayers, was claimed by the Islamic State ‚Äì Khorasan Province. This comes just a week after a similar bombing at a Shia mosque in Kunduz, which killed at least 50 people, also claimed by IS-KP. In response, the Taliban has pledged to increase security measures at Shia mosques."
Sir David Amess, the British Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Southend West, was killed in a terrorist incident after being stabbed to death at a constituency meeting in Leigh-on-Sea on 15 October 2021. The attack occurred at Belfairs Methodist Church, where Amess was holding a surgery for his constituents. A 25-year-old man, a British national with Somali heritage, was quickly arrested on suspicion of murder and a knife was recovered. The motivations of the attacker remain unknown, and Counter-terrorist police officers are involved in the early stages of the investigation. Following the attack, police have declared it to be a terrorist incident. Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to Westminster, expressed his shock and offered condolences, and announced that the security of MPs will be reviewed. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, also announced that security measures for MPs will be examined. The United Nations, political figures across the globe and various parliamentary groups also offered their condolences and spoke out against the attack. The BBC changed its evening schedule as a sign of respect. The Conservative Party suspended campaigning activities until further notice. Amess was a long-serving politician who opposed abortion, campaigned for animal welfare protections and supported Brexit. He was knighted for his commitment to public service, and his death is a significant loss to his friends, family, and constituents."
Protests by Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government, which began on 20 September 2021, have ended following an agreement reached on 30 September 2021 to lift the ban on Serbian license plates. The ban had provoked the protests, which led to traffic being blocked near border crossings between Kosovo and Serbia. The move was taken to mirror the former ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia, and impacted around 9,500 vehicles with Serbian license plates in North Kosovo, who would have been required to switch for Kosovo plates. The Serbian Armed Forces were put on heightened combat readiness during the unrest, which worsened relations between Serbia and Kosovo. The protests ended on 2 October 2021. On 30 September 2021, an agreement was reached to end the ban from 4 October 2021, and to effectively end the ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia. The solution will see the national symbols of Kosovo on RKS plates and those of Serbia on Serbian plates being covered with stickers. A working group will meet to find a permanent solution with negotiators from Kosovo and Serbia."
Sir David Amess, a long-serving British Conservative Party politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for Southend West, was stabbed to death multiple times during a political surgery at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on 15 October 2021. Ali Harbi Ali, a 25-year-old British-born national of Somali heritage, was arrested at the scene and was later charged with the murder of Amess and the preparation of terrorist acts. Ali appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court and the Old Bailey and has been remanded to Belmarsh prison to await trial on March 7, 2022. Amess had entered Parliament in 1983 as MP for Basildon and was described as an ""instantly recognisable"" member of the Conservative Party. He was a devout Catholic and a socially conservative politician who opposed abortion, supported capital punishment, and campaigned for Brexit. He supported animal welfare and was one of the few Conservative MPs to support a ban on fox hunting. Amess had close links to Qatar and supported awarding Southend-on-Sea city status, a development that was approved by the Queen following his death. After Cox's murder in 2016, there were concerns about the safety of MPs during public surgeries. Although MPs are protected by armed police when inside Parliament, they are generally not given police protection during surgeries. In the aftermath of Amess's killing, a review of MP security was announced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Following Amess's death, there was an outpouring of shock and grief from across the political spectrum, as well as from members of the royal family and international politicians. A vigil for Amess was held in his Southend West constituency, and a service of remembrance was held at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, which included an address by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. The Conservative Party suspended political campaigning, and a by-election was triggered to fill Amess's former seat. Major and minor parties announced that they would not stand a candidate to oppose the Conservatives as a sign of respect, following the precedent set in the 2016 Batley and Spen by-election. The Catholic Church raised concerns about Amess's last rites, and British Catholic policymakers sought to enact an ""Amess amendment"" to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill to ensure priests' access to crime scenes to administer the last rites. MPs paid tribute to Amess in a book of condolence placed in the House of Commons Library, as well as in Westminster Hall and Portcullis House. Tributes were also laid at Belfairs Methodist Church Hall, where Amess was killed."
Solar cycle 25, the current pattern of sunspot activity, began in December 2019 with a smoothed minimum sunspot number of 1.8 and is expected to continue until around 2030. While early predictions varied widely regarding the strength of the cycle, experts now largely agree that it will be weaker than average. Recent observations include the appearance of reversed polarity sunspots, indicating a transition to cycle 25, and the identification of magnetic regions with the underlying orientation of the solar cycle 25 toroidal field component. Additionally, solar activity has been increasing, with a series of flares and coronal mass ejections occurring throughout 2020 and 2021. On October 30 or 31, an X-class solar flare, the second of the current cycle, erupted with an associated coronal mass ejection that may graze Earth, potentially causing bright aurorae and interfering with satellite communications."

On November 2, 2021, a bomb and shooting attack took place at the Daoud Khan Military Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, resulting in at least 25 deaths and more than 50 injuries. The incident began with a bomb exploding at the hospital's entrance, followed by gunfire and a second explosion. The Taliban claimed to have killed four attackers and arrested another, but no one has claimed responsibility for the attack. The hospital has experienced a previous attack in 2017, which was claimed by the Islamic State. The attack caused widespread condemnation from leaders around the world, with the United Nations stating that the perpetrators must be held accountable. The incident highlights the ongoing instability and violence in Afghanistan, where insurgent groups continue to pose a threat to civilians and security forces alike."
The death toll from the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, has risen to 22 as search-and-rescue operations enter their third day. The building, known as the ""360 Degrees Towers,"" was being built much higher than authorized by the Lagos State Building Control Agency. A UK-based private development company, Fourscore Homes, commissioned the construction. The company's owner, Nigerian Femi Osibona, is reportedly missing after being in the building during the collapse. The rescue effort is being conducted by the National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos State (NEMA), with the military scheduled to take over operations. Nine people have been rescued so far. The state government has suspended the chief architect and arrested the building's owner, stating they would be prosecuted."
On November 2, 2021, the people of New Jersey voted to re-elect Democratic Governor Phil Murphy for his second term, defeating Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli in the gubernatorial election. This victory made Murphy the first Democratic Governor of the state to be re-elected since 1977, when Brendan Byrne won a second term. The primaries were held on June 8, 2021, in which Murphy won the Democratic nomination unopposed after his two primary challengers were disqualified. Ciattarelli emerged as the Republican nominee, and he was joined by Green nominee Madelyn Hoffman, Libertarian nominee Gregg Mele, and SWP nominee Joanne Kuniansky in the general election. The debate, which was planned for May 26, 2021, between Ciattarelli and Hirsh Singh moderated by NJ Spotlight News reporters Briana Vannozzi, Colleen O'Dea, and David Cruz was later cancelled after Singh announced that he would decline to participate. In the general election, five candidates appeared on the ballot, the lowest number for a New Jersey gubernatorial election since 1953. Despite the third-party candidates being ineligible to debate in any debates that were sponsored by the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, the New Jersey Globe held another debate for third-party Lieutenant Governor candidates on October 11, 2021."
On 1 November 2021, a 21-story high-rise building called the ""360 Degrees Towers"" in the Ikoyi neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria collapsed while in the process of construction. The tower was being built by Fourscore Homes, a United Kingdom-registered company headed by an experienced Nigerian developer Femi Osibona. The collapse resulted in the loss of at least 36 lives. Rescue efforts by the National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos State (NEMA), and other responders are still ongoing. As of 3 November, nine people have been rescued, and many more remain missing or trapped in the rubble. The cause of the collapse is still under investigation by an independent panel set up by the state government. The Lagos State Building Control Agency has suspended the chief architect, and the owner of the building has been arrested and would be prosecuted, according to Gbolahan Oki, the agency's general manager. The collapse has highlighted the challenges Nigeria faces with building safety and quality control."
A devastating explosion in Freetown, Sierra Leone occurred on November 5, 2021, resulting in the deaths of at least 99 people and injuring over 100. The collision involved an oil tanker and a truck in the Wellington suburb outside of Choithram Supermarket, which led to a fuel spill and subsequent ignition. Witnesses reported that people flocked to collect the leaking fuel. The incident caused nearby shops and markets to catch on fire, and a bus full of passengers was completely burnt. Several people remain in critical condition, including 30 victims with severe burns who are not expected to survive. The mortuary at Connaught Hospital has received a total of 92 bodies so far. Freetown has experienced numerous natural disasters in the past, including a devastating mudslide in 2017 and a major fire in one of the city's slums in March of this year. Sierra Leone's President Julius Maada Bio offered condolences to the victims' families and pledged support, while the Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals to assess the situation. However, it was reported that the hospital services were stretched due to the high volume of injured individuals."
"The festival, operated by rapper Travis Scott, was held on November 5, 2021, with approximately 50,000 attendees. The crush occurred during the first night of the festival when concertgoers pushed toward the stage en masse as Scott began his performance. Houston Fire Chief Sam PenÃÉa stated that the crowd began to compress toward the front of the stage around 9:00 p.m. on the first night, and additional panic ensued as people began to fall and get injured. At least eight people died, ranging in age from 16 to 23, and 23 others were hospitalized, including eleven people found in a state of cardiac arrest. Drug overdose is being investigated as a potential cause of cardiac arrest. More than 300 people were treated for injuries at the festival's field hospital. Scott, along with stage crew, paused during his 75-minute performance when he noticed attendees in distress near the stage. Music was halted for a few seconds when Scott noticed an ambulance in the crowd to ask what was happening. Two members of Scott's staff approached him on stage, though he shooed them away and resumed his performance. A concertgoer was filmed informing a cameraman that ""people are dying"", but another audience member told him that the crowd would take care of it. The cause of death is still under investigation, and the second night of the festival on November 6 was cancelled. A reunification center was set up for families searching for relatives. Texas governor Greg Abbott stated on November 6, ""What happened at Astroworld Festival last night was tragic, and our hearts are with those who lost their lives and those who were injured in the terrifying crowd surge."" Scott stated he would support the incident's investigation and that he wants to help heal the Houston community. Kylie Jenner, Scott's girlfriend, was criticized for Instagram posts depicting the crowd, including one with an ambulance attempting to make its way through the crowd. Jenner and her sister, Kendall Jenner, were not injured during the event."
Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan recently made history by meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the first time since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War ten years ago. The meeting revolved around discussing ""ways to develop cooperation in different sectors that are of common interest"".

Both countries are part of the Middle East region and share close cultural ties."
A fuel tanker collision in Sierra Leone's capital and largest city Freetown on November 5th, 2021, resulted in an explosion and a fire which caused the death toll to rise from 99 to 115, as confirmed by the National Disaster Management Agency. Over 100 others were injured, overwhelming the city's medical services. The accident occurred at a busy intersection in the Wellington area, Freetown's main industrial district, involving a petrol fuel tanker and a lorry carrying granite. The leaking petrol spilled onto the streets, and locals, particularly motorbike taxi-riders, attempted to collect it in containers. An explosion led to a massive fireball that engulfed vehicles, shops, markets, and passengers that were stuck in traffic created by the initial collision. The incident has been described as the first of its kind in the densely populated city of about 1.2 million, following similar high-casualty fuel tanker explosions across sub-Saharan Africa where spilled fuel was viewed as wasteful in communities where many struggled to afford petrol. Similar events include the 2018 Mbuba tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo that killed 50 and the 2019 Morogoro explosion in Tanzania that killed 85. President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, offered condolences and promised support to the victims' families. Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals. The hospital services in the city were stretched due to the high number of casualties. The intersection where the collision happened is popularly known as ""PMB,"" short for Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board, a defunct parastatal with its old factory buildings located adjacent to the intersection. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and Sierra Leone's government has promised to take action to prevent future similar disasters."
Israel's COVID-19 vaccination programme, dubbed ""Give a Shoulder"" (Hebrew: ◊ú◊™◊™ ◊õ◊™◊£), has been globally recognized for its success in vaccinating a high proportion of its population in a short period of time relative to the rest of the world. As of June 26, 2021, about 64% of eligible Israelis have received at least one dose, with a world-leading 60% receiving two doses. Israel's mass vaccination campaign was initiated on December 19, 2020, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being the first person in the country to receive the vaccine. The initial campaign focused on the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, as well as employees in the healthcare sector. The success of Israel's centralized health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in coordinating the distribution of the vaccine was attributed to their maintenance of personal health data databases, which allowed them to contact residents directly regarding vaccination drives. However, Israel faced distribution issues early on, including trouble scheduling appointments and insufficient distribution to less-populated villages and Arab-Israeli communities. By late February 2021, at least 4.8 million Israelis had received at least one dose, resulting in a drop in severe COVID-19 cases. Israel has the highest vaccinated population per capita in the world, with over 60% of residents having received at least one dose by March 2021. Immunized residents are required to show a green pass to access certain locations. As of July 29, 2021, the country rolled out a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to people over the age of 60, based on data indicating significant waning immunity from infection for those with two doses. In addition to vaccinating its own population, Israel faced criticism for its distribution of vaccines to Palestinians, which was not as thorough as to Israeli citizens. In June 2021, Israel announced plans to give over 1 million soon-to-expire Pfizer vaccines to the Palestinian Authority in exchange for later reimbursement, but the deal fell through due to concerns regarding the expiration date of the doses. In recent news, Israel's pandemic advisory board has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old. This marks an important step forward in efforts to vaccinate younger age groups and control the spread of the virus."
On November 14th, 2021, a taxi explosion occurred outside the main entrance of Liverpool Women's Hospital in Liverpool. The explosion, caused by an improvised explosive device carried by the taxi's passenger, a Middle Eastern man, was declared a terrorist incident by Merseyside Police. The passenger was killed in the blast, while taxi driver David Perry was injured but later released from the hospital. It has been revealed that the driver locked the passenger inside the taxi upon noticing the explosive device, according to Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson. The motivation behind the attack is still unknown. The police made three arrests under the Terrorism Act and continue to investigate the incident. Following the attack, the UK terror threat level was raised from substantial to severe, and MI5 joined the local police investigation. COBRA also held a meeting in response to the incident. The attack was reported internationally by news outlets such as CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post."
Tongans are set to elect their new government as general elections will be held in the country on 18 November 2021. The election will choose 17 of the 26 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Tonga. The 2017 general elections saw the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands emerge victorious, with  ªAkilisi PoÃÑhiva being re-elected as Prime Minister. However, following his death in September 2019, Pohiva Tu ªi ªonetoa became the new Prime Minister with support from the nobles, independent MPs, and former members of the DPFI. In December 2020, Democratic party leader Semisi Sika submitted a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Tu ªi ªonetoa which was later rejected by the Legislative Assembly. The Tongan electoral system allows up to 30 members in the Legislative Assembly with 17 directly elected through first-past-the-post voting from single-member constituencies. The nobility holds nine seats while up to four members not elected to the Assembly can be appointed to the Cabinet formed by a Prime Minister. The parliament has been dissolved since 16 September, with 75 candidates, including 12 women, registering to contest the elections. However, one candidate withdrew while another died, leaving a total of 73 candidates. Despite a week-long lockdown due to a COVID-19 case, the elections will proceed as scheduled. The island of Tongatapu has ten constituencies, Vava ªu three, Ha ªapai two, and  ªEua and Niuatoputapu/Niuafo ªou one each. The outcome of the election remains to be seen as Tongans exercise their right to vote and choose their new leaders."
Late on November 22, a bus carrying Macedonian tourists who were returning from a trip to Istanbul crashed just outside the village of Bosnek, in Bulgaria's Pernik Province. The tragic incident, which occurred on a motorway southwest of Sofia, left 46 people dead and another seven injured. The bus caught fire after the crash, resulting in one of the deadliest incidents of its kind in Bulgarian history. Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident."
The Solomon Islands has been hit by ongoing protests and violent riots since 24 November 2021, with buildings set ablaze, schools and businesses closed, and clashes between police and protesters. Most of the protesters in Honiara, the capital, are from Malaita Province, which has continued to receive support from Taiwan and the United States after the central government withdrew recognition of Taiwan in 2019. The unrest is believed to be linked to disputes between the national government and several provinces over economic and political issues. Rioting and looting continue in Honiara's Chinatown, with police using tear gas to disperse protesters. Following a request for assistance from the Solomon Islands government, the Australian Federal Police and Australian Defence Force personnel have been deployed to maintain order and protect vital infrastructure, while Papua New Guinea is sending 34 peacekeepers. A nighttime curfew is now in place in Honiara from 7:00 p.m. local time. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has warned the rioters will ""face consequences"" and has resisted calls to step down while blaming ""foreign powers"" for the unrest. The premier of Malaita Province, Daniel Suidani, criticized the government's actions but condemned the violence on the part of the protesters, while the premier of Guadalcanal strongly denounced the riots. The government of the People's Republic of China expressed concern about the attacks and support for ""restoring order and stability quickly."""
The 2021-2022 European windstorm season is currently underway, with Storm Arwen being the latest named storm by the Met Office on 25 November 2021. Red wind warnings have been issued for northeastern parts of the UK, with extensive orange and yellow warnings for much of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and most of England. Dangerous waves are also forecasted, with likely disruptions to ferry services. As of 5 pm GMT on 26 November, Network Rail has closed rail lines north of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and LNER has stopped running trains north of Newcastle. In earlier events, Storms Tim, Volker, and Stephane have also caused damage and fatalities in Germany, Poland, and Northern Europe. Additionally, Cyclone Apollo and Blas have caused heavy rainfall and flooding in Tunisia, Algeria, Southern Italy, and Malta this season.
On November 30, 2021, a 15-year-old sophomore student opened fire on students at Oxford High School in Oxford, Michigan, killing four students and injuring seven others, including one teacher. The suspect reportedly used a semiautomatic handgun for the shooting. According to the parent of a student who stayed home on November 30, threats of a mass shooting occurring at Oxford High School were already present before the incident occurred. Earlier that month, in an act of vandalism, a deer head had been thrown off the school roof, prompting school administrators to notify parents that they had been investigating rumors of a threat against the school but found none. After the shooting occurred, the school went into lockdown, and some students were evacuated to a nearby Meijer store. At 12:55 p.m. EST, police arrived at the school after receiving around 100 911 calls. The shooter was arrested unharmed. A 9 mm SIG Sauer SP2022 semiautomatic handgun was recovered from the suspect; the suspect's father had purchased the gun four days prior to the shooting. Based on recovered shell casings found in the school, authorities believe around 15 to 20 shots were fired. President Joe Biden and Representative Elissa Slotkin, whose district includes Oxford High School, both expressed their condolences over the shooting. Governor Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that she was ""devastated for the students, staff, and families"" of the school, calling gun violence a ""public health crisis."" The shooting has reignited debates about gun control and school safety in the United States."
The Semeru volcano, located in East Java, Indonesia, erupted on December 4, 2021, resulting in one death and 41 injuries. The initial eruption occurred at 14:50 local time, causing a cloud of volcanic ash to rise 40,000 feet (12,000 meters) into the air. The eruption is believed to have been triggered by the collapse of a lava dome at the summit crater due to intense precipitation. As a result, a pyroclastic flow swept down the volcano's slopes, affecting six sub-districts in the Malang Regency and eight villages in the Lumajang Regency. The eruption caused severe damage to the Gladak Perak Bridge, disrupting vehicle access to villages in the surrounding area. Power outages were also triggered, affecting over 30,000 residents. At least 30 homes were destroyed by lahars, and many other homes and vehicles were submerged in heavy volcanic ash. Around 300 families were evacuated from their homes due to the eruption. On December 5, ashfall occurred in the Pronojiwo District of Lumajang, resulting in the evacuation of many residents and aid officials. A smaller eruption also caused panic in nearby villages, damaging 28 schools in two districts. The death toll from the eruption has since risen to 14, with many victims dying from severe burns. Additionally, at least 102 people have been injured, with four burn victims in the intensive care unit. The Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB) reported that ten miners were initially thought to be missing at a sand mine in Lumajang, but they were later rescued. However, some sand miners remain unaccounted for. Local authorities have urged residents to keep a distance of at least 5 kilometers from the main summit crater due to the risk of large pyroclastic flows. The head of the BNPB warned of increased volcanic activity and urged residents to evacuate the affected areas. Relief efforts are underway, with aid agencies providing meals, medical supplies, and refugee tents to displaced residents. Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the Lumajang Regency on December 5 to lead the post-eruption recovery efforts."
In a tragic incident on December 4, 2021, Indian soldiers of the Assam Rifles unit fired upon a group of miners who were returning home from work in Nagaland, under the false impression that they were militants. Thirteen miners lost their lives, while a soldier was killed in a confrontation with the angry locals. The Indian army has cited this episode as a ""case of mistaken identity"" due to an intelligence failure. The incident sparked widespread protests and public outrage calling for the repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). Following the tragic incident, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to probe the incident. The Nagaland Police have registered a case against the Indian army's 21 Para Special Forces. The National Human Rights Commission of India has sent notices to the Central and state governments, seeking an inquiry. The incident has led to the Eastern Nagaland People‚Äôs Organisation (ENPO) withdrawing from the ongoing annual Hornbill Festival in Kisama near Kohima, while the Nagas hoisted black flags on all its Morungs at the festival. The Konyaks decided to abstain their cultural troupe from participating in the festival, followed by other Naga cultural troupes. On December 7, 2021, the Government of Nagaland announced that it would suspend all activities at Hornbill Festival and seek the repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. The tragedy is a stark reminder of the urgent need to address the ongoing political conflict and human rights abuses in the region."
The United Kingdom continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, as the country reported a record 78,610 new cases in the past 24 hours on January 4, 2022. The virus first reached the UK in late January 2020 and has since led to 10,523,316 confirmed cases and 165,721 deaths as of December 6, 2021. The UK has the highest number of confirmed cases in Europe and the fourth highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. The country has the world's 7th highest death toll and 28th highest death rate by population. The UK's response to the pandemic has included a public information campaign and several expansions to government powers. However, the country was slow to introduce preventative measures, increase testing, or prepare for an outbreak. The government introduced restrictions across the UK on people's freedom of movement, education, and leisure activities beginning in March 2020. Police were empowered to enforce the measures, and the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave all four governments emergency powers not used since the Second World War. The country's vaccination program was the first to start in December 2020 and was, in early 2021, one of the fastest in the world. The highly transmissible Delta variant arrived in the UK and drove a third wave of infections in mid-2021 that increased into the autumn, although high vaccination rates led to a substantially lower mortality rate than previous waves. In late 2021, the Omicron variant arrived in the UK and drove a further increase in cases. The impact of the Omicron variant on the UK's healthcare system and the broader population remains to be seen. In addition to the major strain on the UK's healthcare service and a substantial fall in life expectancy, the pandemic has had a severe impact on the country's economy, caused major disruptions to education, and had far-reaching impacts on society. The pandemic's major impact on the country's healthcare system, leading to lengthy waitlists for medical procedures and ambulances, has also led to an indirect increase in deaths from other conditions. The lockdown also had a major mental health impact, particularly among foreign-born workers whose work hours had been reduced or eliminated.  The pandemic has had far-reaching consequences in the country that go beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it, including political, cultural, and social implications. The impact of COVID-19 in the UK remains a significant issue, particularly as the country faces new challenges and uncertainties with the emergence of the Omicron variant."
Helen Morgan of the Liberal Democrats has won the North Shropshire by-election, becoming the constituency's new MP. This seat has been consistently held by the Conservative Party since the constituency's creation, making this result a major upset. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of former Conservative MP Owen Paterson in November, after he was found to have breached paid advocacy rules. Helen Morgan won the election with a swing of 34.1%, which is the 7th largest in UK by-election history. The other candidates included Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst of the Conservatives, Ben Wood of Labour, Kirsty Walmsley of Reform UK, and several representatives of minor parties. The turnout for the election was 51.3%.
A cargo ship carrying 130 passengers illegally sank off the northeast coast of Madagascar on December 20, 2021, leaving at least 85 people dead. The Francia, a wooden cargo ship, had taken on passengers for a journey from Antanambe to Soanierana Ivongo, but a hole in the hull caused the engine room to flood, leaving the vessel vulnerable to wave action. The flooding caused the ship to sink, and including crew, 138 people were onboard. The Madagascan government launched an investigation into the sinking, and three vessels from the Madagascan navy and maritime agency assisted in the search for survivors. By December 22, 2021, 64 bodies had been recovered, with around 24 people missing and around 50 survivors rescued. However, on December 23, it was reported that 24 more people were found dead, bringing the total death toll to 85, with three more persons missing. Madagascan president Andry Rajoelina paid tribute to those who died in the shipwreck and the helicopter crash that occurred during the rescue mission, and some bodies were sent to nearby villages for burial due to the overcrowding of the Soanierana-Ivongo graveyard. The accident highlights the dangers of illegal passenger vessels and the need for stronger maritime safety regulations in developing countries."
South Australia has reported a surge in COVID-19 cases with a record 744 new cases confirmed in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of cases in the state to 4,324. The state had been following a suppression strategy after achieving an 80% vaccination rate for adults, but the recent surge has raised concerns. The state had previously undergone a seven-day lockdown in July 2021 due to a five-case cluster linked to Modbury Hospital. Several major events such as the OzAsia Festival, the Tour Down Under cycling event, and the Royal Adelaide Show have been cancelled in response to the pandemic. South Australia had previously closed its borders to other Australian states due to the growing cluster in Sydney before re-opening them after hitting the required vaccination rate. The state has also recently implemented new rules for travellers from New South Wales and Victoria in response to concerns about the Omicron variant."
Heavy rains and flooding have wreaked havoc in Brazil's northeastern state of Bahia, resulting in the deaths of at least 18 people, injuries to 280, and displacement of more than 35,000 residents since December 24, 2021. The state's capital, Salvador, received over 250 millimetres (9.8 inches) of rain on Christmas, five times the historic average, leading to the worst disaster in Bahia's history, according to Governor Rui Costa. A state of emergency has been declared in 72 municipalities. Two dams in Jussiape and Itambe collapsed due to the flooding, and a joint rescue operation involving the Bahia state government, the Brazilian federal government, and other state governments has been mounted to aid the affected areas. This disaster comes after Southern Bahia was severely hit by Subtropical Storm UbaÃÅ earlier in the same month."
Iran's cyber warfare capabilities have once again come into question as Israeli media reports that its Jerusalem Post newspaper was hacked by suspected Iranian hackers. The attackers replaced the website's content with a threat directed towards the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center and a possible reference to Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated exactly two years ago in Baghdad. The incident highlights Iran's ongoing status as one of the most active players in the international cyber arena with the country having been both victim and wager of cyber warfare. In recent years, Iran has been accused of carrying out cyber-attacks against the United States, Israel and Persian Gulf Arab countries, but the Iranian government denies the allegations. Meanwhile, the country has its own cybersecurity mechanism called the ""Cyber Defense Command,"" which operates under the ""Passive Civil Defense Organization"" and is a subdivision of the Joint Staff of Iranian Armed Forces. The digital fortress is part of the country's national information network, developed to thwart attacks by engaging attackers."
A deadly blaze broke out on January 9, 2022, in a 19-story apartment building located in Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx, causing 17 fatalities and 44 injuries. This fire is being considered as one of the worst fires that New York City has experienced in modern times. The officials are yet to determine the cause of the fire, but the investigation is currently underway."
The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis, which started in late October 2021, has recently seen Ukrainian authorities arresting an alleged Russian intelligence agent who they claim attempted to recruit others to launch attacks in the port city of Odessa. The crisis has caused international tension, with involvement from the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The escalation began in late October-early November and was provoked by the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations. This came shortly after the occupation of the village of Staromarievka on the contact line, where 37 Russian citizens who received passports under the simplified program reside. Since then, there have been reports of Russian military buildups near the Ukrainian border, with Ukrainian intelligence stating that more than 92,000 troops and Iskander short-range ballistic missile systems have been concentrated there. There have been diplomatic responses to the situation, with talks between US and Russian officials set to take place in Geneva on January 10, 2022, and talks between Russia and NATO in Brussels on January 12, 2022. On January 13, a broader meeting involving the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will take place in Vienna. The UK has also reportedly formed a consolidated rapid response unit of around 600 fighters for potential transfer to Ukraine. Despite these diplomatic efforts, there has been a military escalation, with reports of the use of weapons prohibited by the Minsk Package of Measures. Moscow has accused Ukraine of aggressive actions in the Donbas and of deploying half its army - around 125,000 troops - in the region to confront pro-Russian separatists. In response, the Ukrainian Defense Minister has warned of the possibility of a large-scale escalation by Russia at the end of January. Harsh statements from Kyiv and Moscow sound against the background of a deadlock on all existing negotiating platforms, with no contacts within the Normandy Format and no expected summit. The foreign ministers have not yet been able to coordinate a meeting, and political advisers have not communicated since September. In the Trilateral Contact Group, negotiations have reduced to discussing whether Russia is a party to the conflict. The arrest of the alleged Russian intelligence agent in Odessa adds further tension to the ongoing crisis, with both sides accusing the other of escalating the situation. The international community has called for a reduction of tension and a peaceful resolution to the crisis."
The ongoing military confrontation and international crisis between Russia and Ukraine that started in late October 2021 has reached a breaking point in talks between NATO and Russia, as Poland warns of a possible war. The crisis has caused international tension and involves the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The escalation in Russian-Ukrainian relations began in late October - early November when the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV was reported against the DPR formations. The ceasefire regime has been violated twice as often as in 2020, and OSCE SMM observers reported the movement of military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as repeated attempts to muffle the signal of its UAVs, which are used to monitor the terrain. Russia has also been accused of moving troops to the Ukrainian border, with satellite photos of Russian armoured vehicles being cited as evidence. In response to the escalating tensions, diplomatic efforts have been intensified, including meetings between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the head of the European Council Charles Michel, and the British Defense Minister Ben Wallace visiting Kyiv. The US and Russia also announced bilateral talks in Geneva on 10 January 2022, to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and to confront rising tensions over Ukraine. However, talks hit a breaking point as Poland warns of a possible war. The head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, reported that Russia had allegedly concentrated more than 92,000 troops and Iskander short-range ballistic missile systems near the Ukrainian borders. Russia has accused Ukraine of aggressive actions, saying that the Ukrainian authorities are escalating tensions in the Donbas and are conducting offensive actions in some areas. The situation has reached a deadlock on all negotiating platforms, with no expected contacts within the Normandy Format at any level. The Trilateral Contact Group negotiations are reduced to discussing whether Russia is a party to the conflict. The crisis shows no signs of abating, and tensions continue to rise as talks reach a breaking point."
The 2022 Australian Open is set to take place at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, marking the tournament's 110th edition. The event will span from 17‚Äì30 January 2022 and will be the first Grand Slam of the year, featuring professional players competing in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles categories.  The International Tennis Federation (ITF) is organizing the tournament under the Grand Slam category, which is part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour calendars. The tournament will include junior and wheelchair singles and doubles competitions as well. Among the players, Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka are the defending champions in Men's Singles and Women's Singles, respectively. Despite being granted a medical exemption, Djokovic's Australian visa was initially refused by the Australian Border Force upon entering the country on 5 January 2022. Djokovic's lawyers requested an injunction against deportation to appeal the visa refusal, allowing him to remain detained in a hotel. On 10 January, the Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in favour of Djokovic, ordering his immediate release from detention and directing the federal government to pay his legal expenses following a government admission that they had ""treated Djokovic unreasonably."" Later, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Alex Hawke, invoked his ministerial powers under the Migration Act 1958 to cancel Djokovic's visa on ""health and good order grounds."" The tournament will take place across a series of 25 courts, including the four main show courts: Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena, Margaret Court Arena, and 1573 Arena. Joining the main tennis arenas will be the debut of Kia Arena. Prize money for the tournament reached a record A$75,000,000 AUD, with an increase of 4.5% from the previous year. Controversy surrounding Djokovic‚Äôs visa refusal and subsequent detention sparked public outcry in Australia, particularly due to the exemption granted by Tennis Australia and the health department of the state of Victoria, which allowed Djokovic to compete in the tournament without being vaccinated. Many Australians have been left stranded overseas during the pandemic, and authorities' handling of Djokovic's visa has led to criticisms of unfair treatment towards international athletes."
A hostage crisis at Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, United States, came to a violent end on January 15, 2022, as an armed man who claimed to be the brother of Pakistani Al-Qaeda suspect Aafia Siddiqui was shot and killed by police. The assailant had entered the synagogue posing as a homeless man in search of shelter and taken four hostages, including the Rabbi, Charlie Cytron-Walker, during a bar mitzvah ceremony. Police and federal authorities negotiated with the man for over 12 hours before he was killed in a police raid that rescued the remaining hostages unharmed. The synagogue, which was opened in 1999, is located in Colleyville, a suburb in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and follows the principles of Reform Judaism. It had 25 families and a religious school with 75 children. The Attacker had demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, who in 2010 was convicted of the attempted murder of a U.S. Army captain while in Afghan custody. However, Siddiqui's only biological brother had no involvement with the attack, according to a former lawyer. A connectivity to Al-Qaeda has not been established to date. During the crisis, the law enforcement had evacuated neighborhoods in the vicinity of the incident, and the White House and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett were keeping a close watch over the events. One member of the synagogue stated that she heard the man speaking using anti-Israel epithets. Soon after the raid that ended the hostage crisis, Israeli Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid praised the efforts of the Texas police for their actions and condemned the actions of the attacker. The attorney who represents Aafia Siddiqui also strongly condemned the hostage-taking at Congregation Beth Israel and implored the assailant to release all hostages and turn himself in."
A large eruption of Hunga Tonga, a volcanic island in Tonga in the Pacific Ocean, occurred on January 15, 2022. The eruption caused tsunamis in Tonga, Fiji, American Samoa, and other parts of the world, and claimed the lives of at least five people. After being dormant for years, the Hunga Tonga volcano erupted on December 20, 2021, sending particulates into the stratosphere. Increased volcanic activity on the island was reported on December 25, and it was declared dormant on January 11, 2022. On January 14, another eruption occurred, causing waves of up to 15 meters (50 feet) to hit the Tongan coasts, causing widespread damage and prompting evacuation efforts. The following day, a significantly larger eruption occurred, sending a large plume of ash and smoke into the air, which was visible from space, and causing tsunamis across the Pacific. The tsunamis caused a magnitude 5.8 earthquake and up to 2.5-meter (8-foot) waves to strike the Tongan capital, Nuku ªalofa, while waves of between 1 and 2.5 meters hit Vanuatu. Hawaii was also affected, with waves of up to 80 centimeters (31 inches) recorded, although no significant damage was reported. Peru was hit by a small tsunami that left at least two people dead in Lambayeque. As a result of the eruption, many residents in Tonga were stranded and without food, water, and power. A global relief effort involving New Zealand, Australia, and other countries was launched to bring aid and support to the affected communities. The eruption of Hunga Tonga is a reminder of the power of nature and the need for preparedness and response measures to minimize the impact of such events on affected populations. The global community must continue to work together to address the risks posed by natural disasters and climate change."
On January 20, 2022, an attack by Islamic State militants on Al-Sina'a prison in the city of Al-Hasakah led to a prison riot and the escape of inmates. The militants used a car bomb to target the prison while ground fighters opened fire with heavy weapons. The attack resulted in the deaths of 67 people. The prison was subsequently occupied by armed prisoners and several managed to escape. The Islamic State fighters spread to the Al-Zouhour area of Al-Hasakah city and solidified their control of the prison. Kurdish forces and the International Coalition dispatched military aircraft to the area to support the fight against the militants. The clashes continued into the next day and resulted in an announcement from SDF forces that 89 of the escaped prisoners had been tracked down and arrested. The SOHR reported that the fighting continued between Islamic State and Kurdish forces over control of the prison and its surrounding areas. The attack is one of the largest by the Islamic State since it lost its last key Syrian territory in 2019."
Singapore's COVID-19 vaccination campaign, which started on December 30, 2020, has been ongoing to immunize the country against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The nation currently holds the distinction of being the world's most vaccinated country, with more than 88% of its total population having completed their vaccination regimen. The government invested over SGD 1 billion to sign advanced purchase agreements and made early down payments on promising vaccine candidates such as Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, and CoronaVac. On March 14, 2022, Singaporean authorities extended the COVID-19 vaccine booster doses to people between the ages of 12 and 17. To advise and assess on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for use, the Singaporean government appointed a 14-member Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination on October 5, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the Committee submitted its recommendations on the overall vaccination strategy of Singapore to the government, emphasizing the prioritization of people who are at high risk of infection and the elderly. Singapore became the first Asian country to approve Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine on December 14, 2020. After that, on December 22, 2020, Singapore received its first shipment of Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac vaccine. Still, the Health Sciences Authority did not authorize the vaccine for use. However, on June 2, 2021, the authority authorized the Sinovac vaccine for usage in private healthcare settings. The government rolled out booster shots for senior citizens above 60 years of age from September 14, 2021. On December 10, it was announced that booster shots will be extended to individuals above 18 years of age from December 14. On August 19, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) began issuing a tamper-proof vaccination sticker to travelers who have been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO). On September 24, Malaysian National Recovery Council chairman Muhyiddin Yassin confirmed that Malaysia and Singapore will recognize each other's vaccination certificates to facilitate travel between both nations."
The Baluch Liberation Front has claimed responsibility for a militant attack in the remote area of Dasht, Kech District in Balochistan, Pakistan that killed ten soldiers of the Pakistan Army and injured three others. The attack occurred on January 25, 2022 and lasted for a few hours, during which militants also seized weapons from the security post. While law enforcement agencies reported that they killed one militant and arrested three others in a clearance operation, the insurgents reportedly suffered several casualties as well. No group has yet taken responsibility for the attack, and it is unclear if the militants who were arrested were directly involved in the incident. The Baluch separatist movement in the region has been active for decades, and incidents of violence and conflict have been a regular occurrence there."
Between January 31 ‚Äî February 1, 2022, heavy rainfall struck Ecuador, resulting in multiple landslides, floods, and mudflows. The devastation led to at least 23 people losing their lives and 47 others wounded in Quito due to landslides. In addition, nine individuals remain missing from the landslide tragedy. The Ecuadorian government has declared a state of emergency in several affected areas. Rescue operations continue to help those affected by the natural disaster."
On February 1, 2022, a coup attempt was made in Guinea-Bissau that resulted in the deaths of ""many"" members of the security forces, according to the country's president Umaro Sissoco Embalo. Despite this, Embalo assured the public that ""all is well"" and that the situation was ""under control."" Both the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) condemned the attempted coup and called for peace in the country. In a statement, ECOWAS urged the military to return to their barracks and maintain a ""republican posture"" while holding them responsible for the safety of President Embalo and his government members."
On February 2, 2022, CODECO militiamen carried out a mass stabbing at a camp called Plaine Savo for internally displaced people in Djugu territory, Ituri Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in the killing of over 60 residents. The camp is home to about 4,000 people in the northeast region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The incident marks another unfortunate episode in the ongoing violence by armed groups against civilians in the region."
After centuries of whaling, Iceland has announced that it will finally end the controversial practice by 2024. The reasons cited for this decision include the decreasing demand and price for whale meat, as well as the growing global concern for marine conservation. The move is a significant victory for anti-whaling activists, who have long been campaigning for Iceland to abandon its whaling industry. For years, Iceland has been one of a few countries that still maintain a whaling fleet, despite an ongoing moratorium established by the International Whaling Commission in 1986. The country was notorious for its hunting of fin whales, which were primarily exported to Japan, and minke whales, which were consumed domestically - particularly by tourists. However, whaling in Iceland has faced several challenges in recent years. The industry has been temporarily paused since 2019, due to coronavirus restrictions, competition from subsidized Japanese whaling, and the rise of domestic whale-watching tourism. Icelandic whalers were also accused of slaughtering a blue whale in 2018, which caused significant international outrage. Now, with the announcement of the impending end of whaling, Iceland is sending a clear message that it is committed to protecting marine life and respecting global opinion on this controversial issue. The country's whale-watching sector, which has existed in tension with the whaling industry, is expected to flourish as a result.

Operation Unifier, also known as Canadian Armed Forces Joint Task Force-Ukraine, has undergone changes in its operations. Canada has announced the withdrawal of its military advisors from Ukraine, relocating them to an undisclosed destination in Europe. Additionally, it has moved its diplomatic staff to Lviv, suspending all operations at its embassy in Kyiv. The operation is part of Multinational Joint Commission, a larger body composed of the U.S., UK, Canada, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and Denmark aimed at reforming Ukraine's military. The first Canadian troops to participate in the operation come from the 1st Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment. The Canadian contribution of training is provided by about 200 Canadian soldiers, rotating every 6 months, increased to 260 in January 2022. As of November 2018 there have been 230 course sessions and more than 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained under Operation Unifier. Since 2018, a small Swedish contingent also operates within the framework. In December 2021, three Swedish officers were in Ukraine within the framework of Operation Unifier. Canada made its first delivery of non-lethal military equipment to Ukraine on November 28, 2014. This equipment mainly included cold protective clothing and was delivered to Boryspil International Airport by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). On December 8, 2015, the Minister of National Defence of Canada, Harjit Sajjan, announced that his country has signed an agreement with Ukraine for joint military training and for strengthening its military capabilities. On March 6, 2017, the Government of Canada announced the extension of Operation Unifier until the end of March 2019, and later extended it until the end of March 2022. On January 26, 2022, the Government of Canada announced the extension of Operation Unifier until the end of March 2025, and increased the complement of 200 by another 60. According to lobbyists from the NATO Association of Canada, Operation Unifier's broader mission includes helping the development of the region, maintaining security, democracy, providing humanitarian aid, and promoting economic stability and growth. Members of the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada have positively welcomed the Canadian government's contribution to Ukraine. A number of community appreciation events were held in Toronto, Edmonton and Winnipeg for CAF members who have served in Operation Unifier. On July 1, 2018, the Band of the Ceremonial Guard performed during its daily guard mounting ceremony on Parliament Hill, a Ukrainian military march known as ""Shchob shabli ne braly, shchob Kuli mynaly"" (–©–æ–± —à–∞–±–ª—ñ –Ω–µ –±—Ä–∞–ª–∏, —â–æ–± –∫—É–ª—ñ –º–∏–Ω–∞–ª–∏) in front of members of the Ukrainian diaspora during the ceremony, as a sort of response to the operation."
The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation, a regulation of the European Union and Euratom, has been confirmed by the European Court of Justice to comply with the treaties of the European Union. This dismissal of legal challenges from Poland and Hungary will allow the European Commission to suspend funds from the EU budget to member states with rule of law issues that could affect the management of EU funds. Democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland has been a significant concern for the European Union since the 2010s. In response, the European Commission proposed in May 2018 to tie disbursements from the European Union's budget to adherence to rule of law standards through a regulation. In December 2020, the Council finally adopted the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation, which empowers the Commission to propose measures against a member state violating the principles of rule of law, such as suspension of payments or commitments. Despite the adoption of the regulation, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on March 25, 2021, urging the Commission to avoid further delays in its application and keep the Parliament informed about ongoing investigations into rule of law breaches. On June 10, 2021, the Parliament adopted another resolution calling on the Commission to fulfil its obligations within two weeks, threatening legal action against the Commission for failure to act. However, the Commission rejected the ultimatum on August 23, 2021, with a five-page letter. In addition, on March 11, 2021, Hungary and Poland separately launched legal proceedings with the Court of Justice of the European Union against the European Parliament and the Council, asking the court to annul the regulation. Nevertheless, the advocate general advised the court to dismiss these challenges on December 2, 2021. With the recent dismissal of legal challenges, the implementation of the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation can now be fully enforced."
Australia has designated several new organizations as terrorist groups including Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham, and the Guardians of Religion Organization. The government has also expanded its designation of Hamas to include its political wing. The list of designated terrorist organizations in Australia is maintained by the Attorney-General's Department and includes foreign groups that have been found to be involved in terrorist activities. The country's anti-terrorism financing laws include various sanctions for individuals and entities that support terrorist organizations, and the responsibility for prosecuting these offenses lies with the Australian Federal Police, state police forces, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. AUSTRAC, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, also monitors financial transactions involving these groups. The government's efforts are part of a wider global effort to combat terrorism and keep the nation safe."
