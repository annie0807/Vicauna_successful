The 2021 Taliban offensive continues to make significant gains as the group recently captured Zaranj, the provincial capital of Nimruz Province, marking their first major capture of a provincial city since the 2001 invasion. The group has now taken control of a significant portion of Afghanistan, with over half of the country now under Taliban control. The lack of reinforcements from the central government has been blamed for the loss of Zaranj. The conflict has caused a sharp increase in civilian deaths, with the United Nations warning that women and children are being killed. The international community continues to monitor the situation, with some countries offering to protect Afghan refugees and others calling for a transitional government in Afghanistan.
Wildfires continue to ravage Greece, forcing mass evacuations in the northern suburbs of Athens as the outskirts of the capital burn. The fires have claimed the lives of two individuals so far, with a volunteer firefighter killed by a fallen electricity pylon and another man dying in a factory. In addition to the fatalities, at least 20 people have been injured. The wildfires have destroyed dozens of homes and prompted evacuations in several villages and towns. The largest fires are currently located in Attica, Olympia, Messenia, and Euboea. Authorities are urging residents in affected areas to remain vigilant and follow evacuation orders as necessary."
Queensland has entered another snap three-day lockdown in Cairns and Yarrabah after an ""unexpected"" case of COVID-19 was reported. The case involves a taxi driver from Kanimbla who was infectious in Far North Queensland for 10 days. Cairns and Yarrabah locals are being told to stay home unless shopping for essentials or seeking medical care, and masks are mandatory. As of the end of July 2021, Queensland had recorded the death of just 7 patients with Covid-19, with a fatality rate of just under 1 per million residents, the lowest not just in Australia but of any sizeable jurisdiction in the world. Throughout the pandemic, various restrictions had been put in place, including border closures and lockdowns, and some events had been cancelled, such as the Ekka agricultural show and the Big Pineapple Music Festival. The Queensland government also launched the ""Check in Qld"" QR code sign-in/contact tracing app in February 2021. Vaccinations are ongoing, with the first Queensland nurse receiving the vaccine in February."
Palau, a small island nation in the Western Pacific, has achieved herd immunity against COVID-19 as 80% of its population aged 12 and above have been fully vaccinated. This milestone comes just a few months after the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the country on May 31, 2021. Palau took swift action early on in the pandemic, implementing border controls and suspending travel from China, Macau, and Hong Kong as early as February 2020. By March, the country's borders were closed, and schools were shut in April. President Thomas Remengesau Jr. eventually suspended all travel to Palau. The country's efforts have paid off as it became one of the first nations in the world to reach herd immunity. According to the Ministry of Health, vaccination started on January 3, 2021, and by April 12, an estimated 40% of the population had received two doses of the vaccine. By May 26, an estimated 96% of adults (18 and over) in the country had been fully vaccinated, about 70% of all Palauans. Plans were also announced to start vaccinating adolescents from 12 to 17. With the vaccination campaign's success, the country has reopened its borders and resumed tourism, a major source of income for Palau. Plans to vaccinate teenagers are underway as Palau continues its efforts to protect its population from the virus. Palau's success in achieving herd immunity serves as an inspiration to other nations, especially those struggling to control the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, but with the right measures and determination, countries like Palau have proven that it is possible to overcome this global crisis."
Egypt and Russia have a long history of diplomatic relations dating back before the 16th century. Today, the two countries continue to strengthen their ties in various sectors, including military, trade, and tourism. As of August 2021, direct commercial flights between Russia and Egypt have resumed for the first time since the 2015 Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing, which killed mostly Russian tourists. A Rossiya Airlines plane carrying 518 passengers landed in Sharm El Sheikh, a popular tourist destination in Egypt, and was warmly welcomed with a water cannon salute, roses, and flags. Relations between the two countries have seen many ups and downs throughout history, including periods of close collaboration during the Gamal Abdel Nasser era and strained ties during Anwar Sadat's leadership. In recent years, however, the two nations have worked closely to strengthen their bilateral cooperation, particularly in the military and trade sectors. Russia has become one of Egypt's biggest suppliers of arms, accounting for 31% of major imports from 2009 to 2018. In addition to military and trade ties, Egypt and Russia have also collaborated in other sectors such as higher education.  In 2006, the Egyptian Russian University was opened in Badr City, Cairo, offering training in pharmacy and engineering. The two countries also share similar stances on various international issues such as their support for the Syrian government in the Syrian Civil War and the House of Representatives in the Libyan Civil War. In the summer of 2020, Egypt received five Su-35 jets from Russia, despite the threat of American sanctions. Despite occasional setbacks, the relationship between Egypt and Russia continues to evolve and strengthen, with both nations continuing to collaborate on various fronts."
Algeria continues to battle a total of 69 wildfires for the fourth consecutive day, with the death toll rising to 65 people, including 37 civilians and 28 soldiers. The wildfires started on 9 August 2021 in the Kabyle region and other areas, prompting Algerian authorities to send soldiers to assist with evacuations and contain the blazes. The fires have destroyed Mediterranean trees, olive trees, and killed cattle and chickens. Many distant villages have limited access to water, and some villagers tried to contain the flames with rudimentary tools. Despite the severity of the situation, firefighting aircraft were not available. President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has declared three days of national mourning to honor the wildfire victims."
Lebanon's ongoing financial crisis, which began in August 2019, continues to worsen with new developments. The crisis has been further exacerbated by both the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 Beirut port explosion. As of June 2021, the black market exchange rate has climbed up to 15,200 Lebanese pounds per US dollar due to acute USD shortages within Lebanon. The shortage of U.S. dollars and the crash in the value of the pound have led to a liquidity crisis that has affected foreign currency reserves. Banks have stopped giving short-term loans to businesses and no longer provide them with U.S. dollars for imports, forcing people to turn to the black markets. There is also significant inflation, causing a massive loss of purchasing power and an increase in poverty. The head of research at Bank Audi recently stated that Lebanese banks own $12.7 billion of the country's outstanding $30 billion Eurobonds as of January 2020. The debt to GDP ratio sits at 170% as of April 2020. The default is the first one in the history of the country. Foreign currency inflows have slowed, and Lebanon's sovereign debt became junk rated. On 1 June 2021, the World Bank released a report warning that the economic crisis in Lebanon risks becoming one of the three most severe since the mid-19th century if its ""bankrupt economic system, which benefited a few for so long"" wasn't reformed. In light of the crisis, the Central Bank of Lebanon recently announced that it will stop fuel subsidies and instead offer credit lines for fuel imports based on the market price for the Lebanese pound. This decision is expected to significantly increase fuel prices, further exacerbating the economic crisis in the country."
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has obtained the dissolution of the House of Commons for an election on September 20, 2021. The federal election will elect members of the House of Commons to the 44th Canadian Parliament. The fixed-date provisions of the Canada Elections Act determine that the latest possible date of the vote should be the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year after the polling day of the previous election. However, since the current government is a minority government, the election was called before the scheduled date by the Governor General of Canada due to a motion of no confidence in the government or at the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada for a snap election. The by-election in Haldimand-Norfolk was cancelled because of the election call. In the 2019 federal election, the Liberals, led by incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, lost their majority but won the most seats. The Conservatives continued as the Official Opposition with Andrew Scheer temporarily remaining as Leader of the Opposition until announcing his resignation, triggering a leadership election. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois became the third party, while the New Democrats lost seats but maintained official party status. Although the Greens increased their seats in the House of Commons, they ultimately failed to achieve the required number of MPs‚Äîtwelve‚Äîfor official party status. Following the 2019 federal election, all leaders initially announced that they would continue as the heads of their respective parties into the next session of Parliament. However, Elizabeth May said that she may not lead the Greens into the 44th election, and she ultimately resigned as Green Party leader on November 4, 2019. On November 6, 2019, the Conservative caucus decided not to adopt a measure that would have given them the ability to remove Andrew Scheer as leader. Although his leadership was still reviewed during the party's April 2020 convention, Scheer announced his intention to resign as leader on December 12, 2019. He stayed on until his successor, Erin O'Toole, was chosen and remains as MP for Regina‚ÄîQu'Appelle. The following MPs have announced that they would not be running in the next federal election: - Diane Finley, who had already announced in August 2020 that she would not run in the next election, resigned her seat in May 2021 as the MP for Haldimand‚ÄîNorfolk. - Jenica Atwin, the MP for Fredericton, left the Green caucus and joined the Liberals in June 2021, citing party infighting over the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. In June 2020, the Leaders' Debates Commission released its report reviewing the 2019 election debates and making recommendations for future debates. The report recommended a permanent and publicly funded commission be tasked with organizing two debates every future election. It also called for the commission, not the government, to set the criteria for participation in future election debates. As the election campaign begins, the current standings suggest that the Liberals hold a narrow lead over the Conservatives in the polls. However, the outcome of the election remains uncertain, and the campaign will likely be a closely contested race."
The Panjshir conflict is a political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban that began following the Fall of Kabul in 2021. As of August 2021, negotiations were ongoing to resolve the political impasse, and no military conflict had occurred in Panjshir Province. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which, as of August 2021, is the only region out of the Taliban's hands, according to The Week. Prior to Kabul's fall, the Panjshiri forces had been moving military equipment, including helicopters and armored vehicles, from the surrounding areas into Panjshir Province. They were later joined by commanders of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. On August 17, 2021, Amrullah Saleh declared himself the President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, citing provisions of the Afghan Constitution. He vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there, and his claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and the Afghan Minister of Defence, Bismillah Mohammadi. At around the same time, the remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Masoud. As of August 17, the Panjshir Valley was under siege on all sides, but had not been directly attacked. However, Russian intelligence sources recently reported that Panjshir resistance forces loyal to Amrullah Saleh had managed to re-capture Charikar and the surrounding areas of Parwan Province from the Taliban. The situation in Panjshir Province remains tense, and negotiations are ongoing to avoid any further military conflict."
The 2021 Niger attacks continue as gunmen opened fire on civilians praying at a mosque in southwestern Niger. The attack resulted in the death of 16 people. The series of attacks, mainly in the western region of TillabeÃÅri, which began in January, have left 439 people dead, and over 100 others injured, with most of the victims being civilians. These attacks mark the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. 2021 is the first year when attacks were carried out with such frequency in the country, and as of August, attacks were carried out every month. The gunmen who carried out the latest attack are yet to be identified, but they bear similarities with other Islamist militants who have carried out the previous attacks. The government has dispatched soldiers to the affected regions to help combat the crisis."
Operation Allies Refuge, the United States military operation to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, continues amid the American military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The mission's name was officially revealed on July 14 by the Biden administration, and as of August 22, the United States has evacuated around 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans, in the past few weeks, according to United States Army Major General William D. Taylor. The operation has been extended to August 31, and the United States has activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist with evacuation efforts, with 18 planes from various commercial airlines joining in. At least eight people died due to the chaotic situation at the Kabul International Airport, with some clinging to departing planes or being run over during the scramble. The Taliban has agreed to permit refugees to leave Afghanistan via the airport."
Operation Allies Refuge is an ongoing military mission led by the United States to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians, with a specific focus on interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants. The mission has also provided support to NATO and regional allies in their evacuations from the Kabul International Airport. The operation name was officially unveiled by the Biden administration on July 14. On July 30, the first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing. As of August 20, nearly 13,000 people had been evacuated from Afghanistan, including more than 5,000 U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and refugees, as well as nearly 2,000 Afghan interpreters. The United States activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) for the third time to help with evacuations, dispatching 18 planes that will be utilized by the military to evacuate American citizens. While the operation began as a part of the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan, it has since evolved into a critical humanitarian mission following the fall of the capital city, Kabul. The situation at the airport has become increasingly chaotic, with reports of tragic casualties, as thousands of people have attempted to board planes in desperate attempts to flee. Despite the ongoing challenges, the U.S. military has continued to operate round-the-clock evacuation flights to evacuate individuals from Afghanistan. The mission will continue in the coming days as the United States works to help as many Afghan citizens and others as possible leave the country before the August 31 deadline for withdrawal."
Operation Allies Refuge, the United States military operation to airlift at-risk Afghan civilians including interpreters, embassy employees, and Special Immigrant Visa applicants, continues as the country faces a Taliban takeover. The operation was officially named by the Biden administration on July 14 and began with the arrival of 200 Afghan interpreters at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing on July 30. As the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated in August, the deployment of U.S. troops to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants was announced on August 12. Following the fall of Kabul on August 15, the U.S. military expanded its presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops, with a C-17 cargo plane evacuating 823 people to Qatar on August 16. Since then, thousands of people have been evacuated on multiple flights from Kabul, with the Pentagon confirming on August 22 the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the effort. The network Fox News has also announced that it evacuated 24 people from Afghanistan, including three Afghan nationals who assisted with the network's coverage of the war. However, the operation has not been without casualties, with at least eight people killed at Kabul International Airport as people attempted to board planes, and two Afghan nationals among the casualties. The Taliban has agreed to terms for refugees to flee using the airport, with U.S. troops working to evacuate U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and refugees, as well as Afghan interpreters for SIV processing. The evacuation efforts are ongoing."
Operation Allies Refuge, the United States military operation aimed at evacuating at-risk Afghan civilians, such as interpreters, embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, continues amidst the bigger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan. Recently, U.S. President Joe Biden has announced that American troops may remain in Afghanistan beyond the August 31 deadline. He also revealed that the past 36 hours have seen the evacuation of 11,000 people from the country, with over 17,000 people evacuated in the past few weeks, including 2,500 Americans. The operation's name was officially unveiled on July 14, and on July 30, the first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing. The situation prompted the Biden administration to announce that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to the Kabul International Airport to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. The military presence at the airport was later expanded to nearly 6,000 troops, with U.S. military taking control over air traffic on August 15. Since then, there have been numerous flights and evacuations, including 16 flights on August 20 alone, and the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation. Unfortunately, the chaos at the Kabul International Airport resulted in the deaths of at least eight people, and the Pentagon confirmed that two armed men who fired into a crowd were killed by U.S. troops. In summary, Operation Allies Refuge remains an ongoing effort to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians amidst the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan."
The Panjshir conflict, which began on August 17, 2021, is an ongoing conflict between the Taliban-controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance. The Panjshir Valley, largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and home to a majority Tajik population, remains the only region currently out of the Taliban's hands. Amidst this conflict, Ahmad Massoud, leading the Panjshir resistance along with self-proclaimed acting president Amrullah Saleh, has declared war ""unavoidable"" if the Taliban refuse dialogue on forming a comprehensive government and refuses to surrender the Panjshir Valley. Reports suggest that Massoud's forces have gathered upwards of 9,000 fighters and have access to helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. The Panjshir resistance has also reportedly played a role in the recapture of Andarab, Puli Hisar, and Dih Salah districts in Baghlan Province and is seeking to seize a northern highway to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. However, there remain differences between the forces loyal to Saleh, who is anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, and those loyal to Massoud, who previously maintained good relations with Pakistan in support of the Taliban but is now more willing to negotiate with them. Attempts have been made to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, including Saleh's call for a ""peace deal"" with the Taliban and the possibility of including them in a coalition government as a means of diffusing the stalemate. However, as of August 2021, war remains the likely outcome if talks fail. The USA and Western forces have been criticized for their low level of support for the resistance, with Massoud penning an op-ed in the Washington Post requesting greater Western support, suggesting a lack of direct communication and coordination between the resistance and the US government. Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan has reportedly been asked to mediate talks between the Taliban and Panjshir-based leaders."
Operation Allies Refuge, the United States military operation to airlift at-risk Afghan civilians from Afghanistan, continues amid ongoing violence at the Kabul airport. On August 26, a security guard was killed and three others were wounded in a gunfight involving an unknown gunman and Afghan forces at the airport's north gate. German and American forces were also involved in the shooting. The operation, which was officially unveiled by the Biden administration on July 14, aims to evacuate interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants. The first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia for SIV processing on July 30, with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants remaining in the relocation process. The Biden administration announced that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to Kabul International Airport on August 12 to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. As of August 22, President Joe Biden reported that 11,000 people had been evacuated in the past 36 hours, and by August 26, the operation had evacuated over 88,000 people from Afghanistan. The Department of Defense also ordered the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet on August 22 to assist in the evacuation. However, the operation has been marred by violence and chaos, with at least eight people killed at the Kabul airport as thousands of people have tried to forcibly board planes. The United States has pledged to continue its evacuation efforts despite the ongoing unrest."
The year 2021 has seen an unprecedented wave of violence in Niger, with militants carrying out regular attacks on civilians and soldiers in various regions of the country. The attacks have left over 500 people dead and more than 100 injured, making this the deadliest year in Niger since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. One of the most recent attacks occurred in August, when gunmen on motorbikes stormed the village of Darey-Daye, killing 37 people, including 14 children. Another attack in August targeted a mosque in the village of Theim, killing 16 people who were praying. The previous month, Islamist militants ambushed and opened fire on a group of soldiers in Torodi, killing 15 soldiers and leaving six more missing. In May, Boko Haram militants carried out a brazen raid on the town of Diffa, killing four civilians and four soldiers. Responding security forces pushed back the attackers, killing six of them in a prolonged gunfight. However, in another attack in May, militants stormed the village of Fantio during Eid al-Fitr celebrations, killing five villagers and wounding two others. The deadliest attack of the year so far occurred in March, when militants riding motorbikes attacked three villages in the Tahoua Region close to the Malian border, killing 137 people. This was the deadliest attack committed by suspected jihadists in Niger's history. On the same day, armed men on motorcycles attacked a convoy returning from a market in Banibangou by the Malian border, killing 58 people. These attacks follow a pattern that began earlier in the year when two villages were attacked in January, resulting in the deaths of 105 people. While the exact terrorist organization responsible for the attacks is not entirely clear, the attackers are known to be Islamist militants who crossed the border from Mali. As a result of the violence, the government of Niger dispatched soldiers to the border and declared three days of national mourning. Newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum has condemned the attacks, but the situation remains tense as the violence continues to escalate."
On August 26, 2021, two suicide bombings took place near different gates of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. The attacks occurred amid the ongoing evacuation of Afghanistan, following the Taliban's takeover on August 15. The first bomb went off at Abbey Gate, one of the airport's entrances, where a suicide bomber detonated his explosive, killing at least 90 Afghan civilians and 13 American servicemembers. The second blast happened at Baron Gate, close to a hotel where American citizens seeking evacuation gathered. ISIL-KP, an offshoot of the Islamic State group, claimed responsibility for the attacks. The group had issued threats against the airport in recent days, and warnings from western nations had led to heightened security at the site. The attack came hours after the United States State Department urged Americans outside the airport to leave Kabul because of a terrorist threat. In the aftermath of the bombings, over 150 people were wounded, including Taliban members and foreign soldiers. The death toll is expected to rise, with many injured people in critical condition. The incident has been described as one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul in recent years. The international community has condemned the attacks, and the United States, along with its allies, has vowed to continue the evacuation efforts despite the danger. Over 100,000 people, including American citizens, Afghan refugees, and foreign nationals, have been evacuated from Kabul since August 14. The bombings have further increased tensions in Afghanistan, and leaders are calling for calm and unity to prevent further violence. The Taliban, who control the country, have condemned the bombings and promised to investigate the attacks. The situation in Afghanistan remains tense and unpredictable as the country transitions under new leadership."
In the wake of the Taliban's return to power and their proclamation of re-establishing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the United States has carried out another drone strike in the country. The airstrike took place in Nangarhar province and targeted two members of the Islamic State militant group, killing them both and injuring a third individual. According to reports, one of those killed was involved in planning further attacks on Kabul, including the recent bombing at the Kabul airport that killed over 100 people, many of them civilians. The strike was carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper drone with guided munitions in order to minimize the risk of civilian casualties. The United States has stated that it will continue to use targeted strikes against those who pose a threat to its security interests in the region."
On August 26, 2021, a suicide bombing rocked the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, claiming the lives of 182 people and injuring 150 others. Among the victims were 13 American service members and 169 Afghan civilians, including two British dual-nationals and the child of a British national. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ‚Äì Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) claimed responsibility for the attack. Following the tragedy, US President Joe Biden vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice and continue evacuation efforts. The Taliban, despite being enemies of ISIL-KP, condemned the attack and promised to pursue its leaders. Recently, the United States launched an airstrike against ISIL-KP members in Nangarhar Province. The strike, carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper drone, killed two militants and wounded a third, who was reportedly planning more attacks in Kabul. The attack followed warnings of a potential second suicide bombing, which US officials have been working to prevent. Despite the ongoing chaos and conflict in Afghanistan, countries around the world have expressed their solidarity with the victims and troops carrying out evacuation efforts. The situation remains tense, as the US works to evacuate people from the country and prevent further harm."
Relations between the United States and the Taliban-controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan were unofficially established on August 15, 2021, after the fall of Kabul. The US does not formally recognize the Taliban as the government, but has expressed willingness to do so if the Taliban respects basic human rights. On August 27, the Taliban appointed Khalil Haqqani, a US-designated terrorist with a $5 million bounty on his head, as head of security in Kabul. The Taliban condemned the August 26 airport attack that killed over 100 people and pledged to capture the ISIS-K leader responsible for the attack. The US retaliated with an airstrike on August 27 that killed two ISIS-K planners and facilitators. In response, the Taliban spokesperson denounced the airstrike as a ""clear attack on Afghan territory."""
Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan and declared the re-establishment of the Islamic Emirate, the country has witnessed several airstrikes. The latest incident happened when a U.S. drone targeted a vehicle driven by an aid worker for the U.S. based Nutrition and Education International. The attack resulted in the deaths of at least ten people, including seven children. Some of the victims had previously worked for international organizations and held visas permitting them to enter the United States. The U.S. said that the strike targeted an ISIS-K suicide bomber and accomplices. However, there are reports of other civilian casualties, with most of the victims being residents of the area. This incident is the second known drone strike since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021. Earlier, in August, the United States launched an airstrike targeting an ISIS-K member in Nangarhar Province, killing two high-profiled members and injuring another militant. This attack came a day after the 2021 Kabul airport attack that resulted in the deaths of over 180 people. The drone strikes in Afghanistan have sparked widespread condemnation and calls for investigations into civilian casualties. The situation remains tense as the country braces for further instability under the Taliban's rule."
The Panjshir conflict has entered a critical phase as the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan claims their fighters have killed eight Taliban members in clashes in the valley. The Panjshir Valley has remained the sole region out of Taliban control since the Fall of Kabul on 15 August 2021. The Taliban has deployed a large number of forces near the valley, while negotiations are underway to resolve the conflict. The valley is predominantly inhabited by ethnic Tajiks, who have been resisting Taliban rule. The resistance forces reportedly regrouped in the area after the fall of Kabul, and are estimated to have about 7,000 personnel under arms. Ahmad Massoud, the son of legendary Afghan commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, is a prominent leader of the resistance forces. The Taliban, who have seized control of Afghanistan, have been engaging in talks with the resistance forces to resolve the conflict peacefully. The international community, including the United States, has been focused on evacuating Kabul and securing the cooperation of the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation. Despite the negotiations, clashes have continued in the Panjshir Valley, with the latest report of eight Taliban members being killed in clashes. The National Resistance Front has vowed to resist Taliban rule and seek a decentralized government that respects civil and semi-autonomy rights. The conflict has caught the attention of regional stakeholders, with Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan volunteering to fight against the Taliban. The Russian Embassy in Afghanistan has reportedly been asked by a Taliban representative to mediate, while the international community remains cautious in showing support for the Panjshir-based resistance."
The Panjshir conflict, which began on 17 August 2021 between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's National Resistance Front and the Taliban-led Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, has escalated as the Taliban entered the Panjshir Valley and clashed with resistance forces under Ahmad Massoud. Both sides reported heavy casualties and the Taliban claimed to have gained some territory. While talks had been underway, attempts at reaching a negotiated settlement failed on 1 September 2021. The conflict has triggered volunteers from the Kulob region of Tajikistan to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials. The international community has not expressed public support for the resistance as countries prioritize the ongoing evacuation of Kabul."
Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation to airlift at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan. It was concurrent with the withdrawal of American military forces from the country, and as such, U.S. personnel aided NATO and regional allies in their respective evacuation efforts from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. SIV applicants were airlifted to the United States, where they were temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their SIV requirements. The operation's name was unveiled by the Biden administration on July 14, 2021. On July 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs (ALLIES) Act, which increased the visa cap for Afghan interpreters and expedited the Afghan SIV process. The first group of 221 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing on July 30, with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants still to be moved from Afghanistan. Following continued Taliban victories across Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced on August 12 that it would deploy 3,000 U.S. troops to Hamid Karzai International Airport to help evacuate embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. On August 13, a vanguard of troops arrived in Kabul, with an infantry brigade from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division on standby in Kuwait. Another 1,000 Air Force and Army personnel were to deploy in Qatar to process SIV applicants. Meanwhile, U.S. embassy staff in Kabul were destroying sensitive materials and items featuring embassy logos or U.S. flags, standard procedure during a drawdown. Helicopters shuttled people between the embassy compound and Kabul International Airport. Following the fall of Kabul on August 15 and the chaotic scenes of Afghans attempting to force themselves aboard military planes, the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. Operation Allies Refuge became concurrent with a new effort to airlift all SIV applicants, embassy personnel, American nationals, and eligible Afghans seeking to flee the country. As of August 27, the U.S. announced that it is opening military bases to hold up to 5,000 Afghan nationals who are applying for Special Immigration Visa (SIV) or deemed to be ""at risk."" U.S. is opening up Marine Corps Base Quantico, Fort Pickett, Fort Lee, Fort McCoy, Fort Bliss, Joint Base McGuire-Dix, and Holloman Air Force Base to provide housing and support for the Afghans. White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain has stated that around 100 Americans remain in Afghanistan following the August 31 withdrawal deadline, and the Biden administration will still try to rescue them. On September 2, a nine-month-old baby died after arriving at Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania, making her the first death of an evacuee on American soil."
At approximately 8:47 p.m. local time on September 7, a powerful 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit just outside the popular tourist destination of Acapulco in Guerrero, Mexico, leaving more than 1.6 million residents without power and causing damage to numerous buildings. According to initial reports, at least one person was killed when a pole fell in Coyuca de Ben√≠tez. The earthquake occurred on the anniversary of the deadly 2017 Chiapas earthquake, which measured at 8.2 on the Mw scale and claimed the lives of over 100 people. The U.S. Geological Survey describes earthquakes of this size as having a rupture size of approximately 40x20 km. The earthquake appears to have been caused by thrust faulting and occurred on or near the boundary between the Caribbean Plate and the Cocos Plate, in a seismic gap dubbed the Guerrero Gap. This area has the potential to generate a magnitude 8.0 earthquake, which could have devastating consequences. In Acapulco, where the epicenter was located just 3 km away, there were numerous reports of buildings shaking and sustaining damage, as well as gas leaks and power outages. In addition to the earthquake, a small tsunami measuring 1.2 feet (0.37 meters) was recorded in Acapulco. While the mayor of Acapulco, Adela RomaÃÅn, urged residents to remain calm while the situation is being assessed, the earthquake serves as a reminder of the potential dangers that lurk along Mexico's Pacific coast."
Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation to airlift Afghan civilians at risk, especially interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan to safety. This operation was conducted along with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans. SIV applicants were temporarily housed in the United States by the U.S. military to complete their SIV requirements. The Biden administration unveiled the operation's name on July 14, 2021, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs (ALLIES) Act on July 22 to expedite the Afghan SIV process and increase the visa cap for Afghan interpreters. The operation involved multiple airlifts and evacuations, including the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. The situation became chaotic following the Taliban's conquest of Afghanistan and their takeover of the capital city Kabul. The operation culminated with the evacuation of over 120,000 individuals, including Americans and Afghan nationals, from the country.  On September 7, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the U.S. had evacuated 124,334 people from Afghanistan, including 6,000 Americans. Blinken also disclosed that 21 Americans had been evacuated from Afghanistan, including private citizens and U.S. citizens who had been in Afghanistan for different reasons. The U.S. government is currently working on a plan to evacuate approximately 100 Americans still stranded in Afghanistan. The operation was marred by devastating attacks by ISIS-K, the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State group. The August 26 suicide bombing at Kabul airport resulted in the deaths of at least 182 people, including 13 U.S. service members and three British citizens. In total, at least 195 people lost their lives in stampedes, gun incidents, and in attempts to board planes forcibly. A nine-month-old baby died on September 2, becoming the first evacuee to die on American soil. Despite the challenges, Operation Allies Refuge succeeded in evacuating tens of thousands of at-risk Afghan nationals and Americans to safety."
Since January 2001, the United States government has conducted multiple drone strikes in Afghanistan resulting in over 13,000 airstrikes and at least 4,138 deaths, including 310 civilians and 73 children. During the presidency of Donald Trump, the frequency of drone strikes increased significantly, and the order initiated by President Obama requiring the CIA to report civilian drone strike deaths was revoked. On August 29, 2021, a drone strike conducted by the U.S. military near Kabul International Airport was initially believed to have killed ISIL-K militants. However, Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. has since acknowledged that the strike killed 10 civilians instead. The United States government has received criticism for the high number of civilian casualties resulting from drone strikes, with Amnesty International USA questioning their legality."
On September 18, 2021, a rally was held near the United States Capitol to show support for the individuals arrested and charged for their involvement in the January 6 riot. The event, called Justice for J6, was organized by Look Ahead America, a non-profit led by former Trump campaign staff member Matt Braynard. Amid concerns of violence, a fence was installed outside the Capitol, and the Metropolitan Police Department was activated for the rally. Several congressional offices were also closed in preparation for the event. Though there were initially discussions about restoring the fencing, they were met with bipartisan disapproval. In response, a counter-rally was scheduled on the same day, heightening tensions and fears of clashes between participants of both events. The Department of Homeland Security shared an intelligence briefing memo warning of potential violence at the rally and the day before. Braynard downplayed the estimated size of the rally and criticized the security measures taken. Former U.S President Donald Trump called it a ""setup"" for Republican voters, urging them not to allow the lack of participants to be used against them. On social media, far-right groups like the Proud Boys urged members not to attend. Despite the concerns and preparations, only around 400 to 450 people attended the rally. Four individuals were arrested, with one found in possession of a knife and another with a gun.  Overall, the Justice for J6 rally was a small gathering centered on expressing solidarity with the arrested individuals. Despite earlier concerns, the event remained peaceful, with law enforcement officials largely successful in keeping the situation under control."
On September 19, 2021, a disturbance was reported at a residential property on Chandos Crescent in Killamarsh, Derbyshire. Upon arrival, police officers discovered the bodies of three children and one adult inside, and the incident was treated as a suspected mass murder.

After multiple delays, Qatar held its first-ever general elections on October 2, 2021, to elect 30 members of the Consultative Assembly. The elections were originally scheduled to take place in the second half of 2013 but were postponed several times, with Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani finally pledging to hold them in November 2020. The electoral law was approved on July 29, 2021, which mandates that members will be elected from single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting. A total of 284 candidates contested the 30 seats, with 29 women running under the provision that any Qatari above the age of 18 is eligible to vote. Political parties are banned, and all candidates ran as independents. Recently, Qatar has seen major strides towards modernization under the Young Emir, from hosting the World Cup 2022, to lifting restrictions on women such as those who wish to travel, own and run businesses. The event served as another step towards democratizing the country."
On October 3, 2021, a Pilatus PC-12 plane crashed into an empty building in San Donato Milanese, Lombardy, Italy, resulting in the deaths of all eight people on board.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has shaken the world of finance once again with the announcement of the Pandora Papers leak. This unprecedented haul of 11.9 million documents, published on October 3, 2021, exposes hidden wealth, tax evasion, and money laundering among 330 politicians, including 35 national leaders. The documents also implicate numerous celebrities worldwide, including 130 billionaires, and reveal 29,000 beneficiaries among 27,000 companies. The Pandora Papers are now the largest offshore data leak in history, surpassing the Panama Papers by nearly half a million documents. The ICIJ's most recent exposeÃÅ of financial secrecy provides a remarkable insight into the world of high-stakes offshore finance. The first leaks on October 3, 2021, reveal over 100 billionaires, 30 current and former leaders, and 300 public officials. Notably, former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was uncovered to have saved ¬£312,000 in Stamp Duty on the purchase of a ¬£6.45 million property in London by purchasing Romanstone International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company. Though not illegal, the revelations further highlight the extent to which wealthy individuals use offshore companies to reduce their tax liabilities. The Pandora Papers' revelations will continue to unfold over the following weeks and months, with the ICIJ promising a deeper insight into the world of offshore finance."
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has released the largest offshore data leak in history, comprising 11.9 million leaked documents revealing hidden wealth, tax evasion, and money laundering by 29,000 beneficiaries among 27,000 companies. The Pandora Papers expose wrongdoing among 330 politicians, including 35 national leaders, and numerous celebrities, including 130 billionaires. The data leak surpasses the Panama Papers in volume by nearly half a million documents. The documents were obtained from 14 offshore service providers that facilitate clients in establishing companies in secrecy jurisdictions, including Panama, Switzerland, and the UAE. The ICIJ worked with journalists in 117 countries to investigate and report on this expos√©. Among the names mentioned in the papers are former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Chilean President SebastiaÃÅn PinÃÉera, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Montenegrin President Milo ƒêukanovicÃÅ, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim, Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba, and Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso. Other global names include Shakira, model Claudia Schiffer, Indian cricket player Sachin Tendulkar, Alexandre Cazes, founder of the dark web site AlphaBay, and Channel One Russia CEO Konstantin Ernst. An ICIJ report focused on the Panamanian law firm AlemaÃÅn, Cordero, Galindo & Lee, or Alcogal, saying it created at least 14,000 shell companies and trusts in tax havens, making it the ""law firm of the Latin American elite"" mentioned more than any other offshore provider in the leaked documents. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan stated that all citizens mentioned in the Pandora Papers would be investigated and appropriate action taken in case of wrongdoing."
A prolonged outage of Facebook and its subsidiaries, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus, began on October 4, 2021, around 15:39 UTC. According to reports, a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) update from Facebook may have triggered the issue.

An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 struck the Balochistan province of Pakistan near the city of Harnai on October 7, 2021, killing at least 24 people and injuring around 200 others. The earthquake occurred during the rupture of a thrust fault under the Sulaiman Mountains and Central BraÃÑhui Range, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and was followed by a magnitude 4.6 aftershock. The quake is the largest to hit Pakistan since a major tremor in 2013 that occurred nearby. The Balochistan province is situated at a highly oblique convergence between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. This convergence involves the Chaman Fault, a strike-slip structure, and many thrust faults. The 2005 Kashmir earthquake, which killed 87,000 people, occurred near the vicinity of the Main Himalayan Thrust, which also accommodates north-south continental collision. The earthquake struck early in the morning, collapsing many homes where residents were sleeping. Most of the 24 people who died were women and children. An unspecified number of residents were buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings but were rescued by survivors. At least 70 homes in the Harnai District and Shahrag area were affected, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) (PDMA), while damage was also reported in the cities of Sibi and Quetta. In the aftermath of the earthquake, troops from the Pakistan Army were dispatched to Harnai to aid in rescue and relief operations. Nine injured victims were transported via helicopters from the affected region to Quetta for medical treatment. The Inter-Services Public Relations, army, medical personnel, response workers, and officials are working together to coordinate the rescue and relief efforts. Search and rescue teams from Rawalpindi were sent to Harnai to find survivors among the wreckage."
A shooting rampage in Kongsberg, Viken, Norway, has left five people dead and two others injured. The suspect used a bow and arrow to attack people on the streets of the town, located about 70 kilometers (43 miles) west of Oslo. The attacker targeted people at multiple locations before being apprehended by authorities. The motive for the attack is still unclear. Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the incident."
In a shocking incident on 13th October 2021, a Norwegian man identified as 37-year-old Espen Andersen BraÃäthen, who converted to Islam and held Danish citizenship, carried out a spree shooting in Kongsberg, Viken, Norway, killing five people and injuring three others. The suspect was in police custody after the attack. It was reported that the police had been concerned about him regarding his possible radicalization, and he had several prior criminal convictions for break-ins, cannabis possession, and threats against family members. The attack was the deadliest in Norway since the 2011 attacks by Anders Behring Breivik, which killed 77 people. The authorities had launched a terrorism investigation following the attack. The constables were ordered to carry firearms nationwide temporarily after the attack, and the national threat level remained unchanged. A day after the incident, flags were flown half-mast on all public buildings, and candles were lit on the steps of Kongsberg Church to honor the victims."
At least 65 people were killed and over 70 others were injured in a suicide bombing at the Imam Bargah mosque in Kandahar, Afghanistan on October 15, 2021. The attack targeted the Shia mosque during Friday prayers and was claimed by the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP) in a statement released by the group's media wing, Amaq. This bombing came just a week after another attack at a Shia mosque in Kunduz, which killed more than 50 people and was also claimed by IS-KP. In response to the attacks, the Taliban has pledged to increase security measures at Shia mosques. The militant group has taken control of Afghanistan following the collapse of the government and the withdrawal of US forces earlier this year. The Taliban have been holding talks with various groups, including the Afghan Shia community, to form a new government and prevent further violence. However, the recent attacks highlight the ongoing security challenges facing the country."
The killing of British Conservative Party MP Sir David Amess on 15 October 2021 at a constituency meeting in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, has been declared by police as a terrorist incident. Amess, a long-serving politician and committed social conservative, was stabbed to death by a 25-year-old man during a surgery with constituents, sparking shock and outrage across the UK. Following the attack, Essex Police arrested the suspect, recovered a knife, and launched a counter-terrorism investigation given the attacker's reported Somali heritage. A vigil was held in Amess's Southend West constituency to pay respects, while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a review of security measures for MPs. The killing has renewed concerns about political violence in the UK, particularly social media-fueled threats, and has been widely condemned by political leaders and the public alike."
A series of protests by the Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government, triggered by the government's decision to ban Serbian license plates, ended on 2 October 2021. The ban has since been lifted, following an agreement reached on 30 September 2021 that led to the removal of barricades set up by the protesters and the withdrawal of Kosovar special police ROSU. A working group composed of negotiators from the governments of Kosovo and Serbia will also meet in Brussels on 21 October 2021 to find a permanent solution to the license plate issue in accordance with EU standards. The protests had consisted mostly of blocking traffic near border crossings, where local Serbs had been protesting daily against the ban. The ban intended to mirror the former ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia and would have impacted around 9,500 vehicles with Serbian license plates in North Kosovo which would have had to switch to permanent Kosovar license plates, as well as invalidating the Kosovar license plates used by some vehicles in Kosovo. The relations between Serbia and Kosovo, which had been improving, have worsened due to the protests, prompting Serbian authorities to raise the combat readiness of the Serbian Armed Forces on the border with Kosovo, and the deployment of Russian air defense forces to Serbia for joint military exercises. Meanwhile, Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti accused Serbia of ""inciting and supporting"" the attacks on government buildings, while international powers have called for de-escalation. North Kosovo has been largely opposed to an independent Kosovo, it has not recognized the Government of Kosovo and has acted independently of it until the 2013 Brussels Agreement. The Community of Serb Municipalities, a self-governing association of municipalities with a Serbian majority in Kosovo, was to be formed according to the agreement by 2016 but has not yet formed. The Constitutional Court of Kosovo declared some parts of the agreement to be unconstitutional. The lifting of the ban on license plates marks a significant development in the relations between Serbia and Kosovo, and the meeting of the working group in Brussels provides hope for a more permanent solution to the long-standing issue."
Sir David Amess, a long-serving British Conservative Party politician and Member of Parliament for Southend West, was stabbed to death on October 15, 2021, during a political surgery at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Ali Harbi Ali, a 25-year-old British citizen of Somali heritage, was quickly arrested at the scene and later charged with murder and the preparation of terrorist acts. Following the attack, police launched an investigation and counter-terrorism officers were involved in the early stages of the probe. On October 21, 2021, Ali was charged with the murder of Amess and the preparation of terrorist acts. Further updates have confirmed that Ali Harbi Ali has appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court and the Old Bailey and has been remanded to Belmarsh prison. He is due to stand trial on March 7, 2022. In the wake of Amess's killing, a by-election has been triggered to fill his former seat. Politicians from across the spectrum have expressed their condolences and paid tribute to Amess's political and public service. A vigil was held in his Southend West constituency, and a service of remembrance was held by MPs at St Margaret's Church, Westminster. As a way of honouring Amess's memory, the Queen has agreed to award Southend-on-Sea city status, a topic that Amess had frequently spoken on in Parliament. The safety of MPs, particularly during open, public constituency surgeries, has been debated, and calls have been made to enact a law to crack down on online targeting of MPs, end anonymity, and ensure access for Catholic priests to crime scenes to administer the last rites."
Solar cycle 25, the current solar cycle pattern of sunspot activity, began in December 2019 with a smoothed minimum sunspot number of 1.8 and is expected to continue until around 2030. While predictions regarding the strength of cycle 25 have varied widely, the Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel forecasted in December 2019 that it would be similar to solar cycle 24, with the number of sunspots reaching a (smoothed) maximum of 115 in July 2025 (¬± 8 months). As of April 2018, the Sun showed signs of a reverse magnetic polarity sunspot appearing, marking the beginning of this solar cycle. The onset of cycle 25 was further signaled by two reversed polarity sunspots that appeared in November 2019, according to Nandy et al.'s analysis of the polarity orientation of bipolar magnetic regions observed in December 2019. More recently, an X-class solar flare, the second of the current solar cycle, erupted, and an associated coronal mass ejection may cause bright aurorae and interfere with satellite communications as it grazes Earth on October 30 or 31. Flares have been taking place on a near-daily basis since October, marking a sharp increase in solar activity. In May 2021, the first C-class solar flares of Solar Cycle 25 took place, followed by the first M-class flare."

The death toll of the 360 Degrees Towers collapse, a high-rise building under construction in Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria has risen to 22, as the search-and-rescue operations continue for a third day. The privately commissioned 21-story luxury residential building, one of the three buildings in the development project, collapsed on November 1, 2021. The Lagos State Building Control Agency had approved only 15 floors, but the building exceeded this authorization. Femi Osibona (aka Olufemi Adegoke Osibona), the head of United Kingdom-based private development company Fourscore Homes, who commissioned the building, was reportedly inside the building when the collapse occurred and is missing. The rescue effort is ongoing, supervised by the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, with the military scheduled to take over operations. The Lagos State government has suspended the chief architect involved in the project and arrested the owner of the building. Gbolahan Oki, the general manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, has confirmed that the owner would be prosecuted as part of the ongoing investigation into the disaster.

On November 2, 2021, the gubernatorial election was held in New Jersey, with incumbent Democratic Governor Phil Murphy seeking re-election to a second term. Murphy ran unopposed in the Democratic primaries after his two challengers were disqualified. Meanwhile, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli emerged victorious in the GOP primaries, defeating several contenders. On Election Day, Murphy won his bid for re-election, defeating Ciattarelli in a closely watched race. With his victory, Murphy becomes the first Democrat to win re-election as governor since Brendan Byrne in 1977. As governor, Murphy has focused on issues such as healthcare, education, and social justice reform. The 2021 New Jersey gubernatorial election saw the lowest number of candidates on the ballot since 1953. In addition to Murphy and Ciattarelli, three third-party candidates also ran: Libertarian nominee Gregg Mele, Green nominee Madelyn Hoffman, and Socialist Workers Party nominee Joanne Kuniansky. Despite the third-party candidates being ineligible to participate in debates sponsored by the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, the New Jersey Globe held a debate for third-party Lieutenant Governor candidates on October 11, 2021. Incumbent Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver, who has served with Governor Murphy since 2018, was re-elected. Overall, the 2021 New Jersey gubernatorial election was closely watched as a bellwether for potential shifts in the Garden State's political landscape. With Murphy's victory, Democrats will maintain control of the governor's office in New Jersey for another term."
A total of 36 people have been confirmed dead in the collapse of a high-rise block of flats in Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, on November 1, 2021. The building was in the process of being built by Fourscore Homes, a United Kingdom registered company headed by Nigerian developer Femi Osibona. The trio of buildings known as ""360 Degrees Towers"" included a 21-story luxury residential high-rise tower, which consultancy firm Prowess Engineering Limited had withdrawn from in February 2020, citing concerns regarding the integrity of the building as only 15 floors had been approved by the Lagos State Building Control Agency. The collapse occurred in one of the three buildings, a 21-story tower, and at least 40 workers were on site at the time. Efforts to rescue victims are ongoing, with only nine people having been rescued so far. The Lagos State Government has suspended the chief architect, arrested the building owner, and launched an independent investigation panel that will have 30 days to submit its findings. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said the search for more survivors would continue."
A devastating explosion caused by a fuel tanker colliding with a truck in the Wellington suburb outside Choithram Supermarket in Freetown, Sierra Leone, has resulted in the deaths of over 99 people with more than 100 injured. The incident, which occurred on November 5, 2021, also caused nearby shops and markets to catch fire after fuel spilled over the streets. Reports state that a bus full of people was ""completely"" burnt. According to sources, people had flocked to collect the fuel from the leaking vehicle, which led to the fuel igniting and causing the explosion. Freetown, a port city with a population of over 1 million people, has faced several disasters in the past. In 2017, heavy rains triggered mudslides that claimed the lives of more than 1000 people. Moreover, in March of 2021, a major fire in one of the city's slums left 80 injured and more than 5000 people displaced. As of now, the mortuary at Connaught Hospital has received 92 bodies, and the injured have been transferred to hospitals, with many in critical condition. A staff member of Connaught Hospital's intensive care unit has reported that around 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive. President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, has offered his condolences and promised support to the victims' families. Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh also visited two hospitals to assess the situation. Journalist Omar Fofana has reported that hospital services have been stretched due to the high number of casualties. Mohamed Lamrane Bah, director of the NMDA, confirmed that rescue efforts had ended, and the bodies had been collected. Investigations are currently underway to determine the cause of the accident."
The incident occurred during the festival's first night, on November 5, 2021. The festival was operated by rapper Travis Scott, and approximately 50,000 people were in attendance. The cause of death is still under investigation. Twenty-three people were hospitalized, and over 300 people were treated for injuries at the festival's field hospital. The Houston Fire Department had 55 in-service units present at the festival, including 367 police officers and 241 security officers. Earlier on November 5, hundreds of fans surged at the festival's perimeter in an attempt to get in, knocking over metal detectors. Scott's performance was live streamed on Apple Music. The appearance of Scott on the stage led people to push towards the stage en masse, leading to a crush. At least eight people died, ranging from the ages of 16 to 23. Twenty-three others were evacuated to local hospitals, including eleven people found in a state of cardiac arrest. Drug overdose is being investigated as a potential cause of cardiac arrest. As a result, the second night on November 6 was canceled. A reunification center was set up for families searching for relatives. Travis Scott has stated he would support the incident's investigation and that he wants to help heal the Houston community.
Syria and the United Arab Emirates are rekindling their relations after a decade of strain caused by the Syrian Civil War. Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to discuss cooperation in various sectors. This is the first time both leaders have met since the conflict erupted. The UAE has an embassy in Damascus, while Syria has an embassy in Abu Dhabi and a consulate-general in Dubai. Despite the political differences that arose during the war, both countries retain strong cultural ties."
At least 115 people have been reported dead following a fuel tanker explosion in Freetown, Sierra Leone on 5 November 2021. The incident occurred when the tanker collided with a lorry in the Wellington area, which resulted in a fuel leakage. Locals attempted to collect the fuel in containers, leading to an explosion and fire that engulfed vehicles and trapped victims, with many burned beyond recognition. Over 100 people have been reported injured, and the city‚Äôs medical services have been overwhelmed. The death toll rose from 101 to 115 in the days following the disaster. The incident is the latest in a series of high-casualty fuel tanker explosions across sub-Saharan Africa, which often occur due to the dangerous practice of collecting fuel spills by residents. President Julius Maada Bio offered condolences and support to the victims and their families."
Israel's COVID-19 vaccination programme, known as ""Give a Shoulder"" (Hebrew: ◊ú◊™◊™ ◊õ◊™◊£), has been highly successful in vaccinating its population. As of June 26, 2021, about 64% of eligible Israelis have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 60% have received both doses, making Israel one of the populations with the highest vaccination rates per capita in the world. The programme's success is attributed to the country's centralized health system, coordinated vaccination drives, and early agreements with vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer and Moderna. Israel's vaccination programme has also undergone significant developments since its inception. On 29 July 2021, Israel's Prime Minister announced the rollout of a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to people over 60, based on data suggesting significant waning of immunity from infection over time after two doses. Subsequently, the country expanded eligibility for the booster shot to all Israelis over the age of 12, five months after their second shot. Moreover, Israel's pandemic advisory board approved the usage of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old, indicating the country's intentions to vaccinate even more of its population. However, the country has faced challenges in distributing its vaccines, particularly to Palestinians. Distribution problems included scheduling issues, loosely interpreted eligibility criteria, and inadequate distribution to less-populated villages and Arab-Israeli communities. Additionally, vaccine hesitancy in the general population and pockets of hesitancy among young adults and religious/cultural minority groups hindered progress. Furthermore, the vaccination programme did not cover all Palestinians, prompting the United Nations and Amnesty International to call for more support. Despite obstacles, Israel's vaccination programme remains one of the most successful in the world, with the country surpassing 60% fully vaccinated and making progress towards vaccinating its population under 12 years old."
On 14 November 2021, a terrorist incident occurred when an improvised explosive device carried by a man of Middle Eastern origin exploded inside a taxi in the car park outside the main entrance of the Liverpool Women's Hospital, killing the passenger and injuring the driver. Mayor Joanne Anderson has since revealed that the driver, David Perry, realized that the passenger was wearing an explosive device and locked him inside the taxi before the explosion. Perry sustained injuries but was released from the hospital the next day. Merseyside Police arrived at the scene, accompanied by fire and ambulance crews, the Bomb Squad, and Military Logistics. The hospital was subsequently locked down, roads were closed, and a cordon was in place around the hospital, with armed police maintaining a presence. The motivation behind the attack remains unclear. Still, a theory emerged that the bomber initially intended to walk to the cathedral and detonate his device as the congregation left. However, due to Perry's quick thinking, a potentially more significant tragedy was averted. Following the incident, three men were arrested under the Terrorism Act in the Kensington area of Liverpool. The police later confirmed that these arrests were a direct response to the attack. A fourth man was also arrested, and a controlled explosion was carried out near Rutland Avenue. Houses in the Sefton Park area were evacuated, as a precautionary measure. On 15 November 2021, the police declared the explosion a terrorist incident, and the UK raised its terror threat level from substantial to severe. MI5 joined the investigation on the same day, providing local authorities with support. The event has been reported globally, with international news outlets covering the incident, including CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post."
Tonga held its general elections on November 18, 2021. The elections were held to elect 17 out of 26 seats to the Legislative Assembly of Tonga. The island nation saw 73 candidates contesting the elections, including 12 women. A week-long lockdown due to a COVID-19 case did not delay the elections. In the 2017 elections, the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands led by the late Akilisi Pohiva won a landslide victory, and Pohiva was re-elected as the prime minister. However, in 2019, Pohiva passed away, and Pohiva Tu ªi ªonetoa was elected as the prime minister with the support of nobles, independent MPs, and some former members of DPFI. In December 2020, the opposition submitted a motion of no-confidence in Tu ªi ªonetoa, which was rejected by the Legislative Assembly in January 2021. The 2021 general elections were held using a first-past-the-post voting method from single-member constituencies, with Tongatapu having ten constituencies, Vava ªu three, Ha ªapai two, and  ªEua and Niuatoputapu/Niuafo ªou one each. Nine seats are occupied by members of the nobility who elect representatives amongst themselves. The Cabinet formed by the Prime Minister may include up to four members not elected to the Assembly, who then automatically become members of the legislature."
A tragic incident occurred near Bosnek, Pernik Province, Bulgaria, on November 23 at around 2:00 in the morning. A bus carrying Macedonian tourists who were on their way back from Istanbul caught fire after crashing, resulting in 46 fatalities and 7 injuries. The accident happened on a motorway, and it is considered one of the deadliest bus accidents in Bulgaria's history. The authorities are currently investigating the incident to determine the cause of the crash and provide more details to the public. Our thoughts go out to the families and friends of those impacted by this tragedy."
The Solomon Islands has been hit by ongoing civil unrest since 24 November 2021, with protests and violent riots taking place. The unrest began following the central government's withdrawal of recognition of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in favor of the mainland People's Republic of China in 2019, sparking tension with Malaita Province, which continues to be supported by Taiwan and the United States. Malaita Province's premier, Daniel Suidani, also held an independence referendum in 2020, which the national government dismissed as illegitimate. Initially peaceful protests turned violent on 24 November, with fires breaking out around the Solomon Islands Parliament Building and looting in Honiara's Chinatown. The majority of the protesters were from Malaita Province, and clashes with police and government forces led to a deployment of Australian Federal Police and Australian Defence Force personnel to help maintain order and protect vital infrastructure. As of the latest update, Australian Federal Police have taken control of the capital, Honiara, following three days of civil unrest. Rioting and looting continue in the Chinatown suburb, with a nighttime curfew implemented at 7:00 p.m. local time. The Solomon Islands Government has warned that those involved in the unrest will ""face consequences,"" but Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has resisted calls to resign, saying that any removal will be on the floor of Parliament. The unrest and tension have also garnered international attention, with China expressing ""concern about the attacks"" and support for the Solomon Islands Government's attempts to ""restore order and stability quickly."""
"The 2021-2022 European windstorm season includes the participation of more countries such as Greece, Israel, Cyprus, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Malta in naming storms that affect their areas. The storm names for the season were released on September 1, 2021, and across Europe, various meteorological agencies are collaborating to name storms based on their respective forecasting areas. The storm naming scheme partially overlaps between the Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands) and the South-western Group (France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and Luxembourg) meteorological agencies. The season has already brought severe weather, with Cyclone Apollo, Storms Blas, and Tim affecting various countries with heavy rain, strong winds, and flooding. Storm Arwen, which hit the British Isles, caused widespread damage and travel disruptions in Scotland and North East England, with 100,000 people losing power. Furthermore, former Atlantic hurricanes will retain their names as assigned by the National Hurricane Center of the United States, and some storms may be of tropical origins. From the Autumn of 2021, the names issued by other meteorological services will also be included in the charts of the Berlin Wetterkarte and Free University of Berlin, under the EUMETNET umbrella."
A tragic mass shooting occurred at Oxford High School in Oxford Township, Michigan on November 30, 2021 leaving four students dead and seven others injured. The suspected shooter, a 15-year-old sophomore student, has been taken into custody. It has been reported that the shooter used a semiautomatic handgun during the attack, which resulted in the school going into lockdown and some students being evacuated to a nearby store. Prior to the shooting, there were rumors of a threat against the school but no evidence of such threats were found during the investigation. Parents of students who stayed home reported that they had heard threats of a shooting occurring and the incident has caused widespread distress among the community. Recovery efforts for the victims and their families remain ongoing. President Joe Biden, Representative Elissa Slotkin, and Governor Gretchen Whitmer have all expressed their condolences to the families of the victims and called for an end to gun violence."
On December 4th, 2021, the Semeru volcano erupted on the Indonesian island of Java, killing one person and injuring 41 others. Semeru is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and the highest on the island at 3,676 meters in elevation. The eruption began when a lava dome at the summit crater collapsed due to intense precipitation, triggering a pyroclastic flow down the slopes of the volcano. The eruption resulted in a cloud of volcanic ash being ejected 40,000 feet (12,000 m) into the air. Since the eruption, at least 10 miners at a sand mine in Lumajang were initially trapped but later rescued. Nevertheless, 10 other people remain unaccounted for. The eruption affected several sub-districts in the Lumajang and Malang Regency, where ashfall was reported in eight villages and 28 heavily-damaged schools. More than 300 families were evacuated as many village homes and vehicles were buried under heavy volcanic ash. Power interruptions and blackouts affected at least 30,253 people. The Indonesian authorities have warned residents to keep a distance of at least 5 km away from the main summit crater amid concerns of large pyroclastic flows. The head of the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB) has also alerted people to stay away from rivers originating from Semeru as they may transport volcanic debris. The BNPB has dispatched immediate aid, including meals ready-to-eat, blankets, mattresses, masks, refugee tents, medical supplies, water, and instant food, worth about 1,14 billion Indonesian rupiah, to assist the displaced residents. The Deputy Regent of Lumajang said rescue and recovery efforts were challenging to carry out due to difficult access to the affected areas in the aftermath of the eruption. However, Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the Lumajang Regency on December 5th to lead the BNPB in the recovery efforts. Khofifah Indar Parawansa, the Governor of East Java, has also relocated her office to the Lumajang Regency to aid in the evacuation process of residents in the danger zone. Operations at the Yogyakarta International Airport, Adisumarmo International Airport, and Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport were unaffected by the eruption as no volcanic ash was observed. The Indonesian authorities have urged residents to remain alert for the possibility of further eruptions and keep themselves informed of the latest updates from official sources."
A tragic incident occurred in Nagaland, India on December 4, 2021, when soldiers of the Assam Rifles, an Indian paramilitary force, opened fire on a group of miners, mistakenly believing them to be militants. Thirteen miners lost their lives in the attack, and a soldier was also killed when a confrontation broke out with angry locals. The incident sparked outrage across Nagaland, with many calling for the repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). The miners were returning home from work when they were ambushed by soldiers who had received faulty intelligence that a group of militants were in the area. In the subsequent violence, seven more miners were killed along with the soldier when locals confronted the soldiers, demanding the return of the bodies. The Eastern Nagaland People's Organisation (ENPO) and the Nagaland Students Federation called for protests across the state on December 5, while the Assam Rifles' camp in Mon Town was attacked and vandalized by around 200 people. The government of Nagaland imposed Section 144 in the district, limiting public assembly and movement and suspending mobile internet and bulk SMS services. The incident led to widespread condemnation, with many calling for the repeal of AFSPA, a controversial law that gives Indian security forces extensive powers in the name of protecting public order. The National Human Rights Commission of India sent notices to the Central and the State governments, and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to probe the incident, with the police registering a case against the soldiers. The community mourned the loss, with black flags hoisted on all Morungs at the Hornbill Festival, and a six-hour shutdown was called by the Nagaland Students Federation. On December 7, the Nagaland government announced that it would suspend all activities at the Hornbill Festival and seek the repeal of AFSPA."
The United Kingdom continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic as it reports a record 78,610 new cases in the past 24 hours. This surge in cases comes as the highly transmissible Omicron variant spreads rapidly throughout the country. As of December 6, 2021, the UK has recorded 10,523,316 confirmed cases and 165,721 deaths among those who recently tested positive. The country has the world's seventh-highest death toll and the fourth-highest number of confirmed cases worldwide, the highest in Europe. The UK's response to the pandemic has been marked by periodic lockdowns, restrictions on movement and activities, and a successful vaccination rollout, even as new variants continue to emerge. The pandemic has had severe impacts on the UK's healthcare system, economy, and society as a whole, including significant disruptions to education and long waiting lists for medical procedures. The pandemic has also led to the largest fall in life expectancy in England since records began in 1981, with over 1 million people in the UK affected by Long COVID."
In a shocking upset, Helen Morgan of the Liberal Democrats has won the North Shropshire seat in the British House of Commons, which has been held by the Conservative Party since the constituency's creation. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of Conservative MP Owen Paterson in November. Morgan's victory marks the seventh-largest swing in United Kingdom by-election history, with a 34.1% swing to the Liberal Democrats. North Shropshire is the third-largest constituency by area in the West Midlands and includes five small towns. Sixty percent of its constituents voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.
A cargo ship carrying 130 passengers, including crew, sank off the northeast coast of Madagascar on December 20, 2021. The vessel, called Francia, had illegally taken on passengers for a journey from Antanambe to Soanierana Ivongo. The ship reportedly flooded due to a hole in the hull, leaving it exposed to wave action. At least 85 people died in the accident, while around 50 survivors were rescued. Madagascan police minister Serge GelleÃÅ, who flew to the site of the shipwreck on December 21, survived a helicopter crash along with Chief Warrant Officer Jimmy Laitsara. Both were separately rescued. Prime Minister Christian Ntsay and the Minister of National Defense, General LeÃÅon Richard Rakotonirina, visited the site of the shipwreck using a separate helicopter. Following the accident, the Madagascan government launched an investigation into the sinking, with the help of three vessels from the Madagascan navy and maritime agency. On December 23, it was reported that 24 more people were found dead, bringing the total death toll to 85. Three persons are still missing. The grave site of Soanierana Ivongo was too small to accommodate all the bodies recovered, so some were sent to nearby villages for burial. Madagascan President Andry Rajoelina paid tribute to those who died in the shipwreck and helicopter crash."
The COVID-19 pandemic in South Australia has taken a turn for the worse as the state reports a record 744 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the statewide total of confirmed cases to 4,324. The state government has introduced restrictions including mandatory masks in high-risk settings, aged care homes, hospitals, and other personal care settings, as well as restrictions on indoor entertainment venues. Non-essential retail, gyms, and indoor fitness facilities have also been closed. The lockdown, which was triggered by a five-case cluster of the Delta variant linked to Modbury Hospital, ended on July 27. In November 2021, South Australia reopened its borders to the rest of the country, signaling a change from an elimination strategy to a suppression strategy in controlling the virus. However, on December 10, the Omicron variant was detected in two interstate travelers, resulting in changes to the rules for travelers coming to SA from New South Wales and Victoria being required to be tested on day 6 as well as on arrival. Several high-risk exposure sites were listed, where anyone who entered had to quarantine for 14 days. These restrictions were eased on December 14 and 15 respectively. The pandemic has also impacted events in the state, with several being canceled or postponed, including the South Australian National Football League men's and women's games, NBL1 Central games, the South Australian portion of Head of the River, the Royal Adelaide Show, and the Tour Down Under bicycle race. AVCon, Adelaide's main anime and gaming convention, was canceled in 2020 and 2021, while Riverland Field Day in Barmera and Adelaide's New Year's Eve fireworks at the end of 2020 were also canceled. The World Solar Challenge was canceled in 2021, and the OzAsia Festival was canceled in 2020, but went ahead in 2021 with some shows being canceled due to COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, the SA state government has introduced economic stimulus measures, and in November 2020, announced it would double its coronavirus economic stimulus package to AU$4 billion. The state has also set up mass vaccination hubs, deployed sniffer dogs on a trial basis, and declared public health emergencies, major emergencies, and lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus."
The recent record-breaking rainfall in the northeastern Brazilian state Bahia has resulted in severe floods, claiming the lives of at least 18 people. In addition, more than 280 individuals sustained injuries and over 35,000 were displaced. Governor of Bahia, Rui Costa, declared the floods to be ""the worst disaster that has ever occurred in the history of Bahia"" in a tweet. As many as 72 municipalities in Bahia have declared a state of emergency. The state capital Salvador alone had a total rainfall exceeding 250 millimetres (9.8 inches) on 24 December, which is five times the historic average. On 26 December, the Bahia state government, along with the Brazilian federal government and cooperation from other state governments, launched a joint rescue operation to help the affected areas. Two dams, Itambe and Jussiape, collapsed between the 25th and 26th of December, exacerbating the flooding. The southern part of Bahia state had already been struggling with floods earlier in December caused by Subtropical Storm UbaÃÅ."
Iran's cyberwarfare capabilities and activities continue to be a cause for concern as the country is suspected of hacking into Israel's Jerusalem Post newspaper's website. The attack, believed to be carried out by Iranian hackers, replaced the website's content with a threat aimed at the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center and a reference to the assassination of Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad exactly two years ago. Iran is considered an emerging military power in the field of cyberwarfare and has been accused of launching cyber-attacks on the United States, Israel, and Persian Gulf Arab countries. The country reportedly runs two surveillance operations targeting dissidents in cyber-space. However, Iran's cyber defense system, including a digital fortress that is part of its national information network, is said to be capable of thwarting attacks and engaging attackers. In 2010, Iran was the victim of a cyber-attack on its nuclear facility in Natanz, reportedly carried out by the United States and Israel, which destroyed over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges, setting Tehran's atomic program back by at least two years. While the worm responsible for the attack, 'Stuxnet,' infected more than 60,000 computers, the Iranian government claims that it caused no significant damage. Despite accusations from western analysts, Iran denies involvement in cyber-attacks on other countries, including specific allegations of involvement in hacking into American banks."
A devastating fire that erupted on January 9, 2022, in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx in New York City has claimed the lives of 17 people and left 44 others injured. The blaze quickly spread through the 19-story apartment building, causing widespread damage and prompting emergency evacuations. Officials are calling it one of the worst fires in the city's modern history. Our thoughts and condolences go out to the victims and their families during this difficult time."
The Russo-Ukrainian crisis that started in late October 2021 continues as tensions rise between Russia and Ukraine. On January 10, 2022, talks between Russia and the United States were held in Geneva to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and confront rising tensions over Ukraine. The talks were led by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. In addition, Russia would hold talks with NATO in Brussels on January 12, and a broader meeting involving the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe would take place in Vienna on January 13. Against this backdrop, Ukrainian authorities announced on January 13, 2022, the arrest of an alleged Russian intelligence agent who attempted to recruit others to launch attacks in the port city of Odessa. Details of the arrest were not provided, but it marked the latest escalation in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Previously, Kyiv had accused Russia of amassing more than 92,000 troops and Iskander short-range ballistic missile systems near the Ukrainian borders in November 2021. In December, Janes analysis concluded that major elements of the Russian 41st Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army had been repositioned to the west, reinforcing the Russian 20th Guards and 8th Guards armies already positioned closer to the Ukrainian border. Additional Russian forces were reported to have moved into Crimea, reinforcing Russian naval and ground units already deployed there. Tensions have risen as Moscow accuses Ukraine of conducting offensive actions in Donbas in some areas and escalating tensions in the conflict zone. Ukrainian intelligence stated that Russia was strengthening ""specific groups of troops"" near the border, leading Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to urge Paris and Berlin to prepare for a possible military scenario of Russia's actions in the Ukrainian direction. Harsh statements from Kyiv and Moscow come against the backdrop of a deadlock on all existing negotiating platforms, including negotiations within the Normandy Format and the Trilateral Contact Group. The international community has called for reducing tension and avoiding any escalation in and around Ukraine. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on the West to send Russia ""a clear signal,"" while the acting German Foreign Minister and French Foreign Minister expressed concern about ""Russian military activity"" near Ukraine. The United States is discussing possible sanctions with European allies in case of further Russian invasion. In November 2021, the Russian Defense Ministry described the deployment of US warships to the Black Sea as a ""threat to regional security and strategic stability."" The ministry said that the real goal behind the US activities in the Black Sea region was exploring the theatre of operations in case Kyiv attempts to settle the conflict in the southeast by force. This provoked further international tensions involving the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States."
The ongoing military confrontation and international crisis between Russia and Ukraine, which began in late October 2021, have escalated to a breaking point in early 2022. The crisis has caused international tension, involving the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Talks between NATO and Russia have hit a breaking point, with Poland warning of possible war. The aggravation of Russian-Ukrainian relations began in late October ‚Äì early November and was provoked by the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations. The message about the use of UAVs appeared almost simultaneously with the news about the occupation of the village of Staromarievka on the contact line of the parties, in which 37 Russian citizens who received passports under the simplified program live. The ceasefire regime has been violated twice as often as in 2020, and there have been repeated attempts to muffle the signal of Ukrainian UAVs used to monitor the terrain. Publications appeared in the Western media that Russia was again pulling troops to the Ukrainian border. Satellite photos of Russian armored vehicles were cited as evidence. The military aggravation was accompanied by aggravation in the Ukrainian political field. Russia accuses Ukraine of deploying half its army ‚Äì about 125,000 troops ‚Äì in Donbas to confront pro-Russian separatists. On 3 December, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Olexii Reznikov said: ""There is a possibility of a large-scale escalation on the part of Russia. The most likely time to achieve readiness for escalation will be the end of January.""  Against this background, Ukraine has sharply intensified diplomatic efforts, and talks between NATO and Russia hit a breaking point. Poland has warned of possible war. Talks are ongoing, but the situation remains tense, and the risk of escalation is high. Both sides have accused each other of aggressive actions, and there are no contacts within the Normandy Format. The situation remains deadlock despite international efforts to defuse the crisis, and the possibility of escalation is growing."
The much-anticipated 2022 Australian Open is scheduled to take place from 17th to 30th January 2022, marking the 110th edition of the tournament at Melbourne Park, Victoria, Australia. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) runs the tournament as a part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The event features men's and women's singles and doubles draws, as well as mixed doubles events, and also includes wheelchair and junior competitions. The total prize money for this year's Australian Open has gone up to tournament record A$75,000,000, offering multiple ranking points at various events making it an exciting season. However, the tournament has garnered attention for reasons beyond its prize money and players' ranking points. Defending champions Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka are expected to participate in Men's Singles and Women's Singles, respectively, but Djokovic's visa issues have caused speculations on his participation. Djokovic was granted a medical exemption from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination after a blind review of his application by Tennis Australia and the health department of the state of Victoria. However, upon his arrival in Australia, his visa did not meet the country's entry requirements for unvaccinated travelers. His lawyers attempted an injunction against deportation to appeal the visa refusal; this allowed him to remain confined in a detention hotel pending appeal. On 15th January 2022, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Alex Hawke, invoked his ministerial powers under the Migration Act 1958 to cancel Djokovic's visa citing ""health and good order grounds."" The Australian Border Force subsequently held Djokovic on 16th January, and he was detained in a Melbourne hotel as he awaited deportation. Djokovic has since filed an appeal against the visa-cancellation decision. The public response to Djokovic's case is alight with mixed opinions. Still, the Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has reiterated that the Australian Government's stand is to ensure that everybody meets the same entry requirements to keep Australians safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, other players who had obtained a similar medical exemption as Djokovic and now face increasing uncertainty about their participation in the tournament. The opening ceremony of the Grand Slam tournament has taken place, and under strict COVID-19 protocols, players and organizers are observing guidelines aimed at minimizing the spread of the virus. The tournament is being played on hard courts in a series of 25 courts, including the newly constructed Kia Arena. With the controversy surrounding Djokovic's participation, the tournament continues amid heightened anxiety in some quarters."
A tense hostage situation at Congregation Beth Israel, a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, ended tragically on January 15, 2022. An armed man claiming to be the brother of Pakistani Al-Qaeda suspect Aafia Siddiqui entered the synagogue carrying a handgun and began taking hostages, including the synagogue's Rabbi, Charlie Cytron-Walker, during a bar mitzvah. The assailant demanded Siddiqui's release as part of his negotiations. After more than 12 hours of being under siege, the situation came to a bloody end when the assailant was shot and killed by police. Law enforcement officials evacuated people from the vicinity of the synagogue to ensure their safety. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Public Safety were involved in the operation. A live stream of the synagogue's services showed the ongoing situation, including the taking of hostages. During the crisis, the assailant made several threatening statements, including ""everyone will die"" and ""I'm going to die. Don't cry about me..."". He was also heard using anti-Israel epithets. Negotiations between law enforcement and the assailant included a demand that the rabbi call a New York City-based rabbi to pass along the demand for Aafia Siddiqui's release. Siddiqui's current attorney condemned the hostage-taking and asked the hostage-taker to release all hostages immediately. The White House and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett closely monitored the situation. The Alternate Prime Minister of Israel, Yair Lapid, announced that Israeli Consulate General Livia Link was on her way to the scene, and the Israeli government was in contact with American law enforcement. At around 9:21 p.m., James Hartley of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported hearing ""what sounds like gunshots and a much louder bang, possibly a flash grenade"" from the synagogue. After more than 12 hours, Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced via Twitter that ""All hostages are out alive and safe."" One of the hostages was released earlier and was not in need of medical attention. The assailant's claim to be Aafia Siddiqui's brother was later disputed by his lawyer, who stated that he had no involvement in the attack. Law enforcement officials have not identified the assailant. This hostage situation has once again highlighted the need for security measures to protect vulnerable communities such as synagogues."
On 15 January 2022, a large eruption of Hunga Tonga, a volcanic island in Tonga in the Pacific Ocean, caused tsunamis in Tonga, Fiji, American Samoa, and other countries leading to evacuation orders and warnings. The tsunami waves were reported to have caused damage and loss of life in some areas. One newly reported casualty was in Lambayeque, Peru, where two people were killed by a small tsunami. The eruption, which occurred after a period of relative inactivity since 2014, has caused significant damage and remains a concern to surrounding areas. Rescue operations are underway, and aid is being discussed by officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tonga."
On January 20, 2022, a large-scale attack by Islamic State militants targeted Al-Sina'a prison in the city of Al-Hasakah, Syria. The attack included a car bomb and heavy weapons fire, resulting in a prison riot where inmates obtained weapons from the prison's armoury. The militants managed to free several prisoners and take control of the prison. Clashes continued into the next day, with 67 people reported dead. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and international coalition forces launched a counter-attack to regain control of the prison and surrounding areas. By January 21, SDF forces reported that they had apprehended 89 escaped prisoners, although fighting with ISIL militants continued. The attack is considered the largest committed by ISIL since losing their last key territory in Syria in 2019."
Singapore has announced that it will be extending COVID-19 vaccine booster doses to young people aged between 12 and 17 years old. The Ministry of Health disclosed that the booster doses will be rolled out on March 14, 2022, following earlier efforts to prioritize vulnerable populations and frontline workers in the national vaccination campaign. Singapore boasts the highest percentage of vaccinated individuals in the world, with over 88% of the population having already received their complete dose regimen. The government invested in advanced purchase agreements with various vaccine suppliers, including Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, and CoronaVac, among other initiatives. The country also recognizes vaccine certificates from other countries, recently announcing that it will accept Malaysia's certificate to facilitate travel between the two nations. The extension of booster doses to young Singaporeans is part of the government's commitment to ensuring that the entire population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19."
On January 25, 2022, the Baluch Liberation Front insurgents launched an attack on a security post belonging to the Pakistani military in Kech District, Balochistan, Pakistan, killing at least ten security personnel and injuring three others. During the clashes, the insurgents also suffered significant casualties and managed to seize the weapons present in the security post. Local sources confirmed the attack, and law enforcement agencies killed one insurgent and arrested three others during a subsequent search operation. The Baluch Liberation Front has claimed responsibility for the attack, labeling it an insurgency against Pakistan's military. The attack reflects ongoing tensions between Baloch separatists and the Pakistani military in the region, which has been the center of several separatist movements in recent years."
From January 31 to February 1, 2022, heavy rainfall caused devastating landslides, floods, and mudflows in Ecuador. In the capital city of Quito alone, at least 23 people have been reported dead and 47 others injured in landslides. The natural disaster also left nine people missing. The Quito landslide, in particular, has claimed the lives of eleven individuals. The Ecuadorian government is currently leading the rescue and recovery efforts for the affected communities. "
Guinea-Bissau has recently experienced a coup attempt on February 1st, resulting in the death of several members of the security forces. President Umaro Sissoco Embalo described the event as a ""failed attack against democracy."" Despite the situation, Embalo assured that everything was under control in a phone call with AFP news agency. The President's current location has not been disclosed, however, reports indicate that he was at his residence. Both the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union have condemned the attempted coup. ECOWAS demanded that ""the military return to their barracks and maintain a republican posture"", holding them responsible for the physical security of President Umaro Sissoco Embalo and his government members."
On 2 February 2022, a horrible massacre took place at Plaine Savo, a camp for internally displaced people in Djugu territory, Ituri Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo. According to recent reports, CODECO militiamen stormed the camp and carried out a mass stabbing, resulting in the death of over 60 civilians. Plaine Savo, which is home to around 4,000 people, has been dealing with violence and insecurity for years. The attack has sparked outrage and condemnation from many, including human rights organizations and government officials who are calling for action to bring the perpetrators to justice. The situation in Djugu remains tense and the safety of the displaced residents is of utmost concern."
After centuries of whaling, Iceland has announced plans to end the practice by 2024. Previously, Iceland was one of the few countries that objected to the International Whaling Commission's moratorium established in 1986, and maintained a whaling fleet. However, the industry has faced challenges in recent years from subsidized Japanese whaling, increasing domestic whale watching tourism, and now the decreasing price of whale meat. Previously, one company in Iceland focused on hunting fin whales for export to Japan, while another hunted minke whales for domestic consumption until 2020. In 2018, Icelandic whalers were accused of slaughtering a blue whale. The tension between the whaling industry and the whale watching sector in Iceland is well known, and the decision to end whaling is likely to have positive effects on tourism. It remains to be seen if other countries will follow Iceland's example and end commercial whaling."
The ongoing war and civil conflict between the Government of Burkina Faso and Islamist rebels continue to lead to violence and bloodshed. Recent reports indicate that French troops battled against Ansar ul Islam, resulting in the deaths of four civilians and ten militants. The clash involved attack helicopter support and highlights the ongoing struggles faced in the region. The crisis has resulted in a humanitarian emergency, with thousands of people displaced and summary executions committed by government forces. Jihadist groups have also been responsible for human rights abuses, including targeting civilians, schools, and local elders. The conflict continues to pose challenges for the Burkina Faso government and French forces."
Operation Unifier, the Canadian Armed Forces contribution to the security of Ukraine, has seen significant changes as Canada withdraws its military advisors and relocates them to an undisclosed location in Europe. The move comes as Canada also suspends operations at its embassy in Kyiv and moves its diplomatic staff to Lviv. The operation, which began in 2015, was primarily focused on training the Ukrainian military in response to the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and pro-Russian unrest. As of January 2022, there were 260 Canadian soldiers participating in the operation, an increase from the original 200. In addition to Canada's contribution, the operation also includes a small Swedish contingent. Since its inception, over 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained under Operation Unifier. The mission's broader goals include supporting the development of the region, maintaining security and democracy, providing humanitarian aid, and promoting economic stability and growth. Members of the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada have expressed appreciation for Canada's contribution to reforming the Ukrainian military, and in July 2018, the Band of the Ceremonial Guard performed a Ukrainian military march in front of members of the diaspora during a ceremony on Parliament Hill. Despite the recent changes to Canada's involvement in the operation, it has been extended until March 2025 with an increased complement of 260."
The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation, a regulation of the European Union and Euratom, has been confirmed as compliant with the treaties of the European Union by the European Court of Justice. This decision dismisses challenges from Poland and Hungary and will allow the European Commission to adopt measures, including the suspension of payment of funds from the EU budget, to member states which violate the principles of rule of law enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland has been a major concern for the European Union since the 2010s. In May 2018, the European Commission proposed linking disbursements from the European Union's budget to adherence to rule of law standards by means of a regulation. While the European Parliament adopted a position on the Commission's proposal in April 2019, the Council was generally wary of confronting its members from Poland and Hungary. However, the adoption of the 2021‚Äì2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery package in the summer of 2020 led to a compromise on the rule of law conditionality regulation proposed - resulting in a legislative draft being published on November 5, 2020. Although the regulation could be adopted by the Council by a qualified majority, Hungary and Poland threatened to veto the Own Resources Decision defining how the MFF and NGEU are financed. However, the impasse was resolved at the European Council summit of 10 and 11 December 2020 by adopting a series of declarations on how the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation should be adopted, implemented, and interpreted. This paved the way for the adoption of the regulation by the Council on December 14, 2020, and by the European Parliament on December 16, 2020. The regulation provides the Commission to propose measures against a member state that violates the principles of the rule of law, and these measures include the suspension of payments or commitments and a prohibition on entering into new legal commitments. The rule of law refers to the values enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, and includes principles like legal certainty, transparent and accountable law-making processes, effective judicial protection, and separation of powers. However, there have been recent challenges related to the implementation of the regulation. According to a resolution adopted by the European Parliament on March 25, 2021, the application of the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation cannot be subject to the adoption of guidelines, and the European Commission should avoid any further delay in its implementation. The European Parliament also urged the Commission to keep it regularly informed about all ongoing investigations into breaches of the principles of the rule of law. When the necessary information was not provided to the European Parliament by June 1, 2021, it threatened to take legal action against the Commission. On June 10, 2021, after the deadline had passed without the Commission providing the necessary information, the European Parliament adopted another resolution calling on the Commission to fulfil its obligations under the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation within two weeks, and notifying the Commission that it would start preparations for legal action against the Commission for failure to act. The Commission rejected the ultimatum on August 23, 2021, with a five-page letter. Despite these challenges, the European Court of Justice's recent decision confirms that the regulation is in line with the treaties of the European Union, ensuring that the Commission can suspend funds from the EU budget to member states with rule of law concerns that could affect the management of EU funds."
Australia has designated Hamas, including its political wing, as a terrorist organisation, alongside Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham and the Guardians of Religion Organization. The list of designated terrorist organisations in Australia is maintained by the Attorney-General's Department, and an organisation may be found to be a terrorist organisation by a court as part of a prosecution for a terrorist offence or designated by regulation upon the motion of the Attorney-General of Australia under Division 102 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Listing, de-listing and re-listing follows a protocol that mainly involves the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Attorney-General's Department, and the responsiblity of prosecuting offences related to these groups falls on the Australian Federal Police, State police forces and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) also monitors financial transactions involving listed terrorist organisations. The list currently includes 26 foreign organisations as terrorist organisations, and Australian anti-terrorism financing laws include sections related to getting funds to, from or for a terrorist organisation, providing support to a terrorist organisation, financing terrorism, financing a terrorist, and giving or receiving goods and services to promote the commission of a foreign incursion offence. These sanctions apply to persons and entities under Australian and international law."
