Since the start of their offensive on 1 May 2021, the Taliban and allied militant groups have been capturing districts and cities in Afghanistan's provinces. The latest development in the ongoing conflict is the capture of Zaranj, the provincial capital of Nimruz Province, by the Taliban. This marks the first major capture of a provincial city by the group since the 2001 invasion. A spokesperson for the local police has confirmed that the city has fallen under Taliban control, and blames the lack of reinforcements of military from the central government for the defeat. The Taliban now control over half of Afghanistan's provinces, including key border crossings with neighboring countries. Meanwhile, the Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban, and countries like Russia and China have expressed concerns about the security situation in the region.

The Australian state of Queensland has entered a snap lockdown after a taxi driver from Kanimbla tested positive for COVID-19. The driver was infectious in Far North Queensland for 10 days, prompting lockdown restrictions to be put in place in Cairns and Yarrabah. The unexpected case has caused concern in the state, which has so far had one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. As of the end of July 2021, Queensland had recorded the death of just 7 patients with COVID-19, and has been praised for its handling of the pandemic. The state's legislation was strengthened early on in the pandemic, giving the Chief Health Officer the power to make 'Directions' that could restrict movement, gatherings, and business activities, along with border closures and other measures. Queensland reopened its borders to all Australian states and territories except Western Australia on 1 February 2021, but has since implemented restrictions on areas with reported case numbers or outbreaks. The state has also cancelled a number of public events and festivals, including the Ekka agricultural show and the Big Pineapple Music Festival."

Palau, a small island nation in the western Pacific, has achieved herd immunity against COVID-19 as 80% of its population aged 12 years and above have been fully vaccinated against the contagious disease. The country, which confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on May 31, 2021, had closed its borders early on and imposed strict control measures, including a quarantine for non-citizens entering the country. As a member of the Compact of Free Association with the United States, Palau received vaccines from the American Operation Warp Speed program. By May 26, an estimated 96% of adults (18 and over) in the country had been fully vaccinated, while 70% of all Palauans had received their shots. The vaccination program, coupled with border controls, allowed the country to maintain zero COVID-19 cases for months. Additionally, Palau and Taiwan established a ""travel bubble"" in April, allowing people to safely travel between the two countries despite the pandemic. The Pacific island has now announced plans to vaccinate adolescents aged 12 to 17 as it reopens its doors to tourists."

Egypt-Russia relations have a long history dating back to the 16th century, and today, the two countries have resumed direct commercial flights for the first time since the 2015 Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing. The incident, which killed 224 people, mostly Russian tourists, strained the already complicated relationship between the two nations. However, since the removal of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi from office in 2013, Egypt and Russia have strengthened their military and trade ties through multiple rounds of bilateral visits, the signing of arms deals worth billions of dollars, and agreements to build Egypt's first nuclear reactor and a ""Russian Industrial Zone"" along the Suez Canal. In 2020, Egypt reportedly dispatched 150 troops to help the Syrian government, while Russia has been supporting the Syrian government and intervening militarily in its favor since 2015. Despite the ups and downs in their relationship, Russians remain the largest group of outsiders to visit Egypt, while the country is the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroad. The two countries are also collaborating in higher education, as the Egyptian Russian University was established in Badr City, Cairo, in 2006, offering training in pharmacy and engineering."

Wildfires have ravaged Algeria since August 9, 2021 and have left 65 individuals dead, including 37 civilians and 28 soldiers. As of recent news, the death toll has risen to 65 with fires continuing to burn across the country. Algerian authorities have sent soldiers to aid with evacuations and the fires that started in the Kabyle region and other parts of the country. These fires have affected the Mediterranean vegetation, resulting in the destruction of olive trees and killing of cattle and chickens. Although some villagers have fled the blazes, others attempted to contain them with limited resources such as buckets, branches and basic equipment. The country has been battling a total of 69 fires for the past four days with firefighting aircraft not available. President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has announced three days of national mourning for those who lost their lives in the devastating wildfires."

Lebanon's ongoing financial crisis continues to worsen as the Central Bank of Lebanon recently announced the end of fuel subsidies. Instead, it will offer ""credit lines for fuel imports based on the market price for the Lebanese pound."" This decision is expected to lead to a substantial increase in fuel prices, further exacerbating the country's already dire economic situation. The Lebanese pound has been pegged to the US dollar since 1997, but due to various financial hardships, including the growing probability that the Lebanese government will default on its debt obligations, its black market value has significantly diverged from the official exchange rate. The financial crisis has been further intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 Beirut port explosion. The country's consumer goods prices have increased by 580% since October, and its GDP has fallen to around 44 billion USD from about 55 billion USD the year before. The shortage of US dollars, used in everyday transactions, and the rapid devaluation of the Lebanese pound have resulted in significant inflation and a massive loss of purchasing power, leading to an increase in poverty. These liquidity issues have also created a barrier for depositors, who have been unable to access their deposits and withdraw US dollars directly. The financial crisis has also led the country to default on its Eurobond debt, and Lebanon has become junk-rated. Prime Minister Hassan Diab has resigned, and there have been widespread protests with citizens expressing anger at the government and the governor of the central bank. On 1 June 2021, the World Bank warned that the economic crisis in Lebanon would risk becoming one of the three most severe since the mid-19th century if the country's bankrupt economic system, which benefited a few for so long, wasn't reformed."

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has obtained the dissolution of the House of Commons for an election scheduled on September 20, 2021. This election will determine the members of the House of Commons for the 44th Canadian Parliament. The fixed-date provisions of the Canada Elections Act dictate that federal elections have to be held on the third Monday of October in the fourth calendar year after the polling day of the previous election. However, since the current government is a minority government, the election has been before the scheduled date if Parliament is dissolved by the Governor General of Canada due to a motion of no confidence in the government or at the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada for a snap election.

The 2019 federal election saw the incumbents, the Liberals led by Justin Trudeau, losing their majority but still winning the most seats. The Conservatives remained as the Official Opposition with Andrew Scheer temporarily staying as the Leader of the Opposition until his resignation, which triggered a leadership election. The Bloc Québécois became the third party while the New Democrats lost seats but maintained their official party status. The Greens increased their seats in the House of Commons, but they ultimately failed to achieve the required number of MPs, i.e., twelve, for official party status.

Several incumbents have announced that they would not run in the upcoming federal election, including Hastings—Lennox and Addington MP Derek Sloan, who was expelled from the Conservative Caucus, and Haldimand—Norfolk MP Diane Finley, who had already announced in August 2020 that she would not run in the next election. 

After a Leaders' Debates Commission report recommended two debates every future election, a permanent and publicly funded commission was suggested to be created solely tasked with organizing future debates. The commission, not the government, will also set the criteria for participation in future election debates. 

In June 2020, Liberal Michael Levitt resigned as MP for York Centre to become the President and CEO of the Canadian Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Centre for Holocaust Studies, triggering a by-election in the York Centre riding, which was won by Liberal Ya'ara Saks. 

The 44th federal election will see Canadians head to the polls on September 20, 2021, to vote for members who will represent them in the House of Commons at the Canadian Parliament."

The Panjshir conflict, a political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban which began following the Fall of Kabul in 2021, has seen new developments. As of August 2021, the Panjshir Valley was ""the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands"", though the situation has now changed. According to reports from Russian intelligence sources, Panjshir resistance forces loyal to Amrullah Saleh have managed to re-capture Charikar and the surrounding areas of Parwan Province from the Taliban.

Prior to the Fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by commanders of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. On 17 August 2021, Amrullah Saleh declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there.

At around the same time, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Masoud. As of 17 August, the Panjshir Valley was ""under siege on all sides"" but had not come under direct attack. The situation remained tense, though no military conflict had occurred in Panjshir Province and a negotiated end to the political impasse had been discussed.

With the recent news of the Panjshir resistance forces' success in re-capturing Charikar and the surrounding areas of Parwan Province, it remains to be seen how the conflict will progress. The Taliban has consolidated its control over Afghanistan since the Fall of Kabul, but pockets of resistance remain, with the Panjshir Valley serving as a focal point for opposition to Taliban rule."

Operation Allies Refuge, the ongoing United States military operation to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians, particularly interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan continues to make progress. The operation was officially unveiled by the Biden administration on July 14 and has since evacuated over 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans, in the past few weeks, according to United States Army major general William D. Taylor. 

The operation began on July 30, 2021, when the first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants remaining in the process of being relocated. Following the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on August 12, the Biden administration announced that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to the Kabul International Airport in order to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals and SIV applicants. 

On August 15, following the fall of Kabul, the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. The U.S. military took control over the air traffic control of the airport later in the day. The next day, a C-17 cargo plane evacuated roughly 823 people to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and evacuations have continued in the days since.

On August 17, approximately 1,100 people were evacuated on 13 flights, and the White House reported that more than 3,200 U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and refugees were evacuated from the country, with nearly 2,000 Afghan interpreters flown to the U.S. for SIV processing.

More people were evacuated over the following days: approximately 2,000 on August 18, more than 2,000 on August 19, approximately 5,700 on August 20, and several thousand more since then. The Department of Defense even ordered the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, with commercial airline pilots and crews helping to transport thousands of Afghans from U.S. bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.

However, the operation has also seen casualties. By August 16, at least eight people had been killed at the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes. At least two people were seen falling to their deaths from the sky after clinging to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane, while at least three people clinging to the side of an Air Force jet were killed after being run over. Remains of another dead Afghan were found in the landing gear of the American C-17 after the pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in a nearby country because they were unable to retract the landing gear. The Pentagon said that two armed men who fired into a crowd were killed by U.S. troops."

Operation Allies Refuge is a United States military operation conducting ongoing efforts to airlift at-risk Afghans, including interpreters, embassy employees, and Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan, and assist in the evacuation of Kabul International Airport. The operation began with the arrival of the first group of 200 Afghan interpreters at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing on July 30th, 2021, and has been named by the Biden administration. As of August 22nd, the Department of Defense has activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation, deploying 18 planes operated by commercial airline pilots and crews to transport thousands of Afghan refugees, U.S. citizens, and SIV applicants to U.S. bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The planes will augment military flights carrying Afghans to Europe and, ultimately, the United States.

The operation has faced several challenges, with at least eight casualties at the airport, including two individuals falling to their death from a departing C-17 cargo plane and three people who clung to the side of an Air Force jet and were run over. The Pentagon has confirmed the killing of two armed men who fired into the crowd. Despite these challenges, the operation continues, with the deployment of 6,000 troops securing the airport. As of August 19th, nearly 5,000 people were evacuated by U.S military flights, and the total number of evacuees has reached about 12,700 people as of August 20th. On August 17th, 13 flights evacuated 1,100 people, with more than 3,200 U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and refugees evacuated from the country, and 2,000 Afghan interpreters flown to the U.S. for SIV processing.

As of August 22nd, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has announced that the Civil Reserve Air Fleet will be activated for the third time, with 18 planes deployed to assist in the evacuation of American citizens. The operation's mission continues, with the U.S. military working to evacuate remaining at-risk Afghans from Afghanistan during the ongoing withdrawal of American troops."

Operation Allies Refuge is an ongoing mission led by the United States military to airlift at-risk Afghan citizens, particularly interpreters, U.S. embassy staff, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, out of Afghanistan. It was officially introduced by the Biden administration on July 14 and is happening concurrently with the broader U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

On August 12, the Biden administration announced the deployment of 3,000 U.S. troops to Kabul International Airport to secure the safe departure of embassy employees, U.S. citizens, and SIV candidates. Following the fall of Kabul on August 15, the airport was secured by almost 6,000 U.S. troops, and the U.S. military took over air traffic control. An impressive airlift operation was mounted to evacuate individuals from Afghanistan, and by August 19, the State Department announced that U.S. military flights had evacuated around 5,000 people from the country, and almost 2,000 Afghan interpreters had been flown to the U.S. for SIV processing. As of August 20, the U.S. had evacuated around 12,700 people from Afghanistan, and by August 22, the Department of Defense had activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist with evacuations. The airlift operation continued up until August 31 when the U.S. military completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The operation has not come without casualties, as at least eight people were killed at Kabul International Airport, including two who fell from a departing C-17 cargo plane and three who clung onto the side of an Air Force jet but were eventually run over. Additionally, the Pentagon confirmed the deaths of two armed men who fired into a crowd and were subsequently killed by U.S. troops.

The Panjshir conflict between the Taliban and the Panjshir resistance, led by Amrullah Saleh and Ahmad Massoud, has escalated with the resistance refusing to surrender the Panjshir Valley to the Taliban. As of August 2021, the resistance controls the area, which has a majority of ethnic Tajik people, and has gathered around 9,000 fighters and military equipment, including helicopters and armored vehicles. Ahmad Massoud has called for dialogue on the formation of a comprehensive government, but has warned that war is ""unavoidable"" if the Taliban refuse to negotiate. The Taliban have sent fighters to Andarab in Baghlan Province to kidnap the children of anti-Taliban forces, and reports suggest that independent local militias are fighting against the Taliban in the area. The US and Western forces are seen as lowly supportive of the resistance due to ongoing evacuation efforts from Kabul, and Ahmad Massoud's Washington Post op-ed requesting Western support suggests an absence of direct communication and support between the resistance and the US government. Amidst attempts at a negotiated end to the political impasse, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders for mediation, and the Panjshir representatives have met with members of the Coordination Council to discuss the current situation and providing security to Afghans."

The 2021 Niger attacks continue as militants target civilians and soldiers in Niger, particularly in the western region of Tillabéri. These devastating attacks have resulted in more than 500 deaths and over 100 injuries. This marks the first year that frequent attacks occur in the country, with incidents happening every month in 2021. 

In August, armed militants attacked a military post in Diffa, Niger, resulting in the killing of 16 soldiers and the wounding of nine others. Around 50 Islamist insurgents were killed in the ensuing gun battle. Boko Haram is suspected to have carried out this attack.

Several major attacks occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020, but this is the first time that over 100 civilians were killed in single incidents. The January attack and 21 March attack are the deadliest against civilians since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. Both the December 2020 and January 2021 attacks were carried out during Niger's municipal and regional elections, while the February bombing specifically targeted members of the electoral commission.

Numerous villages and regions have been targeted by militants, including Tchombangou, Zaroumdareye, Banibangou, and Wistan. Newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum has condemned the attacks and declared three days of national mourning. The exact terrorist organization responsible for the attacks is not yet clear. The government of Niger has dispatched soldiers to the border, where the militants are believed to have crossed over from Mali.

On August 26, 2021, a devastating suicide bombing occurred at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. Reports indicate that a suicide bomber detonated explosives at an airport entrance, with another explosion occurring shortly afterward. The first blast killed at least 90 Afghan civilians, while 13 American servicemembers also lost their lives. Over 150 individuals have been injured. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) has claimed responsibility for the attack, which comes amid the ongoing 2021 evacuation of Afghanistan and heightened security concerns.

Following the fall of Afghanistan to Taliban control earlier in the month, the Hamid Karzai International Airport had become the principal way out of the country for many desperate civilians. However, security concerns had been mounting in recent weeks, with warnings from UK and US officials about credible threats of attack from jihadist militants. Hours before the suicide bombings, US diplomats had advised Americans outside the airport's gates to leave the area immediately.

ISIL-KP is widely believed to have been behind the attack. Taliban officials and foreign troops have confirmed the death toll, while up to five US personnel were also injured. The Baron Gate, which leads to nearby Baron Hotel, was the site of the second explosion. The Baron Hotel has been used by American citizens seeking rescue and refuge, as well as by Afghan civilians fleeing Taliban rule.

In the aftermath of the attack, both the Taliban and Afghan officials have condemned the incident, with the Taliban spokesperson tweeting that ""evil circles will be strictly stopped."" International leaders have expressed their condolences and solidarity with Afghanistan, with French President Emmanuel Macron echoing the need for coordinated action with American allies.

On 26 August 2021 at 17:50 local time (13:20 UTC), a suicide bombing took place at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan during the evacuation from Afghanistan, killing at least 182 people, including 13 members of the United States military and 169 Afghan civilians. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack came after heightened security concerns following the fall of Afghanistan to Taliban control and hundreds of members of ISIL-KP escaping from jails at Bagram and Pul-e-Charkhi. The attack took place at Abbey Gate, where a suicide bomber detonated an explosive, leading to gunfire and the closure of all gates to the airport.

Hours before the attack, US diplomats in Kabul had warned American citizens to leave the airport due to security threats. United Kingdom Armed Forces Minister James Heappey and embassies from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia had also warned of high security threats on the airport.

Following the attack, on 27 August, the United States launched an airstrike against an ISIL-KP member in Nangarhar Province, killing two Islamic State members and wounding a third. It was reported that one of those killed was planning more attacks in Kabul. The strike was carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper drone with guided munitions to minimize civilian casualties. 

The Taliban and ISIL-KP, despite both being jihadist groups, are enemies and have fought a bloody war among each other. General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., head of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), said there was no indication that the Taliban allowed the attacks to happen. Through a tweet by their spokesperson, the Taliban condemned the attack, saying ""evil circles will be strictly stopped."" The Taliban later announced that they would take every possible measure to capture ISIL-KP leader Shahab al-Muhajir.

Many nations expressed condemnation for the Kabul airport attack and solidarity with the victims and troops conducting evacuations at the airport. The European Commission and the United Nations likewise condemned the attack. German Chancellor Angela Merkel cancelled an upcoming trip to Israel and stayed in Germany to monitor the evacuation of German troops. The United Kingdom said civilian evacuations would continue in spite of the attack.

US President Joe Biden made a public address following the attack, honoring the American service members who were killed and expressing deep sorrow for the Afghan victims as well. He stated that the US had evacuated more than 100,000 Americans, Afghans, and others, and vowed to hunt down those who wished harm upon the US."

The United States and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan have unofficially started relations on August 15, 2021, after the Taliban returned to power and declared intentions to re-establish the Islamic Emirate. However, the US does not recognize the Taliban as a government but says it could recognize a government that respects basic rights. On August 27, the Taliban appointed Khalil Haqqani, a designated terrorist with a US$5 million bounty, as head of security in Kabul. The Taliban condemned the 2021 Kabul airport attack by ISIS-K and pledged to capture its leader. In response, the US launched an airstrike on August 27, killing two ""high-profiled"" ISIS targets and injuring another. However, the Taliban condemned the airstrike as a ""clear attack on Afghan territory""."

Following the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan and their announcement to re-establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, at least three known drone strikes have been conducted in the country. The most recent strike, carried out by the United States, targeted a vehicle driven by an aid worker for U.S.-based Nutrition and Education International, who was bringing home water for his family. The strike resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people, including seven children. Some of the victims had previously worked for international organizations and held visas allowing them entry to the United States. Reports indicate that other civilians were also killed in the attack, with the majority of the casualties being residents of the area.

The first strike occurred on August 27, 2021, targeting an IS-K member in Nangarhar Province. The target, who was riding in a vehicle, was killed alongside another high-profile member, while a third militant was injured. These two individuals were described as a planner and a facilitator. This strike took place a day after the 2021 Kabul airport attack, which resulted in the deaths of over 180 people.

The second strike took place on August 29, 2021, and targeted a vehicle carrying a family of nine people. The U.S. claimed they were targeting an ISIS-K suicide bomber and accomplices, but reports indicate that the strike resulted in the deaths of at least six children and other civilians.

The drone strikes have sparked controversy and led to calls for greater accountability and transparency in the use of unmanned weapons. The United States has not announced any official investigations into the strikes."

The Taliban has deployed a significant number of forces near the valley, heightening fears of an all-out assault. Negotiations between the two sides are ongoing, but a peaceful resolution remains uncertain. The international community has yet to show public support for the resistance, with focus continuing to be on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul and seeking the Taliban's cooperation.

The Panjshir conflict between the Taliban and the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRFA) has escalated with the Taliban entering the Panjshir Valley to clash with NRFA forces led by Ahmad Massoud. The Taliban reports gaining some territory, including capturing three districts previously held by the NRFA, while both sides claim heavy casualties. The conflict began on August 17, 2021, following the fall of Kabul, when Saleh declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban. The resistance initially gained support, with Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers and other anti-Taliban activists joining their movement. The region is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province, and it has natural defenses in the form of the Hindu Kush mountains, making it difficult to conquer for the Soviet Union during its invasion in the 1980s and for the Taliban during the civil war in the 1990s. However, the Taliban managed to gain control of most of the country, including Kabul, within a few days, and the resistance remained confined to the Panjshir Valley.

On August 23, 2021, both sides attempted to negotiate a settlement, with the Taliban reportedly willing to seek peaceful means to end the conflict, but talks broke down on September 1, 2021, leading to resumed fighting. The Taliban gave the resistance a four-hour ultimatum to surrender, which Massoud rejected. The Taliban then dispatched hundreds of its fighters to the Panjshir Valley, and both sides engaged in heavy fighting. On August 26, 2021, a ceasefire was declared, and the Taliban and the resistance entered into talks, but the talks failed on September 1, 2021. On August 27, 2021, Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it can be deemed illegal, while the international community remained largely silent on the conflict.

As of now, the situation remains highly uncertain, with the Taliban attempting to gain control of the Panjshir Valley, and the resistance fighting fiercely to hold onto its last stronghold. The conflict represents a potential turning point in the Taliban's rule, as failure to quell the resistance could signal the beginning of a prolonged insurgency against their rule."

The operation was concurrent with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and focused on helping NATO and regional allies in their respective evacuation efforts from Hamid Karzai International Airport in the country's capital of Kabul.

The US military airlifted SIV applicants to the United States, where they were temporarily housed while they completed their SIV requirements. The operation's name was unveiled on July 14, 2021. On July 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs (ALLIES) Act to expedite the Afghan SIV process.

On August 15, following the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, the Pentagon and the State Department launched a new effort to airlift all SIV applicants, embassy personnel, American nationals, and eligible Afghans seeking to flee the country. Operation Allies Refuge became concurrent with this effort to evacuate Afghanistan.

The evacuation effort continued for several days, with more than 82,300 people evacuated from the country. On August 27, the US announced that it would open military bases to hold up to 5,000 Afghan nationals who are applying for Special Immigration Visa or are deemed to be ""at risk.""

While the Taliban's conquest of the country led to the disintegration of the Afghan Armed Forces, an armed remnant of mostly 500-600 Afghan Commandos were still active in the airport assisting US troops in providing perimeter security. The Pentagon said these Afghan troops would also be evacuated if they desired.

As of September 7, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain reported that around 100 Americans remain in Afghanistan following the August 31 withdrawal deadline, and that the Biden administration is still working to rescue them."

At 20:47 local time on September 7, an earthquake with a moment magnitude of Mw 7.0 hit just outside the popular tourist city of Acapulco in Guerrero, Mexico. The powerful earthquake caused extensive damage, killed at least one person, and left over 1.6 million residents without electricity. The earthquake occurred on the same day as the 2017 Chiapas earthquake that killed over 100 people. The tremor was a thrust faulting event located near the boundary of the Caribbean Plate and Cocos Plate, which according to the U.S. Geological Survey, caused a rupture size of 40x20 km. It occurred at the southern edge of the Guerrero Gap, where the seismic gap could generate a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. A small tsunami measuring 1.2 feet or 0.37 meters recorded in Acapulco. In Acapulco, a few buildings swayed and were damaged, and several gas leaks and power outages were reported. The mayor of Acapulco, Adela Román, has urged for residents to remain calm while the situation is being assessed."

Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation aimed at evacuating at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants. U.S. personnel also provided assistance to NATO and regional allies in their evacuation efforts from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. The operation was part of the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan, and its primary objective was to evacuate all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans. 

One of the main components of the operation was airlifting SIV applicants to the United States, where they were temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their SIV requirements. The operation's name was unveiled by the Biden administration in July 2021, and by August 27, the Pentagon had confirmed that nearly 100,000 people had been evacuated from Afghanistan.

On September 7, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the US had evacuated 124,000 people from Afghanistan since August 14, including 6,000 US citizens. It is believed that thousands of Afghans, including SIV applicants, were still awaiting evacuation as of September 2021.

Despite the operation's success in evacuating a large number of people from Kabul, it was not without casualties. At least 200 people were killed during the operation, including 13 US service members, in a suicide bombing attack at the airport on August 26. On September 2, a nine-month-old baby died after arriving at the Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania, making her the first death of an evacuee on American soil.

As of September 2021, the situation in Afghanistan remains uncertain following the Taliban's takeover. The US and its allies continue to work on evacuating vulnerable Afghans, including SIV applicants, and providing humanitarian aid to those left behind."

Drone strikes conducted by the United States government in Afghanistan have come under renewed scrutiny following a recent acknowledgement by Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. that a late August strike near Kabul International Airport killed 10 civilians instead of ISIL-K militants as previously claimed by the military. This incident highlights one of the many controversies surrounding drone strikes, which have been conducted in Afghanistan since January 2001. Since then, the U.S. government has carried out over 13,000 airstrikes in the country, resulting in at least 4,138 deaths, including 310 civilians and 73 children. During Donald Trump's presidency, the use of drone strikes reportedly increased at a pace of four to five times compared to the previous administration. In 2016, Barack Obama ordered the CIA to report civilian drone strike deaths, but this order was later revoked by Trump. Amnesty International USA has criticized the legality and effectiveness of drone attacks, while the high rate of civilian casualties and unintended targets continues to fuel controversy and raise questions about their effectiveness in achieving the intended goals."

On September 18, 2021, a rally in support of those arrested for their participation in the January 6 Capitol attack was held near the United States Capitol. Organized by Look Ahead America, a nonprofit led by former Trump campaign staffer Matt Braynard, the rally was originally called ""Justice for J6."" While only around 400 to 450 people attended, fears of violence prompted the Metropolitan Police Department to activate and for a fence to be erected outside the building. In response to the rally, a counter-protest was also scheduled for the same day, raising concerns of violence between the two groups. 

Despite the small turnout, at least four participants were arrested and found to be in possession of weapons. Lawmakers and law enforcement officials had expressed concerns about the potential for violence leading up to the event, with the Department of Homeland Security sharing an intelligence briefing memo warning about possible confrontations and escalation. 

Although former President Donald Trump had called the rally a ""setup"" for Republican voters, far-right groups like the Proud Boys stayed away and members of the Republican Party distanced themselves from the demonstration. While the event was intended as a show of support for those arrested in connection with the January 6 attack, concerns about violence and potential security breaches prompted heightened security measures."

Qatar held its first-ever legislative elections on October 2, 2021, allowing Qataris to vote to elect 30 members of the Consultative Assembly. The elections were first announced in August 2021 by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Originally scheduled to take place in 2013, the elections were repeatedly postponed until Al-Thani pledged to hold them in October 2021. Under the constitution, both men and women over the age of 18 were eligible to vote for the 30 seats. However, 15 members were appointed by the Emir. A total of 284 candidates, including 29 women, ran as independents because political parties are banned. To run for office, candidates had to be at least 30 years of age and ""of Qatari origin"" according to the 2005 nationality law. This requirement excluded those who were descendants of people naturalized after 1930 and members of the Al Murrah tribe, prompting protests.

On October 2, 2021, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) announced the release of 11.9 million leaked documents, making this the largest offshore data leak in history. Dubbed the ""Pandora Papers,"" the documents expose hidden wealth, tax evasion, and money laundering among politicians, celebrities, and billionaires worldwide. The initial leaks, published on October 3, 2021, named over 330 politicians, including 35 national leaders, and over 130 billionaires among the 29,000 beneficiaries of the 27,000 companies involved in the scheme.

Among those named in the leak is former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was shown to have saved £312,000 ($425,000) in Stamp Duty on a London property purchase by using a British Virgin Islands company. While not illegal, the revelations have caused outrage and scrutiny of the individuals and companies involved in the scheme.

The ICIJ's expansive exposé of financial secrecy has surpassed the Panama Papers leak of 11.5 million documents and highlights the ongoing issue of offshore tax havens and corporate secrecy. The Pandora Papers have sparked calls for increased government regulation and transparency surrounding offshore tax sheltering and financial transactions."

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) recently published the largest offshore data leak in history known as the Pandora Papers. The 11.9 million leaked documents, which comprise 2.9 terabytes of data, revealed hidden wealth, tax evasion and money laundering among 330 politicians, including 35 national leaders, and numerous celebrities worldwide, including 130 billionaires, totaling 29,000 beneficiaries among 27,000 companies. The Pandora Papers surpass the Panama Papers by nearly half a million documents, making it the ICIJ's most expansive exposé of financial secrecy yet.

The leaked documents come from 14 offshore service providers that help clients establish companies in secrecy jurisdictions, revealing at least 14,000 shell companies and trusts in tax havens created by the Panamanian law firm of Alemán, Cordero, Galindo & Lee, or Alcogal, the ""law firm of the Latin American elite."" Alcogal was mentioned more than any other offshore provider in the leaked documents.

Among the 35 current and former national leaders named in the papers are former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Montenegrin President Milo Đukanović, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim, Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba, and Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso.

Other global names included in the documents are Shakira, Claudia Schiffer, Indian cricket player Sachin Tendulkar, Alexandre Cazes (the founder of the dark web site AlphaBay), Pakistan's finance minister Shaukat Fayaz Ahmed Tarin, and several family members of Pakistan's top generals, and the CEO of Channel One Russia, Konstantin Ernst. Miguel Bosé, Pep Guardiola, and Julio Iglesias are also named.

The leaked documents estimate that up to US$32 trillion (excluding non-monetary valuables such as real estate, art, and jewelry) may be hidden to avoid taxes. The ICIJ worked with journalists in 117 countries, including news organizations such as The Washington Post, L'Espresso, Le Monde, El País, Süddeutsche Zeitung, PBS program Frontline, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, The Guardian, and the BBC's Panorama.

In response to the Pandora Papers, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan promised to investigate all of the citizens mentioned and take appropriate action in case of wrongdoing.

A powerful 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan's Balochistan province near the city of Harnai on 7 October 2021, killing at least 24 people and injuring around 200. The deadly earthquake occurred near the anniversary of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which claimed the lives of over 87,000 people. Pakistan is influenced by the ongoing oblique convergence between the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate, with thrust faulting in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya region resulting from this plate interaction. In the Balochistan region, the convergence involves the large Chaman Fault, a strike-slip structure, and many thrust faults. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the recent earthquake occurred during the rupture of a thrust fault under the Sulaiman Mountains and Central Brāhui Range. It was followed by a magnitude 4.6 aftershock and was the largest earthquake in Pakistan since a major tremor in 2013 which occurred nearby. The earthquake struck early in the morning at just after 3:00 am local time, collapsing many homes where residents were asleep. Most of the victims were women and children, and an unspecified number of residents were buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings. The number of injured people stands at around 200, and many hospitals in Balochistan have been overwhelmed by the influx of patients. The Harnai District and Shahrag area were severely affected, with at least 70 homes damaged, while cities such as Sibi and Quetta also reported damage. In response, troops from the Pakistan Army were dispatched to aid in rescue and relief operations, and at least nine injured victims in need of medical treatment were transported via helicopters from the affected region to Quetta. Search and rescue teams are working to find survivors among the wreckage with the help of coordinated efforts from army, medical personnel, response workers, and officials."

Five people have tragically been killed and two others injured in Kongsberg, a town in Viken, Norway. Reports indicate that a man used a bow and arrow to target people at various locations before being apprehended by authorities.

38,76,"UPDATED VERSION:

On October 13th, 2021, a 37-year-old Norwegian man and Islamic convert, Espen Andersen Bråthen, opened fire with a bow and arrow on unsuspecting pedestrians in Kongsberg, Viken, Norway. The attack resulted in the deaths of five individuals and injuries to three others. Reports indicate that the perpetrator was previously known to law enforcement and had been flagged for potential radicalization. 

The incident started when a patrol unit responded to reports of a person walking around with a quiver on his back, searching for victims. Officers on the scene were confronted by Bråthen within six minutes, but he fired multiple arrows and fled the scene. The first confrontation was unsuccessful, and Bråthen was able to commit the attack soon after in the Coop Extra supermarket and other locations throughout the town. 

The large-scale emergency response that ensued included heavily-armed police patrols, multiple ambulances, and helicopters, eventually leading to the suspect's capture. Bråthen was taken into custody at 18:47, and it was later revealed that he had confessed to the attack after questioning. The Norwegian Police Security Service has since launched a terrorism investigation into Bråthen's motive for the attack.

The five victims of the attack were four women and one man, aged 50 to 70 years old. Three additional individuals sustained injuries but were not considered life-threatening. 

Bråthen was born and raised in Norway to a Norwegian father and Danish mother. He was known to police and had converted to Islam in 2016. The suspect had a criminal history that included break-ins, cannabis possession, and threats against family members. Despite being flagged for potential radicalization, he had not been on the police radar in 2021.

Following the attack, Norwegian police constables were temporarily ordered to carry firearms nationwide, but no change to the country's threat level was made. Questions were raised about the first confrontation with the perpetrator and why the officers were unable to stop the attack before it occurred. 

The day after the attack, Norwegian public buildings flew flags at half-mast, and candles were lit at Kongsberg Church in memory of the victims. This attack marks the deadliest attack in Norway since the 2011 attacks committed by Anders Behring Breivik."

The Islamic State – Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the attack, as it did for the Kunduz attack that killed 50 people a week earlier. The Taliban's statement comes in response to the growing concern over the safety of the Shi'ite minority community in the country. Over 120 people have been killed in the two attacks, prompting leaders across the world to condemn the violence and call for stricter measures to counter terrorism."

Sir David Amess, a long-serving Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Southend West, was declared a victim of terrorism after he was stabbed to death during a constituency meeting at a Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea. The killing happened on October 15, 2021. The attacker, a 25-year-old man who was British and of Somali heritage, was quickly arrested on suspicion of murder, and a knife was recovered. The motivations of the attacker are still unknown. 

In the wake of the attack, various parliamentary groups and current and former politicians from across the political spectrum have expressed shock and offered condolences, as did the relatives of Jo Cox, another MP who was murdered by a far-right extremist before the European Union membership referendum in 2016. 

Conservative MP and Chairman Oliver Dowden announced that, in light of Amess's death, campaigning activities on behalf of the Conservative Party would be suspended nationwide until further notice. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, announced that the security of MPs would be reviewed. Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, said that politicians should be able to undertake their duties without fear of attack. 

Essex Police confirmed that they had handed the investigation to the Counter Terrorism Command of the Metropolitan Police, which is leading the probe. Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the killing, saying that ""we will ensure that the culprit is apprehended and that justice will be served."" 

BBC One changed its evening schedule out of respect, replacing its topical news satire show Have I Got News for You with a rerun of panel show Would I Lie to You?; crime scene comedy The Cleaner with a rerun of sitcom Miranda; and slasher film Halloween with the romance The Light Between Oceans. 

Sir David Amess has been remembered as an ""instantly recognizable"" member of the Conservative Party who had campaigned for stronger animal welfare protections, the award of Southend-on-Sea city status, and a Brexit supporter. He was also socially conservative and opposed to abortion. In his 2020 autobiography, he expressed concern about the harassment and insecurity that MPs faced while undertaking their duties. MPs are generally not given police protection during surgeries, where they normally have only one staff member."

Protests by Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government, triggered by a ban on Serbian license plates, have come to an end following an agreement on October 2. The ban meant that those with Serbian license plates in Kosovo would have to switch to Kosovar plates. Kosovo introduced the ban to mirror Serbia's previous ban on Kosovar plates. Although the protests largely consisted of blockades near border crossings, two government registration centers were attacked in late September. An agreement was reached on September 30 which allows vehicles with Serbian plates to use them, provided their national symbols and country codes are covered with a sticker. A working group, formed of negotiators from Kosovo and Serbia, will meet in Brussels to find a permanent solution to the issue, with proposals expected in six months."

Sir David Amess, a British Conservative Party politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for Southend West, died on 15 October 2021, after being stabbed multiple times during a political surgery at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Ali Harbi Ali, a 25-year-old male British citizen, was arrested at the scene and was later charged with murder and the preparation of terrorist acts. On 7 March 2022, Ali Harbi Ali appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court and the Old Bailey, where he was charged with the murder of David Amess and remanded to Belmarsh prison. He is due to be tried on that charge.

Amess was a long-serving politician who entered Parliament in 1983 as MP for Basildon. He had held no senior positions but was described by Nick Paton Walsh as an ""instantly recognisable"" member of the Conservative Party and had been knighted for his political and public service. He was a devout Catholic and a socially conservative politician who opposed abortion, supported capital punishment, and campaigned in favour of Brexit. He was a supporter of animal welfare and was one of the few Conservative MPs to support a ban on fox hunting. 

Following the murder of MP Jo Cox on her way to a constituency surgery in 2016, Amess wrote in his 2020 autobiography that fears of similar attacks ""rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians"" and that he had faced harassment and insecurity at his home. MPs are protected by armed police when inside Parliament, with security tightened after the 2017 Westminster attack. They are generally not given police protection during surgeries, and they are normally accompanied by one member of staff only. After Cox's murder, parliamentary spending on MPs\' personal security rose from under £200,000 to £4.5 million in two years.

On 15 October 2021, Amess was at a one-to-one constituency meeting at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall, where he was scheduled to meet with constituents from 10 am to 1 pm. While inside the church hall, a man armed with a knife emerged from the group of constituents and stabbed him multiple times. Armed units and medical and police helicopters arrived at the scene within minutes. The suspect waited inside the church hall, where he was arrested and a police cordon was set up. An air ambulance landed on Belfairs Sports Ground at 2:13 pm to take Amess to hospital, but the medical team decided that his condition was not stable enough to transport him and so continued to work on him at the scene. He was declared dead just before 3 pm.

Counter-terrorist police officers were involved in the early stages of the investigation. Essex Police said that a ""25-year-old man was quickly arrested after officers arrived at the scene on suspicion of murder and a knife was recovered"". On the evening of 16 October, the Metropolitan Police Service confirmed the suspect had been detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000, and that magistrates had extended the period the suspect could be held in custody for questioning until 22 October 2021. Just after midnight, police identified the stabbing as a terrorist incident potentially motivated by Islamic extremism. Police searched three addresses in London over the weekend following the stabbing.

Ali Harbi Ali, a British-born national of Somali heritage, was charged with the murder of Amess and the preparation of terrorist acts on 21 October 2021. Ali was born in 1996 in Southwark, Central London, to Somali immigrant parents. In 2014, as a teenager, Ali was referred to the Prevent programme, Britain's voluntary programme for those thought at risk of radicalisation, from which he was referred on to the Channel Programme. He is believed to not have spent long in the programme, and he was not a ""subject of interest"" to MI5.

After the attack, the prime minister Boris Johnson returned from a holiday, to Westminster, where flags were lowered to half-mast. Various parliamentary groups, and current and former politicians from across the political spectrum, expressed shock and offered condolences, as did members of the royal family, international politicians, and relatives of Jo Cox. A vigil for Amess was held in his Southend West constituency at 6 pm on the day of his death, with another being held the next day.

The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, announced that the security of MPs will be reviewed. The safety of MPs during open, public constituency surgeries was debated by politicians. Calls to enact a law to crack down on online targeting of MPs and end anonymity were made. The Conservatives suspended political campaigning. 

As a result of Amess's death, a by-election was triggered to fill his former seat. Major and minor parties announced they would not stand a candidate to oppose the Conservatives, as a sign of respect, following the precedent set in the 2016 Batley and Spen by-election. In the days following Amess's death, a number of MPs, including Conservative Chris Skidmore and Labour's Charlotte Nichols, voiced their support for a campaign to give Southend-on-Sea city status as a way of honouring Amess's memory; he had frequently spoken on the topic in Parliament. During tributes to Amess on 18 October, the Prime Minister announced that the Queen had agreed to Southend being given city status.

A Catholic priest reported he was not allowed to enter the crime scene to administer the last rites for Amess. Following Amess's killing, British Catholic policymakers issued statements affirming Amess's commitment to his faith and lauding his achievements. Labour MP Mike Kane also sought to add an ""Amess amendment"" to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that would ensure Catholic priests access to crime scenes in order to administer the last rites.

On 16 October, Boris Johnson and the Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer, accompanied by Sir Lindsay Hoyle and the home secretary Priti Patel, laid wreaths at the church hall where Amess was killed. On 18 October, a minute's silence was held in the House of Commons before MPs paid tribute to Amess. That evening, a service of remembrance for Amess was held by MPs at St Margaret's Church, Westminster. The service, which included an address by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, was streamed live by the ITV News YouTube channel. MPs paid tribute in a book of condolence that was placed in the House of Commons Library, as well as in Westminster Hall and Portcullis House. Tributes were also laid at Belfairs Methodist Church Hall, where Amess was killed."

Solar cycle 25, the current solar cycle pattern of sunspot activity, began in December 2019 with a smoothed minimum sunspot number of 1.8 and is expected to continue until about 2030. Although predictions varied widely, the Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel predicted in December 2019 that solar cycle 25 would be similar to solar cycle 24, with a maximum of 115 sunspots in July 2025 (± 8 months), but weaker than average. 

Early signs of cycle 25 included the appearance of reversed polarity sunspots and magnetic activity observed in both solar hemispheres in late 2019 and early 2020. In May 2020, the first C-class and M-class solar flares of the cycle were observed, and solar activity continued to increase in the following months. In November 2020, an M4.4 flare, the strongest of the cycle to date, took place, possibly indicating the solar cycle would be more active than initially thought.

In more recent developments, an X-class solar flare, the second of the current solar cycle, has erupted. It is possible that an associated coronal mass ejection may graze Earth on October 30 or 31, which could cause bright aurorae and interfere with satellite communications. 

Spotless days by year have also been recorded; as of August 28, 2021, there have been 43 spotless days (18%) during solar cycle 25, compared to 192 (52%) in 2020, 274 (75%) in 2019, and 208 (57%) in 2018. 

Overall, the current scientific consensus is that solar cycle 25 will be weaker than the exceptionally strong Modern Maximum but similar to solar cycle 24."

On 1 November 2021, a high-rise block of flats in Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, collapsed, killing at least 36 people. The building, known as the ""360 Degrees Towers"", was being constructed by Fourscore Homes, a UK-registered company headed by Nigerian developer Femi Osibona. One of the buildings was a 21-story luxury residential high-rise tower that had been built six stories above the approved limit set by the Lagos State Building Control Agency. 

The collapse prompted a rescue effort by the National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos State (NEMA) and other responders, who were supervised by the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations and the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development. However, as of 3 November, no new survivors have been found. 

The Lagos State government has suspended the chief architect and arrested the owner of the building, who will be prosecuted for the disaster. The government has also launched an independent panel to investigate the collapse, which has been allotted 30 days to disclose its findings. 

The death toll from the collapse has since climbed to 36, making it one of Nigeria's deadliest building disasters in years. The incident has raised concerns about the quality of construction in Nigeria and the role of oversight bodies in ensuring building safety."

On November 5, 2021, a devastating accident occurred in Freetown, Sierra Leone when an oil tanker collided with a truck resulting in a fiery explosion that killed at least 99 people and injured more than 100 others. The tragedy occurred in the Wellington suburb at a junction outside the Choithram Supermarket at around 10 pm GMT. The fuel spilled over the streets before igniting and people reportedly flocked to the leaking vehicle to collect the fuel. The inferno engulfed a bus full of people and also caused fires in nearby shops and markets. The mortuary at Connaught Hospital has already received 92 bodies, and several severely burned victims are not expected to survive.

Freetown is a port city with a population of over 1 million people that has faced several disasters in the past. In March, a major fire in one of the city's slums left 80 injured and more than 5000 displaced. In 2017, heavy rains triggered mudslides that killed over 1000 people. President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, offered condolences and promised support to the victims' families. Meanwhile, Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals, and journalist Omar Fofana reported that hospital services have been stretched.

Mohamed Lamrane Bah, director of the National Maritime Administration, stated that the injured had been transferred to hospitals and the bodies were collected. He added that rescue efforts at the site had ended, and several people are reported to be in critical condition. This disaster is another reminder of the need to implement measures to ensure safety in transportation of hazardous materials. The Sierra Leone government must put stringent measures in place to avoid such tragedies in the future."

A collision between a petrol fuel tanker and a lorry at a busy intersection in Sierra Leone's capital and largest city, Freetown, resulted in an explosion and fire that killed at least 115 people and injured more than 100. The accident occurred on 5 November 2021 in the Wellington area of Freetown, the city's main industrial district. The fuel tanker carrying petrol collided with a lorry carrying granite, creating a fuel leak. Locals, including ""Okada"" taxi-riders, attempted to collect the spilled petrol, which led to an explosion and a huge fireball that engulfed vehicles, people, and nearby shops and markets. 

Many of the victims were trapped in vehicles, including a bus full of people which was intensely burnt, killing all inside. The damage was exacerbated by people who gathered at the crash scene, scooped the leaking fuel in containers, and placed them in close proximity, leading to traffic chaos. Footage broadcast by local media outlets showed charred bodies surrounding the tanker. The death toll increased four days after the explosion to 115, and several people are in critical condition. 

The event is the first of its kind in the densely populated city with a population of over 1.2 million, and follows a number of similar high-casualty fuel tanker explosions across sub-Saharan Africa, where fuel spilled was viewed as wasteful in communities where many struggled to afford petrol. President Julius Maada Bio offered condolences and promised support to the victims' families, and Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals to support those injured in the incident. The hospital services have been stretched, and about 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive."

Israel has received worldwide recognition for its speedy COVID-19 vaccination program, which began on December 19, 2020, and is officially named ""Give a Shoulder"" in Hebrew. As of June 26, 2021, about 64% of eligible Israelis have received at least one dose, with 60% of the population fully vaccinated with two doses, making Israel's vaccination rates among the highest in the world per capita. Israel's government implemented a centralized approach to vaccine distribution, utilizing personal data to coordinate with the country's health authorities, and purchasing a substantial amount of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines early on. Israel's population density, smaller size, and the younger average age of the population also played a role in the success of the program.

The initial vaccine drive focused on the elderly and high-risk groups, such as those with pre-existing conditions and healthcare workers. By early February 2021, at least 90% of Israelis over the age of 60 received at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The program proved effective in reducing the number of confirmed infections and severe COVID-19 cases, and mass vaccination led to the creation of a green pass that provided immunized residents access to specific locations.

Israel's vaccination success, however, was not without distribution issues. The country experienced scheduling appointment problems and eligibility issues early on, lack of distribution to less-populated areas, and vaccine hesitancy among young adults and religious/cultural minorities. Moreover, the distribution of vaccines to Palestinians and Arab-Israeli communities proved insufficient, and the country faced criticism for the situation.

In more recent news, Israel's pandemic advisory board has given approval for the usage of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old. The program remains ongoing, and the government is currently providing its citizens with a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine to boost immunity."

On 14 November 2021, a terrorist attack took place in the car park outside Liverpool Women's Hospital, England. At about 11:00 am GMT, a passenger in a taxi, a man of Middle Eastern origin, detonated an improvised explosive device, killing himself and injuring the taxi driver. On 15 November 2021, the police declared the incident as a terrorist attack, and the UK terror threat level was raised from substantial to severe. The motive of the bomber was unclear, and investigations were ongoing.

New information has since emerged that the taxi driver, David Perry, noticed that the bomber was wearing an explosive device and locked him inside the vehicle before the explosion occurred. Mayor Joanne Anderson has praised Perry for his ""incredible presence of mind and bravery"" that may have saved lives.

The explosion at the Liverpool hospital has garnered international attention, with many news outlets reporting the incident, including CNN, The New York Times, and the Washington Post. Despite the attack, the hospital remains open, and the police have continued to provide security in the area.

The investigation into the terrorist attack is ongoing, and police have made several arrests under the Terrorism Act. The police have confirmed that MI5 is providing support for the investigation as the perpetrator was unknown to the agency. The incident has raised concerns about the UK's national security, and the government has pledged to take action to prevent future attacks."

Tonga recently held elections on November 18, 2021, to elect 17 of the 26 seats to the Legislative Assembly of Tonga. The previous general elections in 2017 saw a landslide victory for the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands, resulting in the re-election of ʻAkilisi Pōhiva as Prime Minister. However, in September 2019, Pōhiva passed away, and Pohiva Tuʻiʻonetoa succeeded him with the support of the nobles, independent MPs, and former members of the DPFI.

In December 2020, the Democratic Party leader, Semisi Sika, submitted a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Tuʻiʻonetoa. This was backed by Deputy Prime Minister Sione Vuna Fa'otusia, who later resigned from Cabinet as a result. Despite this, the Legislative Assembly rejected the no-confidence motion of 13-9 on January 12, 2021.

The legislative assembly of Tonga consists of up to 30 members, of which 17 are directly elected by first-past-the-post voting. The Cabinet formed by the Prime Minister may include up to four members not elected to the Assembly, who then automatically become members of the legislature.

Parliament was dissolved on September 16, and 75 candidates, including 12 women, registered to contest the election. One candidate withdrew, while another passed away, leaving a total of 73 candidates. The election was held despite a week-long lockdown in response to a new COVID-19 case.

With the results of the election still to be announced, the people of Tonga are eagerly awaiting their new government."

A tragic incident unfolded on November 30, 2021, when a gunman opened fire on students at Oxford High School, located in Oxford Township, Michigan. The shooting left four students dead, seven others injured, and one teacher wounded. Reports suggest that the alleged shooter is a 15-year-old sophomore student who is in custody. 

Prior to the shooting, a parent whose child had stayed home from school claimed that threats of a mass shooting had already been made against Oxford High School. The school administration had previously investigated rumors of a threat following an act of vandalism, but found no evidence to support the suspicion.

The shooter reportedly used a semiautomatic handgun during the attack, which prompted the school to go into lockdown. Some students were evacuated to a nearby Meijer store. The police arrived at the scene at around 12:55 p.m. EST, following approximately 100 calls to 911. The alleged shooter was arrested without harm, with the Oakland County undersheriff commenting that the gunman ""gave up without any problems.""

The aftermath of the shooting saw two of the injured people undergoing surgery, and the remaining six in stable condition. The police recovered a 9mm SIG Sauer SP2022 semiautomatic handgun from the suspect, whose father had reportedly purchased the gun four days before the shooting. Based on recovered shell casings, authorities estimate that the shooter fired around 15 to 20 shots.

Following the unfortunate incident, President Joe Biden, Representative Elissa Slotkin, and Governor Gretchen Whitmer expressed their condolences and offered their support to the families and community affected by the tragedy.

The Semeru volcano in East Java, Indonesia erupted on December 4, resulting in one fatality and 41 injuries. The eruption, which began at 14:50 local time, caused a lava dome at the summit crater to collapse due to intense precipitation, triggering a pyroclastic flow that traveled down the slopes of the volcano. The eruption sent a cloud of volcanic ash 40,000 feet (12,000 m) into the air, affecting villages in the Malang and Lumajang Regencies, causing destruction of the Gladak Perak Bridge, power interruptions and blackouts, and burying village homes and vehicles under ash. An estimated 300 families were evacuated, with some residents taking refuge in schools and village halls. 

The Indonesian Ministry of Health reported that all of the injured suffered burns caused by pyroclastic flows, with four burn victims taken to the intensive care unit for their serious injuries. The head of the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB) warned of increased volcanic activity and the presence of pyroclastic flows in the volcano, urging residents to keep a distance of at least 5 km away from the main summit crater and prohibiting individuals from approaching 1 km or closer to the crater. 

Local authorities have also warned residents to keep clear from rivers originating from Semeru as they are transporting volcanic debris. The BNPB provided aid packages, including meals ready-to-eat packs, blankets, mattresses, masks, and refugee tents to assist the displaced residents, and operations at airports were not affected. Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Governor of East Java Khofifah Indar Parawansa aided in the post-eruption recovery efforts."

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom continues to surge, with the country reporting a record 78,610 new cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours. This comes as the highly transmissible Omicron variant drives a further increase in cases. Since the virus reached the UK in late January 2020, there have been 10,523,316 confirmed cases, the most in Europe and fourth highest number worldwide, and 165,721 deaths among people who had recently tested positive. The UK has the world's 7th highest death toll and 28th highest death rate by population. The pandemic has had a severe impact on the UK's economy, caused major disruptions to education, had far-reaching impacts on society, and led to the largest fall in life expectancy in England since records began in 1981. In addition, research suggests over 1 million people in the UK have had Long COVID, with the majority reporting substantial impacts on day-to-day life. Despite the challenges, the UK's vaccination programme was the first to start in December 2020 and was, in early 2021, one of the fastest in the world. By mid-February, 15 million vaccine doses had been given to predominantly those most vulnerable to the virus. Six months later, more than 75% of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. However, as the Omicron variant continues to spread, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predict that it could cause from 25,000 to 75,000 deaths in England over the five months to April unless there are more stringent restrictions."

Borders were closed, gatherings prohibited and restrictions were put in place for a few months until the situation improved. The state budget was later doubled to address the economic impact of COVID-19. The government also established mass vaccination hubs in April 2021, and trials of sniffer dogs to detect infections at the Adelaide Airport started in mid-June. However, the state had to reintroduce several restrictions and lockdowns due to waves of outbreaks, including a 7-day lockdown in July 2021 following the emergence of a Delta variant cluster linked to Modbury Hospital. Though the state had eased most of the restrictions after achieving a high vaccination rate and opening borders to the rest of the country in November 2021, it detected the Omicron variant in two travellers from New South Wales and Victoria in December 2021. As a result, several restrictions were reinstated, exposure sites were listed and the rules for travellers entering the state were revised.

Iran's cyberwarfare capabilities continue to be a significant concern to international security, as evidenced by the recent hacking of Jerusalem Post's website by suspected Iranian hackers. Despite being both a victim and aggressor of cyberwarfare, Iran is considered an emerging military power in the field. The country's Cyber Defense Command has been operating since 2010, developing a digital fortress as part of its national information network to foil and engage attackers. Iran's cyberwarfare capabilities were highlighted in a 2021 report by a cybersecurity company, which revealed that the country operates two surveillance operations in cyberspace, targeting over 1,000 dissidents.

Iran's involvement in cyber attacks against other countries has also been extensively documented. From the cyber attack on its nuclear facility in Natanz in 2010, to accusations by western analysts of its own cyber-attacks against the United States, Israel, and Persian Gulf Arab countries, Iran's cyberwarfare capabilities continue to pose a threat to international security. In 2013, a Revolutionary Guards general boasted that Iran had the 4th biggest cyber power among the world's cyber armies.

The Iranian government has consistently denied involvement in cyber attacks against other countries, including specific allegations of their involvement in hacking American banks in 2012. Nevertheless, experts have called the conflict between Iran and the United States ""history's first known cyber-war.""

In addition to cyber attacks against other countries, the Iranian government has also been accused of engaging in propaganda campaigns through fake social media accounts. In May 2020, Reuters reported that Iranian state-run media had targeted hundreds of fake social media accounts to covertly spread pro-Iranian messaging, online since at least 2011.

The Russo-Ukrainian crisis of 2021-22 remains an ongoing military confrontation and international crisis that has seen a recent development in the form of the arrest of an alleged Russian intelligence agent by Ukrainian authorities. The military escalation between Russia and Ukraine began in late October 2021, following the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations. The situation has caused international concern and involves the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

On January 16, 2022, Russia announced that it would hold talks with NATO in Brussels two days later, following bilateral talks with the US in Geneva. Meanwhile, on January 21, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, reported that Russia had allegedly concentrated over 92,000 troops and Iskander short-range ballistic missile systems near the Ukrainian borders. Budanov said that Russia was behind protests against COVID-19 vaccinations and other protest rallies in Ukraine as preparation for a large-scale military invasion. According to Budanov, active actions are expected in late January - early February 2022.

In the most recent development, Ukrainian authorities arrested an alleged Russian intelligence agent who they claim attempted to recruit others to launch attacks in the port city of Odessa. The arrest underscores the continued tensions and security concerns in the region. Both Kyiv and Moscow accuse each other of aggressive actions and no contacts within existing negotiating platforms have been made. The situation remains tense with significant military activity and diplomatic efforts on both sides."

The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis, which began in late October 2021, has reached a critical point as talks between NATO and Russia have hit a breaking point. The crisis has caused international tension, involving not only Russia and Ukraine but also the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The escalation of tensions initially came about due to the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations in late October, coupled with reports of Russian troops massing near the Ukrainian border. The situation has since deteriorated, with both sides continuing to accuse each other of aggressive actions.

On 10 January 2022, Russia and the US held bilateral talks in Geneva to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and to confront rising tensions over Ukraine. The talks, called the Strategic Stability Dialogue, were led by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov and US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. However, talks between NATO and Russia over the situation in and around Ukraine broke down, with Poland warning that there may be a possibility of war.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has intensified diplomatic efforts to address the crisis. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has held talks with the head of the European Council and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has held talks in Brussels. The new head of the Defense Ministry, Oleksii Rezikov, has also gone to Washington to meet with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The UK has reportedly formed a consolidated rapid response unit of about 600 fighters for transfer to Ukraine.

However, the situation on the ground remains tense, with both sides continuing to accuse each other of aggressive actions. Russia has accused Ukraine of escalating tensions in Donbas and using weapons prohibited by the Minsk Package of Measures, while Ukraine has accused Russia of massing troops and allegedly preparing for a large-scale military invasion. The situation remains deadlocked on all existing negotiating platforms, with no contacts within the Normandy Format and negotiations in the Trilateral Contact Group reduced to discussing whether Russia is a party to the conflict.

In December 2021, Janes analysis concluded that major elements of the Russian 41st Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army had been repositioned to the west, reinforcing the Russian 20th Guards and 8th Guards armies already positioned closer to the Ukrainian border. Additional Russian forces were reported to have moved into Crimea, reinforcing Russian naval and ground units already deployed there. This has heightened concerns that the current crisis could escalate into a full-blown military confrontation. 

As tensions continue to rise, the international community is calling on both sides to show restraint, with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg calling on the West to send Russia ""a clear signal calling for reducing tension, avoiding any escalation in and around Ukraine."""

The 110th edition of the tournament will be part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour calendars in the Grand Slam category. It will consist of men's and women's singles and doubles draws, mixed doubles events, junior competitions, and wheelchair events. 

Last year's winners Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka are the defending champions in Men's Singles and Women's Singles, respectively. However, Novak Djokovic's participation in the tournament has been uncertain. Djokovic had been granted a medical exemption from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination by Tennis Australia, but upon arriving in Australia on 5 January 2022, he was detained by the Australian Border Force as his visa did not meet the country's entry requirements for unvaccinated travellers. Djokovic's lawyers requested an injunction against deportation, which allowed Djokovic to remain confined in a detention hotel pending the outcome of the appeal.

On 10 January 2022, the Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in Djokovic's favour, ordered his release from detention, and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses. The reason for the ruling was that Australian officials reneged on an agreement to give Djokovic sufficient time to contact his lawyers and tennis authorities before his official interview, leading the Australian government to concede that they treated Djokovic unreasonably. However, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Alex Hawke, cancelled Djokovic's visa on ""health and good order grounds.""

Apart from Djokovic's visa controversy, the tournament will be held across a series of 25 courts, including the four main show courts of Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena, Margaret Court Arena, and 1573 Arena. The total prize money for 2022 increased by 4.5% to a tournament record A$75,000,000. Tennis fans and followers can also watch the games online through multiple sports streaming platforms."

The assailant was later identified as Malik Faisal Akram. He demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, who is currently serving a prison sentence in the US for terrorism-related offences. Negotiations ensued, during which the assailant allowed the congregation members to call their loved ones to let them know that they were safe.

After more than 12 hours of negotiations, law enforcement officials heard gunshots and made the decision to enter the building, where they found the assailant dead. It was later revealed that he had been shot by police. All four hostages were successfully rescued unharmed. 

The White House closely monitored the situation, and Israeli leaders expressed their support for the congregation members and their condemnation of the hostage-taking. Aafia Siddiqui's current legal representative also condemned the incident, stating that she had no involvement with the hostage crisis.

Congregation Beth Israel is a Reform Judaism synagogue located in Colleyville, Texas, and was opened in 1999 with 25 families and a religious school with 75 children. The synagogue's Rabbi is Charlie Cytron-Walker, who was one of the hostages taken during the incident. 

The incident has since sparked debates around gun control laws in the United States, which have become a contentious topic in recent years. Law enforcement officials are still investigating the situation to determine how the assailant was able to obtain his weapon and plan the operation."

On 15 January 2022, a volcanic eruption on Hunga Tonga island in Tonga caused tsunamis that affected several countries across the Pacific Ocean, including Fiji, American Samoa, New Zealand, Australia, Chile, and Ecuador. The eruption followed an initial eruption on 20 December 2021 that caused ash clouds in the stratosphere and led to advisory notices to airlines. The 15 January eruption caused a 5.8 magnitude earthquake and a 1.2-meter tsunami in Tonga. Reports of damage and casualties are still emerging due to communication issues, but Atata Island near Nukuʻalofa was submerged, and two people were killed by a small tsunami in Lambayeque, Peru. Rescue operations are underway in Tonga, and New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has expressed concern and discussed providing aid to Tonga. 

Tsunami warnings were issued across Oceania, Asia, and the Americas, and several countries reported minor tsunami activity. In Fiji, the tidal gauge recorded a wave measuring 20 centimeters. A tsunami measuring 0.61 meters was recorded in American Samoa, and waves up to 0.8 meters were recorded in Hanalei, Hawaii. The tsunami caused flooding in Mahinepua Bay in New Zealand, but there were no casualties reported. On the coast of Peru, the above-mentioned small tsunami caused damage and injuries, but no further details have been provided yet. In Chile, waves up to 2 meters struck the coastline, damaging piers, carrying boats, and hitting beaches. Several warnings and evacuation orders were issued, and the Chilean National Office for Emergency advised people to sustain on their emergency supplies and aid. 

The eruption of Hunga Tonga also ejected a large amount of volcanic material into the stratosphere, creating a potential temporary climate effect. Reports suggest the eruption was a one-in-1000-year event, and little information is available on the extent of damage and casualties from Tonga. Scientists and officials continue to monitor the situation and provide assistance to those affected."

On January 20, 2022, ISIL militants carried out a large-scale attack on Al-Sina'a prison in the city of Al-Hasakah, aiming to free arrested fighters of the Islamic State. The attack, which involved a car bomb and heavy weapons fire, triggered a prison riot in which prisoners obtained weapons from the armoury and attacked prison staff. Several prisoners managed to escape and the prison was subsequently occupied by armed prisoners.

Over the next day, clashes between ISIL militants and Kurdish forces continued as ISIL fighters spread to the Al-Zouhour area of Al-Hasakah city and solidified control of the prison. The International Coalition dispatched military aircraft to support Kurdish forces, and 89 of the escaped prisoners were tracked down and arrested by SDF forces.

The clash led to the death of 67 people as per the latest reports. The SOHR reported that clashes continued between ISIL and Kurdish forces over control of the prison and its surrounding areas. Al-Hasakah city also saw power cuts in several areas due to the ongoing clashes. This is the largest attack committed by the Islamic State since it lost its last key Syrian territory in 2019."

Singapore's Ministry of Health has recently announced the extension of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, which will now include children and teenagers in the age group of 12-17. From March 14, eligible individuals in this age group who have completed their primary vaccination regimen with an mRNA vaccine, namely Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, will be able to register for a booster dose. This comes as a new measure taken by the Singaporean Government to further strengthen the immunity levels against the virus and combat the spread of new variants.

Singapore had already begun administering booster shots for senior citizens above the age of 60 from September 14, followed by those above 50 from October 4 and individuals above 30 from October 9. The booster shots are available for the eligible population who have completed their second dose before six months. From November 24, the eligible population who completed their second dose before five months were also allowed to receive booster shots of all age groups. On December 10, the use of booster shots was extended to individuals above 18 years of age starting from December 14.

Singapore has been leading the way in its COVID-19 vaccination drive, with over 88% of its total population and more than 91% of its eligible population having completed their vaccination regimen. The government had invested more than SGD 1 billion to secure advanced purchase agreements with vaccine candidates such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and CoronaVac. 

The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, appointed by the Singapore government in October 2020, had advised and assessed the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for use in Singapore. In December 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorized for use, and on February 3, 2021, Moderna's vaccine was approved for use. The government approved Sinovac's vaccine for use in private healthcare settings in June 2021. From December 10, 2021, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will also be available for children aged 5 to 11 years. 

Singapore has also been recognizing all COVID-19 vaccines listed under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) from August 10, 2021. This means that all individuals inoculated with a WHO-approved vaccine are considered fully vaccinated and entitled to vaccination-differentiated safe management measures and travel concessions. Moreover, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will also issue a tamper-proof vaccination sticker that is to be pasted onto travel documents and can serve as proof of vaccination for travelers who have received a COVID-19 vaccine under the EUL and present a valid English-language certificate. Furthermore, on September 24, 2021, Singapore and Malaysia also announced the mutual recognition of vaccination certificates to facilitate travel between the two countries."

Iceland, a country with a long history of whaling, has announced that it will end the practice by 2024. The decision was made due to the decreasing price of whale meat, as well as ongoing pressure from animal rights groups and changing attitudes towards the industry. Iceland has been one of the few countries that still maintain a whaling fleet and formally object to a moratorium established by the International Whaling Commission in 1986. One company had focused on hunting fin whales for export to Japan, while the only other one hunted minke whales for domestic consumption until 2020. In 2018, Icelandic whalers were accused of slaughtering a blue whale, which is an endangered species. Since 2019, whaling has been temporarily paused due to coronavirus restrictions, competition from subsidized Japanese whaling, and increasing domestic whale watching tourism. The decision to end whaling in Iceland has been welcomed by animal rights groups and supporters of sustainable tourism."

Operation Unifier, the Canadian Armed Forces' mission to assist the security and military capabilities of Ukraine, has undergone significant changes as of recent. In response to growing tensions and conflict in Ukraine, Canada has withdrawn its military advisors from the country and relocated them to an undisclosed destination in Europe. Additionally, it has suspended all operations at its embassy in Kyiv and moved its diplomatic staff to Lviv.

Operation Unifier began in the wake of separatist movements in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and pro-Russian unrest, as part of the Multinational Joint Commission with the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and Denmark aimed at reforming Ukraine's military.

The operation has included training provided by about 200 Canadian soldiers, rotating every six months, with a small Swedish contingent also operating within the framework. Since its inception, over 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained under Operation Unifier.

However, following recent developments in Ukraine, Canada has made significant changes to its involvement. The diplomatic staff has been moved to Lviv and all embassy operations in Kyiv have been suspended. Additionally, Canada has withdrawn its military advisors from Ukraine and relocated them to an undisclosed location in Europe.

The changes come as tensions continue to rise in Ukraine, with conflict escalating in recent months. Despite the changes to Canada's involvement, the broader mission of Operation Unifier remains to help develop the region, maintain security, democracy, and stability, and provide humanitarian aid. The operation has been extended until March 2025, with an increase in staff bringing the complement to 260."

The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation, a regulation of the European Union and Euratom, has been confirmed by the European Court of Justice to be in compliance with the treaties of the European Union. The court dismissed Hungary and Poland's challenges against the regulation, which will now allow the European Commission to suspend funds from the EU budget to member states that have rule of law issues likely to affect the management of EU funds. This regulation was proposed by the European Commission in May 2018 to address democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland, and after trilogue meetings, a legislative draft was published on 5 November 2020. The regulation was adopted by the Council on 14 December 2020 and by the European Parliament on 16 December 2020, and it provides for the Commission to propose measures against a member state that violates the principles of the rule of law. These measures include the suspension of payments or commitments, and a prohibition on entering into new legal commitments. Despite the adoption of the regulation, there have been disputes regarding its implementation, with the European Council's declaratory statements adopted on 10 and 11 December 2020 calling for the Commission to await the outcome of legal challenges before implementing it. The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 25 March 2021, urging the Commission to avoid any further delay in the application of the regulation and threatened legal action against the Commission if it did not provide information on ongoing investigations into breaches of the principles of the rule of law. On 10 June 2021, the European Parliament adopted another resolution calling on the Commission to fulfil its obligations under the regulation within two weeks and notifying the Commission that it would start preparations for legal action against the Commission for failure to act. The Commission rejected the ultimatum on 23 August 2021 with a five-page letter. Despite these disputes, the confirmation of the regulation by the European Court of Justice will allow the European Commission to take measures against member states that violate the principles of the rule of law."

The Australian government maintains a list of designated terrorist organisations, which includes Hamas in its entirety, including its political wing, along with 25 other foreign organisations as of August 2021. Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham, and the Guardians of Religion Organization have also recently been designated as terrorist organisations. The list was first created in 2002 under the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act, which inserted various terrorist organisation offences into the Criminal Code Act. The protocol for listing, de-listing, and re-listing is overseen by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Attorney-General's Department, and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre monitors financial transactions involving listed terrorist organisations. Those who finance terrorism or provide support to a terrorist organisation may face prosecution by the Australian Federal Police, State police forces, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions under Australian and international law."
