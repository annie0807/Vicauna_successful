Queensland's COVID-19 situation has taken a turn with Cairns and Yarrabah entering a snap three-day lockdown. This came after an ""unexpected"" case of COVID-19 was reported in a taxi driver from Kanimbla who was infectious in Far North Queensland for 10 days. The lockdown was implemented to curb any potential community transmission. The latest case marks a departure from Queensland's successful fight against COVID-19, which had recorded only seven deaths and low infection rates. The state had opened its border to all Australian states and territories except Western Australia on 1 February 2021. However, due to the recent spike in cases across the country, border closures and restrictions have been reinstated. Additionally, Queensland has faced several lockdowns, with the most recent being implemented on 31 July 2021, affecting 11 local government areas in South East Queensland due to the Delta COVID variant. Other events, such as the Ekka agricultural show, the Big Pineapple Music Festival, and the Brisbane and Gold Coast New Year's Eve fireworks were cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions. Queensland's response to the pandemic was swift and effective, with key directions given to the Chief Health Officer to enforce restrictions on movement, gatherings, and business activities, among other things. Despite these efforts, the recent spike in cases underscores the need for continued vigilance in the face of the pandemic."

Palau has achieved herd immunity against COVID-19 as 80% of its population over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated. This milestone comes after the country registered its first case of COVID-19 on 31 May 2021 and a second case on 11 June 2021. However, both cases were quickly contained and did not lead to wider community transmission. Palau began implementing border controls early on, and by March 2020, the country's borders were closed, schools were shut, and travel was suspended. The President of Palau, Thomas Remengesau Jr., also suspended all charter flights from China, Macau, and Hong Kong. Palauans began receiving COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021, with an estimated 96% of adults (18 years and over) fully vaccinated by 26 May, and 97% of the adult population vaccinated by the time the first case was detected. As a member of the Compact of Free Association with the United States, Palau has received vaccines from Operation Warp Speed, and plans were announced to start vaccinating adolescents from 12 to 17. With the country's successful vaccination rollout, tourism is set to reopen in Palau, with plans to vaccinate teenagers underway."

Russia and Egypt have a long history of diplomatic relations, dating back to before the 16th century, and their relationship has continued to evolve over time. In recent years, both countries have worked to strengthen their ties in various areas, including military and trade cooperation.

One major development in the relationship between Russia and Egypt was the resumption of direct commercial flights between the two countries, which had been suspended since the Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing in 2015. On March 28, 2021, a Rossiya Airlines passenger plane landed in Sharm El Sheikh, carrying 518 passengers, most of whom were Russian tourists. The flight was greeted with a water cannon salute, roses and flags as a sign of the growing relationship between the two countries.

The resumption of direct flights is just one example of the recent cooperation between Russia and Egypt. In November 2015, the two countries signed a deal allowing Russian and Egyptian warplanes to use each other's airbases and airspace, and in December 2017, they signed agreements for Russia to build Egypt's first nuclear reactor and supply nuclear fuel for the same. Additionally, plans for a ""Russian Industrial Zone"" along the Suez Canal were discussed.

Russia has also been a staunch supporter of the Syrian government in the Syrian civil war, while Egypt has backed the House of Representatives in the ongoing Libyan Civil War. As of 2020, Egypt reportedly dispatched 150 troops to assist the Syrian government.

Tourism and higher education have also played a role in the relationship between Russia and Egypt. Egypt is the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroad, and the opening of the Egyptian Russian University in 2006 has offered training in pharmacy and engineering.

Overall, the relationship between Russia and Egypt continues to evolve and deepen, with both countries working to strengthen their ties in various areas of cooperation."

Algeria is currently facing multiple wildfires that started on August 9, 2021. The fires have affected various regions, with the Kabyle region being hit the hardest. As of latest reports, the death toll has risen to 65, with 37 civilians and 28 soldiers losing their lives. In response to the ongoing crisis, Algerian authorities have deployed soldiers to the affected areas to help with the evacuation and contain the blazes.

On August 10, fires continued to ravage the region, causing widespread devastation to Mediterranean trees, olive groves, and killing hundreds of livestock. Distant villages are struggling with limited access to water, leading some residents to flee while others try to fend off the flames with buckets, branches, and basic tools. Unfortunately, firefighting aircraft are not readily available to assist in the firefighting efforts.

In a bid to mourn the loss of lives, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has declared three days of national mourning. Currently, Algeria is battling a total of 69 fires, which have caused several injuries and displaced thousands of people. The situation remains critical, and the Algerian government is calling for increased international support to help fight the wildfires."

Lebanon's ongoing liquidity crisis, which began in August 2019, has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 Beirut port explosion. The crisis, caused by acute USD shortages and growing probabilities of the government defaulting on its maturing debt obligations, has led to a black market exchange rate of 15,200 LBP per USD in June 2021, up from 1,600 LBP per USD in the fourth quarter of 2019. Prices of consumer goods have increased by 580% since October 2019, resulting in the worst economic crisis in decades and forcing 785 restaurants and cafes to close, with 25,000 employees losing their jobs.

As a consequence of the liquidity crisis, the prime minister resigned, the debt to GDP ratio sits at 170%, and Lebanon's sovereign debt has become junk rated. Foreign currency inflows have slowed, resulting in sharp restrictions on dollar withdrawals and transfers by commercial banks to maintain reserves. The inability to pay for imports due to the shortage of US dollars has caused significant inflation, undercutting Lebanon's purchasing power and leading to an increase in poverty.

In the latest development, the Central Bank of Lebanon announced the end of fuel subsidies, offering ""credit lines for fuel imports based on the market price for the Lebanese pound."" This decision is expected to lead to a significant increase in fuel prices amid the ongoing economic crisis. Meanwhile, the World Bank warns that the economic crisis in Lebanon would be one of the three most severe since the mid-19th century if the ""bankrupt economic system, which benefited a few for so long,"" is not reformed."

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has secured the dissolution of the House of Commons, paving the way for a federal election scheduled to take place on September 20, 2021. The upcoming election aims to elect members of the House of Commons to the 44th Canadian Parliament. The fixed-date provisions of the Canada Elections Act require federal elections to be held on the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year after the polling day of the previous election. However, because the current government is a minority government, the election can be held earlier if Parliament is dissolved by the Governor General of Canada due to a motion of no confidence in the government or at the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada for a snap election. As a result of the election call, a by-election in Haldimand-Norfolk has been cancelled. 

In the 2019 federal election, the Liberals, led by incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, lost their majority but won the most seats. The Conservatives continued as the Official Opposition with Andrew Scheer temporarily remaining as Leader of the Opposition until announcing his resignation, triggering a leadership election. The Bloc Québécois became the third party. The New Democrats lost seats but maintained official party status, and although the Greens increased their seats in the House of Commons, they ultimately failed to achieve the required number of MPs—twelve—for official party status.

Since this is an election year, several MPs have announced that they will not be running again in the upcoming federal election.

The political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban over control of Panjshir Province has heated up with new developments. Russian intelligence sources have reported that Panjshir resistance forces, loyal to Amrullah Saleh, have successfully managed to recapture Charikar and the surrounding areas of Parwan Province from the Taliban. This is a significant development as the Taliban have been gaining control of more regions in Afghanistan since the Fall of Kabul in 2021. 

The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley in the province, has been moving military equipment and commanders of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps into the region. Amrullah Saleh himself declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley in August 2021, citing constitutional provisions, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Mohammadi. 

While the Panjshir Valley has been described as ""under siege on all sides"" by one observer, it has not come under direct attack as of August 2021. Negotiations for a peaceful end to the political impasse have been discussed, but the recent recapture of Charikar and Parwan by Panjshir resistance forces could escalate the situation. The conflict between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban over Panjshir Province continues to be a tense political and military standoff."

The 2021 Niger attacks have been ongoing throughout the year, with militants targeting civilians and soldiers in various regions of the country. The attacks have resulted in the deaths of at least 455 people and more than 100 others injured. In the most recent attack, gunmen opened fire on worshippers at a mosque in the village of Theim, killing 16 people.

The attacks began in January, with two major attacks that left over 100 civilians dead in single incidents. Since then, attacks have been carried out every month of the year, with the most deadly attack occurring in March, when militants attacked three villages in the Tahoua region, killing 137 people.

The attackers are believed to be Islamist militants who have crossed the border from Mali to carry out their attacks. The exact terrorist organization responsible for the attacks is not clear, though Boko Haram and ISIS have been active in the region in recent years.

The attacks have taken place during a time of political turmoil in Niger, with presidential and regional elections being held earlier this year. The attacks have also targeted members of the electoral commission.

The government of Niger has dispatched soldiers to the border in response to the attacks, and newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum has declared three days of national mourning for the victims. The international community has condemned the attacks and offered support to Niger in the fight against terrorism."

Operation Allies Refuge is an ongoing US military operation to evacuate selected at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, US embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan. The operation was officially introduced by the Biden administration on July 14 and is concurrent with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan.

On July 30, the first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing, with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants still awaiting relocation. However, following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, the operation's scope has been expanded to include the evacuation of US citizens, permanent residents, and refugees.

Since August 15, thousands of people have been evacuated from the Kabul International Airport, which is under US military control, via multiple flights. On August 22, the Department of Defense activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, mobilizing 18 commercial planes from various airlines to transport Afghans arriving at US bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates to Europe and eventually the United States.

According to United States Army major general William D. Taylor, the US has evacuated 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans, in the past few weeks. However, the evacuation efforts have not been without casualties, with at least eight people killed in and around the airport due to crowding and other factors."

As the situation in Afghanistan became increasingly volatile, the Biden administration announced on August 12 that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to the Kabul International Airport to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. Following the fall of Kabul on August 15, the military presence at the airport was expanded to nearly 6,000 troops, with the U.S. military taking control of air traffic control.

Since August 17, over 7,000 people have been evacuated by U.S. military flights from the country, including more than 3,200 U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and refugees, and nearly 2,000 Afghan interpreters who were flown to the U.S. for SIV processing. On August 22, the Department of Defense ordered the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for the third time and sent 18 planes that will be used by the U.S. military to help evacuate American citizens.

The evacuation efforts have not been without casualties. By August 16, at least eight people had been killed at the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes. At least two people were seen falling to their deaths from the sky after clinging to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane, while at least three people clinging to the side of an Air Force jet were killed after being run over. Remains of another dead Afghan were found in the landing gear of the American C-17 after the pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in a nearby country because they were unable to retract the landing gear.

The Panjshir conflict, which began on 17 August 2021 following the Fall of Kabul, is still ongoing between the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (controlled by the Taliban). As of August 2021, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and is ""the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands,"" according to The Week. The population of the Panjshir valley consists of a majority of ethnic Tajik people, unlike the Taliban's majority, who are Pashtuns. The valley is well known for its natural defenses, and despite being under siege on all sides, it has not come under direct attack.

The Panjshir resistance is led by Ahmad Massoud, who is working with self-proclaimed acting president Amrullah Saleh. They refuse to surrender the Panjshir Valley to the Taliban and say that war will be ""unavoidable"" if the Taliban refuse to engage in dialogue on forming a comprehensive government. Prior to the Fall of Kabul, Panjshiris moved military equipment, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by commanders and soldiers of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid-August 2021. Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a ""handful of armored humvees"" in the valley.

There are differences between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud. The former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan, which supported the Taliban. As a result, Massoud was more willing to negotiate with the Taliban. By 22 August, the resistance also confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban on their own, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. According to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military.

As of August 2021, a negotiated end to the political impasse has been attempted, with Saleh calling for a ""peace deal"" with the Taliban. On 18 August, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, indicated the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government as a means of diffusing the stalemate. On 21 August, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to ""discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans."" On 22 August, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possibly mediate. Meanwhile, resistance spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary informed the Agence France-Presse that Ahmad Massoud's group would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict under the condition that a future government implemented a system of ""decentralization"" and ""equal rights"" across the country.

The USA and Western forces are commented as lowly supportive of this movement due to ongoing evacuation of Kabul depending fully on the Taliban's benevolence. Massoud's Washington Post op-ed requesting Western support has been analyzed as evidence of the absence of direct communication and support between the resistance and the US government."

The deadliest attacks were carried out against civilians, with the January and March attacks leaving over 100 civilians dead in single incidents – marking the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. The exact terrorist organization that carried out the attacks is not yet clear.

Recent attacks have targeted both military and civilian targets. In August, around 100 heavily armed Boko Haram militants attacked a military post in Diffa, Niger, killing 16 soldiers and wounding nine others. In retaliation, security forces killed around 50 Islamist insurgents in a gun battle.

Other recent attacks on civilians include the targeting of a mosque in the Tillaberi region, killing 16 people, including children, and a raid on the village of Darey-Daye, Niger, which left 37 people dead while they were tending their farms.

More than 150 people were wounded. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP), who had threatened the airport in recent days, have claimed responsibility for the attack.

The situation at the airport had become increasingly dangerous in recent days, with crowds of Afghan citizens and foreign nationals seeking to flee the country amid the Taliban takeover. Multiple countries had advised their citizens to avoid the airport due to a high risk of terrorist attacks.

The suicide bomber targeted one of the airport's entrances, leading to chaotic scenes as gunfire erupted and all gates were closed. A second explosion occurred at Baron Gate, a processing center for Afghan people fleeing the country to escape Taliban control, where many American citizens had gathered for rescue and evacuation in the past.

The toll from the attack is staggering, with 90 Afghan civilians and 13 American servicemembers confirmed dead. More than 150 others were injured, including a number of Taliban members and foreign soldiers. Among the injured were five U.S. personnel, including three U.S. Marines. The attack marks the deadliest day for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a decade.

ISIL-KP's claim of responsibility for the attack has led to widespread condemnation from countries around the world. Even the Taliban, through a tweet by their spokesperson, has condemned the attack, saying ""evil circles will be strictly stopped."" French President Emmanuel Macron has voiced full support for coordinating with ""American allies"" in response to the explosions.

According to reports, one of those killed was involved in the planning of the 2021 Kabul airport attack, which targeted the United States. The strike was carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper drone with guided munitions to minimize civilian casualties.

The attack was carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) and left at least 182 people dead, including 13 members of the United States military and 169 Afghan civilians. The attack also injured at least 150 people, including 18 US military personnel and Taliban members.

Amid the security concerns in Afghanistan following the Taliban's takeover, the airport became the only secure way out of the country. US President Joe Biden had warned of the increasing threat posed by the ISIL-KP, who claimed responsibility for the attack, to US personnel and civilians near the airport.

On August 27, 2021, the United States launched an airstrike against an ISIL-KP member in Nangarhar Province. According to two defense officials, the strike was carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper drone with guided munitions to minimize civilian casualties, and two Islamic State members were killed and one was wounded. The strike targeted an individual believed to have been planning more attacks in Kabul.

The Taliban and ISIL-KP, despite both being jihadist groups, are enemies and have fought a bloody war against each other. The Taliban condemned the attack and have expressed their willingness to capture ISIL-KP leader Shahab al-Muhajir.

Many nations expressed condemnation for the Kabul airport attack and solidarity with the victims and troops conducting evacuations at the airport. The European Commission and the United Nations likewise condemned the attack. The United Kingdom said that civilian evacuations would continue in spite of the attack.

US President Joe Biden honored the American service members who were killed and stated that the US had evacuated more than 100,000 Americans, Afghans, and others. He expressed deep sorrow for the Afghan victims as well and vowed to hunt down those who wished harm upon the US.

On August 27, the Taliban appointed Khalil Haqqani, a designated terrorist with a US$5 million bounty, as head of security in Kabul. Following the 2021 Kabul airport attack, the Taliban condemned the attack and promised to capture the ISIS-K leader. In response, the U.S. launched an airstrike on August 27 that killed two ""high-profiled"" ISIS targets and injured a third person.

Reports indicate that some of those killed had previously worked for international organizations and held visas allowing them entry to the United States. The majority of the casualties were residents of the area. This comes after another airstrike on August 27, which killed two high-profile members of ISIS-K in Nangarhar Province.

The Panjshir conflict is an ongoing conflict between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, controlled by the Taliban, and the Panjshir resistance, led by the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, in the Panjshir Valley. The valley has been the only region out of Taliban's control since the fall of Kabul on August 15, 2021. The Panjshir Valley is known for its natural defences and has never fallen to the Soviet Union during the 1980s nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990s.

The resistance began after Amrullah Saleh, the former vice president of Afghanistan, declared himself the legitimate president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from the Panjshir Valley, following the fall of Kabul. He was joined by Ahmad Massoud, the son of the late anti-Taliban leader Ahmed Shah Massoud, who had escaped to Panjshir Province with Afghan National Army commanders, soldiers and anti-Taliban activists.

As of August 2021, the resistance consisted of approximately 7,000 personnel, according to a Russian estimate. On August 26, 2021, the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan reportedly recaptured the Banu, Deh Salah and Pol-e-Hesar districts. However, on August 29, 2021, the Taliban denied that their fighters were trying to enter the valley, contradicting information from a member of the Taliban cultural commission.

On August 31, 2021, eight Taliban fighters were killed while trying to infiltrate the western part of Pansjhir with two resistance fighters wounded. Fahim Dashty said that the attack was likely done to test the area's defenses.

On September 1, 2021, the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan reported that its fighters had killed eight Taliban members in clashes in the Panjshir Valley. A large number of Taliban forces have been deployed near the valley, while negotiations take place in order to resolve the conflict.

The international community has shown little support for the resistance, as they focus on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul and seek the Taliban's cooperation to do so. The possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government to end the stalemate has been suggested. Meanwhile, Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan have volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it can be deemed illegal."
23,47,"UPDATED VERSION:

The Panjshir conflict between the National Resistance Front (NRF) and the Taliban has taken a new turn as the Taliban enters the Panjshir Valley and clashes with the NRF forces. Led by Ahmad Massoud, the NRF has held out in the valley since the fall of Kabul amid a worsening security situation in the region. Both sides claim significant casualties as the Taliban reports gaining some territory in the valley.

The conflict began on August 17, 2021, following the fall of Kabul and the Taliban’s takeover of the country. The NRF declared resistance, and both sides agreed to a ceasefire and talks to resolve the issue. However, by September 1, it was reported that talks had failed, and fighting had resumed between the sides.

The Panjshir Valley is known for its natural defenses, surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, and had never fallen to the Soviets in the 1980s or the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990s. The population of the valley is mostly ethnic Tajik, while the majority of the Taliban is Pashtun.

The NRF movement consists of Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, including ex-Mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and other anti-Taliban activists. Most of them regrouped in Baghlan Province before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan. 

As of August 2021, the Panjshir Valley was reportedly the only region out of the Taliban's reach but with the latest clashes with the Taliban, it appears that the situation has changed. The international community remains focused on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul and has yet to declare any support for the NRF movement.

The situation in Afghanistan continues to be volatile, with civilians caught in the crossfire between warring factions. The NRF and the Taliban must find a way to resolve their differences peacefully to prevent further loss of life and displacement of civilians."

Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation launched by the Biden administration in July 2021 to airlift from Afghanistan at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants. As the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans took place, US personnel aided NATO and regional allies in their respective evacuation efforts from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.

Under the operation, SIV applicants were flown to the United States, where they were housed by the US military as they complete their visa requirements. However, as the Taliban gained ground across the country and took over Kabul, the operation expanded to include the airlifting of all embassy personnel, American nationals, and eligible Afghans seeking refuge from the country.

Following the August 31 withdrawal deadline, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain revealed that approximately 100 Americans remained in Afghanistan, and the Biden administration was still working to rescue them. The operation faced significant challenges, with at least 195 people killed at or near the Kabul airport, and others injured or killed in stampedes and gun incidents.

Despite the difficulties, the operation successfully airlifted over 122,000 people from Afghanistan, including around 6,000 US citizens and over 116,000 Afghans, before the US military's withdrawal. The Department of Defense activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation, with 18 planes from different commercial companies transporting thousands of Afghans to US bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.

With the Taliban now in control of Afghanistan, the future of the country remains uncertain as millions of Afghans face potential persecution and human rights abuses. However, the success of Operation Allies Refuge offers hope to the many vulnerable Afghans who were able to escape the country and find safety elsewhere."

At least one person was killed and over 1.6 million were left without electricity following a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that occurred just outside the tourist city of Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico on September 7th. The earthquake, which struck at 20:47 local time, was classified as a thrust faulting event located on or near the subduction zone boundary of the Caribbean Plate and Cocos Plate, and had an estimated intensity of VII on the MMI scale. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, earthquakes of this size are typically 40x20 km in rupture size. The earthquake occurred on the anniversary of the 2017 Chiapas earthquake which measured Mw 8.2 and killed at least 100 people. 

The earthquake caused damage to some buildings in Acapulco, which is located just 3 km from the epicenter of the quake, and resulted in numerous gas leaks in the area. A tsunami measuring 1.2 feet or 0.37 meters was also recorded in Acapulco. The earthquake occurred at the southern extent of the Guerrero Gap, which is a seismic gap capable of generating a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. 

The mayor of Acapulco, Adela Román, urged residents to remain calm while the situation was being assessed. Meanwhile, Héctor Astudillo, the governor of Guerrero, reported that a person was killed in Coyuca de Benítez due to a falling pole."

Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation launched to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians from Afghanistan, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants. The operation was launched along with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans.

SIV applicants were airlifted to the United States, where they were temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their SIV requirements. The name for the operation was unveiled by the Biden administration in July 2021.

In August, following continued Taliban victories across Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced the deployment of 3,000 U.S. troops to Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, where they helped evacuate embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants.

The situation quickly escalated following the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, resulting in chaotic scenes of Afghans attempting to force themselves aboard military planes. The Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. U.S. military took control over the security and air traffic control of the airport later in the day, and Operation Allies Refuge became concurrent with a new effort to airlift all SIV applicants, embassy personnel, American nationals, and eligible Afghans seeking to flee the country.

In the weeks following, the U.S. military continued to evacuate individuals from Afghanistan. As of September 2, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that 21 Americans have been evacuated from Afghanistan.

Tragically, there have also been casualties associated with the evacuation effort, including at least 182 people who were killed and more than 200 others who were wounded during a suicide bombing attack at the airport on August 26, when evacuations were underway. The attack was carried out by Islamic State militants. Among the dead were 169 Afghan civilians and 13 US service members. Additionally, a nine-month-old baby died after arriving at the Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, making her the first death of an evacuee on American soil.

As of now, though the U.S. military has largely withdrawn from the country, the situation in Afghanistan remains volatile, with many individuals still seeking refuge and support."

Since 2001, the United States government has conducted multiple drone strikes in Afghanistan, with a significant increase in frequency during Donald Trump's presidency. As of 2021, there have been at least 13,074 airstrikes, resulting in at least 4,138 deaths, including 310 civilians and 73 children. The Afghan Air Force has also carried out strikes. However, the legality and efficacy of drone strikes have been called into question, with Amnesty International USA criticizing the high number of civilian casualties.

In a recent development, Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. has confirmed that a U.S. drone strike on August 29 near Kabul International Airport, which was intended to target ISIL-K militants, actually killed 10 Afghan civilians instead. The strike has sparked international outrage and calls for accountability, with the U.S. government now facing intense scrutiny over its use of drone strikes in Afghanistan."

On September 18, 2021, hundreds of people gathered near the United States Capitol for a rally in support of those who were arrested and charged following the January 6 attack on the Capitol. The event, called Justice for J6, was organized by Look Ahead America, a nonprofit led by former Trump campaign staffer Matt Braynard. Amid concerns over potential violence, a protective fence was erected around the Capitol building prior to the rally.

A counter-rally was also scheduled for the same day, heightening tensions. The Department of Homeland Security issued an intelligence briefing memo to state and local law enforcement agencies, warning of potential violence at the rally and on the day before.

Despite concerns, the rally was attended by only a small crowd of around 400 to 450 people. Among them, at least four individuals were arrested for various felonies. One man was found to be in possession of a knife, while another was found to be in possession of a gun.

Former President Donald Trump had called the rally a ""setup"" for Republican voters and criticized the security measures put in place. Far-right groups like the Proud Boys also urged members not to attend the event.

The rally served as a demonstration of solidarity with those facing charges related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol."

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has released the Pandora Papers, a groundbreaking leak of 11.9 million documents that exposes secret wealth, tax evasion, and money laundering by 330 politicians, including 35 national leaders, and multiple high-profile celebrities worldwide. The data reveals the details of over 29,000 beneficiaries among 27,000 companies and 130 billionaires. This makes it the most comprehensive offshore data leak in history, surpassing the Panama Papers by over 400,000 documents.

The leaked documents also reveal how Tony Blair, the former British Prime Minister, allegedly saved £312,000 in stamp duty on the purchase of a £6.45 million London property by purchasing it through Romanstone International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company. The move, while not illegal, highlights the use of offshore companies and tax havens by the wealthy elite.

ICIJ Executive Director, Gerard Ryle, states that the Pandora Papers expose a system that is “set up to benefit the wealthiest people in the world at the expense of everybody else.” The revelations have sparked calls for greater transparency and tighter controls on the use of offshore companies for tax avoidance and money laundering."

The Pandora Papers leak has revealed the hidden wealth, tax evasion, and money laundering of 29,000 beneficiaries across 27,000 companies, including 35 national leaders and 330 politicians, alongside prominent celebrities and business personalities around the world. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) disclosed 11.9 million leaked documents, the largest offshore data leak in history, surpassing the previous release of the Panama Papers by nearly half a million documents. The ICIJ worked with journalists from 117 countries, including news organizations such as The Washington Post, L'Espresso, Le Monde, El País, Süddeutsche Zeitung, PBS program Frontline, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, The Guardian, and the BBC's Panorama.

Among the notable figures mentioned are former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Montenegrin President Milo Đukanović, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim, Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba, and Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso. Additionally, 130 billionaires were named in the leak, including model Claudia Schiffer, Indian cricket player Sachin Tendulkar, Alexandre Cazes (the founder of the dark web site AlphaBay), Pep Guardiola, Julio Iglesias, and Colombian singer Shakira, who was incorporating new offshore entities while on trial for tax evasion. 

The ICIJ uncovered evidence indicating that an estimated US$32 trillion (excluding non-monetary assets like real estate, art, and jewelry) may be hidden from being taxed. The leak includes documents, images, emails, and spreadsheets from 14 financial service providers in countries like Panama, Switzerland, and the UAE. Alemán, Cordero, Galindo & Lee, or Alcogal, a Panamanian law firm referred to as the ""law firm of the Latin American elite,"" created at least 14,000 shell companies and trusts in tax havens and was named more than any other offshore provider in the leaked documents.

A deadly earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 struck Harnai in Balochistan, Pakistan, killing at least 24 people and injuring around 200 others. The earthquake occurred on October 7, 2021, near the anniversary of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which killed 87,000 people. The tectonic setting of the area is greatly influenced by the ongoing oblique convergence between the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate, resulting in thrust faulting in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya region. In the Balochistan region, the convergence involves the large Chaman Fault, a strike-slip structure and many thrust faults.

The earthquake collapsed many homes where residents were asleep, mostly women and children. An unspecified number of residents were buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings and rescued by survivors. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) (PDMA) reported severe damage from the quake in the Harnai District and Shahrag area, where at least 70 homes were affected. Damage was also reported in the cities of Sibi and Quetta.

Following the earthquake, troops from the Pakistan Army were dispatched to Harnai to aid in rescue and relief operations. The Inter-Services Public Relations, army, medical personnel, response workers, and officials are working together to coordinate the rescue and relief works. A team of search and rescue individuals from Rawalpindi was sent to Harnai to find survivors among the wreckage.

Protests by Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government ended on 2 October 2021, after the government agreed to lift its ban on Serbian license plates. The ban, imposed on 20 September 2021, had led to blockades near border crossings and threatened to undo recent improvements in relations between Serbia and Kosovo. The issue has been contentious since 2011, when Serbia agreed to stop issuing Serbian license plates to towns in North Kosovo, with the understanding that they would be replaced by Republic of Kosovo or neutral (KS) license plates. However, no serious attempts were made to enforce the agreement until the Kosovan government implemented the ban in September 2021.

The lifting of the ban was agreed upon in Brussels, with negotiators from both governments meeting to find a more permanent solution. A working group has been established and will announce its proposals in six months if negotiations prove successful. The temporary solution is to cover the national symbols and country codes of Serbian license plates in Kosovo and Kosovar license plates in Serbia with stickers. The issue has stoked tensions in the region, with Serbia transporting military equipment to Kosovo’s borders and raising the combat readiness of its armed forces. In response, Serbia accused Kosovo of inciting attacks on government buildings and exploiting citizens to provoke an international conflict. The situation prompted international calls for de-escalation, and the NATO-led Kosovo Force increased its patrols near border crossings to prevent further violence. The protests by Kosovo Serbs have been mostly peaceful, with the exception of two arson attacks on government vehicle registration centers on 25 September 2021. Kosovo police denied their involvement and condemned the attacks as having “terrorist elements.”

North Kosovo is a predominantly Serbian region that has opposed an independent Kosovo and has not recognized its government up until the 2013 Brussels Agreement. As part of the agreement, the Community of Serb Municipalities was supposed to be formed by 2016, but this has yet to happen due to the Kosovan government freezing the agreement and declaring parts of it unconstitutional."

Following the incident, a vigil was held for Amess in his Southend West constituency, and two more tributes were made in Westminster. 

After appearing in court, Ali Harbi Ali, was charged with the murder of David Amess and remanded to Belmarsh prison. His trial is scheduled to take place on March 7, 2022. Meanwhile, the late MP's links to Qatar have been examined by police. 

Amess served in the UK Parliament for over three decades, and was recognised for his support of social conservatism, animal welfare, and Brexit. After his death, a by-election was triggered to fill his former seat in the Parliament. Political parties announced that they will not be fielding a candidate against the Conservative Party, as a sign of respect. 

The incident has raised concerns about the security of MPs during public surgeries, with parliamentarians calling for a review of MP security protocols. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, also stated that priest access to crime scenes to administer the last rites should be included in the law. 

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the Leader of the Opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, paid tribute to Amess, who was known for his work as a public servant and a devout Catholic. Members of the royal family, international politicians, and friends and family of Jo Cox, who was murdered in 2016, also expressed condolences.

Solar cycle 25, the current pattern of sunspot activity, began in December 2019 with a smoothed minimum sunspot number of 1.8 and is expected to continue until around 2030. It has been predicted that cycle 25 will be weaker than average, with the number of sunspots reaching a maximum of 115 in July 2025 (± 8 months). However, recent events have shown some unexpected activity.

On July 3, 2020, the first X-class solar flare of the cycle occurred, though the event was not directed towards Earth. Several months later, in October, solar activity began to increase abruptly, with flares taking place nearly every day by November. On November 29, an M4.4 flare, the strongest of the cycle to date, took place, possibly indicating that the solar cycle would be more active than initially anticipated.

A small coronal mass ejection was found heading directly towards Earth on December 8, 2020, shortly after a strong C-class solar flare. It hit the planet on December 9/10, causing bright aurorae at high latitudes. On July 22, 2020, six sunspots were seen for the first time since September 6, 2017.

More recently, on October 9, 2020, an M1.6 class solar flare erupted, sending a coronal mass ejection that hit Earth on October 12, triggering a G2 Geomagnetic Storm. Additionally, the second X-class solar flare of the cycle has recently occurred, with an associated coronal mass ejection expected to graze Earth on October 30 or 31. This could cause bright aurorae and interfere with satellite communications.

While solar cycle 25 was initially predicted to be weaker than average, recent events suggest that it may be more active than anticipated. Further observations will be needed to understand the full extent of cycle 25 and its impact on Earth."

On November 2, 2021, the state of New Jersey held its gubernatorial election, in which incumbent Democratic Governor Phil Murphy was running for a second term against Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, Green nominee Madelyn Hoffman, Libertarian nominee Gregg Mele, Socialist Workers Party nominee Joanne Kuniansky, and Legalize Marijuana candidate Ed Forchion. Although technically there were seven candidates in the race, only five appeared on the ballot - the lowest number for a New Jersey gubernatorial election since 1953.

Murphy had announced his intention to run for re-election on October 1, 2020, and he faced no opposition in the Democratic primary after his two opponents were disqualified. In the Republican primary, Ciattarelli emerged as the nominee after defeating several other candidates, including Brian Levine, Phil Rizzo, Hirsh Singh, and Joseph Rudy Rullo.

Throughout the campaign, support for Murphy remained strong, and polls consistently showed him leading Ciattarelli by a significant margin. On election day, Murphy was declared the winner, securing a second term and becoming the first Democrat to win re-election as Governor of New Jersey since Brendan Byrne in 1977.

While Ciattarelli put up a strong fight, running on a platform of lower taxes, smaller government, and school choice, Murphy's message of raising the minimum wage, investing in education, and expanding access to healthcare resonated with voters, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

With his victory, Murphy will continue to serve as Governor of New Jersey, alongside his Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver, who also won re-election."

The trio of high-rise buildings at 44BCD Gerrard Road, known as the ""360 Degrees Towers,"" included a 21-story luxury residential tower that had been approved for only 15 floors by the Lagos State Building Control Agency. Consultancy firm Prowess Engineering Limited had withdrawn from the project in February 2020 due to concerns over the tower's integrity. Twenty-two people were confirmed dead and many more trapped in the rubble. The National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos State is conducting a rescue effort supervised by government agencies. The owner of the building has been arrested and will be prosecuted, according to Gbolahan Oki, the general manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency. The chief architect has been suspended, and an independent panel has been given 30 days to disclose findings of an official investigation."

A tragic accident in Freetown, Sierra Leone occurred on November 5, 2021 when an oil tanker collided with a truck, resulting in an explosion that killed at least 99 people and injured over 100. The collision took place at a junction outside Choithram Supermarket in the Wellington suburb, and reports indicate fuel leaked before igniting. Despite warnings from officials, individuals flocked to collect fuel from the leaking vehicle. A bus carrying passengers was among the many casualties, as were nearby shops and markets that caught fire due to the fuel spilled over the streets.

Freetown is a port city with a population of over 1 million, and this is not the first time it has faced such disasters. In March 2021, a major fire in a city slum left 80 injured and over 5000 displaced. In 2017, heavy rains triggered mudslides that killed over 1000 people.

Rescue efforts have ended, and the mortuary at Connaught Hospital has received 92 bodies so far. Mohamed Lamrane Bah, the director of the National Motor Drivers Association, stated that the injured have been transferred to hospitals and the bodies have been collected. However, many victims remain in critical condition. According to a staff member of Connaught Hospital's intensive care unit, around 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive.

President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, has expressed his condolences and promised support for the families of the victims. Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals to check on the injured. However, journalist Omar Fofana reports that hospital services have been stretched beyond their capacity. This tragic accident marks yet another disaster in Freetown's history."

The cause of the incident is still under investigation, but initial reports suggest that people were pushing towards the stage en masse, causing a crush. At least 23 people were hospitalized, and more than 300 others were treated for injuries on-site. The second night of the festival was canceled, and Scott has pledged to support the investigation and help the Houston community heal. Kylie Jenner, Scott's girlfriend, faced criticism for social media posts depicting the crowd, including one with an ambulance attempting to make its way through the throng. Governor Greg Abbott stated that the tragedy was ""terrifying,"" and authorities are working to determine exactly what happened. The incident has rocked both the music community and the Houston community at large, with many mourning the loss of life and praying for the recovery of those injured."

At least 115 people have died following a collision between a petrol fuel tanker and a lorry in Freetown, Sierra Leone on 5 November 2021. The accident occurred at a busy intersection in the Wellington area, the city's main industrial district. The two vehicles collided, causing a fuel leakage. Locals reportedly attempted to collect the petrol in containers, but an explosion led to a huge fireball that engulfed vehicles, people, and passengers caught in traffic. Many of the victims were trapped in vehicles and a nearby bus was intensely burnt, killing all inside. Several shops and markets caught fire after fuel spilled onto the streets. The incident overwhelmed the city's medical services, with more than 100 people injured. The event has been described as the first of its kind in the densely populated city of about 1.2 million and follows similar high-casualty fuel tanker explosions across sub-Saharan Africa.

Israel's successful COVID-19 vaccination campaign, named ""Give a Shoulder"" (Hebrew: לתת כתף), has reached a new milestone as of June 26, 2021, with roughly 64% of eligible Israelis receiving at least one dose of the vaccine and a world-leading 60% with two doses. Israel's coordination of national vaccination drives, utilizing patient databases, has been credited for vaccinating a high proportion of its population in a short period of time, relative to the rest of the world. Israel's high vaccination rates, in conjunction with a centralized government system that enabled streamlined coordinated efforts, have curbed deaths and infection rates in the country. 

Israel first began its campaign on December 19, 2020, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu becoming the first person in the country to receive the vaccine. Early into the programme, Israel provided Pfizer with medical information about its citizens as part of a deal for the country to receive a supply COVID-19 vaccines from the company, illustrating the close collaboration between Israel's government and pharmaceutical companies. Israel prioritized vaccinations for high-risk groups, such as those over 60 and healthcare workers, and as of early February 2021, at least 90% of Israelis over 60 received at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The quick initial distribution led to a 41% decrease in confirmed infections in the country compared to the previous month. 

However, Israel faced various challenges during the vaccination drive, including early distribution issues, vaccine hesitancy among various communities, and disparities in vaccine access between Israeli citizens and Palestinians. Authorities faced scheduling appointment issues, loosely interpreted eligibility early on, and difficulty in distributing vaccines to less populated villages and Arab-Israeli communities. In the first quarter of 2021, Israel had to address vaccine hesitancy, particularly among young adults and religious/cultural minority groups. Nonetheless, Israel expanded its green pass initiative, first introduced by the Israeli Ministry of Health on February 21, to immunized residents who could show proof of vaccination, enabling access to certain locations such as gyms, hotels, and theaters. The green pass expires after six months, and with data from the national campaign illustrating a waning effect of immunity from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after six months, Israel began rolling out a third booster shot of the Pfizer vaccine to those over the age of 60 in late July 2021. The country later expanded booster shot availability to all Israelis over 12 years old, after five months since their second shot. 

As of August 29, 2021, Israel’s coronavirus czar announced that those who had not received a booster shot within six months of their second dose would lose access to the country's green pass vaccine passport indicating the holder is immunized against COVID-19. Israel also faced criticism for disparities in vaccine access between Israeli citizens and Palestinians. While Israeli citizens of any origin and Palestinian residents in East Jerusalem were eligible for the vaccine, an estimated five million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza were not eligible as their healthcare is under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority. However, Israel began vaccinating Palestinian laborers with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in March 2021, and in June 2021, Israel announced it would give over 1 million soon-to-expire Pfizer vaccines to the Palestinian Authority in exchange for a later reimbursement of a similar number of vaccines."

On 14 November 2021, a terrorist incident occurred outside the Liverpool Women's Hospital in England when a taxi exploded, killing the passenger who was carrying an improvised explosive device. The explosion also injured the driver of the taxi, who had noticed the device and locked the bomber inside the vehicle. The incident led to the hospital being placed under lockdown, roads being closed, and a cordon being established around the area.

Merseyside Police, along with military logistics and the bomb squad, attended the scene and made three arrests under the Terrorism Act. The investigation was being led by counter-terrorism officers, with support from MI5. On 15 November, the police officially declared the incident a terrorist attack, and the UK terror threat level was raised to severe.

The bomber's motivations for the attack were not immediately clear, though one theory suggested that he may have intended to walk to the nearby cathedral and detonate his device as the congregation left. The incident occurred shortly before the Remembrance Sunday ceremonies, prompting some to question whether there was a connection to the timing.

The taxi driver, David Perry, was later praised for his bravery and presence of mind in locking the bomber inside the vehicle. He was injured in the explosion but was released from hospital the next day.

The incident was reported on a global scale, attracting attention from CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, among others."

Tongan citizens will head to the polls on November 18, 2021, to elect 17 of the 26 seats to the Legislative Assembly of Tonga. The 2017 general elections resulted in a victory for the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands, and ʻAkilisi Pōhiva was re-elected as Prime Minister. However, Pohiva passed away in September 2019, and Pohiva Tuʻiʻonetoa was elected as his successor with the backing of nobles, independent MPs, and five former members of the DPFI. Following Tuʻiʻonetoa's election, his cabinet included three nobles who had previously been excluded under Pohiva.

In December 2020, Democratic Party leader Semisi Sika submitted a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Tuʻiʻonetoa. The motion received support from Deputy Prime Minister Sione Vuna Fa'otusia, who subsequently resigned from Cabinet. However, the Legislative Assembly rejected the no-confidence motion 13-9 on January 12, 2021.

The Tongan legislative assembly has up to 30 members, with nine seats being held by members of the nobility who elect representatives amongst themselves. The Cabinet formed by a Prime Minister may include up to four members not elected to the Assembly, who then automatically become members of the legislature. 75 candidates, including 12 women, registered to contest the upcoming election. Despite a week-long lockdown due to a COVID-19 case, the election has not been delayed.

It remains to be seen which party will come out on top in the elections and form the next government for Tonga."

The Solomon Islands unrest that began on 24 November 2021 has intensified, resulting in violent riots and demonstrations in the capital city of Honiara. The unrest was triggered after the central government under Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare withdrew recognition of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and established relations with the mainland People's Republic of China, a move that was not supported by some provinces in the islands. The protests started with peaceful demonstrations but turned violent on 24 November, resulting in clashes between police and protesters and the burning down of buildings near the Solomon Islands Parliament Building. Schools and businesses remained closed as mobs looted Honiara's Chinatown and a large warehouse was set alight, causing an explosion. While the rioters faced Australian Federal Police, who arrived to support the Solomon Islands Police Force to maintain order, the looting and burning continued, resulting in a nighttime curfew beginning at 7:00 p.m. local time. The unrest is yet to die down, and the government of the People's Republic of China has expressed its concern about the attacks and continued to support the Solomon Islands Government's attempts to ""restore order and stability quickly."""

On December 4, 2021, the Semeru volcano erupted on the Indonesian island of Java in the East Java province, resulting in one death and 41 injuries. Semeru is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, standing at 3,676 meters in height and being the highest volcano on the island. The eruption began at 14:50 local time and caused a cloud of volcanic ash to rise 40,000 feet (12,000 m) into the air. Pyroclastic flows, eruption columns, and debris avalanches accompanied the eruption, leading to damages to six sub-districts in the Malang Regency and eight villages and two sub-districts in the Lumajang Regency. Moreover, 30 homes in East Java were destroyed by lahars, and an estimated 300 families were evacuated. Power outages also affected at least 30,253 people.

Initially, three individuals were reported missing when the Gladak Perak Bridge in Lumajang collapsed due to a lahar, but this number was revised to ten later in the evening of December 4 by CNN Indonesia. The Indonesian Ministry of Health reported one death and 45 injuries, all of them suffering burns from pyroclastic flows. Four of the victims were in critical condition and were taken to the intensive care unit, while 38 people were treated at the Penanggal Health Center. Ten miners in a sand mine in Renteng Village were reported trapped, though they were later rescued by the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management. Nevertheless, several other miners remain unaccounted for.

Local authorities are urging residents to avoid approaching within at least 5 km of the main summit crater, prohibiting individuals from coming within 1 km or closer to the crater due to the risks of large pyroclastic flows. Ashfall was observed in some villages, leading residents to evacuate. The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, is set to lead the BNPB in post-eruption recovery efforts on December 5, visiting the Lumajang Regency, while the Governor of East Java, Khofifah Indar Parawansa, has relocated her office to help in the evacuation process of residents in the danger zone. The BNPB has provided aid to the affected residents, including meals, blankets, mattresses, masks, refugee tents, medical supplies, water, and instant food. No volcanic ash was observed at the Yogyakarta International Airport, Adisumarmo International Airport, or Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport, ensuring that their operations remained unaffected."

On December 4, 2021, soldiers of the Indian Army's Assam Rifles unit mistakenly opened fire on a group of miners returning home from work in Nagaland, believing them to be militants. Thirteen miners and a soldier were killed in the incident. Seven miners and a soldier were killed in a subsequent confrontation with angry locals as they attempted to retrieve the bodies. The incident sparked protests and public outrage in Nagaland, with many calling to repeal and revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA).

According to the Indian Army, the killings resulted from a ""case of mistaken identity."" However, the incident was widely condemned, with some accusing the army of committing war crimes. The Eastern Nagaland People's Organisation (ENPO), which represents six tribes, withdrew from the ongoing annual Hornbill Festival at Kisama near Kohima. The Nagas hoisted black flags on all its Morungs at the festival, while the Konyaks decided to abstain its cultural troupe from participating at the festival. A two-minute silence was observed at the venue on the same day.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom continues to be a major concern as the country reports a record 78,610 new cases within the past 24 hours. Since the virus first reached the UK in late January 2020, there have been over 10.5 million confirmed cases, the highest in Europe and fourth highest in the world, along with 165,721 deaths. The UK has the world's 7th highest death toll and 28th highest death rate by population. In addition to the major strain on the UK's healthcare service and a significant fall in life expectancy, the pandemic has had a severe impact on the country's economy, causing major disruptions to education, and far-reaching impacts on society. The UK vaccination programme was one of the fastest in the world, with over 75% of adults being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by mid-2021. However, the highly transmissible Delta variant caused a third wave of infections in mid-2021, and in late 2021, the Omicron variant arrived in the UK and drove a further increase in cases.

On December 20, 2021, a cargo ship carrying 130 passengers illegally sank off the northeast coast of Madagascar, resulting in the deaths of at least 85 individuals. The Francia, a wooden vessel, had taken on passengers for a journey from Antanambe to Soanierana Ivongo that was not officially registered as a port. The vessel became vulnerable to waves after the engine room was flooded, caused by a hole in the ship's hull.

The Madagascan police minister Serge Gellé was flown to the site of the shipwreck on December 21 but survived an ensuing helicopter crash with Chief Warrant Officer Jimmy Laitsara. Gellé used a seat from the helicopter as a flotation device during his twelve-hour overnight swim to safety, spotted by a fisherman who eventually rescued him.

The Madagascan government sent a force of gendarmes to investigate the sinking, and three vessels from the navy and maritime agency helped with the search for survivors. By December 22, 64 bodies had been recovered, with approximately 24 individuals still missing and around 50 survivors rescued. On December 23, it was announced that the confirmed death toll had increased to 85 after 24 more bodies were found. 

Madagascan president Andry Rajoelina paid tribute to the victims of the shipwreck and helicopter crash. Due to the high number of casualties, some of the bodies that were recovered were sent to nearby villages for burial as the graveyard in Soanierana-Ivongo was too small to accommodate all of them."

The COVID-19 pandemic in South Australia continues to be a concern as the state reports a record 744 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the statewide total of confirmed cases to 4,324. The ongoing worldwide pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has prompted numerous measures in South Australia. On 11 March 2020, the SA state government announced its A$350 million economic stimulus measures. The government doubled its coronavirus economic stimulus package to AU$4 billion in November 2020. 

In November 2020, ""significant restrictions"" were reintroduced after an outbreak of coronavirus in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. On 17 November that year, a six-day lockdown was announced following the outbreak. Private functions and funerals were allowed 50 people, while ten people were allowed to attend private functions, and 100 people were allowed to attend restaurants and pubs. 

In 2021, the first Australian received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and on 30 April, South Australia's first COVID-19 mass vaccination hub opened at Adelaide Showground. 

In June, sniffer dogs were deployed on a trial basis at Adelaide Airport to detect people with COVID-19 infections. Due to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, South Australia ""immediately"" reinstated a hard border with NSW in June 2021. On 28 June, SA re-introduced a number of restrictions. 

On 19 July 2021, from midnight ""level 4"" restrictions were introduced after a traveller from overseas and two close contacts all tested positive. On 20 July that year, South Australia went into lockdown for 7 days following a 5 case cluster of the Delta variant linked to Modbury Hospital. 

South Australia opened its borders to the rest of the country on 23 November 2021, as it hit an 80% vaccination coverage for 16 and older. This signalled a change from an elimination strategy to a suppression strategy in controlling the virus. However, on 1 December, the state recorded its first two cases of community transmission since the borders opened, two men aged in their 50s. On December 10, the Omicron variant was detected in two interstate travellers that came to South Australia. 

Numerous events were cancelled in South Australia as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, including the Royal Adelaide Show and AVCon. The Tour Down Under bicycle race and OzAsia Festival were also cancelled in both 2021 and 2022.

The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis, which began in late October 2021, is still causing international tension. The conflict involves military confrontation and international crisis between Russia and Ukraine and has also involved the United States, NATO, the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The current situation was provoked by the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations in late October, and subsequently, the use of UAVs became a central issue in the escalation of the conflict.

The ceasefire regime began to be violated more frequently than in 2020, and there were repeated attempts to block the signal of Ukrainian UAVs, which are used to monitor the terrain. This was accompanied by an escalation in the Ukrainian political field, with the appointment of Dmytro Yarosh as adviser to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the approval of a new defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov. The Russian Defense Ministry also expressed concern about the deployment of US warships to the Black Sea, calling it a ""threat to regional security and strategic stability.""

On 13 November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of amassing 100,000 troops in the border area, while reports of Russian military buildups raised concerns about a potential invasion. In response, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called for a reduction of tension, and Acting German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas expressed concern about the movement of Russian forces and military equipment near Ukraine.

Against this backdrop, Ukraine intensified its diplomatic efforts, with Zelensky and the head of the European Council Charles Michel discussing ""the security situation along the borders of Ukraine."" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba held talks on the same issues in Brussels, and the new head of the Defense Ministry, Oleksii Reznikov, went to Washington to meet with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The UK formed a rapid response unit of about 600 fighters for transfer to Ukraine.

In response to rising tensions, Russia and the US announced bilateral talks in Geneva on 10 January 2022, to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and to confront rising tensions over Ukraine. Additionally, Russia held talks with NATO in Brussels on 12 January 2022, and a broader meeting involving the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) took place on 13 January 2022 in Vienna.

The situation remained tense as both Ukraine and Russia accused each other of escalating the conflict. The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that Ukraine was using weapons prohibited by the Minsk Package of Measures, while Ukraine accused Russia of deploying more than 92,000 troops and Iskander short-range ballistic missile systems near the Ukrainian borders. In December, Janes analysis concluded that major elements of the Russian 41st Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army had been repositioned to the west, reinforcing the Russian 20th Guards and 8th Guards armies already positioned closer to the Ukrainian border.

Finally, Ukrainian authorities arrested an alleged Russian intelligence agent who they claim attempted to recruit others to launch attacks in the port city of Odessa, adding another layer of complexity to an already tense situation."

The conflict has seen accusations and military confrontations between Russia and Ukraine, with international actors such as the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States involved. The conflict began with the use of Ukrainian drones against the Donetsk People's Republic, and since then, the ceasefire has been repeatedly violated. The crisis has been marked by an increase in diplomatic efforts by Ukraine, with talks held between European leaders and senior US officials. In late December, Russia and the US announced talks would take place in Geneva to discuss concerns about their respective military activity, with the meeting being followed by a NATO-Russia Council meeting in Brussels. 

However, recent developments have seen tensions rise even further, with Poland warning of possible war. As of January 2022, Russia has been accused of amassing troops and short-range ballistic missile systems near the Ukrainian border, with Ukraine accusing Russia of planning a large-scale military invasion. The situation has led to harsh statements from both Moscow and Kyiv, with both sides accusing each other of aggressive actions. Talks between the two sides have stalled, with negotiations reduced to discussing whether Russia is a party to the conflict. 

In December 2021, Janes analysis concluded that major elements of the Russian 41st Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army had been repositioned to the west, reinforcing the Russian 20th Guards and 8th Guards armies already positioned closer to the Ukrainian border. Additional Russian forces were reported to have moved into Crimea, reinforcing Russian naval and ground units already deployed there. This has raised concerns among European leaders and the US, with Poland warning of a possible war.

Djokovic had planned to compete in the tournament after being granted a medical exemption from mandatory vaccination by Tennis Australia and the health department of the state of Victoria, following a blind review of his application. However, the Australian Minister for Home Affairs, Karen Andrews, commented that regardless of Tennis Australia and Victoria's decision, Australia's border requirements would still be enforced by the federal government, and unvaccinated individuals entering Australia ""must provide acceptable proof that they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.""

On 5 January 2022, Djokovic was detained by the Australian Border Force upon his arrival in Australia because his visa did not satisfy the country's requirements for entry by unvaccinated travelers. Djokovic's lawyers requested an injunction against deportation for him to appeal the visa refusal. As a result, Djokovic remained confined in a detention hotel awaiting the outcome of his appeal. On 10 January, the Federal Circuit and Family Court, however, ruled in favor of Djokovic, ordering his release from detention and directing the federal government to pay his legal expenses. The reason for the ruling was that the Australian officials had failed to provide Djokovic sufficient time to contact his lawyers and tennis authorities before his official interview while he was in immigration holding before his visa was cancelled, leading the Australian government to concede that they had treated him unreasonably.

Amid the controversy surrounding Djokovic's visa refusal, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Alex Hawke, invoked his ministerial powers under the Migration Act 1958 to cancel Djokovic's visa on ""health and good order grounds."" Meanwhile, 25 other players and staff who had applied for a medical exemption, among whom a handful of applications had been granted, were being monitored. Among those who had reportedly been allowed into the country with the same exemption and visa types as Djokovic were two individuals. Renata Voráčová, a player who had been granted an exemption, was allowed into the country and had participated in a warm-up tournament but subsequently was also deported on 8 January 2022, after her visa had been cancelled on 7 January 2022. A tennis official with an exemption had also been allowed entry but left the country voluntarily.

Djokovic's visa cancellation has garnered global attention, raising debates over mandatory vaccinations and the role of the government in making public health provisions. The overwhelming public opinion in Australia is not in favor of permitting an unvaccinated athlete to enter the country when many Australians are unable to return home due to the pandemic, and spectators cannot attend the event without being fully vaccinated."

A hostage crisis unfolded at Congregation Beth Israel Synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, United States on January 15, 2022, when an armed man claiming to be the brother of Pakistani Al-Qaeda suspect Aafia Siddiqui took several congregants hostage. The assailant posed as a homeless man seeking refuge before brandishing a weapon, taking four hostages, including Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, during a bar mitzvah ceremony. Reports indicate that the attacker used anti-Israel epithets and made demands for the release of his sister Aafia Siddiqui, who is currently serving a prison sentence in the US for attempted murder. 

Local police, the FBI, and the Texas Department of Public Safety swiftly responded to the scene and evacuated neighboring areas. Negotiations with the assailant ensued, and Rabbi Cytron-Walker was reportedly ordered to call a New York City-based Rabbi to pass along the hostage-taker's demands. The White House and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett both issued statements monitoring the situation, and Israeli Consulate General Livia Link headed to the scene. 

Shortly after 5:00 p.m., police announced that one hostage had been safely released, and after 12 hours of negotiations, shots were fired, and the assailant was killed. Governor Greg Abbott confirmed that all hostages were safely rescued without injuries. However, the former lawyer for Siddiqui's biological brother denied any involvement, and authorities have not identified the assailant. 

The attack is the latest incident targeting the Jewish community in the United States, with a recent spike in anti-Semitic incidents and hate crimes. Rabbi Cytron-Walker reflected on the ordeal, stating, ""The world that we thought would never happen here has happened here, and it's our turn to address it."" He also praised the outpouring of support from the community and law enforcement officials."

On 15 January 2022, a large eruption of Hunga Tonga, a volcanic island in Tonga in the Pacific Ocean, caused tsunamis in Tonga, Fiji, American Samoa, and other countries. The tsunamis caused significant damage and triggered tsunami warnings across multiple coastal areas. Tonga, which was most affected by the eruption and tsunamis, has reported several deaths and significant damage, but communication issues have made it difficult to fully assess the situation. 

In addition to the damage in Tonga, a small tsunami hit Lambayeque, Peru, and resulted in the deaths of two people. The tsunami caused damage to restaurants and boats in the Lagunillas beach and San Andrés District, and many residents evacuated to safety while businesses closed. Boat owners dragged their boats to shore to prevent the waves from damaging them. Some material damage was confirmed on the beaches. A wave measuring 0.68 m was recorded at the port of Callao, 0.72 m in the Marcona District, and 0.65 m in Paita.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the events in Tonga as ""hugely concerning"" and said officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are discussing aid provision to Tonga. In Fiji, the Mineral Resources Department issued advisories to people living around coastal areas, urging them to stay away from the shores. Evacuations were also made on the Lau Islands after wave activity was observed in the sea. Tsunami warnings were issued to American Samoa by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, and the agency warned that changes in the sea level, as well as strong currents, could pose a risk along the coast. Samoa later issued a tsunami advisory, and the PTWC canceled the tsunami warning for American Samoa.

Tsunami waves were observed on the shores of East Australia, Tasmania, and Macquarie Island. Maximum tsunami waves of 1.27 m (4.2 ft) were recorded at Norfolk Island, 1.10 m (3.6 ft) at Lord Howe Island, 0.82 m (2.7 ft) at the Gold Coast, Queensland, 0.77 m (2.5 ft) at Twofold Bay, New South Wales, and 0.50 m (1.6 ft) at Hobart, Tasmania. The National Emergency Management Agency of New Zealand warned residents to expect ""strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges"" along the north and east coast of North Island, as well as the Chatham Islands.

The eruption has potential to cause a temporary climate effect, and preliminary observations have shown that the eruption column ejected a large amount of volcanic material into the stratosphere. A scientist from the University of Auckland described it as a one-in-1000-year event."

On January 20, 2022, Islamic State militants launched a massive attack on Al-Sina'a prison in the city of Al-Hasakah in northern Syria. The militants targeted the prison with a car bomb and heavy weapons, triggering a prison riot in which prisoners seized weapons from the prison's armoury and attacked prison staff. The facility was overrun and several prisoners escaped. According to new information, the attack resulted in the freeing of numerous prisoners and 67 deaths from the ensuing clashes between the militants and Kurdish forces. The attack, which is the largest by the Islamic State since losing its last key Syrian territory in 2019, also led to the disruption of electricity to parts of Al-Hasakah city. Clashes have continued between Kurdish forces and militants over control of the prison and its surrounding areas. The US-led International Coalition sent military aircraft to support the Kurdish forces fighting in the city. The SDF has announced that they have arrested 89 of the escaped prisoners. The situation in Al-Hasakah remains tense as fighting between the two sides continues."

Singapore continues to be the most-vaccinated country in the world with over 88% of its population having completed their vaccination regimen against COVID-19. The Singaporean government had invested over one billion Singapore dollars in securing vaccines from Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, and CoronaVac. The country started its COVID-19 vaccination campaign on December 30, 2020, and has been ongoing since. The vaccination is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents.

On March 14, Singapore's Ministry of Health announced that it would extend the COVID-19 vaccine booster doses to people between the ages of 12 and 17. Booster shots have already been rolled out to senior citizens above 60 years of age from September 14, 2021. From October 4, booster shots would be given to the eligible population above 50 years of age, followed by individuals above 30 years of age from October 9. Those who completed their second dose before five months are eligible for booster shots for all age groups from November 24. The use of booster shots is extended to individuals above 18 years of age starting from December 14.

Singapore's Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination advised on the efficacy and safety of vaccines for use in Singapore. The committee recommended the prioritization of healthcare workers, people at high risk of infection, the elderly, and those vulnerable to severe diseases and complications from infections for vaccination. The committee recommended booster shots for people above 60 of age as evidence of declining efficacy of vaccination over time emerged, and updated recommendations for those with mild skin reactions after the first dose to continue their vaccination programme.

Singapore approved Pfizer-BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine in December 2020 and was the first country in Asia to approve Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021. HSA granted interim authorization for Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac vaccine, which was included in the National Vaccination Programme. Novavax also concluded a purchase agreement with Singapore's Health Ministry for its non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, with shipments expected to arrive in Singapore before the end of 2021.

Singapore is recognizing all COVID-19 vaccines listed under the Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization as fully vaccinated individuals, which shall be accorded vaccination-differentiated safe management measures and travel concessions. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) shall issue a tamper-proof vaccination sticker that is to be pasted onto travelers' travel documents and can serve as proof of vaccination. On September 24, the HSA granted interim authorization under the Pandemic Special Access Route for the CoronaVac vaccine under a three-dose regime, following which it was included in the National Vaccination Programme."

For centuries, Iceland has been known for its whaling industry, which began with spear-drift hunting in the 12th century. However, the country's whaling practices have remained a source of controversy, particularly with the International Whaling Commission's established moratorium in 1986. Iceland has been formally objecting to the ban, and even maintains a whaling fleet today. Even though one company hunts mainly for exportation to Japan, and the other has historically supplied domestic consumption, whaling has now come to a standstill in Iceland since the coronavirus outbreak in 2019. 

Now, new information has emerged as Iceland announces its decision to stop whaling altogether by 2024. The primary reason cited for this decision is the decreasing value of whale meat; the niche market has seen a decline in demand over the years, leading to financial losses for whaling companies. With trends indicating that people are turning to other sources of protein, the Icelandic government has deemed whaling unsustainable and unprofitable. Additionally, competition from subsidized Japanese whaling, as well as the increasing popularity of domestic whale watching tourism, has further hampered the industry. 

It marks a significant victory for animal welfare groups and environmental campaigners, as many have been advocating for an end to commercial whaling in Iceland for years. The country's whale watching sector, which operates in stark contrast to the whaling industry, is expected to benefit from this decision. As Iceland transitions to focus more on sustainable and ethical tourism practices, it's clear that whaling no longer has a place in the country's economy or ethos."
83,158,"The ongoing conflict between the government of Burkina Faso and Islamist rebels has continued to escalate, with recent reports of four civilians killed in a battle between French troops and Ansar ul Islam. The clash, which resulted in the deaths of ten militants, was supported by an attack helicopter. Both government forces and rebels have been accused of serious human rights abuses, causing a humanitarian crisis that has displaced thousands and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians. The conflict has also led to the closure of numerous schools, leaving an estimated 300,000 children without access to education. Despite various efforts to quell the violence, including joint military operations between France, Burkina Faso, and Mali, the situation remains highly volatile, with frequent attacks and tensions between different ethnic groups aggravating the conflict."

In a recent development, the European Court of Justice has dismissed the legal challenges brought by Hungary and Poland against the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation. The court confirmed that the regulation is fully compliant with the treaties of the European Union, which means that the European Commission can now suspend funds from the EU budget to member states that violate the principles of the rule of law enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. This decision is considered a significant victory for the European Union, which has been concerned about democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland since the 2010s.

The regulation was proposed by the European Commission in May 2018 as a means of linking disbursements from the EU's budget to adherence to rule of law standards. After trilogue meetings between the Council, the European Parliament, and the Commission, a legislative draft of the regulation was published in November 2020. Despite opposition from Hungary and Poland, the regulation was eventually adopted by the Council on 14 December 2020 and by the European Parliament on 16 December 2020.

Under the regulation, the rule of law is understood to refer to the values enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. These values include the principles of legality implying a transparent, accountable, democratic and pluralistic law-making process; legal certainty; prohibition of arbitrariness of the executive powers; effective judicial protection, including access to justice, by independent and impartial courts, also as regards fundamental rights; separation of powers; and non-discrimination and equality before the law. Measures can only be taken if violations of the rule of law affect or seriously risk affecting the sound financial management of the Union budget or the protection of the financial interests of the Union in a sufficiently direct way.

The European Parliament adopted a resolution in March 2021, in which it stressed that the application of the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation cannot be subject to the adoption of guidelines and urged the Commission to avoid any further delay in its application. The Parliament also threatened to take legal action against the Commission if it would not provide regular updates on ongoing investigations into breaches of the rule of law which could affect the sound financial management of the Union budget. However, the Commission missed a deadline set by the European Parliament to provide necessary information, leading to the Parliament adopting another resolution in June warning the Commission of legal action if it did not fulfil its obligations.

With the court's decision, the Commission can now take measures against member states that violate the rule of law, which include the suspension of payments or commitments and a prohibition on entering into new legal commitments. This decision is a step towards addressing democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland and upholding the rule of law in the European Union."
