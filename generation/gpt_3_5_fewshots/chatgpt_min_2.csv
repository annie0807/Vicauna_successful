The Taliban has made significant progress in its military offensive against the government of Afghanistan since the withdrawal of most US troops from the country on 1 May 2021. As of 6 August, the group had captured Zaranj, the provincial capital of Nimruz Province, marking the first major capture of a provincial city since the 2001 invasion. The local police spokesperson confirmed the capture of the city and blamed the lack of reinforcements from the central government. The group has also taken control of over a third of Afghanistan's 421 districts, with over half of the country falling under Taliban control as of 21 July. The group has captured important border crossings with Tajikistan, Iran, and Turkmenistan, with continued attacks on other provincial capitals and major cities, including Kandahar and Herat.

Queensland is bracing for another round of lockdowns as two more areas, Cairns and Yarrabah, went into a snap three-day lockdown after a case of COVID-19 was reported in a taxi driver from Kanimbla. The taxi driver was infectious in Far North Queensland for 10 days, and the case was described as ""unexpected."" This new development highlights the ongoing challenges of managing the COVID-19 pandemic, even in regions with very low case numbers. As of the end of July 2021, Queensland had recorded the death of just seven patients with COVID-19, with a fatality rate of just under 1 per million residents, the lowest in the world among sizeable jurisdictions with their own policing and health powers. However, ongoing vigilance and quick action will be essential to prevent outbreaks and protect public health in the province."

Palau, a small island nation in the western Pacific, has officially reached herd immunity against COVID-19 as 80% of its population aged 12 and over have been fully vaccinated. This significant achievement comes after the country registered its first case on May 31, 2021, followed by a second case in June of the same year. At the time of the first case, the vast majority of Palauans, about 97% of the adult population, were already fully vaccinated, making the risk of widespread transmission low. 

Palau began implementing strict border controls early on in the pandemic, with President Thomas Remengesau Jr. suspending all charter flights from China, Macau, and Hong Kong as early as February 2020. Schools were also shut down starting in April, and the country's borders were eventually completely closed off. In January 2021, Palau began receiving COVID-19 vaccines from Operation Warp Speed as part of its membership in the Compact of Free Association with the United States. The vaccination campaign began on January 3 and reached a milestone on May 26, when an estimated 96% of adults aged 18 and over in the country were fully vaccinated.

Now that Palau has achieved herd immunity, the country is looking to further expand its vaccination program to include teenagers aged 12 to 17. Plans for this are already underway as the country reopens its borders to tourism. While vaccination is not currently mandatory for tourists, those who are not vaccinated are subject to strict quarantine rules upon arrival. Despite the successful vaccination campaign and reopening efforts, Palau continues to remain vigilant and cautious, monitoring the situation closely and maintaining strict health and safety protocols."

Egypt and Russia have had a long history of diplomatic relations, dating back to before the 16th century, and have recently resumed direct commercial flights between the two countries. The resumption follows the Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing in 2015, where most of the 224 people killed were Russian tourists. For the first time since the incident, a passenger plane from Rossiya Airlines landed in Sharm El Sheikh carrying 518 passengers. Russia has been an important economic partner for Egypt, accounting for 31% of the country's imports of major weapons since 2009, and both countries have worked closely to strengthen military and trade ties in recent years. Egypt also supports Syria and the House of Representatives in the Libyan Civil War, while Russia supports the Syrian government and the House of Representatives' forces through the Wagner Group. In 2017, both countries signed agreements for Russia to build Egypt's first nuclear reactor and a ""Russian Industrial Zone"" in the Suez Canal, among other economic investment plans. Additionally, tourism has been an important aspect of the bilateral relationship between Russia and Egypt, with Egypt being the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroad as of 2015. The Egyptian Russian University, offering training in pharmacy and engineering, was established in Badr City, Cairo in 2006."

Algeria continues to battle a total of 69 fires in the northern region since August 9, 2021, with the death toll increasing to 65, including 37 civilians and 28 soldiers. The wildfires have destroyed olive trees and killed cattle and chickens. Many distant villages have limited water and some villagers have been forced to flee or attempt to hold back the flames with rudimentary tools. Despite the efforts of Algerian authorities to contain the blazes, firefighting aircraft are not available to assist.

Meanwhile, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has declared three days of national mourning for the victims. The fires began in the Kabyle region and have since spread to other areas of the country. The government has deployed soldiers to help evacuate citizens and battle the flames.

As the wildfires continue to rage on, Algerians are calling for more resources and aid to combat the disaster. The country is currently experiencing a heatwave, with temperatures reaching up to 50 degrees Celsius, which is expected to exacerbate the situation. Authorities are urging people to take all necessary precautions and avoid starting fires."

Lebanon's liquidity crisis continues to worsen, with the country's Central Bank announcing that it will end fuel subsidies, a move that is expected to lead to a significant increase in fuel prices. The bank stated that it will provide credit lines for fuel imports based on the market price for the Lebanese pound, as opposed to continuing subsidies. The move is likely to exacerbate the ongoing economic crisis in Lebanon, which began in August 2019 and has been compounded by both the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 Beirut port explosion. The crisis has led to a devaluation of the Lebanese pound, with the black market exchange rate reaching 15,200 LBP per USD in June 2021. It has also caused widespread economic hardship, including inflation, job losses, and the closure of numerous businesses. In response, there have been widespread protests, and the prime minister and his cabinet resigned in the wake of the crisis. Lebanon's debt to GDP ratio currently sits at 170%, and the country experienced its first-ever default in 2020. The World Bank has warned that without significant reforms, the crisis risks becoming one of the most severe economic crises in the world in the past century."

The Panjshir conflict, a political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban, has seen new developments as Russian intelligence sources report that forces loyal to Amrullah Saleh recently re-captured Charikar and the surrounding areas of Parwan Province from the Taliban. This comes after Saleh declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley in mid-August, citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. The claim was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Mohammadi. Prior to this, Panjshiris had been moving military equipment into Panjshir Province and were joined by commanders of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. As of August 2021, no direct military conflict had occurred in Panjshir Province and a negotiated end to the political impasse had been discussed.

The 2021 Niger attacks have continued with yet another violent incident, as gunmen attacked civilians who were praying at a mosque in the village of Theim in southwestern Niger, resulting in the deaths of 16 people. This ongoing series of attacks by militants has mainly taken place in the western region of Tillabéri, and has left a devastating death toll of 439 people, with more than 100 others injured. This marks the first time that over 100 civilians were killed in single incidents, making the January attack and the 21 March attack the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. 

Although major attacks occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020, it is the first year in which attacks were carried out with frequency in the country, with attacks being carried out every month of 2021. The previous biggest attack in Niger against civilians was the December 2020 Toumour attack, which resulted in 28 people killed. Both the December 2020 and January 2021 attacks were carried out during Niger's municipal and regional elections, while the February bombing specifically targeted members of the electoral commission.

The attacks are carried out by Islamist militants who arrived in the villages while crossing the border from Mali, however, the exact terrorist organization responsible is not clear. Some time before the massacre, two militants who were seen in the area were killed by the local villagers. Those attacks are suspected to have been in retaliation for those killings, according to the country's interior minister. The government of Niger has dispatched soldiers to the border after the attacks. 

On 21 February, seven members of the electoral commission were killed and three others wounded in a landmine explosion in Tillabéri, on the same day as the presidential election's second round. On 16 March, armed men on motorcycles attacked a convoy returning from a market in Banibangou by the Malian border to a nearby village in Southwestern Niger's Tillabéri Region, killing 58 people. The attacks continued on 21 March, when militants riding motorbikes attacked Intazayene, Bakorat and Wistan, three villages in the Tahoua Region close to the Malian border, killing 137 people, marking the deadliest attack committed by suspected jihadists in Niger's history. Newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum condemned the attacks and declared three days of national mourning.

The attacks have not slowed down, as on 24 March, at least 10 people were killed during attacks at two villages in the Tillabéri Region. On 18 April, at least 19 civilians were killed and two wounded when armed men raided a village in the same region. On 3 May, a military patrol was ambushed in the Tahoua Region, resulting in the killing of 16 soldiers and the wounding of six more. On 12 May, five villagers were killed and two more wounded after militants stormed the village of Fantio, in the Tillabéri region, during Eid al-Fitr celebrations. On 25 June, armed men attacked a village and nearby locations, killing a total of 19 civilians. On 29 June, Boko Haram fighters opened fire on a bus along the road between Diffa and Maine Soroa, killing three civilians, including the bus driver, two villagers and a village chief; two more were wounded. The fighters then moved on another road and opened fire on a group of soldiers, wounding six of them. A gunfight erupted, and thirteen terrorists were killed. On 2 July, around 100 heavily armed “terrorists” riding motorcycles attacked Tchoma Bangou village, killing both civilians and soldiers. 

On 25 July, fourteen people were killed and one more was wounded as gunmen stormed the village of Wiye, and on 28 July, 19 civilians were killed and five more wounded as militants stormed the village of Deye Koukou in the Banibangou area, near the border with Mali. On 1 August, Islamist militants ambushed and opened fire on a group of soldiers in Torodi, Tillabéri Region. As the soldiers were escaping and carrying the wounded, a bomb exploded, resulting in the killing of 15 soldiers, and six more went missing. Then, on 16 August, gunmen on motorbikes stormed the village of Darey-Daye in Niger, opening fire against civilians while they were tending their fields, killing 37 people, including 14 children. 

These attacks have caused widespread devastation and loss of life, and it is still unclear who is responsible for each attack. The government of Niger has dispatched soldiers to the border and has declared national mourning, but it is crucial that the situation in Niger is brought under control to prevent any further loss of life."

Operation Allies Refuge is an ongoing military operation by the United States to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians, such as interpreters, embassy employees, and Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan. The operation is part of the larger American military withdrawal from the country. The operation's name was officially unveiled by the Biden administration on July 14.

On July 30, 2021, the first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing. As of August 22, the United States has evacuated 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans, from Afghanistan in the past few weeks. This comes after the Biden administration announced that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants at the Kabul International Airport, following the Taliban's takeover of the country.

The U.S. military took control of air traffic at the airport on August 15, and on August 16, a C-17 cargo plane evacuated roughly 823 people to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The head of U.S. Central Command, General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., met with Taliban leaders based in Doha, and they agreed to the terms set by McKenzie for refugees to flee using Kabul Airport.

On August 17, approximately 1,100 people were evacuated on 13 flights, and by August 19, over 7,000 people had been evacuated, including nearly 2,000 Afghan interpreters flown to the U.S. for SIV processing. On August 20, over 12,700 people had been evacuated, and the Department of Defense activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation, with 18 planes consisting of commercial airline pilots and crews transporting Afghans from U.S. bases in the Middle East to Europe and ultimately the United States.

However, the evacuation efforts have been marred by casualties, including at least eight people who were killed at the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes. At least two people clung to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane, falling to their deaths, while at least three people clinging to the side of an Air Force jet were killed. Remains of another dead Afghan were found in the landing gear of the American C-17 after an emergency landing in a nearby country. Two armed men who fired into a crowd were also killed by U.S. troops."

The main objective of the operation is to help evacuate American citizens, interpreters, and other at-risk Afghans from the country amidst the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan.

On July 30, 2021, the first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants remaining in the process of being relocated. However, following the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced on August 12 that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to the Kabul International Airport in order to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, American nationals, and SIV applicants.

Following the fall of Kabul on August 15, the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. U.S. military took control over the air traffic control of the airport later in the day. Despite chaos and violence at the airport, the military continued with the airlift, evacuating over 12,000 people from the country as of August 20. 

On August 22, the Department of Defense announced that the Civil Reserve Air Fleet would be activated to assist in the evacuation. The 18 civilian planes from different airlines will be used by the U.S. military to help evacuate American citizens and other at-risk Afghan civilians from the country. 

The situation at the airport remains life-threatening, and casualties have been reported. As of August 20, at least eight people have been killed at the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes. The Pentagon said that two armed men who fired into a crowd were killed by U.S. troops.

The Panjshir conflict began on August 17, 2021, following the fall of Kabul, as the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance, faced the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, controlled by the Taliban. The Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and home to a majority of ethnic Tajik people, has remained outside of Taliban control as of August 2021 due to its natural defences.

On August 17, Amrullah Saleh declared himself the President of Afghanistan, citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from Panjshir. Saleh's claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, along with the Afghan Embassy in Dushanbe. Remnants of the Afghan National Army, along with local civilians, answered Massoud's mobilization calls and joined the resistance.

As of mid-August 2021, disparate Anti-Taliban forces had between 2,000 and 10,000 personnel under arms in Panjshir. The resistance has reportedly secured access to helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military, and according to one observer, the Panjshir Valley was ""under siege on all sides"" but had not yet come under direct attack by the Taliban.

Ahmad Massoud and Amrullah Saleh refuse to surrender the Panjshir Valley to the Taliban and are pushing for dialogue on the formation of a comprehensive government. However, war seems ""unavoidable"" if the Taliban refuse to negotiate.

Negotiated end to the political impasse has been attempted, and on August 22, representatives from Panjshir were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai to discuss ways of securing the safety of Afghans. Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possibly mediate. The resistance is seeking a peaceful resolution of the conflict under the condition that a future government implements a system of ""decentralization"" and ""equal rights"" across the country.

Reactions from the United States and Western forces towards the Panjshir resistance have been lowly supportive due to the ongoing evacuation of Kabul, which depends largely on the Taliban's benevolence. Ahmad Massoud's Washington Post op-ed requesting Western support has been analyzed as evidence of the absence of direct communication and support between the resistance and the US government."

On 26 August 2021, a devastating suicide bombing occurred at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. The attack targeted an entrance gate of the airport and was carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP). The blast killed at least 90 Afghan civilians and 13 American servicemembers, with more than 150 others wounded. ISIL-KP claimed responsibility for the attack, which had been threatened in recent days. 

This attack comes amidst the ongoing evacuation efforts from Afghanistan after the Taliban took control of the country on 15 August 2021. With Hamid Karzai International Airport being the only secure way out for many Afghans, the security threat at the airport had been of growing concern. Prior to the attack, US diplomats in Kabul had warned their citizens to leave due to security threats, and the United Kingdom Armed Forces and multiple embassies had also issued warnings about high security risks at the airport. 

The devastating attack has sparked condemnation and concern from the international community. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed full support for coordinating with American allies in response to the explosions. Meanwhile, Taliban officials and foreign troops confirmed the death toll, and the Taliban spokesperson tweeted a condemnation of the attack as ""evil circles"" that would be stopped. 

The attack also occurred near the Baron Hotel, which had been used as a gathering point for American citizens seeking evacuation and as a processing center for Afghan people fleeing the country. The second bombing occurred at the Abbey Gate, where one of the gates entering into the airport was attacked by a suicide bomber. After the explosion, gunfire erupted and all gates at the airport were closed. In addition to the 13 American servicemembers killed, up to five U.S. personnel were injured, including three U.S. Marines.

On 26 August 2021, a devastating suicide bombing took place outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. The attack killed at least 182 people, including 13 United States military personnel – the first US service members to be killed in Afghanistan since February 2020. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) claimed responsibility. 

The attack occurred during the hurried evacuation of Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover, with the airport being the only secure means of departure. Security concerns had been mounting after hundreds of ISIL-KP militants escaped from jails at Bagram and Pul-e-Charkhi, and the Pentagon had warned of an increased terrorist threat. President Joe Biden had also been warned of the danger to US personnel and civilians at the airport. 

In the hours leading up to the attack, US diplomats had warned American citizens to leave the airport due to security threats, and UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey had warned of a highly credible threat from ISIL-KP militants. Embassies of the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia had also warned about elevated security risks. 

The suicide bomber detonated an explosive at Abbey Gate, one of the airport's entry points for evacuation. Following the explosion, gunfire broke out, and all gates to the airport were closed. Reports initially stated that a second explosion occurred near the nearby Baron Hotel, but this was later proven false. 

In addition to the 13 US service members, 169 Afghan civilians were killed in the attack, with at least 150 more people injured. Two of the killed civilians were British dual-nationals, and one was a child of a British national. The US military deaths were the largest single loss of life of American service personnel since the 2011 Afghanistan Boeing Chinook shootdown. 

ISIL-KP claimed responsibility for the attack and named the bomber as Abdul Rahman al-Logari. The Taliban, who control the government in Afghanistan, condemned the attack and vowed to capture the ISIL-KP leader. The two groups are enemies, with a past history of fighting. 

Following the attack, US President Joe Biden honored the American service members who lost their lives, expressing deep sympathy for the Afghan victims. Biden issued a warning to those who wished harm upon the US, saying ""we will hunt you down and make you pay."" Numerous nations condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with the victims and the troops conducting the evacuation.

On August 27, the Taliban appointed Khalil Haqqani, a designated terrorist with a US$5 million bounty on his head, as head of security in Kabul. Despite this, following the 2021 Kabul airport attack, the Taliban condemned the attack and vowed to capture the ISIS-K leader. The United States also launched an airstrike on August 27 that killed two ""high-profiled"" ISIS planners and facilitators. In response, the Taliban condemned the attack as a ""clear attack on Afghan territory""."

Since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan and announced their re-establishment of the Islamic Emirate after Kabul's fall in August 2021, there have been three known drone strikes on the country. The latest of which killed at least ten people, including seven children, and targeted a vehicle driven by an aid worker for U.S.-based Nutrition and Education International. The worker was reportedly bringing home water for his family when the strike occurred. Some of the casualties were residents of the area, and others had previously worked for international organizations and held visas allowing them entry to the United States. Reports suggest that there were civilian casualties in addition to those in the vehicle targeted by the U.S. The strikes come amid ongoing tensions and conflict in the region, which has already claimed the lives of hundreds in recent weeks."
22,45,"UPDATED VERSION:

The Panjshir conflict, which began on 17 August 2021 following the Fall of Kabul, continues to rage on in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley. The conflict remains between the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan and the Taliban-controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The Panjshir Valley is the only region that has not fallen to the Taliban, and is well known for its natural defences. With a majority ethnic Tajik population, the valley has historically been a stronghold for anti-Taliban forces.

As of 1 September 2021, the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan claimed that its fighters had killed eight Taliban members in clashes in the Panjshir Valley, the final stronghold outside of Taliban control. The Taliban has deployed a large number of forces near the valley, while negotiations between the two sides continue in an effort to resolve the conflict.

Prior to the conflict, on 17 August 2021, Amrullah Saleh declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. The resistance was backed by Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, including commandos, ex-Mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and other anti-Taliban activists. However, there are differences between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is a hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan which was supportive of the Taliban.

As the conflict has unfolded, the resistance has reportedly secured access to five helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military, along with other heavy weapons, including BM-21 Grads. There have been clashes reported in several districts in Baghlan Province, including Dih Salah, Pul-e-Hisar, and Andarab. While the Taliban claimed to have recaptured all three districts by 23 August 2021, the resistance has since retaken control of some of these areas.

The international community has remained hesitant to support the resistance, with the US and other potential allies focusing on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul and seeking the Taliban's cooperation to do so. However, Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan have volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it could be deemed illegal. The situation remains tense, with the future of the Panjshir Valley still uncertain."
23,47,"UPDATED VERSION:

The conflict between the Taliban and the National Resistance Front (NRF) of Afghanistan has reached the Panjshir Valley, which had remained the only region out of Taliban control since the fall of Kabul. The Taliban launched an offensive against the NRF, led by Ahmad Massoud, in early September, resulting in heavy fighting and casualties on both sides. The Taliban claimed to have gained some territory, while the NRF said they have repelled some attacks and inflicted heavy losses on the Taliban. Prior to the clashes, both sides had engaged in talks but failed to reach a peaceful resolution. The international community has yet to show support for the NRF due to ongoing evacuations and concerns about the Taliban's cooperation. Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan have volunteered to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it may be illegal."

Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation aimed at airlifting at-risk Afghan civilians from Afghanistan, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, as well as helping NATO and regional allies with their respective evacuation efforts from Hamid Karzai International Airport. The operation was concurrent with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans.

Under the operation, SIV applicants were airlifted to the United States, where they were temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their SIV requirements. On 14 July 2021, the Biden administration unveiled the name of the operation. On 22 July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the ALLIES Act, which raised the visa cap for Afghan interpreters and expedited the Afghan SIV process.

On 30 July, the first group of 221 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing, with more SIV holders and applicants yet to be moved. On 12 August, following continued Taliban victories across Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced the deployment of 3,000 U.S. troops to Hamid Karzai International Airport to help evacuate embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants.

After the fall of Kabul on 15 August and the chaotic scenes that ensued at the airport, the military presence was expanded to nearly 6,000 troops, and Operation Allies Refuge became concurrent with a new effort to airlift all SIV applicants, embassy personnel, American nationals, and eligible Afghans seeking to flee the country.

As of 25 August, the total amount of evacuations topped 82,300, with the U.S. military evacuating about 7,000 people. On 27 August, the U.S. announced that military bases would be opened to hold up to 5,000 Afghan nationals applying for SIV or deemed to be ""at risk."" However, at least 195 people were killed at or near the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes, with the majority killed by a suicide bombing.

On 2 September, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain stated that around 100 Americans remain in Afghanistan following the August 31 withdrawal deadline, and the Biden administration will still try to rescue them."

Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation to airlift at-risk Afghan civilians, particularly interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, out of Afghanistan. The operation was concurrent with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans due to the Taliban's rapid takeover of the country. SIV applicants were airlifted to the United States, where they were temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their SIV requirements.

The operation's name was unveiled on July 14, 2021 by the Biden administration. On July 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs (ALLIES) Act to increase the visa cap for Afghan interpreters and to expedite the Afghan SIV process.

On August 12, following continued Taliban victories across Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced that it would deploy 3,000 U.S. troops to Hamid Karzai International Airport to help evacuate embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. Meanwhile, U.S. embassy staff in Kabul were destroying sensitive materials and items featuring embassy logos or U.S. flags, standard procedure during a drawdown.

On August 15, following the fall of Kabul and chaotic scenes of Afghans attempting to force themselves aboard military planes, the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. U.S. military took control over the security and air traffic control of the airport later in the day. At this point, Operation Allies Refuge became concurrent with a new effort to airlift all SIV applicants, embassy personnel, American nationals, and eligible Afghans seeking to flee the country.

As of September 7, 2021, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that 21 Americans have been evacuated safely from Afghanistan. The U.S. is committed to evacuating more Americans and vulnerable Afghans from the country, and has enlisted the help of commercial airlines to transport Afghans arriving at U.S. bases in the Middle East.

However, the evacuation effort has been marred by violence and tragedy. At least 195 people were killed at or near the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes, with the majority killed by a suicide bombing attack carried out by Islamic State militants on August 26. At least 13 U.S. service members were among the killed. Several more foreign troops and Taliban members were among the injured. In addition to the casualties, a nine-month-old baby died after arriving at the Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 2, making her the first death of a evacuee on American soil."

The US government's drone strike record in Afghanistan is under scrutiny once again after Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. acknowledged that a drone strike on August 29 near Kabul International Airport killed 10 civilians instead of ISIS-K militants. This revelation comes after years of criticism over the number of civilian casualties and unintended targets caused by the US government's drone strikes in Afghanistan. The strikes began in January 2001 under President George W. Bush's administration and, according to estimates, increased four to five times during President Donald Trump's presidency compared to the previous administration of Barack Obama. As of 2021, there had been at least 13,074 airstrikes conducted by the US government in Afghanistan, killing over 4,000 people, including 310 civilians and 73 children. The Afghan Air Force (AAF) also carried out air strikes in the country, with reports of civilian casualties. Amnesty International USA has questioned the legality of drone attacks."

On September 18, 2021, hundreds of people gathered near the United States Capitol for the Justice for J6 rally in support of those who were arrested and charged following the Capitol attack on January 6. Organized by Look Ahead America, a nonprofit led by former Trump campaign staffer Matt Braynard, the event aimed to express solidarity with those arrested. Lawmakers and law enforcement officials expressed concern over potential unrest at the rally, and preparations were made, including the restoration of protective fencing surrounding the Capitol.

A counter-rally was also scheduled on the same day, leading to fears of clashes between participants. The Department of Homeland Security issued an intelligence briefing memo to state and local law enforcement agencies warning of potential violence at the rally, though no specific or credible plots were identified.

Former President Donald Trump called the rally a ""setup"" for Republican voters and Republicans have distanced themselves from the event. Far-right groups like the Proud Boys urged their members not to attend the rally.

Despite the security measures and low turnout, at least four people were arrested at the rally, with one found in possession of a knife and another with a gun. The fence surrounding the Capitol remained in place amid ongoing concerns over potential violence."

A 5.9 magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Balochistan province near the city of Harnai on October 7, 2021, leaving at least 24 people dead and 200 others injured. The deadly quake struck near the anniversary of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake that killed 87,000 people. Pakistan is significantly impacted by the ongoing convergence between the Indian and Eurasian Plates, with the thrust faulting in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya region a direct result of the plate interaction. The Balochistan region experiences an oblique convergence, involving the Chaman Fault, a strike-slip structure and several thrust faults.

Analyzing the tectonic setting, the United States Geological Survey reported that the latest earthquake occurred during a thrust fault rupture under the Sulaiman Mountains and Central Brāhui Range, followed by a 4.6 magnitude aftershock. It was Pakistan's most extensive earthquake since the 2013 major tremor that left over 800 people dead and caused significant damage to the province.

The earthquake hit early morning, after 3:00 AM local time, collapsing many homes while the residents were asleep. Most victims, around 20 people, were women and children, with an unspecified number of residents buried under the rubble of wrecked buildings, and rescued by survivors. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority reported severe damage in Harnai District and Shahrag, where 70 homes were affected. The cities of Sibi and Quetta reported damages as well.

Following the calamity, the Pakistan Army dispatched troops to Harnai to assist in rescue and relief operations. At least nine injured victims in need of medical treatment were transported via helicopters from the affected area to Quetta.

A series of protests by Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government that began on 20 September 2021, triggered by the government's decision to ban Serbian license plates, has come to an end on 2 October 2021. The ban was implemented to mirror the former ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia. The protests, which had mostly consisted of blocking traffic near border crossings, have now led to negotiations between the governments of Kosovo and Serbia. The solution is intended to be temporary, and a working group consisting of negotiators from both countries met in Brussels on October 21st, 2021, to find a permanent solution in accordance with EU standards. If negotiations are successful, the group will announce their proposals in six months. The agreement reached on September 30th, 2021 ended the ban on Serbian license plates and the ban on Kosovo license plates in Serbia. The national symbols of Kosovo on Kosovar RKS license plates in Serbia and those of Serbia on Serbian license plates in Kosovo with their country codes RKS and SRB are covered with a sticker. The agreement had led to the withdrawal of Kosovar special police from the area by October 2nd, and the traffic blocks ended, leading to border traffic resuming. The Serbian Armed Forces, which had raised their combat readiness level on the border with Kosovo in response to the ban, have started withdrawing military equipment."

Solar cycle 25 started in December 2019 with a smoothed minimum sunspot number of 1.8 and is expected to continue until about 2030. While initial predictions regarding its strength varied widely, the Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel predicted in December 2019 that it will be similar to solar cycle 24, which was weaker than average. The panel expects the number of sunspots to reach a (smoothed) maximum of 115 in July 2025 (± 8 months), which is in line with current general agreement in the scientific literature.

Recent activity suggests that solar cycle 25 is ongoing, including the appearance of two reversed polarity sunspots in November 2019 and reversed polarity sunspots suggesting a transition to cycle 25 from December 2016 or early April 2018. Nandy et al. analyzed the polarity orientation of bipolar magnetic regions observed in December 2019 and concluded that magnetic regions with the underlying orientation of solar cycle 25's toroidal field component were brewing in the solar convection zone, representing early signs of the new cycle.

Solar activity has steadily increased since May 2020, with the first C-class and M-class solar flares of the cycle occurring that month. Flares continued to take place on a near-daily basis by November, with an M4.4 flare, the strongest of the cycle to date, occurring on November 29, possibly indicating that the solar cycle would be more active than initially thought. The first X-class solar flare of the cycle happened on July 3, but it was not directed towards Earth. Six sunspots were seen for the first time since September 6, 2017 on July 22. On October 9, a M1.6 class solar flare erupted, sending a coronal mass ejection that hit Earth on October 12, triggering a G2 Geomagnetic Storm.

More recently, an X-class solar flare, the second of the current solar cycle, erupted, and an associated coronal mass ejection may graze Earth on October 30 or 31. This event could cause bright aurorae and interfere with satellite communications."

On November 2, 2021, the 2021 New Jersey gubernatorial election took place, resulting in the re-election of incumbent Democratic Governor Phil Murphy for a second term. Murphy faced Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, Green nominee Madelyn Hoffman, Libertarian nominee Gregg Mele, Socialist Workers Party nominee Joanne Kuniansky, Legalize Marijuana candidate Ed Forchion, and independents Justin Maldonado and David Winkler in the general election. Murphy won with 57.1% of the vote, becoming the first Democratic Governor of the state to be re-elected since Brendan Byrne in 1977.

Murphy had won the Democratic nomination unopposed after his two primary challengers, Roger Bacon and Lisa McCormick, were disqualified. Ciattarelli became the Republican nominee after winning the primary against Brian Levine, Phil Rizzo, Hirsh Singh, Joseph Rudy Rullo, and Joseph Vicari, who withdrew. Other prominent Republicans, such as Jon Bramnick, Chris Christie, and Joe Kyrillos, declined to run.

The New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission did not sponsor any debates that included third-party candidates. However, the New Jersey Globe held a debate for third-party Lieutenant Governor candidates on October 11, 2021.

Murphy's running mate was incumbent Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver, while Ciattarelli's was former state senator Diane Allen. The five candidates who appeared on the general election ballot were the lowest number of candidates for a New Jersey gubernatorial election since 1953.

Despite some controversy surrounding the independent candidate requirements to qualify for debates, the result of the election was clear, with Murphy securing a second term in office."

A high-rise block of flats in Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria collapsed on 1 November 2021. The building was in the process of being built by Fourscore Homes, a UK-registered company headed by experienced Nigerian developer Femi Osibona. One of the buildings, a 21-story luxury residential high-rise tower known as the ""360 Degrees Towers"", collapsed, leading to the death of 36 people. The Lagos State Building Control Agency had approved only 15 floors, but 21 had been built. In February 2020, consultancy firm Prowess Engineering Limited withdrew from the project over concerns about the integrity of the building. 

The rescue effort, which is being supervised by the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations and the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, is ongoing with the military scheduled to take over operations. The National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos State (NEMA) and other responders are conducting the rescue efforts. As of 3 November, no new survivors have been found, but the search continues. The government has suspended the chief architect and arrested the owner of the building, while an independent panel has been allotted 30 days to conduct an investigation and disclose findings."

A devastating explosion caused by a fuel tanker colliding with a truck has claimed the lives of at least 99 people in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The incident occurred on November 5, 2021, in the Wellington suburb at a junction outside Choithram Supermarket. Several people were injured, and nearby shops and markets caught fire after fuel spilled over the streets. Eyewitness accounts suggest that many people rushed to collect the fuel from the leaking vehicle before it ignited. Freetown, which is home to over 1 million people, has experienced several disasters in the past, including a major slum fire in March that left more than 80 people injured and displaced over 5,000 others. In 2017, heavy rains triggered mudslides killing over 1,000 people.

Currently, the mortuary at Connaught Hospital has received 92 bodies, and several people remain in critical condition in the hospital's intensive care unit. Mohamed Lamrane Bah, director of the NMDA, has said that the bodies have been collected, and the injured have been transferred to hospitals. Even though rescue efforts at the scene have ended, efforts to provide medical care for the injured continue, and hospital services have been stretched, according to journalist Omar Fofana. Connaught Hospital's intensive care unit has reported that about 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive.

President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, has offered condolences to the families of the victims and promised to provide support to them. Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals, where he met with medical staff and victims.

The tragic incident is a poignant reminder of the need to improve road safety in Sierra Leone and elsewhere. As the country continues to mourn the loss of life, questions will likely be asked about how similar accidents could be prevented in the future."
52,95,"The rapper Travis Scott's music event was held on November 5, 2021, and attracted around 50,000 attendees. The cause of the crush is still under investigation, but it has been reported that people started to push towards the stage en masse when Scott began his performance. The situation resulted in a human crush where people began to fall and get injured, leading to additional panic.

Houston Fire Chief Sam Peña stated that the most fatal events occurred after 9:30 p.m., and the show's paramedics were seen performing CPR on unconscious attendees. Eight people ranging from ages 16 to 23 died, and twenty-three others were evacuated to local hospitals, including eleven people found in a state of cardiac arrest. Drug overdose is being investigated as a potential cause of cardiac arrest.

Scott stopped his 75-minute performance when he noticed attendees in distress near the stage. Music was halted for a few seconds when Scott noticed an ambulance in the crowd and asked what was happening. Despite this, two members of Scott's staff approached him on stage, but he shooed them away and resumed his performance.

As a result, the second night of the festival was canceled, and a reunification center was set up for families searching for relatives. The incident was described as tragic, and the hearts of those who lost their lives and those who were injured in the terrifying crowd surge are with them.

Scott stated that he would support the incident's investigation and help heal the Houston community, while Kylie Jenner, Scott's girlfriend, was criticized for Instagram posts depicting the crowd, including one with an ambulance attempting to make its way through it. Neither Jenner nor her sister, Kendall Jenner, were injured during the event."

In a significant development, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, recently met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. This meeting was the first between the two nations since the Syrian Civil War began a decade ago. The discussion centered around ways to enhance mutual cooperation in various areas of shared concern. The UAE has an embassy in Damascus, while Syria has an embassy in Abu Dhabi and a consulate-general in Dubai. Despite being part of the same Middle Eastern region, relations between the two countries have been strained due to geopolitical tensions. The meeting, however, suggests a possible thawing of relations and renewed efforts to strengthen cultural ties."

A fuel tanker explosion that occurred in Sierra Leone's capital and largest city, Freetown, resulting from a collision between a petrol fuel tanker and a lorry, has claimed the lives of at least 115 people, according to new reports. Over 100 others sustained injuries from the explosion, which occurred at a busy junction in the Wellington area of Freetown on 5 November 2021. Following the initial collision, petrol had leaked onto the streets, leading to an explosion that triggered a huge fireball, engulfing vehicles and people trapped in the traffic. Many of the victims were trapped in vehicles, with a bus full of people killed in the intense fire. Shops and markets nearby also caught fire due to the fuel spill.

The explosion overwhelmed the city's medical services, with the injured transferred to hospitals and the bodies collected. According to the director of the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), several people are in critical condition, while a staff member of a hospital's intensive care unit stated that around 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive. The event is the first of its kind in the densely populated city of over 1.2 million people and follows similar high-casualty fuel tanker explosions across sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. Fuel spilled in these cases was viewed as wasteful in communities where many struggled to afford petrol. President Julius Maada Bio, attending the United Nations climate talks in Glasgow, has offered condolences and promised support to the victims' families."

Israel's vaccination program, dubbed ""Give a Shoulder,"" has been widely praised for its success in rapidly vaccinating a large proportion of its population. As of June 26, 2021, around 64% of eligible Israelis had received at least one dose of the vaccine, with 60% having received both doses, placing Israel at the forefront of countries with the highest vaccination rates per capita. The program was marked by coordinated drives and the use of personal information databases to target eligible populations, as well as by the centralized systems of the country's health maintenance organizations. The first vaccinations, which began on December 19, 2020, were allocated to the elderly and healthcare workers, with more than 85% of healthcare workers at one hospital in Jerusalem (Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center) receiving their vaccinations after eight weeks. 

The success of the vaccination program led to the introduction of a ""green pass"" system in February, which immunized residents show to gain access to certain locations, such as gyms, hotels, and theaters. The green pass represents proof of immunization against COVID-19, through vaccination or previous infection, and is issued to those who have received both doses of the vaccine, with an expiration date six months after issue. By March 2021, at least 50% of the Israeli population had received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine.

However, the program was not without its challenges. Israeli authorities initially faced difficulty with scheduling appointments and interpreting eligibility requirements, which led to disparities in vaccine distribution to less-populated villages and Arab-Israeli communities. During the first quarter of 2021, vaccine hesitancy was also identified among the general population and particular subgroups, such as young adults and religious/cultural minorities. To address this, the government employed a mix of messaging, incentives, and extensions to the original delivery system to increase vaccine coverage from 40 to 60% and beyond.

The issue of vaccine distribution to Palestinians also became a concern, with the Palestinian Authority receiving only enough doses for around 6,000 people through the first quarter of 2021. Although Israel provided vaccines to Israeli citizens of any origin and Palestinian residents in East Jerusalem, an estimated five million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza were ineligible due to oversight by the Palestinian Authority. In June 2021, Israel announced its intention to give over one million Pfizer vaccines set to expire soon to the Palestinian Authority in exchange for future doses. However, the deal fell through after the Palestinian Authority declined due to the vaccines' expiration date.

In further developments, Israel's pandemic advisory board recently approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children between five and eleven years old, paving the way for their vaccination."

On November 18, 2021, general elections were held in Tonga to select 17 of the 26 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Tonga. The island nation previously witnessed a landslide victory for the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands in the 2017 general elections, with ʻAkilisi Pōhiva being re-elected as Prime Minister by defeating former Deputy Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni 14 to 12. After Pohiva's death in September 2019, Pohiva Tuʻiʻonetoa became Prime Minister. He received support from independent MPs, nobles, and five former members of the DPFI who were previously excluded under Pohiva's rule, and his cabinet consisted of three nobles.

Democratic Party leader Semisi Sika submitted a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Tuʻiʻonetoa in December 2020, which was backed by Deputy Prime Minister Sione Vuna Fa'otusia, who later resigned from Cabinet. The Legislative Assembly rejected the no-confidence motion with a 13-9 vote on January 12, 2021.

The Legislative Assembly of Tonga has up to 30 members, with 17 directly elected through first-past-the-post voting from single-member constituencies. Tongatapu has ten constituencies, Vavaʻu three, Haʻapai two, and ʻEua and Niuatoputapu/Niuafoʻou one each. Members of the nobility hold nine seats and elect representatives among themselves. A Cabinet formed by a Prime Minister may include up to four members who were not elected to the Assembly, who then automatically become members of the legislature.

The parliament was dissolved on September 16, and 75 candidates, including 12 women, registered for the election. Sione Fonua withdrew as a candidate, while one candidate passed away, leaving 73 candidates in total. Despite a week-long COVID-19 lockdown, the election was not delayed.

The Solomon Islands have been hit by three days of civil unrest, with riots and violent protests taking place in the capital city of Honiara since November 24, 2021. The unrest began after a series of peaceful demonstrations, with protesters from Malaita Province demanding greater autonomy and criticizing the government's decision to establish relations with China. The situation escalated after buildings near the Solomon Islands Parliament Building were set on fire, leading to clashes with police and government forces. The violence spread to Honiara's Chinatown district, where shops were looted and buildings were destroyed.

In response, Australia deployed Federal Police and Defense Force personnel to the Solomon Islands, under the terms of the Australia-Solomon Islands Bilateral Security Treaty. They were tasked with maintaining order and protecting vital infrastructure. Papua New Guinea also sent peacekeepers to help quell the unrest.

As the Australian forces secured critical infrastructure, rioters continued to set fire to buildings and loot shops. Mobs rampaged through Honiara's Chinatown, Point Cruz, and business districts. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds. The Royal Solomon Islands Police Force announced that they had made just two arrests, despite two police stations being among the many buildings burned.

Australian authorities have now taken control of Honiara, and a nighttime curfew has been put in place. The situation in Chinatown remains volatile, with rioting and looting continuing.

Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has warned that the rioters will ""face consequences"" and has accused them of being ""politically motivated."" He has resisted calls to resign and blamed ""foreign powers"" for the unrest. Meanwhile, the premier of Malaita Province, Daniel Suidani, has criticized the government's choices but also condemned the violence on the part of the protesters. The premier of Guadalcanal has also strongly denounced the riots.

International reaction to the unrest has been mixed. The government of the People's Republic of China expressed ""concern about the attacks"" and support for the Solomon Islands Government's attempts to ""restore order and stability quickly."" However, the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Solomon Islands has been criticized by some protesters. Australia has deployed troops under the Bilateral Security Treaty, but has taken no position on the internal issues of the Solomon Islands. Opposition Leader Matthew Wale has called on Sogavare to step down, blaming him for escalating the violence."

Four students have been killed and seven others injured in a mass shooting at Oxford High School in Oxford Township, Michigan, United States on November 30, 2021. The suspected shooter is a 15-year-old sophomore student who is currently in custody. The shooting took place at around 12:55 p.m. EST, and police received around 100 911 calls. The suspect reportedly used a semiautomatic handgun, which was recovered from him by the police. Based on recovered shell casings found in the school, it is believed that around 15 to 20 shots were fired.

According to the parent of a student who stayed home on November 30, threats of a mass shooting occurring at Oxford High School were already present before the incident occurred. Earlier that month, in an act of vandalism, a deer head had been thrown off the school roof, prompting school administrators to notify parents that they had been investigating rumors of a threat against the school but found none.

The school went into lockdown after the shooting occurred, and some students were evacuated to a nearby Meijer store. The suspect was arrested unharmed by the police, and no problems were reported during the arrest. The injured students and teacher were taken to a hospital for treatment.

President Joe Biden and Representative Elissa Slotkin, whose district includes Oxford High School, both expressed their condolences over the shooting. Governor Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that she was ""devastated for the students, staff, and families"" of the school, calling gun violence a ""public health crisis"".

On 4 December, 2021, the Semeru volcano in East Java, Indonesia erupted, resulting in the death of one person and 41 injuries. The eruption began with the collapse of a lava dome at the summit crater, causing a pyroclastic flow that traveled down the slopes of the volcano. The volcanic ash cloud reached a height of 40,000 feet (12,000 m), affecting six sub-districts in Malang Regency and eight villages and two sub-districts in Lumajang Regency. The Gladak Perak Bridge was destroyed, resulting in vehicle access to villages being sealed off. Power outages affected at least 30,253 people, and an estimated 300 families were evacuated.

The Semeru volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia, with a height of 3,676 meters. It is located on the island of Java and is part of a chain of volcanic mountains. Indonesian volcanism is mainly associated with offshore subduction.

Since 1818, various significant eruptions have occurred, with the latest explosive eruptions being reported from 2014 onwards, accompanied by pyroclastic flows, eruption columns and debris avalanches. The Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB) has warned of increased volcanic activity and potential for more pyroclastic flows in the area. People are prohibited from approaching within 1 km of the crater, and residents near the riverside are advised to keep clear of the area.

As of 5 December 2021, there were 41 reported injuries and one death due to the eruption. The BNPB has started rescue and recovery efforts to locate the missing miners, and aid has been provided to the displaced residents. Medical supplies, water, and food have been supplied, and Indonesian President Joko Widodo has visited the Lumajang Regency to lead the post-eruption recovery efforts."

Thirteen miners and one soldier were killed in the incident. After hearing gunshots, angry locals arrived at the scene, resulting in a subsequent confrontation that left seven miners and one soldier dead. The incident sparked public outrage across the state, and calls were made to repeal the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA).

The Indian government formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to conduct an investigation into the incident. The Nagaland Police also registered a case against the soldiers involved. The National Human Rights Commission of India sent notices to the Central and the State governments.

Following the incident, protests were organized across Nagaland, and the Eastern Nagaland People’s Organization withdrew from the ongoing Hornbill Festival. The Nagas hoisted black flags on all its Morungs at the festival, while the Konyaks decided to abstain its cultural troupe from participating, which was followed by other Naga cultural troupes. A two-minute silence was observed at the venue, and candlelight marches were held in Kohima, Dimapur, and other towns. A six-hour shutdown was also called by Naga Students' Federation.

On 7 December, the Government of Nagaland announced that it would suspend all activities at the Hornbill Festival and seek the repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.

Iran is renowned for its cyberwarfare capabilities as a part of its ""soft war"" military strategy. In 2010, the country's ""Passive Civil Defense Organization"" established ""The Cyber Defense Command"" to operate under its supervision. Iran has been recognized as ""one of the most active players in the international cyber arena,"" and a Revolutionary Guards general claimed Iran holds the ""4th biggest cyber power among the world's cyber armies."" Iran runs digital fortresses as a part of its national information network to protect against and engage attackers.

Iran suffered a cyber-attack in 2010 when the nuclear facility in Natanz was infiltrated by the Stuxnet worm, which is thought to have destroyed over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges. Iran crowdsourced solutions to it and is now believed to be better positioned in terms of cyber warfare technology. The Iranian government has been accused of cyber-attacks against the United States, Israel, and Persian Gulf Arab countries, and the conflict between Iran and the United States has been called ""history's first known cyber-war.""

On the other hand, Israel's Jerusalem Post newspaper's website was hacked by suspected Iranian hackers, who replaced its content with a threat against the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center, along with an apparent reference to Qasem Soleimani's assassination two years earlier in Baghdad, Iraq. Furthermore, a 2021 report by a cybersecurity firm indicated that Iran was running two surveillance operations in cyberspace targeting more than 1,000 dissidents. 

Iran has denied these allegations against it, including specific allegations of 2012 involvement in the hacking of American banks. The Iranian Telecommunications minister accused Israel of a failed cyberattack on Iran's telecommunications infrastructure in November 2018 and vowed to respond with legal action. Additionally, an IDF official reported in August 2014 that Iran had launched numerous significant attacks against Israel's internet infrastructure. 

Moreover, in 2015, there was a massive power outage for 12 hours, affecting 40 million people in Turkey, with Iranian hackers, possibly the Iranian Cyber Army, suspected of being behind the outage. The Daily Telegraph reported in 2017 that intelligence officials concluded that Iran was responsible for a cyber-attack on the British Parliament lasting 12 hours that compromised around 90 email accounts of MPs; the motive for the attack is unknown. On May 5, 2020, Reuters reported that Iranian state-run media had targeted hundreds of fake social media accounts to covertly spread pro-Iranian messaging, online since at least 2011, for secretly broadcasting online promotional messages in favor of Iran in order targeting voters in countries including Britain and the United States, with accounts suspended for coordinated inauthentic behavior."

The 2021–22 Russo-Ukrainian crisis continues to escalate as Ukrainian authorities report the arrest of an alleged Russian intelligence agent who attempted to recruit individuals to launch attacks in the port city of Odessa.

The crisis has caused international tension, with involvement from the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The root of the crisis lies in the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations, which sparked a military confrontation in late October 2021.

Tensions have only increased since then, with OSCE observers reporting twice as many ceasefire violations as in 2020 and the deployment of additional Russian troops near the border. The United States has warned the EU of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, prompting Ukraine to intensify diplomatic efforts to address the situation.

Recent developments have only added to the international concern, with Ukraine accusing Russia of escalating tensions and conducting offensive actions in the Donbas. Meanwhile, Russia has accused Ukraine of aggressive actions and violating the Minsk peace agreements with the use of Turkish-made drones.

As of 2022, talks between the United States, Russia, and NATO are scheduled to take place in Geneva and Brussels to address concerns about military activity and tensions over Ukraine. However, the ongoing military escalation and diplomatic deadlock suggest a long road ahead towards resolving the crisis."

The already tense situation between Russia and Ukraine escalated even further as talks between NATO and Russia about the crisis reached a breaking point. The ongoing military confrontation, which began in late October 2021, has caused international tension with involvement from the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The crisis arose due to the first combat use of Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 drones against DPR formations in October 2021. Since then, there have been repeated ceasefire violations and sightings of military buildups from both sides. 

On 10 January 2022, the Ukrainian government announced the arrest of an alleged Russian military intelligence agent who was trying to recruit others to conduct attacks in the city of Odessa. This news follows reports of Ukraine's deployment of half its army, about 125,000 troops, in Donbas to confront pro-Russian separatists. On 3 December 2021, Ukraine used a Turkish-made drone against pro-Russian separatists in Donbas, a move that Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized and believed violated the Minsk peace agreements. 

Russia has been accused of aggressive actions and has allegedly concentrated over 92,000 troops and Iskander short-range ballistic missile systems near the Ukrainian borders. Meanwhile, Ukraine has sharply intensified diplomatic efforts, seeking support from countries such as the UK, the US, and Germany. On 31 December 2021, after a phone call between US President Biden and Russian President Putin, Putin warned against US sanctions and called it a ""fatal mistake."" This warning comes as Poland raises concerns about a potential war. 

Amidst this backdrop of escalating tensions and failed negotiations between NATO and Russia, the future remains uncertain for Russia and Ukraine. Talks aimed at resolving the crisis have become deadlocked, with no summit or meetings at any level expected. The Trilateral Contact Group, which discusses whether Russia is a party to the conflict, has not been making progress either. On 15 November 2021, Putin signed a decree providing humanitarian support to the population of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. However, with no clear resolution in sight and both sides unwilling to budge, the situation remains uncertain and tense."

The 2022 edition of the Australian Open, which is the 110th iteration of the tournament, is set to commence from 17-30 January 2022 at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The Australian Open, run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), is a part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. Both Men's Singles and Women's Singles, along with doubles draws and mixed doubles events, are scheduled to take place. Boys and Girls under 18 will compete in singles and doubles events that are part of the Grade A category of tournaments. Men's and women's wheelchair tennis players will also participate in singles, doubles, and quad events under the Grand Slam category of NEC tours.

The tournament will be played on hard courts across 25 courts, including the five main tennis arenas - Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena, Margaret Court Arena, 1573 Arena, and the newly built Kia Arena. The tournament's main sponsor is Kia, and the total prize money increased by 4.5% to A$ 75,000,000, confirming its status as a significant international tournament.

Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka are the defending champions in Men's Singles and Women's Singles, respectively. Djokovic was initially granted a medical exemption from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination by Tennis Australia and the health department of the state of Victoria; however, he was later detained by the Australian Border Force on 5 January 2022, following visa issues. Djokovic's visa did not meet the country's entry requirements for unvaccinated travelers, leading to his detention. Djokovic's lawyers then requested an injunction against deportation to appeal the visa refusal, which allowed him to remain confined in a detention hotel pending the outcome of the appeal. 

On 10 January 2022, the Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in favor of Djokovic, ordered his release from detention, and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses, stating that Australian officials reneged on an agreement to provide Djokovic with sufficient time to contact his lawyers and tennis authorities before his official interview. While Djokovic's initial visa issues took center stage, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Alex Hawke, then invoked his ministerial powers under the Migration Act 1958 to cancel Djokovic's visa on ""health and good order grounds.""
 
Twenty-five other players and staff had also applied for a medical exemption, and a handful of applications had been granted. Among those who were granted an exemption, Renata Voráčová participated in a warm-up tournament but was deported on 8 January 2022 after her visa was canceled. The Australian government's decision to permit unvaccinated athletes to participate in the tournament, with spectators required to be fully vaccinated, has generated widespread controversy and negative public opinion in Australia."

Congregation Beth Israel, a Jewish synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, United States, was attacked by an armed man on January 15, 2022. The assailant, who claimed to be the brother of Pakistani Al-Qaeda suspect Aafia Siddiqui, entered the synagogue impersonating a homeless man in need of shelter and took four hostages, including Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, during a bar mitzvah ceremony. He demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui as part of his negotiations with law enforcement, but was eventually shot and killed by the police. Texas Governor Greg Abbott confirmed that all hostages were freed, and no one was injured.

Congregation Beth Israel is a Reform Judaism synagogue located in Colleyville, Texas, and was established in 1999. Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker is the synagogue's spiritual leader. Various law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Public Safety, assisted in the hostage situation. The White House and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett monitored the situation closely.

Aafia Siddiqui is a Pakistani Al-Qaeda suspect who was convicted in 2010 of the attempted murder of a United States Army captain while in Afghan custody. The assailant demanded her release as part of his negotiations, but her lawyer denied any involvement in the hostage crisis and condemned the attack. The former lawyer for Siddiqui's only biological brother also denied any involvement.

On 15 January 2022, a massive eruption of the Hunga Tonga volcano in Tonga caused tsunamis in various parts of the Pacific Ocean. The eruption had been preceded by increased volcanic activity from 20 December 2021, and the volcano had been declared dormant on 11 January 2022. The eruption column ejected a large amount of volcanic material into the stratosphere, with the potential to cause a temporary climate effect. While little information is currently available on the extent of damage and casualties in Tonga due to communication issues, video footage has shown waves hitting coastal areas, and there are reports of residents struggling to breathe due to the ash. The small island of Atata was reportedly submerged, and rescue operations are underway. Two people were killed by a small tsunami in Lambayeque, Peru. Aid from other countries is being discussed, with New Zealand's Prime Minister expressing concern over the events in Tonga.

On January 20, 2022, ISIS militants launched a large-scale attack on Al-Sina'a prison in Al-Hasakah, northern Syria, aiming to free ISIS fighters arrested there. The attack included a car bomb and heavy weapons fire on the prison. As a result, a prison riot broke out and prisoners successfully obtained weapons from the armoury, leading to a full-blown attack on prison staff. The prison was subsequently occupied by armed prisoners, and many of them managed to escape. This attack is being called the largest attack committed by ISIS since it lost its last key Syrian territory in 2019, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The clashes caused the death of 67 people. The International Coalition dispatched military aircraft to assist Kurdish forces fighting in the city. Further, SDF forces announced the arrest of 89 of the prisoners who had escaped. So far, the clashes continue between ISIS and Kurdish forces over the control of the prison and its surroundings."

Singapore's Ministry of Health has announced that starting from March 14, 2022, COVID-19 vaccine booster doses will be extended to individuals between the ages of 12 and 17. The move is aimed at strengthening the protection against COVID-19 in the younger population as the Delta variant continues to circulate in the country. The Ministry recommended that individuals receive their booster dose three to four months after completing their second dose. 

Singapore's extensive vaccination campaign has been successful, with more than 88% of the country's population fully vaccinated. The government invested more than one billion Singaporean dollars to purchase and make down payments on promising vaccine candidates, such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and CoronaVac. The campaign prioritized people at high risk of infection, frontline healthcare workers, and the elderly who are vulnerable to severe diseases and complications from infections. 

Over time, the vaccination campaign has expanded to include children between the ages of 12 and 17, after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorized for use by the Health Sciences Authority. In December 2021, the Singaporean government approved the vaccine for children aged five to 11, and the first shots for this age group were administered on Dec 27. 

In addition to its vaccination campaign, the ministry has launched measures to recognize vaccination certificates issued by other countries. On September 19, 2021, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority issued a tamper-proof vaccination sticker that serves as proof of vaccination, and on September 24, Singapore and Malaysia announced plans to recognize each other's vaccination certificates to facilitate travel between the two countries."

Iceland, a country that has a longstanding history of whaling, has recently announced that it will end the practice by 2024. Whaling in Iceland began in the 12th century and continued until the late 19th century. Although it was reintroduced in the 20th century, the International Whaling Commission established a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. While Iceland objected to this moratorium, it continued to maintain a whaling fleet, with one company specializing in catching fin whales and the other catching minke whales. However, in 2020, the hunting of minke whales for domestic consumption was ended as it was no longer popular with tourists. 

In 2018, Icelandic whalers were accused of slaughtering a blue whale, sparking international outrage. This, alongside coronavirus restrictions and increasing domestic whale watching tourism, has placed pressure on the whaling industry in Iceland. The decreasing price of whale meat has also contributed to the decision to end whaling. 

Iceland has a whale watching sector that will likely benefit from this decision as it exists in tension with the whaling industry. It remains to be seen if there will be any impact on Iceland's relationship with other countries that have opposed its whaling practices. Nevertheless, the decision to end whaling is a significant step for Iceland in the conservation of marine life."

Operation Unifier, also known as Canadian Armed Forces Joint Task Force-Ukraine, has seen a significant change in its operations as Canada withdraws its military advisors from Ukraine and relocates them to an undisclosed location in Europe. This move is followed by Canada's decision to move its diplomatic staff to Lviv, resulting in the suspension of all embassy operations in Kyiv. The move comes amidst rising tensions between Ukraine and Russia, with Canada providing military and diplomatic support to Ukraine for years.

Started in response to separatist sentiments in the Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimean regions of Ukraine after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, Operation Unifier is part of Multinational Joint Commission, a larger body composed of the U.S., UK, Canada, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and Denmark aimed at reforming Ukraine's military. Canada has been a major contributor to the operation, with about 200 Canadian soldiers providing training and support to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, rotating every 6 months.

Since the start of the operation, more than 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained under Operation Unifier, with a small Swedish contingent also operating within the framework. The operation has seen several extensions, with the latest announcement in January 2022 extending it until the end of March 2025 and increasing its complement of 200 soldiers by another 60.

The broader mission of Operation Unifier includes helping the development of the region, maintaining security, maintaining democracy, providing humanitarian aid, and promoting economic stability and growth. Several commanders have led the operation, with Lieutenant Colonel Sarah Heer currently in charge.

Despite the positive response from members of the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada, who have welcomed the country's contribution to reforming the Ukrainian military, Canada's recent move to withdraw its military advisors and relocate its diplomatic staff has raised concerns about the security situation in Ukraine. The Canadian government has not disclosed the reason behind the move, but it comes amid heightened tensions between Ukraine and Russia, with Russia amassing troops at the border and in Crimea."

The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation of the European Union and Euratom has been confirmed by the European Court of Justice as compliant with the treaties of the European Union. Poland and Hungary had launched legal proceedings against the regulation, challenging its legal basis. The ruling means that the European Commission is now able to suspend funds from the EU budget to member states that violate rule of law principles, likely to impact the management of EU finances. The regulation requires adherence to principles of legality, transparency, accountability, democratic and pluralistic law-making, legal certainty, effective judicial protection, separation of powers, non-discrimination, and equality before the law, as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. The European Parliament adopted a resolution in March 2021 calling for the implementation of the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation, which cannot be subject to adoption of guidelines. The Commission's failure to provide information led to the European Parliament's threat to start legal action. The European Commission rejected the Parliament's ultimatum to fulfil its obligations on the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation, prompting further legal action."

Australia maintains a list of designated terrorist organisations, which are organisations that have been designated by the Australian government as terrorist organisations as part of the fight against terrorism worldwide. The list is created and maintained by the Attorney-General's Department, and listing, de-listing, and re-listing of terrorist organisations follows a protocol that involves the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Attorney-General's Department. The Australian government currently lists 26 foreign organisations as terrorist organisations, including the recently designated Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham, and the Guardians of Religion Organization, as well as the previously listed entirety of Hamas, including its political wing.

Under the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, it is illegal to materially support or be supported by a listed terrorist organisation, and financing terrorism is also illegal under Division 103 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) monitors financial transactions involving listed terrorist organisations to prevent the financing of terrorism.

Australian anti-terrorism financing laws also include several sections of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 (Cth), which sanction persons and entities under Australian and international law. Prosecutions for these offences rest with the Australian Federal Police, state police forces, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions."
