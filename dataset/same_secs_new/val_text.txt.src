On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the arrests of 13 men suspected of orchestrating a domestic terror plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Governor of Michigan, and otherwise violently overthrow the state government. The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. \c\cPreceding the 2020 United States elections, law enforcement officials, members of Congress, and groups tracking extremism in the country have warned about the increasing threat potential from militia and far-right groups. The Anti-Defamation League identified Michigan as a state where the modern militia movement found its roots and where a number of militia groups remain active. However, Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the Wolverine Watchmen group, which the suspects were members of, "flew under the radar", adding, "This is simply not a big group that we\'d ever heard of."\c\cThe alleged plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer developed from June through September. Within the week preceding the Wolverine Watchmen arrests, there were at least three other state and federal arrest operations linked to the Boogaloo movement, of which the Wolverine Watchmen group's ideology adhered to. \c\cWhitmer, the main target of the plot, had seen her political profile elevated over the preceding months due to her early response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan, in which she enacted strict mitigation measures such as a lockdown of the state, which she was widely praised for. However, she also became a target of criticism from far-right groups, and her measures triggered protests in April and May, including one in which armed protesters stormed the Michigan State Capitol. President Donald Trump had offered his support for the protests, derisively calling Whitmer "that woman from Michigan" and tweeting on April 17: "LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"\c\cUltimately, on October 2, 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court made two rulings in response to the measures: a 4–3 ruling that declared a 1945 law allowing Whitmer to enact the measures was unconstitutional, and a unanimous ruling that declared a 1976 act did not give Whitmer the power to enact the measures without legislative approval. This put uncertainty over enforcement of the measures and forced the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services – and later, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration – to circumvent it by ordering similar measures, even after the alleged plot was made public. \c\cThe suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen. The group was co-founded by suspects Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison; the latter is considered the group's "commander". An NBC News investigation into the suspects\' social media profiles found links between their ideologies and those of the broader boogaloo movement. The Wolverine Watchmen group had been recruiting members on Facebook from November 2019 until June 2020, when Facebook began purging all boogaloo-related material. \c\cThe suspects named in the federal indictment, charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, were Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta. Five of the men were Michigan residents, while the sixth, Croft, was from Delaware. Adam Fox and Barry Croft were accused of being the ringleaders of the plot. The suspects charged with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership, were Wolverine Watchmen founders Musico and Morrison, along with Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar. At least four of the 13 suspects had attended prior rallies at the Michigan State Capitol. On October 15, a fourteenth suspect, Brian Higgins of Wisconsin, was charged at the state level with material support of an act of terrorism. Garbin pleaded guilty on January 27, 2021 and agreed to testify against his five alleged co-conspirators. \c\cJoseph M. Morrison is considered the leader of the Wolverine Watchmen. His home in Munith, which he shared with Musico, was allegedly used as a training site, according to Michigan Assistant Attorney General Gregory Townsend. Photographs of the home show a Confederate battle flag and a variation of the U.S. flag with alternating, vertical red and white stripes and a circle of stars surrounding the words "Liberty or Death". Morrison's neighbors told The Daily Beast that the home's residents were "disrespectful" and said large groups regularly gathered there on weekends, whereupon gunfire would be heard. His online alias was "Boogaloo Bunyan". Morrison had served in the U.S. Marine Corps since 2015, most recently with the 4th Marine Logistics Group in Battle Creek, Michigan, with the rank of lance corporal; he was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve on October 8, the same day as his arrest, for reasons unrelated to the criminal charges. \c\cAdam Fox, the alleged mastermind of the plot, was born Adam Waggoner but changed his last name to his mother's maiden name in 2014. He had been living in the basement of his former employer, a vacuum repair shop in Grand Rapids. Fox received permission for that living arrangement from the shop's owner who felt empathy towards Fox, as Fox was homeless and had dogs. The basement was allegedly used to hold one of the group's meetings. Fox posted a YouTube video in June, mentioning Whitmer's handling of the pandemic as one of his motives for the plot. According to his employer, Fox espoused anti-police and anti-government views, along with support for the boogaloo movement, and had recently become worried about the U.S. becoming a communist country and Democratic politicians taking away his guns. Fox had previously been a member of another militia group called the Michigan Home Guard, but he was kicked out due to "rage issues" and threatening other members on social media. \c\cTy Garbin was raised in Wyandotte but had been living in a manufactured home park in eastern Livingston County at the time of his arrest. His father is an Army veteran. Garbin was a licensed aircraft mechanic and had previously worked for SkyWest Airlines. He met Fox at a Second Amendment rally in Lansing. Garbin allegedly cased the governor's vacation home at night, texted about blowing up a bridge to slow police down, offered to paint his boat for "night fishing" as part of the kidnapping mission on the lake, and had the ability to manufacture guns. His lawyer mentioned he had no criminal record. \c\cBarry Croft regularly posted violent messages on his social media accounts. These accounts depicted him wearing a tricorne and a sweatshirt with an insignia associated with the Three Percenters militia group; he was later identified as the second-in-command of its Wisconsin branch. The FBI identified him as a national leader of the organization in January 2021. He expressed support for the Russia investigation origins counter-narrative and opposition to the country's current immigration policy, and he believed the investigations into President Trump constituted an "uprising". However, he also included Trump's name in a grievance-filled hit-list of politicians that he wanted to hang, which he posted on Facebook in late June. He was living in Bear, Delaware, at the time of his arrest. Croft was arrested multiple times from 1994 to 1996 for assault and burglary. He was convicted in 1997 for possessing a gun in the commission of a felony and spent three years in prison. In April 2019, Croft was pardoned for the conviction, as well as the prior assault and burglary charges, by Delaware Governor John Carney. According to recordings of the alleged plotters, Croft claimed he had been granted permission from God to commit murder. \c\cKaleb Franks had allegedly spent $4,000 on equipment during the planning, including a helmet and night-vision goggles. He also allegedly brought a rifle with a silencer to one of the training exercises. According to his LinkedIn profile, he studied clinical psychology at Washtenaw Community College and was employed as a peer recovery coach at an addiction treatment center in Waterford. He had previously battled an addiction to heroin but has been sober since 2013, according to his lawyer. He was convicted in 2011 for cocaine possession and in 2013 for second-degree home invasion. He served nine months in jail and two years under the jurisdiction of drug courts. \c\cDaniel Harris served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a rifleman from 2014 to June 2019, most recently at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Harris had been deployed to Japan and had reached the rank of corporal. He was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He worked as a security guard at two different companies after being discharged. In June, he attended a Black Lives Matter rally in his hometown of Lake Orion and was interviewed by a local newspaper, where he said he was "upset about the killing of George Floyd and police violence." The group allegedly met at his home on August 23 to discuss the plot. \c\cBrandon Caserta was depicted wearing a Hawaiian-style shirt associated with the boogaloo movement in a TikTok video; and on Facebook, he praised Kyle Rittenhouse, a civilian who shot three protesters, killing two, during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August. Caserta was also a COVID-19 denier and supported the QAnon conspiracy theory; however, in one video, he criticized President Trump and called him a tyrant. His belief system apparently became more extreme following Whitmer's implementation of the statewide lockdown. His social media activity originally consisted of posts about comedy shows and podcasts, motivational quotes, and selfies; but following the lockdown, he began "liking" posts about conspiracy theories regarding Bill Gates, as well as memes about hogtying police officers. \c\cPete Musico was active on YouTube, where he posted video blogs against taxes, gun control, and the so-called deep state. A video posted in 2019, entitled "Gretchen Whitmer Interview", depicted him railing against her policies around automobile ownership and promised he would interview Whitmer in person in a later video. Musico was also active on Gab, where he promoted the unfounded claim that there is an ongoing campaign to kill white people in South Africa. He also followed the accounts of Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs and InfoWars personality Owen Shroyer. On Twitter, he expressed support for Trump and conspiracy theories regarding Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the high presence of mercury in vaccines. Musico's attorney said he was eventually kicked out of the Wolverine Watchmen because he was too "soft" and wouldn\'t commit to violence. \c\cShawn Fix had allegedly hosted Wolverine Watchmen meetings at his home in Belleville to discuss the plot. The house's yard had Donald Trump presidential campaign signs and a Gadsden flag. He was working as a truck driver and had more than a dozen driving infractions from 2007 to 2018. Fix had been charged with assault and battery and aggravated assault in 2012, but the victim dropped the charges in 2013. \c\cEric Molitor had posted support of the boogaloo movement on his Facebook profile. He also spoke positively about Kyle Rittenhouse and the St. Louis gun-toting controversy, along with anti-government sentiment. He had worked for a company that provides respiratory and ballistic protection to the military and first responders. In January 2020, he gave the Wexford County Commission a proposal to make it a Second Amendment sanctuary county, which passed unanimously the next month. \c\cMichael and William Null, twin brothers, allegedly helped conduct surveillance on Whitmer's vacation home. They were also former members of another militia group called Michigan Liberty Militia. They were photographed at a protest held by Michigan United for Liberty, a right-wing group protesting against Whitmer's COVID-19 lockdown orders, at the Michigan State Capitol on April 30. William also attended another anti-lockdown rally in May, as well as Black Lives Matter rallies in Grand Rapids and Flint, according to Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf, though Leaf also said William vented about the movement. William was also photographed at a February 2017 protest against President Trump's Executive Order 13769, held by the Equality Caucus of Genesee County in Flint. He and members of the Michigan Liberty Militia were counter-protesting while wearing military fatigues, carrying firearms, and waving a Gadsden flag. William also allegedly made threats against the protesters on Facebook. \c\cPaul Bellar, who was arrested in Columbia, South Carolina, where he had moved from Milford over the summer after an eviction, was allegedly responsible for designing the tactical training exercises used by the Wolverine Watchmen, which included the use of firearms, medical treatment, and other tasks. Bellar's former neighbor in Milford said the pandemic caused Bellar to lose his job and called him a "very angry person" and said he threatened her with a gun after a run-in with him. According to Bellar's father, he trained for the U.S. Army at Fort Jackson for a year before being discharged in 2019 with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. \c\cBrian Higgins was a resident of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, when he was arrested on October 15. He is alleged to have provided his night-vision goggles and dashcam to help conduct surveillance on Whitmer's home. \c\cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that they became aware of group chats on social media in early 2020 threatening to conduct the violent overthrow of state governments and law enforcement. During the initial investigation of social media chats, the FBI said that they encountered Barry Croft and Adam Fox. In March 2020, local officers from an unidentified police department in Michigan reported to the FBI that the militia was seeking addresses of officers. The FBI then interviewed a militia member, who agreed to become a confidential source after they raised concerns that there were plans to kill police officers. On May 8, the FBI obtained a federal search warrant to review Croft's Facebook account. Agents found messages "plotting potential acts of violence", including a May 3 post referencing a male individual who "may be first" and was wanted "in custody"; the FBI claims this individual was South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. \c\cThe FBI subsequently began infiltrating the group online and in person with informants in June, according to a criminal complaint. Starting at that point, the FBI began compiling photographs, video footage, telephone calls, and encrypted messages made by the suspects and storing them as evidence on a USB flash drive. The content, said to consist of "hundreds of hours of undercover audio recordings and more than 13,000 pages of encrypted text messages", was released by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan on October 16. On March 30, Pete Musico, a co-founder of the Wolverine Watchmen, allegedly made a comment about placing Whitmer under citizen's arrest and numerous other statements on tape that prosecutors later said had indicated "a violent intent". \c\cIntentions by the group to obtain Whitmer's address reportedly went as far back as April 19, according to court records. On April 30, all members of the group attended an armed protest at the Michigan State Capitol, which prosecutors said was the beginning of opportunities to conduct surveillance. The plot was reportedly hatched in an official capacity on June 6, among a group of about a dozen individuals meeting in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb located northwest of Columbus. A confidential source at the meeting reported that the group primarily sought to establish a new, self-reliant society that adhered to the U.S. Bill of Rights. Participants reportedly discussed peaceful and violent actions of achieving this goal, with talks shifting to how state governments were allegedly violating the U.S. Constitution, how "tyrants" should be killed, and that those present should return home to recruit neighbors. \c\cAfter the Ohio meeting, Fox allegedly contacted the militia – already being investigated by the FBI – seeking assistance for the plot. On June 14, the militia held a field training exercise. That day, Fox contacted one confidential source in a recorded phone call, detailing the Ohio meeting, and he requested "200 men" to attack the State Capitol in order to take Whitmer and others as hostages and to hold a "trial" for the governor, accusing her of treason. During the call, Fox reportedly said to the source that the operation had to occur prior to the 2020 United States presidential election. \c\cDuring a Second Amendment event at the State Capitol on June 18, Fox was recorded by a confidential source attempting to recruit militia group leaders to unite in an effort to attack the State Capitol. Two days later on June 20, Fox invited individuals, including one confidential source, to where he was employed in Grand Rapids. According to the source, Fox collected cellphones to prevent recordings and led participants through a trapdoor from the main floor, though the source wore a concealed recording device unknown to those gathered. Audio from the meeting provided to the FBI contained discussions of an assault on the Capitol, how to counterattack first responders, and the use of Molotov cocktails to destroy law enforcement vehicles. It was concluded that the group would meet on the first weekend of July, where they would discuss plans and perform training exercises. \c\cIn a June 25 Facebook video captured by the FBI, Fox held a livestream criticizing the justice system, the Government of Michigan and the state's order closing gyms, calling Whitmer a "tyrant bitch" and stating to viewers, "I don\'t know, boys, we gotta do something. You guys link with me on our other location system, give me some ideas of what we can do". \c\cThe FBI alleges that training first occurred on June 28 in Munith, Michigan at a militia member's property, with Fox, his girlfriend, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Caserta, and a confidential source participating in the exercises. Participants were reportedly told to leave if they felt uncomfortable with attacking the government and participating in kidnapping. According to Musico's defense attorney, Fox started making comments about storming the State Capitol during this training session, but there was no agreement from the other members, and Musico expressed concern about the plan's tactical viability, saying, "It's a fishbowl." Court documents released on November 13 alleged that in addition to storming the State Capitol, there were plans of executing hostages and televising them over the course of a week, or locking people inside the building, while the Legislature was in session, and setting it on fire with the intention of leaving no survivors. \c\cAccording to Musico's attorney, from that day to October 1, there was no activity from the Wolverine Watchmen due to a fight between Fox and Musico and Musico's eventual departure from the group. However, the FBI's confidential source for the investigation said that participants met for weapons exercises in Cambria, Wisconsin, between July 10 and 12, with Croft, Garbin, and a militia member attempting to make an improvised explosive device (IED) on July 11, though the device was defective. Franks also brought a rifle equipped with a silencer, firing it at the time. \c\cAt a second meeting in Ohio held on July 18, audio collected by a confidential source revealed discussions of attacking a Michigan State Police station, though Garbin rejected plans of an assault on the Capitol building, instead suggesting to attack Whitmer's family vacation home on Birch Lake in Elk Rapids. In a July 14 call recorded by a source, Fox said he researched the governor's office, concluding that Whitmer would not be present there and was heard saying, "In all honesty right now ... I just wanna make the world glow, dude. I\'m not even fuckin\' kidding. I just wanna make it all glow dude. I don\'t fuckin\' care anymore, I\'m just so sick of it. That's what it's gonna take for us to take it back, we\'re just gonna have to everything's gonna have to be annihilated, man. We\'re gonna topple it all, dude. It's what great frickin\' conquerors, man, we\'re just gonna conquer every fuckin\' thing man." In a July 26 call with a confidential source, Fox said "Maybe we should just make a bunch of cupcakes and send them out", with the source interpreting this as Fox seeking to initiate a "widespread bombing campaign", according to the FBI. \c\cFox invited participants to his Grand Rapids location on July 27, where a confidential source provided recordings of discussions that shifted to kidnapping Whitmer when she was arriving at, or leaving, either her personal vacation home or the Michigan Governor's Summer Residence on Mackinac Island. According to the FBI, in sourced audio, Fox could be heard saying, "Snatch and grab, man. Grab the fuckin\' Governor. Just grab the bitch. Because at that point, we do that, dude -- it's over." Fox was also heard in the recording suggesting that the group hire a realtor to find Whitmer's exact residence, collecting information on the surrounding area and recruiting individuals skilled with information technology and demolitions. \c\cParticipants met in Munith a second time for training on August 9, and afterwards, they communicated via group calls and chats monitored by a confidential source. In these communications, Fox suggested researching the governor's residence in Lansing and destroying Whitmer's boat. Harris said in a chat, "Have one person go to her house. Knock on the door and when she answers it just cap her ... at this point. Fuck it. ... I mean ... fuck, catch her walking into the building and act like a passers-by and fixing  [sic] dome her then yourself." During further chats on August 18, participants concentrated on finding the Whitmer family's vacation home and planned on how to escape the area by boat. \c\cOn August 23, participants met at Harris\' home in Lake Orion, where a secret recording was captured of the group discussing surveillance of the vacation home and Franks shared that he spent nearly $4,000 on night vision goggles and a helmet. A source captured audio of an August 29 surveillance operation, where Fox drove by the Whitmer family's vacation home, took photographs, and discussed response times of police in the area, with Fox allegedly heard saying, "We ain\'t gonna let \'em burn our fuckin\' state down. I don\'t give a fuck if there's only 20 or 30 of us, dude, we\'ll go out there and use deadly force." The next day on August 30, the FBI said screen captures of the group chat showed Garbin suggesting the demolition of a bridge near the vacation home to slow and distract police. \c\cDue to recommendation of the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, the construction of a $1.1 million barrier and electric fence at the Michigan Governor's Mansion in Lansing was announced on September 4 after weeks of construction, with spokeswoman Tiffany Brown saying "perimeter security and other safety upgrades" were being performed. Regarding the security upgrades, The Detroit News wrote "Whitmer, a Democrat who was first elected in 2018, has been the subject of menacing messages at Capitol demonstrations against her past COVID-19 stay-at-home orders", with the newspaper also citing other threats against Whitmer. \c\cWhile driving in three vehicles–with an undercover FBI agent and confidential source present–from a group camp in Luther towards the vacation home on September 12 and early September 13, Croft allegedly suggested that the group attempt to kidnap Whitmer that night, though the idea was dismissed. According to the FBI, Croft and Fox, who were in the first vehicle, planned on detonating a bomb on a bridge of U.S. Route 31 in Elk Rapids, photographing the underside of the bridge, and deciding where to place explosives. The group in the first vehicle then drove to a boat launch across the lake from the vacation home, waiting for a second vehicle to conduct surveillance on the location. The third vehicle, which was also occupied by an undercover agent, was tasked with monitoring for any followers or suspicious activity in the area. On the way back to Garbin's property, the group discussed abandoning the kidnapping plan and instead destroying the vacation home entirely. \c\cAt a discussion recorded at Garbin's property on September 13, Fox said the plan would strictly be a kidnapping. An undercover agent told Fox that explosives for destroying the bridge leading to the lake would cost about $4,000. The group decided that a final training exercise would be conducted later in October, though Fox pushed for an earlier date the following day. On October 2, Fox told a confidential source that he purchased an 800,000-volt taser to be used for the kidnapping. That same month, he reportedly contacted Musico, who advocated for a nonviolent approach. Fox, Garbin, Harris, and Franks planned to meet with an undercover FBI agent to purchase explosives on October 7, though Caserta did not attend due to work obligations, while Croft returned to Delaware prior to the meeting. \c\cAll of the members involved were arrested on the night of October 7, and charges were filed against them the next day. Search warrants and arrests were executed all across Michigan. The arrests were reportedly part of a planned effort between federal and state authorities, launched after evidence was discovered indicating the suspects wanted to kidnap Whitmer before the 2020 election. At least seven FBI field offices, along with the operational divisions at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., were reportedly involved in coordinating the arrests. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. Several weapons and other items were seized, including at least 1,916 rounds of pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition; hundreds of firearms; extended magazines; various silencers; speedloaders; and bomb-making equipment. \c\cSix people (Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta) were charged in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan for conspiring to commit kidnapping. The federal charges carry an automatic sentence of life imprisonment if convictions are obtained. A federal judge said the federal government had probable cause in the cases against five of the defendants and declared they could move forward to trial, while also denying bond to four of them. \c\cDuring a court hearing on October 13, an FBI agent testified that the conspirators had considered leaving Whitmer in a boat in the middle of Lake Michigan and disabling its motor. He also testified that the group had discussed, during early stages of the planning, kidnapping Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also imposed strict lockdown orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted the FBI to notify members of Northam's security staff about the potential threat. \c\cOn October 26, federal prosecutors announced the FBI had found "explosive device components" and ghost guns and are considering adding federal terrorism charges after they are analyzed by experts. On October 28, an unsealed search warrant revealed that some of the defendants had discussed South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster as another possible target during the early stages of planning in March. The warrant also revealed that, in late June, Croft had posted on Facebook a hit-list of politicians that he said he wanted to hang. The list included the names of McMaster, President Trump, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton, New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, other Democratic and Republican elected officials, liberals, Muslims, and "all anti-Americans". \c\cOn October 30, Franks's attorney requested a judge to reconsider her decision to keep him imprisoned, saying he is diabetic and fears contracting COVID-19 in jail. \c\cOn December 16, all six federal defendants were indicted by a grand jury. \c\cOn January 1, 2021, Croft, who remains jailed in a Philadelphia federal prison, asked to be released while he awaited his court hearings, due to the constant delays in a prisoner transfer and the subsequently slow progress of the case against him. Federal prosecutors argued against releasing him, describing Croft as a "violent extremist" and saying such a decision would be "unreasonable". \c\cOn January 15, 2021, a judge ordered all six defendants to stand trial on March 23. The trial date was later postponed to October 12. \c\cOn January 27, 2021, Garbin pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit kidnapping. His sentencing is scheduled for July 8. As part of a plea bargain, he agreed to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for no additional charges being filed against him by prosecutors. \c\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged seven other men (Pete Musico, Joseph Morrison, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar) with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership. Two of the defendants were each set a bond of $10 million, with preliminary examinations scheduled for October 21. Musico's bond was later reduced to $100,000 after his attorney convinced the judge his role in the plot was overstated. \c\cOn October 20, Bellar was charged with state crimes and was extradited from his home state of South Carolina for a formal trial. \c\cOn November 10, Fix was released on a $250,000 bond. Three days later, bond was reduced for Morrison, Musico, and Bellar. Bellar was released on a $75,000 bond on November 13. \c\cOn October 15, Brian Higgins from Wisconsin was charged by Nessel with material support of an act of terrorism, which carries a 20-year sentence. On October 19, Higgins was released on bail, with one of the imposed restrictions being that he not try to make contact with the other 13 defendants. On November 18, his attorney announced his client's plans to challenge his extradition from Wisconsin to Michigan. The basis of the challenge was that the extradition paperwork was signed by Whitmer, the target of the alleged plot, thus creating a conflict of interest. On December 15, a judge in Columbia County, Wisconsin ruled there was enough probable cause for the transfer to occur. His extradition was delayed after his attorney filed an appeal on the ruling. \c\cOn December 4, twin brothers Michael and William Null were released on bond. \c\cOn December 18, a Jackson County judge denied a bond reduction request for Morrison, saying he could still pose a threat to the public. \c\cOn January 14, 2021, Molitor was released on bond. \c\cOn March 29, 2021, Morrison, Musico, and Bellar were bound over for trial after a three-day-long preliminary hearing. At the same hearing, threat of terrorism charges were dismissed against Morrison and Musico; Bellar did not face that charge. \c\cWhitmer spoke out during a livestream held after the thwarted plot was revealed by the FBI. She thanked the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, called the plotters "sick and depraved men", and cast blame on President Trump for refusing to explicitly condemn far-right groups and for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer later urged in a tweet that the suspects be called domestic terrorists and not members of any militia organization. In an October 11 interview with Face the Nation, she said security threats against her still existed and that extremists like the Wolverine Watchmen are "finding comfort and support in the rhetoric coming out of Republican leadership from the White House to our state House." Whitmer wrote about the plot in an opinion piece in The Atlantic on October 27, where she continued to blame Trump's rhetoric for causing divisiveness in the country. \c\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the plot "one of the largest cases in recent history" and labeled the case as "rather unprecedented" in nature. State Senator Mike Shirkey, Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also condemned the plot. Chatfield later criticized Whitmer for not warning state lawmakers in advance about the plotters\' original intent to storm the Michigan State Capitol building. Delaware Governor John Carney, who pardoned one of the suspects in 2019, called the federal charges "disturbing" and said, "This is also another warning sign about the growing threat of violence and radicalization in our politics." Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also been discussed by the alleged plotters as a potential target, declined to comment about the details of the plot but said he and his family felt safe with the protection of the Virginia State Police. \c\cIn an October 8 interview, President Trump criticized Whitmer for her rebuke of him in response to the kidnapping plot, saying he condemned all forms of "extreme violence" and calling for her to reopen her state. During that interview, Trump falsely claimed that Michigan's schools and churches were closed under Whitmer's orders. In response to Trump's remarks, Whitmer said it "tells you everything you need to know" about the difference between him and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Biden also reacted to Trump's remarks on October 16, saying the "failure to condemn these folks is stunning."\c\cTrump continued to attack Whitmer for her COVID-19 mitigation measures at a rally in Muskegon on October 17, which was matched with chants of "Lock her up!", to which he replied, "Lock \'em all up." Trump's daughter-in-law Lara, a campaign surrogate, later insisted he was merely "having fun" at the rally. In a subsequent interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Whitmer called Trump's rhetoric "incredibly disturbing" and said it is "inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism". She also countered Trump's claims at the rally that she should relax the statewide COVID-19 restrictions, saying Michigan hasn\'t had a stay-at-home order since spring. At an October 27 rally in Lansing, Trump downplayed the alleged plot and continued the verbal attacks on Whitmer, which were also met with chants of "Lock her up!". \c\cSince the kidnapping plot at one point involved an intended attack on police, state law enforcement agencies were put on high alert in response. \c\cDar Leaf, the elected sheriff of Barry County, Michigan, appeared to defend two of the suspects in an October 8 interview, saying that "a lot of people are angry with the governor, and they want her arrested. So are they trying to arrest or was it a kidnap attempt? Because you can still in Michigan if it's a felony, make a felony arrest." Citing the state's citizen's arrest statute, he continued, "It doesn\'t say if you are an elected office that you\'re exempt from that arrest. I have to look at it from that angle and I\'m hoping that's more what it is, in fact, these guys are innocent till proven guilty so I\'m not even sure if they had any part of it."\c\cThe interview went viral on the internet, along with the revelation that Leaf had shared the stage with one of the suspects at a May 18 anti-lockdown protest. Attorney General Nessel condemned the remarks as "dangerous", while a number of other Michigan sheriffs expressed their outrage as well. Law experts disagreed with the notion that the Wolverine Watchmen were simply planning to conduct a legal citizen's arrest on Whitmer, saying it was far-fetched. Leaf later clarified his comments, claiming he simply wanted a fair trial for the accused and did not agree with their alleged actions, which he called "horrible". His earlier comments and his ties with one of the suspects during the anti-lockdown protest have spurred calls for him to resign. On October 13, Leaf acknowledged the criticism but said he will not resign. \c\cDemocrats in the Michigan Legislature renewed calls for a ban on guns in the State Capitol building in response to news of the plot, following an unsuccessful September proposal drafted in response to armed anti-lockdown protesters storming the building in April. \c\cOn December 14, the day that Michigan's electors to the Electoral College were set to meet at the capital, authorities closed the Michigan State Capitol to the public and shuttered state legislators\' offices in the wake of the alleged plot, following "credible threats of violence". The building was left open only to those needed for the Electoral College. Earlier that day, State Representative Gary Eisen claimed there would be a "Hail Mary" effort regarding a plan to prevent electors from casting a vote. When asked if he can assure the public that it will be a safe day in Lansing, and that nobody would get hurt, Eisen replied, "No. I don\'t know. Because what we\'re doing today is uncharted." Shortly after the interview, Chatfield and Speaker-Elect Jason Wentworth released a statement disavowing any threat of violence or intimidation and announcing Eisen would be removed from his committee assignments for the rest of the term. \c\cOn January 11, 2021, Michigan banned the open carry of firearms on the State Capitol, citing the alleged plot and the storming of the United States Capitol. The ban was supported by both Democratic and Republican state lawmakers. On January 15, 2021, the Michigan National Guard was requested, and heavy fencing was put up around the State Capitol, in preparation for an armed protest two days later, on January 17. \c\cA spokesperson for Facebook, which had been used by the suspects in plotting Whitmer's kidnapping, said the company would be cooperating with the FBI's investigation. \c\cA scheduled October 13 campaign stop by Eric Trump at a Lyon Township gun store was moved to a banquet center in Novi after it was discovered one of the suspects had worked there for three weeks before being fired. \c\cThe Wolverine Watchmen group was reportedly an offshoot of the Michigan Militia. The day after the suspects were arrested, the Michigan Militia issued a statement disavowing the group. Other Michigan-based militia groups also distanced themselves from the plotters\' actions and intentions. The Michigan Home Guard, a militia that one of the suspects had once been a member of before being kicked out earlier this year, released a statement condemning the Wolverine Watchmen's actions. \c\cConspiracy theories about the alleged plot emerged on social media, falsely claiming the Wolverine Watchmen were anarchists affiliated with the antifa and Black Lives Matter movements. Some social media posts promoting the theories were flagged by Facebook as part of its anti-misinformation campaign, while PolitiFact rated the posts as "Mostly False".
Brexit (/ˈbrɛksɪt, ˈbrɛɡzɪt/; a portmanteau of "British exit") was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) at the end of 31 January 2020 CET. The UK is the first and only country formally to leave the EU, after 47 years of having been a member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Communities (EC), since 1 January 1973. It continued to participate in the European Union Customs Union and European Single Market during a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 at 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET). \c\cThe European Union and its institutions have developed gradually since their establishment, including 47 years of British membership, and grew to be of significant importance to the UK. Throughout that time Eurosceptic groups had existed, opposing aspects of the Union and its predecessors. Prime Minister Harold Wilson’s pro-Europe government held a referendum on continued EC membership in 1975 in which voters chose to stay within the bloc with 67.2% of the vote share, but no further referendums were held as the project grew and became "ever-closer" in the subsequent Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. Facing pressure from Eurosceptic groups, Prime Minister David Cameron's pro-Europe government held a second referendum on continued EU membership in 2016 in which voters chose to leave the EU with 51.9% of the vote share. This led to his resignation, replacement by Theresa May, and four years of negotiations with the EU on the terms of departure and future relations. This process was both politically challenging and deeply divisive within the UK, with one deal rejected by the British parliament, general elections held in 2017 and 2019, and two new Prime Ministers in that time, both Conservative. Under Boris Johnson's government, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 CET; trade deal negotiations continued to within days of the scheduled end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 CET. \c\cThe effects of Brexit will in part be determined by the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was agreed on 24 December 2020 and ratified by the UK Parliament on 30 December 2020 and was "provisionally" applied by the EU from 31 December 2020. The broad consensus among economists is that Brexit will likely harm the UK's economy and reduce its real per capita income in the long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy. Brexit is likely to reduce immigration from European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the UK, and poses challenges for British higher education, academic research and security; the Turing scheme was announced as a new global student exchange programme in early 2021 to combat this. Following Brexit, EU law and the EU Court of Justice no longer have supremacy over British laws or its Supreme Court. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which the UK could then amend or repeal. 
On March 29, 2021, Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old Mexican American boy, was fatally shot by Chicago Police Department officer Eric Stillman in the Little Village neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. Bodycam footage of the shooting was released publicly on April 15. \c\cAdam Toledo was a seventh-grader at Gary Elementary School from the Little Village neighborhood in Chicago. He was 13 years old when the incident occurred. \c\cRuben Roman is a 21-year-old arrested by the Chicago PD at the scene. \c\cEric Stillman is the 34-year-old officer who killed Toledo. He was placed on administrative leave for 30 days following the incident.  Originally, police said Stillman had no complaints on his record. According to the organization that runs the police database however, he had three complaints and four use of force reports on his record at the time of the shooting. \c\cProsecutors alleged that at around 2:30 a.m., Toledo and Roman were walking toward 24th Street when Roman fired multiple rounds as a vehicle passed. Police ShotSpotter detector technology registered shots fired and a squad car arrived at the scene. According to prosecutors\' initial claims, Toledo ran away from the officers, was chased into an alleyway, turned back to the officer with a gun in his hand, and was then shot in the chest. The police claimed a handgun was recovered at the scene from behind a fence after an "armed confrontation". \c\cOn April 15, 2021, however, the released body cam footage of Toledo’s shooting showed he was unarmed at the moment of the shooting. The video shows the officer chasing Toledo into the alleyway, where Toledo slows down and stops. In footage taken from another angle, it appears that he tosses a weapon away, over a fence. The officer points a strobe flashlight at him and yells "Show me your fucking hands." Toledo then turns around with his hands up. As he does so, the officer yells "drop it," and Toledo is shot by the officer. Toledo was not holding a gun when he was shot, but it is uncertain if he was armed in the moments leading up to being shot. \c\cAfter shooting Toledo, officer Stillman calls for medical assistance and begins to perform CPR. \c\cChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has called for reforms to how police pursue individuals on foot and called for a "thorough, expeditious" investigation. Officials have said they are in the "very early stages" of interviewing witnesses and officers. \c\cIn the lead up to the release of the body cam footage, all Chicago police officers\' days off were cancelled to "ensure public safety". During the press conference releasing the body cam footage, Mayor Lightfoot also stated that the city would be putting into place plans to prepare for unrest. \c\cToledo is believed to be the youngest person killed by the Chicago Police Department in several decades. \c\cProtests have occurred in Chicago in the days following Toledo's death. \c\cColumnist Eric Zorn wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune saying it was "too early to say with confidence" what happened and thus Toledo should not be portrayed as a "martyr" until more facts come out. His comments were received with outrage. Days later in another op-ed, Zorn wrote that the "less supportive response ... took fair exception to my chilly, analytical tone ... I regret that tone. In focusing on details and marshaling evidence and arguments, I can neglect the emotional resonance in situations, as though I\'ve forgotten or don\'t care that a child who was loved has died, and that the death of someone with so much life ahead of him is always, always a tragedy. I should have done better."\c\cThe writer Roxanne Gay said, "The Adam Toledo video was so horrifying that Chicago boarded up municipal buildings before the video was released. That tells you all you need to know."\c\cThe journalist Maria Hinojosa stated, "Adam Toledo was a child. Not a threat."\c\cCongressman Joaquin Castro wrote on Twitter, "Adam Toledo was 13-years-old. He complied and had his hands up. Chicago police killed him with a shot to the chest and then lied that he posed an imminent threat. The Toledo family deserves justice and accountability." His brother, former-Secretary Julian Castro, wrote, "Chicago PD shot Adam Toledo with his hands in the air instantaneously after ordering him to do so—then lied about it. They executed Adam, a boy who was not yet in high school. Indict this officer, then pass a national use of force standard immediately."\c\cSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote, "Adam Toledo was just 13 years old. He was a child. This is heartbreaking. He deserves justice. His family deserves justice."\c\cOn April 1, 2021, Chicago Police Department alerted its officers that Latin Kings ranked members were instructed to open fire at unmarked police cruisers to retaliate for the shooting of Adam Toledo. The warning was prioritized to officers in Little Village, between Lawndale Avenue and Whipple Street.
On April 15, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Nine people were killed, including the gunman, 19-year-old former employee Brandon Scott Hole, who committed suicide. Four others were injured. Hole's motive remains unknown. \c\cThe FedEx facility where the shooting occurred is located in the southwestern part of the city, near Indianapolis International Airport. It is the company's second-busiest hub, with nearly 4,000 employees in total. The building is equipped with metal detectors and security turnstiles at its entrance requiring the employees to scan their FedEx badges. There were at least 100 people in the facility at the time of the shooting, and many of them were changing shifts or on dinner breaks. \c\cAccording to Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt, the gunman entered the facility in a vehicle and, after exiting unprovoked, immediately began firing. Afterwards, the gunman entered the facility and began shooting again. The shooting lasted several minutes. Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department responded to the scene shortly after 11:00 p.m. local time. However, the shooter took his own life by that point. \c\cThe shooting resulted in a brief closure of Interstate 70 at Ameriplex Parkway, which reopened shortly afterwards. \c\cThere were nine fatalities in the shooting, including the gunman. Excluding the gunman, four victims were found dead outside of the facility, with the other four being found dead inside. Five people were taken to the hospital, including one in critical condition; four of them suffered gunshot wounds. \c\cPolice identified the gunman as Brandon Scott Hole, a 19-year-old resident of Indiana who had been employed at the Indianapolis facility until 2020. After the shooting, authorities conducted a search of his home and seized evidence, including electronics. \c\cIn March 2020, Hole's mother contacted the FBI and local authorities and warned them about her son's intent to commit suicide by cop, prompting a preliminary investigation to be opened. Hole was placed in a temporary mental health hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. They seized a shotgun from him, and the FBI questioned Hole about unspecified items found in his bedroom in April 2020. Eventually, the investigation was closed due to insufficient evidence of any criminal violation, and the shotgun was not returned to Hole. Previously, in 2013, local police contacted Hole for unclear reasons. \c\cOn April 16, President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. He and Vice President Kamala Harris released statements expressing their condolences with the victims\' families. Later, during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, he decried the recent string of mass shootings in the United States as a "national embarrassment" and called on Congress to act on gun legislation.

She later announced retail stores and auto dealerships may reopen on May 26 and nonessential medical, dental, and veterinary procedures may begin on May 29. \c\cOn May 22, Governor Whitmer extended the stay-at-home order until June 12 and the state of emergency until June 19. \c\cOn June 1, Governor Whitmer lifted the stay-at-home order, and also announced that restaurants and bars would be allowed to reopen statewide on June 8. \c\cOn July 14, Governor Whitmer extended the state of emergency again until August 11. \c\cA month later Whitmer issued a new order to expire September 4. A later emergency order expired October 27. \c\cFacing a COVID-19 surge in the state in April, Governor Whitmer hoped to avoid more mandatory shutdowns and asked Michigan residents on April 9 to take more "personal responsibility," while asking the White House to send more vaccine doses. The request for vaccines was denied, in large part because the protection provided by vaccines activates only after several weeks while the need to prevent new infections was immediate. On April 12, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky argued that asking for voluntary quarantine would not be enough. She said that Michigan needed "to really close things down, to go back to our basics, to go back to where we were last spring, last summer, and to shut things down."\c\cDuring the week of March 16, 2020, Michigan Medicine started in-house testing for COVID-19, with the capabilities to deliver same-day results. This allowed the hospital to bypass the state's testing system, which was previously the sole provider of testing for the virus. The same week, the health system also launched drive-thru testing services for Michigan Medicine patients at West Ann Arbor Health Center, Brighton Health Center, and Canton Health Center. \c\cSimilarly, Beaumont Health and Henry Ford Health System in Metro Detroit also developed in-house testing methods in an effort to increase overall testing capacity within the state. On March 27, 2020, a regional drive-up testing center opened in Detroit, at the vacant State Fairgrounds site. A partnership between Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties, the city of Detroit, and three regional health systems, the center is able to test up to 400 residents a day, who are referred to the site from their doctor via scheduled appointments. The state restructured reporting procedures and began incorporating private test results in official government case tallies on March 19, 2020. On April 15, 2020, Hurley Medical Center in Flint opened a mobile testing clinic at Atwood Stadium, with capacity for at least 250 people per day. Testing is provided to those with orders from a doctor and is not open to the general public. Similar drive-thru testing facilities opened in Atlanta, Bad Axe, Battle Creek, Bay City, Benton Harbor, Dearborn, Grand Rapids, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Saginaw, and Traverse City. \c\cThe state health department released case counts and death tolls daily and updated recovered cases weekly. Reviews of the outcomes of reported COVID cases led to the discovery of unrecorded deaths on multiple occasions. These deaths were added to the daily toll when discovered, with the result that daily reported deaths did not always indicate the current state of the epidemic. Recovery from the disease was defined simply as surviving 30 days after first symptoms, with no review of actual health or hospitalization status. Starting May 29, 2020, families could get tested together in Kalamazoo. \c\cStarting April 13, 2020, new testing sites opened in Atlanta, Bad Axe, Bay City, Battle Creek, Benton Harbor, Detroit, Flint, Jackson, Kalamazoo, and Traverse City. \c\cMichigan airports received a combined $256 million in federal aid to help ease economic hardship from the coronavirus crisis, funded by the CARES Act. \c\cStarting March 13, 2020, Delta Air Lines, which has a major hub at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said it would cancel all flights to Europe for 30 days, decreasing flights by 40% and grounding 300 planes. Delta had previously indicated it would reduce international flights by 20–25% and domestic flights by 10–15%. On April 28, Delta announced it was suspending flights to and from Flint, Lansing, and Kalamazoo and several other small hub airports across the country after losing $534 million in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic. American Airlines ended service to 15 small airports, including Kalamazoo, starting October 7. \c\cStarting on March 15, 2020, several grocery chains that have stores in Michigan, including Kroger, Meijer, and Walmart, began reducing their business hours for cleaning and restocking in response to the pandemic. Similarly, Michigan-based Meijer reported a plan to hire 40–50 new seasonal employees per store to help meet public demand during the outbreak. Kroger announced that, starting the morning of March 23, all of its Michigan stores would be dedicating the first hour of business on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to seniors, expectant mothers, first responders, and those with compromised immune systems. The following week, Kroger announced it would hire up to 2,000 people in Michigan in response to the pandemic. \c\cThe 2020 North American International Auto Show in Detroit was canceled on March 29, due to the use of its venue TCF Center as a FEMA facility. \c\cMichigan-based automotive manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler announced plans to gradually shut down plants starting March 19 with all plants closed by the end of the month. \c\cOn March 30, Ford announced it will convert its Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti to produce GE/Airon Corporation Model A-E ventilators. It says it will produce 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days. \c\cOn April 1, 2020, General Motors announced it will produce 30,000  V+Pro critical care ventilators for the national stockpile. \c\cOn the morning of March 16, Governor Whitmer announced a temporary order to close all bars and restaurants in the state to sit-down service, effective at 3 pm the same evening until March 30. Carry-out and delivery options were excluded from the order, although restaurants were urged to limit in-building carry-out services to five customers at a time. The order also included fitness centers, theaters, casinos, and other venues that encourage large assemblages of patrons, with several exceptions, such as office buildings. This order is expected to have significant economic impacts on businesses, and it prompted the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association to call for Whitmer to submit paperwork to qualify Michigan for the U.S. Small Business Administration Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. The order also expands unemployment benefits to public health workers who become ill, people who need to take time off to care for children, and others, until April 14. \c\cDomino's Pizza, which is centered in the state, anticipated hiring up to 10,000 people to help meet increased demand for food delivery services due to the pandemic, while Jet's Pizza also prepared to hire "hundreds" of additional delivery drivers for the same reason. \c\cOn June 8, Lansing restaurants reopened for dine-in service for the first time since mid-May. \c\cOn September 21, it was announced three bars in West Michigan lost their liquor licenses temporarily after they allegedly failed to enforce coronavirus mandates. \c\cOn January 22, 2021, at Governor Whitmer announced that starting on February 1, restaurants may re-open at 25% capacity with up to 100 people, tables must be six feet apart with no more than six people per table, and bars and restaurants must close by 10 p.m. Contact information must also be collected from people for contact tracing purposes. \c\cSince December 1, 21 restaurants have received COVID-19 order violations by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Six restaurants had their food license suspended – and five of the six suspensions are still in place. Another 15 businesses were sent cease-and-desist orders, which is a lesser violation. \c\cRestaurants, bars and retail stores were allowed to operate at 50% capacity starting March 5, 2021. \c\cOn March 19, the owner of a pizza restaurant in Holland was criminally charged with allowing indoor dining when it was banned, not enforcing mask rules, and ignoring capacity limits. \c\cOn March 19, the Michigan Strategic Fund unanimously voted to approve a $20 million economic relief program meant to help struggling small businesses affected by the pandemic. The Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) had processed over 1.7 million applications as of May 13, with 1.375 million people receiving benefits. The state has paid $5.62 billion in benefits since the state of emergency was declared two months prior. By June 19, UIA disbursed $11.4 billion to two million people since the coronavirus pandemic reached the state. On August 21, the Federal Emergency Management Administration approved UIA's application for funding that would provide an additional $300 per week payment to Michigan residents receiving unemployment benefits. On October 14, the federal government approved unemployment benefits for 20 more weeks, with up to 59 weeks of benefits for some workers. On October 20, Governor Whitmer signed a bill approving six more weeks of state unemployment aid. \c\cOn March 12, Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training. Four days later, they announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, which affected Michigan's team, the Detroit Tigers. On June 24, two members of the Detroit Tigers organization (later identified as pitcher Daniel Norris and a coach) tested positive for COVID-19. Norris was later cleared to join the Opening Day roster. \c\cOn June 25, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order which allows professional sports to resume in the state. Two days before, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred unilaterally implemented a 60-game season. Players reported to training camps at their regular season home stadiums on July 1 in order to resume spring training, which included inter-squad games only, and prepare for a July 23 or 24 Opening Day (July 24 for the Tigers). In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, teams only played their own division and the opposite league's corresponding geographical division, e.g. the Tigers only played the American League Central (40 games total) and National League Central (20 games total). Games were played behind closed doors, with artificial crowd noise played over loudspeakers. \c\cThe Tigers\' August 3–6 series against the St. Louis Cardinals was postponed several times after 17 of the latter's members tested positive for COVID-19, with two of the games later cancelled outright. \c\cAlso on March 12, the National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days, which affected the Detroit Pistons. \c\cOn March 14, Detroit Pistons power forward Christian Wood reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. \c\cThe Pistons\' season officially ended on June 5 when they failed to make the cut for a 22-team restart. \c\cIn their 2020–21 season, the Pistons\' game against the Denver Nuggets on February 1 was postponed due to a positive test on a Detroit player, as well as the February 16 game against the San Antonio Spurs due to an outbreak on the latter team. \c\cIn the National Hockey League, the season was suspended for an indefinite amount of time starting March 12, which affected the Detroit Red Wings. \c\cThe Red Wings\' season officially ended on May 27 when they failed to make a 24-team playoff tournament. \c\cThe NHL's shortened 2020–21 season began on January 13. It will run for 56 games per team, ending on May 8. \c\cOn July 27, National Football League preseason games, which usually take place in August, were cancelled by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell due to the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the Detroit Lions. \c\cSince July 30, the Lions have placed eight players on the injury list after they tested positive for COVID-19. One player's test, quarterback Matthew Stafford, was later revealed to be a false-positive and he was removed from the list on August 4. \c\cMost games in the 2020 season were played behind closed doors, with crowds at some stadiums limited to friends and families of the players, coaches, and staff members. \c\cSeveral members of the Lions coaching staff, including interim head coach Darrell Bevell, sat out the December 26 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers due to an outbreak. \c\cExecutive Order 2020–42, signed April 9, closed golf courses in the state. On April 26, golf courses were allowed to re-open, provided golfers adhere to social distancing guidelines, and stay at least six feet away from people who do not live in their home. Golf carts will not be allowed. \c\cOn May 8, golf carts were allowed back on the Michigan golf courses. \c\cThe FireKeepers Casino Hotel Championship, an LPGA Symetra Tour event, is one of the first pro sports events returning to Michigan, scheduled for July 24–26 at the Battle Creek Country Club. \c\cThe PGA Tour Champions's The Ally Challenge was played at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club in Grand Blanc Township from July 27–August 2, 2020. \c\cOn April 6, IndyCar was forced to cancel the Duel in Detroit at Belle Isle Park which were originally scheduled to be first two races of the season. The NASCAR Cup Series postponed the 2020 FireKeepers Casino 400 at Michigan International Speedway from June 5–7 to August 8. The NASCAR Xfinity Series lost their Michigan date for 2020. \c\cThe NCAA also canceled all of its remaining winter tournaments for the 2019–2020 academic year, including the 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament—whose national semi-finals and championship were scheduled to be hosted by Detroit. All spring 2020 seasons were canceled as well. \c\cOn June 1, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order that allows college teams to begin workouts and practice sessions for fall 2020 sports seasons. It allows "outdoor fitness classes, athletic practices, training sessions or games, provided that coaches, spectators and participants not from the same household maintain six feet of distance from one another at all times". \c\cOn August 8, the Mid-American Conference (MAC), which includes the Central Michigan Chippewas, Eastern Michigan Eagles, and Western Michigan Broncos, canceled all of its fall 2020 sports seasons. On September 25, the MAC reversed its previous decision on its 2020 football season, voting to play a six–game schedule which started on November 4. \c\cOn August 11, the Big Ten Conference, which includes the Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans, postponed their fall 2020 sports seasons. On September 16, however, it was announced the 2020 football season would start on October 24 with an eight-game schedule. \c\cOn August 12, the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, which is made up mostly of schools in Michigan, postponed its fall 2020 and winter 2021 sports seasons. \c\cIn the fall of 2020, the pandemic caused both the Michigan Wolverines football and Michigan State Spartans football teams to cancel their games against the Maryland Terrapins football team due to COVID-19 outbreaks. The Michigan football team's game against their arch-rival, the Ohio State Buckeyes, as well as their game against the Iowa Hawkeyes, were also canceled after an increasing number of Michigan players and staff members became infected. \c\cOn January 23, 2021 the University of Michigan (U of M) shut down all sports for two weeks after the new more infectious UK variant of COVID-19 was discovered in five individuals with ties to the school. As of March 5, 2021, 296 U of M student-athletes and 35 coaches and staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. \c\cAt the high school level, the Michigan High School Athletic Association canceled the remainder of the winter 2019-20 seasons and all of the spring 2020 seasons on April 3, 2020. \c\cOn July 17, MHSAA announced all fall sports will resume as scheduled for the 2020–21 school year with practices starting August 10 for football and August 12 for other sports. However, on July 30, they announced all preseason scrimmages would be canceled and medium and high-risk sports (soccer, volleyball and football) could start practice but a final decision on whether games would be allowed might not be made until August 20. The MHSAA postponed the football season until spring 2021. On August 20, the MHSAA announced it will be allowing soccer, volleyball and swimming to start fall competition in Michigan's region 6 and 8 in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Regions 1-5 and 7 are still pending due to the phases they are in according to the Governor's executive orders on the pandemic. Girl's golf, boys tennis and cross country in both peninsulas are able to start immediately because they are not contact sports. On September 3, the MHSAA approved the return of all fall 2020 sports. \c\cOn November 15, Governor Whitmer announced the MDHHS has ordered all high school sports to suspend activities for three weeks, effective November 18. \c\cOn April 15, a convoy of thousands of motorists drove from all over the state to protest the extension of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order. The protest, known now as Operation Gridlock, involved clogging the streets surrounding on near the Michigan State Capitol, including the Capitol Loop, with their vehicles, drawing national attention. The protest was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, a group with ties to the DeVos family, through Facebook. The Michigan Freedom Fund supported the rally by as an event co-host, spending an estimated $250 to promote the event. The Michigan Conservative Coalition is asking the governor to take a more measured approach that would allow certain parts of work and daily life to start returning to normal. The organizers urged participants to practice social distancing, and not leave their vehicles during the protest. Lt. Darren Green of the Michigan State Police estimated several thousand cars were part of the demonstration, with 100 to 150 people congregating on the Capitol lawn. “They’re doing a pretty good job of maintaining social distance," Green said. "They’re being respectful and not causing any issues at all.” Neither the Michigan State Police nor the Lansing Police Department had reported any arrests. Multiple services have been disrupted as a result of Operation Gridlock, such as the Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA) temporarily suspending their downtown route. Governor Whitmer said the protest was legal per the First Amendment's right to freedom of assembly, and understood the protesters\' anger, but warned them they were endangering their health by not following social distancing guidelines and noticed some people were not wearing personal protective equipment, including children, further adding "(It's) not a political decision, it's about public health. The enemy is the virus, not one another." President Donald Trump supported the protest on April 17 with an all-caps tweet saying "Liberate Michigan". \c\cOn April 30, a second protest occurred when hundreds of protesters, many carrying firearms, gathered at the Michigan Capitol.  Many protesters were able to enter the building.  The demonstration was organized by conservative group Michigan United for Liberty. Governor Whitmer said on April 30 that she found elements of the protest ‘disturbing.’ Also, in an appearance May 3 on CNN’s State of the Union, the governor said the Confederate flags, nooses and Nazi signs displayed were ‘outrageous’ and racist, with some depicting her as Adolf Hitler. On May 14, more armed protesters from Michigan United for Liberty gathered outside the Michigan State Capitol. The organization's Facebook group was deleted over death threats against Governor Whitmer and a fight broke out over a doll tied to a noose carried by a man who also had an axe at the protest. The Michigan Legislature closed its scheduled session to avoid the possibility of another armed confrontation inside the chamber. \c\cOn May 20, the Michigan Conservative Coalition held "Operation Haircut" on the lawn of the Capitol Building, in which barbers gave free haircuts, in support of an Owosso barber who was forced to shut down after continuing to operate until the previous week, violating the executive order closing non-essential businesses that included barbershops and beauty salons resulting in the state suspending his license. Several of the barbers at the demonstration were issued $1,000 citations by the Michigan State Police for disorderly conduct. A week later on May 27, the group from Operation Haircut delivered a letter to the Governor with a layout of safe practices to reopen. The charges against the Owosso barber were eventually dismissed. The charges against the other barbers arrested during the Operation Haircut demonstration were dismissed on February 8, 2021. \c\cA peaceful demonstration of prayers organized by the religious non-profit Transformation Michigan was performed on the Capitol lawn on May 28. \c\cA peaceful protest called "Let MI People Go" by religious group Stand Up Michigan took place on the Capitol lawn on October 8. \c\cOn December 15, a protest took place near the home of Robert Gordon, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, to oppose the new restrictions imposed by the state. 
{"The COVID-19 pandemic in Vanuatu is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Vanuatu on 11 November 2020. \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cOn 16 March 2020, travel restrictions and quarantine measures were put in place for those entering Vanuatu. On 22 March, Vanuatu's health authorities confirmed that tests for a resort worker with a suspected case of coronavirus had returned negative. On 26 March President Tallis Obed Moses declared a state of emergency in the country. A tourist on a cruise ship visiting the island of Aneityum had tested positive for the virus, prompting a lockdown on the island. Blood samples from locals on the island were also sent to New Caledonia for testing. \c\cOn 11 November, Vanuatu confirmed its first asymptomatic case, resulting from a man who had traveled to the islands from the United States via Sydney and Auckland. The man had arrived on Vanuatu on 4 November and undergone managed isolation and quarantine with no symptoms. He tested positive on 10 November. \c\cOn 2 December, Vanuatu confirmed that the man who tested positive earlier on November has tested negative for COVID-19. \c\cOn 6 March 2021, Prime Minister Bob Loughman announced two new cases. \c\cAs on 23 March 2021, total number of cases in Vanuatu was 3, with 2 active cases and 1 has recovered. \c\cAs on 1 April 2021, total number of cases in Vanuatu was 3, with 2 active cases and 1 recovery."}
The COVID-19 pandemic in Israel (Hebrew: מגפת הקורונה בישראל) is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in Israel was confirmed on 21 February 2020, when a female citizen tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 at the Sheba Medical Center after return from quarantine on the Diamond Princess ship in Japan. As a result, a 14-day home isolation rule was instituted for anyone who had visited South Korea or Japan, and a ban was placed on non-residents and non-citizens who were in South Korea for 14 days before their arrival. \c\cBeginning on 11 March, Israel began enforcing social distancing and other rules to limit the spread of infection. Gatherings were first restricted to no more than 100 people, and on 15 March this figure was lowered to 10 people, with attendees advised to keep a distance of 2 m (6 ft 7 in) between one another.  On 19 March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a national state of emergency, saying that existing restrictions would henceforth be legally enforceable, and violators would be fined. Israelis were not allowed to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary.  Essential services—including food stores, pharmacies, and banks—would remain open.  Restrictions on movement were further tightened on 25 March and 1 April, with everyone instructed to cover their noses and mouths outdoors.  As coronavirus diagnoses spiked in the city of Bnei Brak, reaching nearly 1,000 infected people at the beginning of April, the cabinet voted to declare the city a "restricted zone", limiting entry and exit for a period of one week. Coinciding with the Passover Seder on the night of 8 April, lawmakers ordered a 3-day travel ban and mandated that Israelis stay within 100 m (330 ft) of their home on the night of the Seder. On 12 April, Haredi neighborhoods in Jerusalem were placed under closure. \c\cOn 20 March, an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor in Jerusalem who suffered from previous illnesses was announced as the country's first casualty. \c\cThe first wave of the pandemic came amid the under a caretaker government, as no new ruling coalition had been formed following the 2020 Israeli legislative election, the third since the dissolution of the government in December 2018. Netanyahu continued to act as prime minister, and has been accused of adopting additional powers in the effort to monitor and contain the spread of the virus.  A national unity government was sworn in on 17 May 2020.  During the second wave, movements such as the \'Black Flags\' and the gatherings in front of Netanyahu's residence protested his government's response to the virus.  During the third wave, on 22 December 2020, the national unity government collapsed, triggering a fourth election in two years. \c\cOn 21 February, Israel confirmed the first case of COVID-19. A female Israeli citizen who had flown home from Japan after being quarantined on the Diamond Princess tested positive at Sheba Medical Center. On 23 February, a second former Diamond Princess passenger tested positive, and was admitted to a hospital for isolation. \c\cOn 27 February, a man, who had returned from Italy on 23 February, tested positive and was admitted to Sheba Medical Center. On 28 February, his wife also tested positive. \c\cOn 1 March, a female soldier tested positive for the virus. She had been working at the toy store managed by the same man diagnosed on 27 February. On 3 March, three more cases were confirmed. Two contracted the virus at the same toy store: a middle school student who worked at the store, and a school deputy principal who shopped there. Following this, 1,150 students entered a two-week quarantine. One other person, who had returned from a trip to Italy on 29 February, also tested positive for the virus. \c\cThe government has set up a multi-lingual website with information and instructions regarding the pandemic. Among the languages: English, Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, Amharic, French, Spanish, Ukrainian, Romanian, Thai, Chinese, Tigrinya, Hindi, Filipino. \c\cThe government also set up a dashboard where daily statistics can be viewed. \c\cOn 26 January 2020, Israel advised against non-essential travel to China. On 30 January, Israel suspended all flights from China. On 17 February, Israel extended the ban to include arrivals from Thailand, Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore. \c\cOn 22 February, a flight from Seoul, South Korea, landed at Ben Gurion Airport. An ad hoc decision was made to allow only Israeli citizens to disembark the plane, and all non-Israeli citizens aboard returned to South Korea. Later, Israel barred the entry of non-residents or non-citizens of Israel who were in South Korea during the 14 days prior to their arrival in Israel. The same directive was applied to those arriving from Japan starting 23 February. \c\cOn 26 February, Israel issued a travel warning to Italy, and urged cancelling of all travel abroad. \c\cOn 21 February, Israel instituted a 14-day home isolation rule for anyone who had been in South Korea or Japan. \c\cA number of tourists tested positive after visiting Israel, including members of a group from South Korea, two people from Romania, a group of Greek pilgrims, and a woman from the U.S. State of New York. 200 Israeli students were quarantined after being exposed to a group of religious tourists from South Korea. An additional 1,400 Israelis were quarantined after having traveled abroad. \c\cOn 9 March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a mandatory quarantine for all people entering Israel, requiring all entrants to quarantine themselves for 14 days upon entering the country. The order was effective immediately for all returning Israelis, and would apply beginning on 13 March for all foreign citizens, who must show that they have arranged for accommodation during their quarantine period. \c\cOn 2 March, the 2020 Israeli legislative election was held. Multiple secluded voting booths were established for 5,630 quarantined Israeli citizens who were eligible to vote. 4,073 citizens voted in the coronavirus-special voting booths. After the election, numerous Israelis were in quarantine. \c\cOn 15 March, Justice Minister Amir Ohana expanded his powers and announced that non-urgent court activity would be frozen. As a result, the corruption trial of Prime Minister Netanyahu was postponed from 17 March to 24 May. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel urged the Attorney General to stay the new regulations. \c\cOn 15 March, the Israeli government proposed allowing the Israel Security Agency (ISA) to track the prior movements of people diagnosed with coronavirus through their mobile phones. The security service would not require a court order for its surveillance. The stated goal of the measure was to identify people with whom infected individuals came into contact in the two weeks prior to their diagnosis, and to dispatch text messages informing those people that they must enter the 14-day self-quarantine. The security measure was to be in place for only 30 days after approval by a Knesset subcommittee, and all records were to be deleted after that point. Critics branded the proposal an invasion of privacy and civil liberties. \c\cOn 17 March, at 1:30 AM, a Knesset committee approved the contact-tracing program, making Israel the only country in the world to use its internal security agency (Shin Bet) to track citizens\' geoloations. Within the first two days, the Ministry of Health text-messaged 400 individuals who had been in proximity to an infected person, and told them to enter a 14-day self-quarantine. On 19 March, the Supreme Court of Israel heard petitions to halt the contact-tracing program, submitted by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, and Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights, and issued an interim order. The same day, several hundred protesters converged on the Knesset to protest the phone surveillance and other restrictions on citizens\' movements, as well as the shutdown of the judicial and legislative branches of the government. Police arrested three protesters for violating the ban on gatherings over 10 people, and also blocked dozens of cars from entering Jerusalem and approaching the Knesset building. On 26 March, the ISA said contact tracing had led to over 500 Israelis being notified who were then diagnosed with coronavirus. On April 26, 2020, the Supreme Court issued its judgment on the contact-tracing petitions. In granting the petitions, the Court held that the Government's decision passed constitutional review under the exigent circumstances at the time it was made, but that further recourse to the Israel Security Agency for the purpose of contact tracing would require primary legislation in the form of a temporary order that would meet the requirements of the Limitations Clause of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. The Court further held that due to the fundamental importance of freedom of the press, ISA contact tracing of journalists who tested positive for the virus would require consent, and in the absence of consent, a journalist would undergo an individual epidemiological investigation, and would be asked to inform any sources with whom he was in contact over the 14 days prior to his diagnosis. \c\cAs late as 15 March, doctors complained that guidelines for testing were too restrictive. On 16 March, the Health Ministry approved a number of experimental treatments for patients suffering from COVID-19. \c\cOn 18 March, the Defense Ministry took over purchasing of Corona-related gear. On the same day, the Israel Institute for Biological Research announced that they are working on a COVID-19 vaccine. \c\cOn 29 March, Magen David Adom announced that it will collect blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients to treat those most severely affected with the infection. \c\cBy the third week in March, El Al, Israel's national air carrier, responded to a government request to send rescue flights to Peru, India, Australia, Brazil, and Costa Rica to bring home hundreds of Israelis who were stranded around the world due to the worldwide pandemic. On 22 March, 550 Israelis returned from India; a few days before about 1,100 Israeli travelers were repatriated from Peru. \c\cOn 10 March, Israel began limiting gatherings to 2,000 people. A day later, on March 11, Israel further limited gatherings to 100 people. \c\cOn 14 March, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced new regulations and stated the need to "adopt a new way of life". The Health Ministry posted new regulations, effective 15 March. These included banning gatherings of more than 10 people, and closure of all educational institutions, among them daycare centers, special education, youth movements, and after-school programs. The list of venues required to close included: malls, restaurants, hotel dining rooms, pubs, dance clubs, gyms, pools, beaches, water and amusement parks, zoos and petting zoos, bathhouses and ritual baths for men, beauty and massage salons, event and conference venues, public boats and cable cars, and heritage sites. Take-away restaurants, supermarkets, and pharmacies were to remain open. The Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock closed to prevent contamination of the holy sites. \c\cAs a result of the government's directive for citizens to remain at home, there was an increase in calls to domestic violence hotlines, and women's shelters were close to full capacity, both due to new arrivals and to current residents who remained due to the pandemic. \c\cTo encourage social distancing, half of the seats on the Jerusalem Light Rail were marked with signs saying "Sitting on this seat is prohibited". \c\cThe government prohibited sitting on the front seats of buses to reduce the chance of infecting the driver. The seats were wrapped with tape. \c\cStickers in supermarket aisles encourage people to distance themselves from one another: "For the sake of your health, stand here". \c\cOn 12 March, Israel announced that all universities and schools would close until after the Passover (spring) break. After the break, schools remained closed and students learned online. \c\cOn 3 May, grades one to three were allowed to resume school, with restrictions, and not in all cities. In addition, grades eleven and twelve were allowed to hold revisions for the upcoming Bagrut exams. \c\cOn 16 March, Israel imposed limitations on the public and private sectors. All non-critical government and local authority workers were placed on paid leave until the end of the Passover holiday. Private sector firms exceeding 10 employees were required to reduce staff present in the workplace by 70%. \c\cBy 1 April, the national unemployment rate had reached 24.4 percent. In the month of March alone, more than 844,000 individuals applied for unemployment benefits—90 percent of whom had been placed on unpaid leave due to the pandemic. \c\cAs of 19 March, public transportation ridership was down 38.5 percent compared to before the virus outbreak. Public bus operations were strictly curtailed by the government, which placed an 8 p.m. curfew on bus operations nightly, and halted all public transportation between Thursday night at 8 p.m. and Sunday morning, going beyond the usual hiatus on public transportation in Israel during Shabbat (from Friday evening to Saturday evening). \c\cAs of 22 March Israel's Ministry of Transport and Road Safety and its National Public Transportation Authority instituted a notification system allowing passengers using public transportation to inquire whether they had shared a ride with a person sick with COVID-19. The travel histories will be stored through the use of the country's electronic bus card passes, known as Rav-Kav. \c\cAt the peak of the first wave, on 20 April 2020, public transportation ridership was down 80% compared to before the outbreak. \c\cOn 9 March, after it was discovered that an employee at the Israeli embassy in Greece had contracted coronavirus and spread it to two family members, it was announced that the embassy was temporarily shutting down. \c\cOn 30 March, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced an economic rescue package totaling 80 billion shekels ($22 billion), saying that was 6% of the country's GDP. The money will be allocated to health care (10 billion shekels); welfare and unemployment (30 billion shekels) aid for small and large businesses (32 billion shekels), and to financial stimulus (8 billion). \c\cּDuring April 2020, Bituah Leumi deposited one-time payments to seniors, disabled people, people receiving income support or alimony payments, and families with children. \c\cOn 16 June 2020, the Knesset passed a stimulus bill to encourage businesses to bring workers back from unemployment. \c\cThe pandemic forced many events to be cancelled. Notwithstanding the closure of wedding halls, weddings took place in private homes with the limitation of no more than 10 participants in each room; dancing could take place both indoors and in outdoor courtyards. Weddings were also held on rooftops and yeshiva courtyards. In one case, a Sephardi couple opted to hold their wedding ceremony in an Osher Ad supermarket, which was exempt from the 10-person rule. Some weddings were also streamed online through platforms like Zoom. \c\cOn 16 March, the Bank of Israel ordered retail banks to close, but allowed special services to remain open for elderly people. \c\cOn 22 March, both the open-air Carmel Market in Tel Aviv and the open-air Mahane Yehuda Market in Jerusalem were closed by police. \c\cMany supermarkets experienced a shortage of eggs caused by panic buying and fear of shutdown. \c\cThe Health Ministry's rules on indoor gatherings, which were reduced from 100 to 10, still take into account the minimum number of members needed for a minyan (public prayer quorum). With stricter restrictions placed on citizens on 25 March (see below), the two Chief Rabbis of Israel called for all synagogues to be closed and prayer services to be held outdoors in groups of 10, with 2 m (6 ft 7 in) between each worshipper. Many synagogues in Jerusalem were locked and prayer services held outdoors. Due to the uptick in coronavirus diagnoses in Bnei Brak and after initially ordering his followers to ignore Health Ministry restrictions, leading Haredi posek Chaim Kanievsky eventually issued an unprecedented statement on 29 March instructing Bnei Brak residents not to pray with a minyan at all, but rather individually at home. Despite this, Kanievsky was accused of secretly arranging public prayers at his house. According to Israeli Ministry of Health statistics, 24% of all coronavirus infections in Israel with known infection points (35% of all known cases) were contracted in synagogues, 15% in hotels, and 12% in restaurants. \c\cAfter back-and-forth discussions with representatives of the chevra kadisha (Jewish religious burial society), the Health Ministry allowed burial society members to proceed with many traditional aspects of burial for coronavirus victims. Burial workers will be garbed in full protective gear to perform the taharah (ritual purification) of the body, which will then be wrapped in the customary tachrichim (linen shrouds) followed by a layer of plastic. The funeral service must be held completely outdoors. Funeral attendees do not need to wear protective gear. \c\cOn 26 March, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was closed. \c\cOn 1 April, the Chief Rabbis of Israel published guidelines for observance of Passover laws during the outbreak. The guidelines included praying at home and not in a minyan, selling chametz online, and getting rid of chametz at home in ways other than burning, so as not to go out into the streets for the traditional burning of the chametz. \c\cZiyarat al-Nabi Shu\'ayb is a Druze festival called Ziyara celebrated between 25 and 28 April which is officially recognized in Israel as a public holiday. Mowafaq Tarif the current spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, announced that the traditional festivities of the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu\'ayb were canceled for the first time in the history of the Druze community. \c\cOn 18 March at 6 pm, Israelis across the country applauded from their balconies for two minutes in appreciation of medical workers and first responders battling coronavirus. \c\cOn 19 March, Prime Minister Netanyahu declared a national state of emergency. He said that existing restrictions would henceforth be legally enforceable, and violators would be fined. Israelis were not allowed to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary. Essential services would remain open. News reports showed hundreds of Israelis ignoring the new ban on Shabbat, 21 March, and visiting beaches, parks, and nature spots in large numbers, prompting the Ministry of Health to threaten imposing tighter restrictions on the public. \c\cOn 25 March, the government imposed stricter restrictions on citizens\' movements. These include:\c\cPeople must not venture more than 100 m (330 ft) from their homes. Exceptions include:\c\cEmployee arrival to work is permitted according to regulations\c\cAcquiring food, medicine, essential products and receiving essential services\c\cReceiving medical treatment\c\cBlood donation\c\cLegal proceedings\c\cDemonstrations\c\cArriving at the Knesset\c\cReceiving care in the framework of the welfare system\c\cDeparture of an individual or persons living in the same place for a short time and up to 100 meters from the place of residence\c\cProviding medical assistance to another person or assisting a person with difficulty or distress\c\cPrayer in an open place, funerals, weddings, and brit milah, as well as a woman's visit to the mikvah, provided that they pre-arranged the time of their arrival\c\cTransfer of a minor to educational settings for the children of essential workers and special frameworks (in accordance with the Public Health Order). \c\cTransfer of a minor, whose parents live separately, by one of his parents, to the other parent's home. \c\cTransfer of a minor whose responsible parent is required to leave for an essential purpose if there is no responsible place for the child to be left under his care. \c\cPrivate vehicles may have only two passengers. Taxis may have only one passenger. \c\cEssential workers must be tested for fever at their workplace, and anyone with a temperature over 38 °C (100 °F) will be sent home. \c\cViolators will be subject to a 5,000 shekels fine, or up to six months\' imprisonment. \c\cBeginning on April 1 the government proposed to intensify precautionary restrictions on its citizens, requiring them to: refrain from all public gatherings, including prayer quorums of 10 men; limiting outings to two people from the same household; and calling upon them to always wear face masks in public. \c\cBeginning on April 12, the government required all Israelis to cover their nose and mouth when leaving their homes. Exceptions include "children under age 6; people with emotional, mental or medical conditions that would prevent them from wearing a mask; drivers in their cars; people alone in a building; and two workers who work regularly together, provided they maintain social distancing". The new law was passed on the same day that the World Health Organization questioned the efficacy of face masks for protecting healthy individuals from catching the virus. \c\cOn 2 April, the cabinet voted by conference call to declare Bnei Brak a "restricted zone", limiting entry and exit to "residents, police, rescue services, those bringing essential supplies and journalists", for an initial period of one week. With a population of 200,000, Bnei Brak had the second-highest number of coronavirus cases of all Israeli cities in total numbers, and the highest rate per capita. On 10 April the closure was relaxed to allow residents to leave the city to go to work, attend a funeral of an immediate relative, or for essential medical needs. \c\cLawmakers enforced a 3-day nationwide lockdown in conjunction with the Passover Seder, which took place in Israel on Wednesday night, April 8. All travel between cities was prohibited from Tuesday evening until Friday evening. From Wednesday at 3 p.m. until Thursday at 7 a.m., all Israelis were prohibited from venturing more than 100 m (330 ft) from their home. The goal of these measures was to prevent the traditional family gatherings associated with the Passover Seder. The lockdown did not apply to Arab towns, where Passover is not observed. \c\cDespite the lockdown, several prominent politicians, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, President of Israel Reuven Rivlin, Yisrael Beiteinu party leader Avigdor Lieberman, Minister of Immigration and Absorption Yoav Galant, and Likud MK Nir Barkat were noted by the Israeli press to have celebrated the Seder or other parts of the festival with relatives who did not live with them. \c\cOn April 12, the government imposed a closure on Haredi neighborhoods of Jerusalem, citing Ministry of Health statistics that nearly 75% of that city's coronavirus infections could be traced to these neighborhoods. The closure impacted Mea Shearim, Geula, Bukharim Quarter, Romema, Mekor Baruch, Sanhedria, Neve Yaakov, Ramat Shlomo, and Har Nof. Residents of these neighborhoods were allowed to leave to other areas only to go to work, attend funerals of immediate relatives, and for essential medical needs. The closure was opposed by the Mayor of Jerusalem, Moshe Lion, who reportedly told the government cabinet members: "Take the Ramot neighborhood for example — 60,000 residents and 140 of them sick. Why do we need to close off the whole neighborhood?"\c\cA partial nationwide lockdown was again imposed from 14 to 16 April, preventing Israelis from visiting family in other towns, and Jerusalem residents from leaving their own neighborhoods, in conjunction with the seventh day of Passover and the Mimouna holiday the following evening at the end of Passover. \c\cThroughout the month of Ramadan, which began on April 25, stores in towns with majority Muslim populations (including East Jerusalem) were to be closed from 6 pm until 3 am. Indoor prayer for all religions was banned, while outdoor prayer was allowed for groups up to 19 people, distanced at least 2 m (6 ft 7 in) apart. \c\cOn 24 April 2020, the government approved the reopening of street stores and barbershops, effective 26 April 2020. Malls, gyms, and restaurants without delivery services remained closed. \c\cOn 7 May 2020, malls and outdoor markets reopened, with restrictions on the number of people allowed. On 27 May 2020, restaurants reopened, with 1.6 meter distancing between diners, and masked staff. \c\cOn 4 May 2020, Prime Minister Netanyahu outlined a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, approved by the government. Immediate changes included allowing outdoor meetings of groups not exceeding 20, removal of the 100-meter limit on venturing from homes, and allowing meetings with family members, including elderly. Weddings with up to 50 attendees were also allowed. The easing of restrictions would halt should one of the following occur:\c\c100 new daily cases (excluding individuals arriving from abroad, outbreaks in retirement homes, and cases in other current outbreak hotspots)\c\cthe doubling time of infections decreases to 10 days\c\cthe number of patients in serious condition reaches 250\c\cAdditional easing of restrictions was announced on 5 May 2020. \c\cOn 19 May 2020, the requirement to wear masks outdoors and in schools was lifted for the remainder of the week due to a severe heat wave. \c\cOn 20 May 2020, beaches and museums reopened, and restrictions on the number of passengers on buses were relaxed. Houses of prayer reopened to groups of up to 50 people. Attendees were required to wear masks and maintain a distance of two meters. \c\cOn 3 May 2020, schools reopened for first to third grade, and 11th to 12th grade. Classes were limited in size, and schoolchildren were required to wear masks. By 17 May 2020, limitations on class size were lifted. \c\cOn 10 May 2020, preschools and kindergartens reopened, with limits on the number of children per class, and on a rotating half-week schedule. Nurseries were reopened with a full-week schedule, but allowing only 70% of the children to attend. Priority was given to children of single or working mothers. \c\cOn 17 to 19 May 2020, schools reopened fully, with certain social distancing rules in place, including staggered recesses and maintaining 2 meters distance between pupils during breaks. Children arriving at school were required to present a health statement signed by their parents. \c\cA number of schools were shut down after reopening due to cases among staff members or students. \c\cOn July 1, the Knesset reauthorized ISA mobile phone tracking of infected individuals by enacting the Law to Authorize the ISA to Assist in the National Effort to Contain the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (Temporary Provisions) 2020–5780. As ISA location tracking resumed, by July 5, over 30,000 Israelis were ordered into quarantine. \c\cOn 6 July 2020, following over two weeks of continued increase in the number of new daily cases, Netanyahu announced new social distancing guidelines, approved by the government. These included:\c\cRestriction of social gatherings to 20 people\c\cLimiting the number of synagogue worshippers to 19 people\c\cClosure of gyms, night clubs, culture venues, and event halls\c\cLimiting the number of people on public buses to 20\c\cLimiting the number of restaurant guests to 20 indoors, or 30 for restaurants with outdoor seating\c\cOn 17 July, additional restrictions were announced. These included:\c\cClosure of all studios and gyms, except for those used by professional athletes\c\cNo sitting in bars or restaurants (delivery service and take-away allowed)\c\cWeekend lockdown of non-essential businesses from 5:00pm Friday until 5:00am Sunday (supermarkets and pharmacies not included)\c\cClosure of beaches during weekend lockdown, starting 24 July 2020\c\cGatherings limited to 20 people outdoors, and 10 people indoors\c\cDue to pressure from business owners, the government backtracked on the closure of restaurants, pools, and beaches. Weekend closures of malls and markets were also cancelled, following claims that the closures had not slowed infection rates. \c\cOn 31 August 2020, the coronavirus cabinet approved the \'traffic-light\' plan introduced by Prof. Ronni Gamzu, in which each city is assigned a color indicating its current level of COVID-19. \c\cOn 6 September 2020, the government approved closure of schools and a night-time curfew for forty \'red\' communities. This plan replaced Gamzu's proposal of full closure in ten \'red\' towns and went into effect 8 September. The communities affected by the curfews were among the poorest in Israel, with mainly Arab and ultra-Orthodox population. Residents under curfew were restricted to 500 meters distance from their homes, from 7pm to 5am. \c\cOn 10 September 2020, Israel became the country with the highest rate of COVID-19 infections per capita. As confirmed infections continued to rise daily, Israeli officials warned that hospitals would eventually be unable to confront the crisis. \c\cOn 13 September 2020, the government approved a 3-week country-wide lockdown, beginning Friday, 18 September at 2pm, and ending on 10 October. Restrictions include:\c\cPeople will be limited to within 500 meters of their homes, except for work and essential activities such as buying food and pharmacy goods\c\cClosure of malls, stores (except food and pharmacies), hotels, restaurants, fitness clubs and swimming pools\c\cGatherings limited to 10 people indoors, or 20 people outdoors\c\cClosure of schools except for special education and certain boarding schools (online schooling permitted for all schools)\c\cNo sitting in bars or restaurants (delivery service allowed)\c\cThe 3-week lockdown took place during the high holidays, during which many Jews attend synagogue. The lockdown rules for prayer were as follows:\c\cOutdoor prayer groups limited to 20 people\c\cIndoor prayer groups limited to \c\cN\c\c{\\displaystyle N}\c\c groups of 10 people, with \c\cN\c\c{\\displaystyle N}\c\c depending on the number of entrances \c\cE\c\c{\\displaystyle E}\c\c, as follows:\c\cN\c\c=\c\c3\c\cE\c\c{\\displaystyle N=3E\\,\\,\\,}\c\c for \c\cE\c\c<=\c\c2\c\c{\\displaystyle E<=2}\c\c. \c\cN\c\c=\c\c6\c\c+\c\c2\c\c×\c\c(\c\cE\c\c−\c\c2\c\c)\c\c{\\displaystyle N=6+2\\times (E-2)\\,\\,\\,}\c\c  for \c\cE\c\c>\c\c2\c\c{\\displaystyle E>2}\c\c. \c\cIn either case, the total number of people 10\c\cN\c\c{\\displaystyle N}\c\c should not exceed \c\cA\c\c/\c\c4\c\c{\\displaystyle A/4}\c\c, where \c\cA\c\c{\\displaystyle A}\c\c is the area of the room in square meters. \c\cOn 23 September 2020, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced stricter lockdown rules after a new daily coronavirus record of 6,923 infections was reported in Israel. These included:\c\cClosure of synagogues, excepted for limited prayers on Yom Kippur\c\cParticipation in demonstrations only within 1 km from home\c\cClosure of Ben Gurion Airport to outgoing flights\c\cOn 13 October the lockdown was extended for an additional week, until midnight 18 October 2020. \c\cA number of steps were taken to provide financial assistance:\c\cA one-time payment for each citizen was given out in two installments: the first for parents of children under the age of 18, and the second for individuals 18 or older\c\cUnemployment pay was extended through 30 June 2021\c\cAn additional grant was provided for low-income workers over age 67 who were fired or forced to take a leave of absence\c\cGrants for businesses whose income suffered due to the pandemic\c\cOn 21 September 2020, the government unanimously approved a 10% pay cut for all Knesset members and government ministers. \c\cOn 18 October 2020 Israel eased lockdown restrictions in non-\'red\' cities. The first stage of the exit strategy included:\c\cReopening of kindergartens and nurseries\c\cEateries open to take-out in addition to delivery\c\cTravel no longer restricted to 1 km from home\c\cIndoor gatherings of up to 10 people, and outdoor gatherings up to 20, allowed\c\cReopening of prominent religious sites in Jerusalem, including the Western Wall, the Temple Mount, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre\c\cReopening of beaches and national parks\c\cOn 1 November 2020 Israel eased restrictions further:\c\cReopening of elementary schools (grades 1–4)\c\cReopening of synagogues (limited to 10 people indoors, 20 outdoors)\c\cReopening of bed-and-breakfasts\c\cReopening of hair and beauty salons\c\cResumption of some "one-one-one" activities, including driving lessons and personal fitness training\c\cOn 8 November 2020, street-front stores reopened. Strip malls reopened on 17 November 2020. 15 malls opened as part of a pilot plan on 27 November 2020. \c\cWhile restrictions were eased in most of the country, local lockdowns were imposed in the following towns due to high case numbers:\c\cMajdal Shams and Masade starting on 6 November 2020, Buqata on 7 November, and Hazor Haglilit on 8 November\c\cQalansawe and Iksal, starting on 17 November 2020\c\cNazareth and Isfiya, starting on 21 November\c\cThe Haredi school year started on 24 August 2020, before the \'traffic light\' plan was approved. All other schools in non-\'red\' cities opened on 1 September 2020. Within a week, a number of schools and kindergartens reported outbreaks, leading to quarantine of exposed staff members and students. \c\cPhysical schools, kindergartens and nurseries closed at the beginning of the 3-week lockdown, on 13 September, with classes continuing online. \c\cKindergartens and nurseries reopened on 18 October, including in \'red\' cities. \c\cGrades 1 to 4 reopened on 1 November, in non-\'red\' cities. Class size was limited to 18 children. Students were required to wear masks throughout the day and eat their meals outdoors or spaced far apart from one another. \c\cGrades 5 and 6 returned to school on 24 November. \c\cHigh school grades 11 and 12 returned on 29 November. \c\cSchools reopened for remaining grades 7–10 on 6 December. \c\cAfter the Hanukkah break, over 220,000 students from grades 5–12 in \'orange\' and \'red\' cities went back to online studies. \c\cDuring July and August 2020, many protests were held, with protesters voicing frustration over the response of the Netanyahu-led government to the pandemic. \c\cOn 30 September, Israel's parliament passed a law limiting demonstrations which the opposition say is intended to curb protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged corruption and his mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis. The law prohibits Israelis from holding large gatherings more than one kilometre (5⁄8 mile) from their residences. The government defended the measure as a way to curb COVID-19 infections. \c\cOn 3 October, numerous anti-Netanyahu protests were held throughout Israel after the passage of legislation limiting demonstrations during the lockdown. The Black Flag movement estimated that 130,000 people took part in Saturday's protests against Netanyahu in cities and towns across Israel. \c\cIn December 2020, cases steadily increased, reaching over 3,000 new cases daily and over 5% test positivity rate. Multiple countries announced the appearance of new and more infectious COVID-19 strains; towards the end of December, first cases of the B.1.1.7 strain were detected in Israel. First cases of the South African variant were detected in January 2021. \c\cOn 20 December 2020, Israel announced an entry ban on all foreign travelers arriving from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Denmark. Israelis returning from these countries were required to enter state-run quarantine hotels. \c\cOn 24 December 2020, the government declared a third nationwide lockdown, to begin on 27 December 2020. Restrictions included:\c\cTraveling limited to 1,000 meter radius from home (individual sporting activities are allowed)\c\cGatherings limited to 10 people indoors or 20 people outdoors, for approved events (e.g. funerals and weddings)\c\cVisiting another person's home is forbidden\c\cClosure of all non-essential stores and services\c\cBusinesses that do not receive customers can remain open at 50% capacity or up to 10 employees, whichever is greater\c\cRestaurants will open for delivery only\c\cClosure of bed and breakfasts, zoos, safaris and parks\c\cClosure of alternative medicine centers, beauty, and hair salons\c\cCancellation of driving lessons\c\cPublic transportation reduced to 50% capacity\c\cPreschoolers through grade 4, grades 11–12, and special education, are to continue physical schooling as usual, even in "orange" and "red" cities. While the initial government decision called for remote learning for grades 5-10, this decision was revised by the Knesset Education Committee: in "green" and "yellow" cities, grades 5-10 are to continue in-person schooling, while schools in "orange" and "red" cities will switch to remote learning. \c\cDuring the first week of January 2021, there were over 8,000 new cases daily. On 5 January 2021, the government announced a two-week long, complete lockdown, effective midnight Thursday 7 January 2021. The tightened restrictions include:\c\cGatherings limited to 5 people indoors or 10 people outdoors, except for funerals, weddings and Brit milahs which gathering limited to 10 people indoors or 20 people outdoors\c\cClosing the entire education system including preschools, except special education. Grade schools to continue online schooling. \c\cTravel abroad allowed only for essential purposes. \c\cOn 19 January 2021 the tight lockdown was extended until the end of January. The tight lockdown was initially extended until 5 February 2021, and then until 7 February 2021. \c\cOn 24 January 2021, the government announced a week-long ban on most incoming and outgoing flights, effective on Monday January 25 at midnight, to prevent entry of new variants into Israel. The flight restrictions were extended multiple times: until 5 February 2021, then until 21 February 2021, and later until 6 March 2021. Daily flights, for new immigrants and for Israelis stranded outside Israel, were available as of 22 February 2021, for up to 2,000 passengers. The number of daily entries was increased to 3,000 on 7 March 2021. \c\cThe government approved a curfew from 8:30 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. for the three nights of 25–27 February, in an attempt to limit spread of the virus during Purim holiday activities. \c\cOn 7 February 2021 Israel began easing lockdown restrictions:\c\cRestrictions on travel within and between towns were lifted\c\cWorkplaces that do not receive customers were reopened\c\cOpen-air nature reserves and parks were reopened\c\cDuring the third lockdown many Israelis were vaccinated against COVID-19. On 21 February 2021, the government implemented green passes for those who were fully vaccinated or were infected and recovered. Green passes are required for the following:\c\centry into gyms, theaters, hotels, and concerts\c\centry into synagogues registered to the plan\c\cOn 7 March 2021, restrictions were eased further. Rules include:\c\cGatherings of up to 20 people indoors and 50 outdoors are allowed\c\cIn-person interactions with the public for non-essential services are allowed (if the service cannot be provided remotely)\c\cTemperature checks for those entering public locations or businesses are canceled\c\cEvents of up to 300 people and up to 50% venue capacity are allowed, with up to 5% non-green-pass-holders with negative test results allowed\c\cIndoor dining at restaurants allowed at 75% capacity with 2 meters between tables, for up to 100 green pass holders. Outdoor seating of up to 100 outdoors (no green pass required)\c\cPlaces of worship not registered with green pass limited to 20 people inside, 50 outside. Those registered limited to 50% capacity (fixed seating) or 1 person per each 7 square meters. \c\cTourist attractions open for green pass holders. \c\cEntry of Israeli citizens via Ben Gurion airport to increase to 3000 daily. Exit available to all those holding vaccination or recovery certificates. \c\cEntry into Israel via land crossings with Jordan: open twice weekly. \c\cGreen passes can be generated for those who have recovered from the virus or who are fully vaccinated (1 week after the second dose) using the Ministry of Health's Traffic Light app. \c\cPreschools, kindergartens, and grades 1-4 reopened on 11 February 2021 in “yellow” and “green” areas, and in “light orange” areas that had at least 70% of their community vaccinated. \c\cGrades 5-6 and grades 11-12 returned to school in “yellow”, “green”, and “light orange” areas on 21 February 2021. \c\cGrades 7-10 returned to school in “yellow”, “green”, and “light orange” areas on 7 March 2021. \c\cUniversities reopened with in-person classes for green pass holders on 7 March 2021. \c\cThe prevalence of infection has varied between different sectors of the Israeli population. Haredi communities have experienced a disproportionately higher number of cases. Reasons for the increased case numbers include crowded living conditions, and prioritizing continuity of religious routines, such as synagogue services and Torah study at yeshivas. \c\cCompliance, at least of some groups within the Haredi sector, has been low. During the \'third wave\', when all schools were supposed to be closed, many Haredi schools reopened. Hundreds attended weddings in some Haredi communities. Thousands gathered for funerals of prominent rabbies, including Rabbi Meshulam Dovid Soloveitchik and Rabbi Chaim Meir Wosner, despite government restrictions. \c\cVaccination rates in the Haredi community have been lower than in the general population, at least partially due to disinformation. A number of prominent rabbis have called on community members to get vaccinated. \c\cArab communities have also experienced relatively high case numbers. This is mainly attributed to large weddings and social gatherings, held despite government restrictions. \c\cArab communities lagged in vaccinations, despite widespread vaccine availability. The lag is attributed to widespread distrust of the government, and to a lack of Arabic-language outreach and education about the vaccine’s safety. \c\cThe Israeli government began to procure doses of COVID-19 vaccines from various sources as data regarding various COVID-19 vaccines became available:\c\c8 million shots were ordered from Pfizer
The COVID-19 pandemic in Fiji is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in Fiji was reported on 19 March 2020 in Lautoka. As of 17 April 2021[update], the country has had a total of 72 cases as of which five are currently active and 2 deaths, with all cases recorded in the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.

The Super League (organised by the European Super League Company, S.L.), commonly referred to as the European Super League (ESL), was a proposed annual club football competition to be contested by twenty European football clubs. The competition would consist of fifteen "founding clubs" – who would be permanent participants in the competition and govern it – alongside five other European clubs who would qualify based upon their performance in their domestic league's most recent season. It is planned as a breakaway competition to rival or replace the UEFA Champions League, Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA. \c\cPlans for the formation of a "European Super League" were attempted since 1998 but were unsuccessful. In April 2021, the Super League was established by twelve clubs (six in England, three in Spain and three in Italy), with three more founding members anticipated to join. Florentino Pérez was appointed as the first chairman of the organisation. Plans for designating the competition's first tournament began underway in hopes of commencing "as soon as practicable". \c\cThe announcement of the Super League drew widespread opposition from fans, players, other clubs, FIFA, UEFA and national governments. Much of the criticism against the ESL focused on elitism and lack of competitiveness. Backlash against the announcement of the league's formation led to all six of the English clubs announcing their intention to withdraw. The Super League subsequently announced they would "reconsider the most appropriate steps to reshape the project" following the departure of the English clubs. \c\cProposals for the creation of a European Super League date back to at least 1998, when the Italian corporation Media Partners investigated the idea, which failed after UEFA moved to expand the Champions League. Various proposals had been brought forth over the next two decades, with little success. Related proposals included the long-standing ambition by the Premier League to host an overseas "39th game" to capitalise on lucrative overseas markets. \c\cThe league was announced on 18 April 2021, via a press release sent out by the founding clubs. The announcement came on the eve of a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee, which intended to revamp and expand the UEFA Champions League from the 2024–25 season in order to increase the number of matches and revenues, following pressure from elite European clubs. The press release stated an intention to "provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid" while also "provid[ing] significantly greater economic growth and support for European football via a long-term commitment to uncapped solidarity payments which will grow in line with league revenues". Super League chairman Florentino Pérez said that the Super League will help clubs recover lost earnings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pérez also said that the Super League would also eventually have a system of promotion and relegation and will appeal to a new younger generation of football fans while also improving VAR and refereeing. \c\cIn addition to the men's competition, the organisation also announced plans to launch a corresponding women's competition "as soon as practicable". \c\cTwelve clubs were announced as the founding members of the competition, with three more set to join prior to the inaugural season. This included the "Big Six" of England, as well as three Spanish clubs and three Italian clubs. The fifteen founding clubs were to be permanent participants in the competition, and to govern the organisation. At the time of the announcement, 10 of the founding clubs were in the top 14 of the UEFA club coefficient rankings, with only Italian clubs Inter Milan (26th) and Milan (53rd) falling outside. All 12 were in the top 16 on the 2021 Forbes\' list of the most valuable football clubs. Their combined value was US$34.4 billion. \c\cOriginal founding clubs\c\c Arsenal (withdrew on 20 April 2021)\c\c Chelsea (withdrew on 21 April 2021)\c\c Liverpool (withdrew on 20 April 2021)\c\c Manchester City (withdrew on 20 April 2021)\c\c Manchester United (withdrew on 20 April 2021)\c\c Tottenham Hotspur (withdrew on 20 April 2021)\c\c Inter Milan\c\c Juventus\c\c Milan\c\c Atlético Madrid\c\c Barcelona\c\c Real Madrid\c\cOn 20 April 2021, Manchester City confirmed they formally commenced procedures to withdraw from the Super League. UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin issued a statement welcoming them back to the "European football family". \c\cArsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur also withdrew later in the day, with Chelsea withdrawing in the early hours of the next day. In that same vein, Italian club Internazionale told news agency ANSA they were "no longer interested in the project" although no official confirmation of withdrawal came. Numerous rumours also indicated inter-city rivals Milan were considering exiting the Super League too, leaving then only Juventus, Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona as participants. \c\cFollowing the withdrawal of the English clubs, on 21 April the Super League stated, "Given the current circumstances, we shall reconsider the most appropriate steps to reshape the project, always having in mind our goals of offering fans the best experience possible while enhancing solidarity payments for the entire football community."\c\cBayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) were not initial members of the Super League in its announcement, but much speculation has existed that the Super League wants them to be added to the League, even though all three have publicly condemned the competition. According to a document published by Der Spiegel, Bayern and Dortmund will be given 30 days, and PSG 14 days, to sign up to the Super League. \c\cOther French, German, Portuguese and Dutch clubs, such as Porto, reportedly declined to join the competition. However, Super League chairman Florentino Pérez said that PSG and the German clubs were not invited as founding clubs. Sky Sports reporter Charles Patterson stated that the Super League would appeal to the Scottish "Old Firm" clubs Celtic and Rangers. Patterson stated that there had been attempts by the two clubs to break away from the Scottish league system since the 1990s, and that their ability to compete within European competition has been hampered by limited revenue in Scotland. Patterson also believes that the Super League would need to be interested in taking on the Old Firm clubs, as both clubs have worldwide fanbases and quality stadia. \c\cThe competition was proposed to feature twenty teams, including the fifteen founding clubs. The remaining places were to be decided by a qualifying mechanism based on the performance of teams in the previous season. Starting in August, the teams will be split into two groups of ten, with clubs playing home-and-away in a double round-robin format for a total of 18 group matches per team. Fixtures will take during midweeks to allow clubs to still participate in their domestic leagues. The top three teams of each group will qualify for the quarter-finals, while the teams finishing fourth and fifth from each group will compete in two-legged play-offs to decide the last two quarter-finalists. The remainder of the competition will take place in a four-week span at the end of the season, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals featuring two-legged ties, while the final in May will be contested as a single fixture at a neutral venue. In total, each season of the competition will feature 197 matches (180 in the group stage and 17 in the knockout stage). \c\cThe competition is set to feature uncapped solidarity payments to its clubs, which can increase in line with league revenues. The organisation stated that the solidarity payments will be higher than those of existing European competitions, expected to be "in excess of €10 billion during the course of the initial commitment period of the clubs", and that founding clubs will receive €3.5 billion to support infrastructure investment plans and to offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. American investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase is reported to be the major financial backer of the planned Super League, pledging $5 billion towards the competition.  According to leaked documents, the 15 founding clubs of the Super League would share 32.5 percent of commercial revenues. With a further 32.5 percent being distributed between all 20 participating teams, including the five invited teams.  20 percent of revenues would be allocated based on “merit” based on performance in the Super League. And 15 percent would be shared based on broadcast audience size. Clubs would also be allowed to retain all revenues from gate receipts and club sponsorship deals. \c\cThe following football executives have been confirmed as the leaders of the organisation. \c\cThe announcement generated widespread condemnation from UEFA, the Football Association and Premier League of England, the Italian Football Federation and Lega Serie A of Italy and the Royal Spanish Football Federation and La Liga of Spain, which the founding clubs were from. They issued a joint statement stating that they would "consider all measures available to us, at all levels, both judicial and sporting" to prevent the Super League from proceeding. UEFA and the three nations warned that any clubs involved in the Super League would be banned from all other domestic, European and world football competitions. They also threatened that the players involved could be banned from representing their national teams in international matches. The French Football Federation and Ligue de Football Professionnel of France, as well as the German Football Association and Deutsche Fußball Liga of Germany, from which no clubs had yet joined, also released statements opposing the proposed Super League. \c\cThe European Club Association (ECA), whose then-chairman Andrea Agnelli is the vice-chairman of the Super League, held an emergency meeting and subsequently announced their opposition to the plan. Agnelli, also a member of the UEFA Executive Committee, along with the founding clubs of the Super League did not attend the virtual meeting. Agnelli subsequently resigned from his positions as ECA chairman and UEFA Executive Committee member, with all twelve Super League clubs also leaving the ECA. FIFA also expressed its disapproval of the announcement, alongside International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach. FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in an address at the 2021 UFEA conference in Montreux, Switzerland that, "If some elect to go their own way then they must live with the consequences of their choice, they are responsible for their choice...Concretely this means, either you are in, or you are out. You cannot be half in and half out. This has to be absolutely clear," likely in reference to the Super League plan to have its clubs compete in their domestic leagues alongside the Super League. \c\cThe Premier League and the FA released a statement "unanimously and vigorously" opposing the breakaway league, but ruled out barring the six breakaway clubs from domestic competitions or taking legal action against them. \c\cBloomberg reported that UEFA was weighing a €6 billion offer from Centricus Asset Management to reform the Champions League. \c\cNumerous politicians have expressed their opposition to the proposals. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the proposals "very damaging for football" and vowed to ensure that it "doesn\'t go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed", a position which was supported by Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer. In addition, the Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement to the House of Commons that "[T]his move goes against the very spirit of the game", pledged to do "whatever it takes" to stop English clubs from joining, and announced a "fan-led review" into football, to be led by former Minister for Sport Tracey Crouch. Following a meeting with FA representatives, Johnson promised a "legislative bomb" to stop the "anti-competitive" league. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his support for UEFA's position, stating "The French state will support all the steps taken by the LFP, FFF, UEFA and FIFA to protect the integrity of federal competitions, whether national or European." The Spanish Government released a statement saying they "[do] not support the initiative to create a football Super League promoted by various European clubs, including the Spanish ones." Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi also backed UEFA in their decision, saying he "strongly supports the positions of the Italian and European football authorities". Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, president of the Football Association, said that he "share[d] the concerns of fans about the proposed Super League and the damage it risks causing to the game we love."\c\cThe Super League has been described as a "breakaway" endeavour, and the most significant restructuring of elite European football since the creation of the European Cup, with claims of a potential negative impact on lower-placed clubs similar to those made at the time of the Premier League's formation in 1992. However, Super League chairman Florentino Pérez has argued that the Super League will generate income across football since it would increase overall revenues in football thus allowing bigger clubs to invest more in smaller clubs through transfer fees, essentially arguing that excluded clubs would act as feeder teams for Super League clubs, and an annual "solidarity" payment of €400,000,000 to the other clubs which would offset some of the money lost due to the devaluation of domestic and international television rights due to the Super League. \c\cHe also stated the Super League is "not a competition for the rich, it's a competition of solidarity to save football, by the great and the modest."\c\cCommentators have noted that the Super League would eliminate financial risk for its founding members due to its "semi-closed" league setup similar to basketball's EuroLeague where a group of clubs are guaranteed entry in the Super League every year without having to qualify. This would eliminate the risk of clubs being relegated in their domestic leagues or failing to qualify for the Champions League, thus making the founding clubs more stable in generating revenue and more likely to increase in value. Commentators also state that the Super League could render domestic competitions as irrelevant and lower tier compared to the Super League, and that it would destroy the ideas behind promotion and relegation systems. However, Super League chairman Florentino Pérez claimed that the league plans to later have a system of promotion and relegation. Bloomberg columnist Alex Webb argued that a diminished Premier League due to the Super League could hurt Britain's soft power as well. Forbes contributor Marc Edelman, professor of law at the City University of New York, wrote that the Super League will bring the lucrative U.S. professional sports league model to Europe. \c\cIn an opinion piece for Yahoo sports, Henry Bushnell commended the idea that the best teams should play one another in high-leverage situations as often as possible, but said that the competition structure should have a system of promotion and relegation based on performance in domestic leagues and the UEFA Champion's Cup. He added that the league should share more of its profits with lower status clubs. \c\cItalian sports commentator Mario Sconcerti called the Super League a "crude idea that goes against the fans."\c\cWest Ham United said on their website that they were strongly opposed to the Super League emphasising their working class roots and the 150 academy players who had developed to play for the first team. In a statement Everton criticised the "big six" English clubs joining the Super League and said accused them of "betraying" football supporters across England. \c\cAtalanta, Hellas Verona and Cagliari called for the Italian Super League teams to be banned from Serie A. \c\cOther clubs that condemned the Super League include Southampton, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, West Bromwich Albion, Burnley, Brighton & Hove Albion, Fulham, Bayern Munich, Sevilla, Benfica, Roma, Ajax, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Lille, Lyon, Porto, RB Leipzig, Spartak Moscow, Valencia, Villarreal, Borussia Mönchengladbach, Legia Warsaw, Werder Bremen, Freiburg, VfB Stuttgart, and Red Star Belgrade. \c\cUK broadcaster BT Sport, one of the networks that hold the rights to the UEFA Champions League and the Premier League, condemned the Super League and said that it "could have a damaging effect to the long term health of football in the United Kingdom," whilst its competitor Sky reiterated that it has not held talks to broadcast the league. Amazon Prime Video, which owns streaming rights to the Premier League in the UK, stated they had no involvement. DAZN confirmed they were not "in any way involved or interested in entering into discussions regarding the establishment of a Super League and no conversations have taken place." Facebook also said they were not in discussions to broadcast the Super League. \c\cMediapro, who hold the rights to La Liga and the Champions League in Spain, told Reuters that "television broadcasters won\'t break their contracts with UEFA and national leagues to join the breakaway European Super League project," and also predicted that the Super League will fail. \c\cFormer Manchester United player, current Salford City co-owner, and Sky Sports commentator Gary Neville's reaction generated strong attention on social media, calling the formation "an act of pure greed" and being especially disappointed at his former club's admission, going on to say that stringent measures must be taken against the founding clubs, including bans from European competitions and point deductions. Jürgen Klopp hit back at the hypocrisy suggesting that Neville himself has been chasing money all his life. \c\cAnother former Manchester United player Roy Keane said, "It comes down to money, greed. Obviously, we\'ve heard nothing from FIFA yet but it doesn\'t sound good, let's hope they stop it in its tracks because it is just pure greed. We talk about big clubs – Bayern Munich are one of the biggest clubs in the world. At least they\'ve made a stand, which is a good start."\c\cAmong those also critical of the league include David Beckham, Gary Lineker, Ian Wright, Luís Figo, Benjamin Pavard, Eric Cantona, Jamie Carragher, Dani Alves, Alex Ferguson, Kevin de Bruyne, Jordan Henderson, and Marcus Rashford. \c\cLiverpool midfielder James Milner said in a post-match interview that he didn\'t like the Super League and wished it wouldn\'t happen. Liverpool head coach Jürgen Klopp was also critical of the Super League, though he said he would not resign and instead would "sort it somehow” with Fenway Sports Group. \c\cChelsea manager Thomas Tuchel said he trusts his club to make the right decisions in relation to the Super League. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola added that while "it is not [really] a sport if success is guaranteed", UEFA "had failed in advancing the sport" and that the footballing institutions "only think for themselves."\c\cFollowing the announcement of the Super League shares in Manchester United and Juventus increased 9% and 19% respectively. \c\cCriticism was levelled by fans at the fact that English clubs Arsenal, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur have never won the UEFA Champions League, and that the latter have not won a top-flight domestic league title since 1961. Football Supporters Europe (FSE), a body representing supporters in 45 UEFA countries, issued a statement opposing the creation of the Super League. A snap YouGov poll conducted shortly after the league's announcement found that 79% of British football fans oppose the Super League with only 14% expressing support. 76% of fans of the British teams joining the Super League also expressed disapproval, with 20% expressing support. \c\cSupporter groups from all six English clubs opposed the league, releasing statements condemning the plans and the clubs for their involvement in the league. \c\cFans have been given a lot of credit for protesting and having a role in the withdrawal of multiple clubs.[by whom?]\c\cOn 19 April 2021, a crowd of about 700 fans appeared outside Elland Road despite COVID-19 restrictions, ahead of the scheduled match between Leeds United and Liverpool, to protest against the Super League. While warming up before the match, Leeds United players wore a shirt that read "Football is for the fans" on one side and "Earn it" with a Champions League logo on the other. The shirts had been left on the benches inside the Liverpool changing room, but the players did not wear them. In addition, a large banner was placed behind one goal stating "Earn it on the pitch, football is for the fans." The Athletic later reported that the shirts were approved by the Premier League. \c\cBarcelona fans hung a banner over Camp Nou which read "Barcelona is our life, not your toy. No to playing in the Super League."\c\cOn 20 April 2021, thousands of Chelsea fans appeared at Stamford Bridge to protest against the Super League ahead of Chelsea's game against Brighton & Hove Albion. In the wake of the protest, it was reported that Chelsea were preparing to withdraw from the competition, leading to celebration by the protesters. \c\cOn 19 April 2021, UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin stated that UEFA would begin making "legal assessments" on the following day, and that the organisation would look to ban the twelve Super League clubs "as soon as possible". However, the Super League informed UEFA and FIFA that they had begun legal action to prevent the competition from being thwarted. Jesper Møller, chairman of the Danish Football Association and UEFA Executive Committee member, stated that he expected the three Super League clubs in the semi-finals of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League—Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid—to be expelled from the competition by 23 April. In addition, he also expected Arsenal and Manchester United to be expelled from the semi-finals of the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League. However Super League chairman Florentino Pérez said that would be "impossible", and that the law protects them. On 20 April 2021, ESPN reported that UFEA decided to not ban the Super League teams from the Champions League and Europa League and the matches will go ahead as scheduled. \c\cThe Super League has also sparked discussion whether it is in violation of anti-trust laws since it contains business practices that are allegedly designed to reduce competition, by creating a protected market that restricts others from entering that may limit competition. The European Commission stated that it does not plan to investigate the Super League for anti-trust violations. Bloomberg columnist Alex Webb argued that the Commission's lack of investigation was justified; if a case against the Super League failed, other parties could interpret the case as condoning the Super League, and the Commission could face popular backlash. \c\cSports lawyer Daniel Geey speculated that the UEFA and the Super League, as well as the ECA, FIFPro, and FIFA, were involved in "a high-stakes game of negotiation", and that the launch of the Super League was not guaranteed. Recalling a conversation with an unidentified lawyer, Sky Sports reporter Geraint Hughes stated that the main arguments for both sides would deal with competition law; UEFA would argue that the Super League would effectively be a closed league and that the clubs in the league were abusing their power, while the Super League would argue that restrictive conditions imposed by UEFA or FIFA would be anti-competitive. Hughes also stated that, in the lawyer's opinion, the Super League would have a slight advantage in a hypothetical case under current EU law; if there was a change in the interpretation of EU law then UEFA could win. \c\cOn 20 April 2021, a Spanish commercial court in Madrid preliminarily ruled that UEFA, FIFA, and any other associated football body cannot block the launch of the Super League until the court has fully considered the case. \c\cThe Premier League has not ruled out taking legal action against the Big Six.
On April 20, 2021, Ma\'Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old American, was fatally shot by Columbus police officer Nicholas Reardon in Columbus, Ohio. \c\cBody camera footage released after the shooting showed Bryant charging another teen with a knife as she was shot. The officers applied medical treatment and Bryant was transported to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead half an hour later. \c\cThe incident is under investigation. \c\cAround 4:45 pm EDT on April 20, 2021, officers from the Columbus Division of Police responded to a call reporting an attempted stabbing in 3100 block of Legion Lane in southeast Columbus. Upon arriving, officers saw an altercation involving at least four people. Body camera footage shows Bryant in black clothing holding what appeared to be a knife while moving towards another girl, who had fallen to the ground. Bryant then moved towards a second girl dressed in pink who had her back against the hood of a parked car. The officer shouted "get down" several times before firing at least four shots, striking Bryant as her right arm, holding the knife, was raised at the girl in pink. She then fell to the ground, dropping the knife. \c\cBryant was taken to a local hospital in critical condition. She later died at the hospital. \c\cInitial news reports were brief in detail, describing the shooting of a 16-year-old involved in a stabbing incident. Further updates reported details, including that Bryant was the alleged perpetrator in the conflict the police were called to. \c\cLater that day, the Interim Chief of Police Michael Woods held a press conference about the shooting. The body camera footage was released at this time, though not the identity of the officer who shot Bryant. Woods stated that the department's use of force policies permitted deadly force to protect the officer's own life or the life of another person. Investigation of the shooting has been transferred to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation. Andrew Ginther, the mayor of Columbus, said that "based on this footage, the officer took action to protect another young girl in our community", calling the shooting a tragic day. Later, in a press conference, Ginther called the situation a failure. \c\cJen Psaki, the White House Press Secretary, told reporters that President Joe Biden had been briefed on the situation. She said that the shooting was tragic, making reference to higher rates of police violence experienced by Black and Latino communities, as well as the particular vulnerabilities of children in foster care. Psaki said the killing was linked to "systemic racism and implicit bias." Senators Cory Booker and Raphael Warnock commented that the killing pointed to the need for police reform. Professional basketball player LeBron James reacted to the news of the shooting by tweeting "You\'re next", the hashtag "accountability" and a picture of the officer involved. James later deleted the tweet and followed up with a more nuanced explanation of his feelings. \c\cAbout 50 protesters gathered in Downtown Columbus on the night of the shooting; more gathered as they marched to the police headquarters to protest the shooting. \c\cOn April 21, Woods held another press conference, during which two 9-1-1 calls relating to the shooting were played. During the first, the caller tells the dispatcher that there were girls trying to stab them. More body camera footage was also released. Mayor Ginther said that the footage from the cruiser camera would be released later that day or the following morning. \c\cOver 500 Ohio State University students marched from the Ohio Union to the Ohio Statehouse beginning at 2 p.m. on April 21. Protesters at the Ohio Statehouse chanted "Black Lives Matter" and "Say her name" that afternoon. More than 150 protesters gathered for a vigil for Bryant and then a march to Columbus Division of Police headquarters later that day. At 9:30 p.m., a group of between 200 and 250 protesters marched to the Ohio Judicial Center. \c\cExperts on use of force doctrines stated that the body camera footage gave the impression that Reardon acted with a reasonable use of force that is legally justified. Those interviewed include Philip Stinson, a Bowling Green State University criminal justice professor and James Scanlon, a CPD veteran and former trainer who has served as an expert witness at use-of-force trials. The two described that guns are an appropriate response to situations involving lethal force, and that police are only trained to target a person's center mass, in order to effectively neutralize the threat. Stinson stated that if Reardon failed to act, it would likely have led to serious bodily harm or death. Geoffrey Alpert, criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, also gave a personal assessment that the use of deadly force seemed appropriate. \c\cSome commentators drew parallels between the police responses to Bryant and Kyle Rittenhouse, a white 17-year-old who had been initially let go by police after he shot and killed two people during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin in August 2020.[unreliable source?]\c\cThe killing caused further examination of police shootings in Columbus, with Newsweek reporting that Columbus Division of Police has killed the third-highest number of children of any US police department from 2013 to 2021. Six children were fatally shot by Columbus police during this time period, compared to eight in Houston and thirteen in Chicago. During this time period, seven children were fatally shot by police in Ohio, with Tamir Rice the only minor not killed in Columbus. Additionally, Franklin County, where Bryant was killed, has one of the highest rates of fatal police shootings in the US.
On March 22, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, United States. Ten people were killed, including a local on-duty police officer. The alleged shooter, 21-year-old Ahmad Al Aliwi Al-Issa, was arrested after being shot in the right leg. He was temporarily hospitalized before being moved to the county jail. Legal proceedings against Al-Issa began on March 25. \c\cThe shooting began shortly after 2:30 p.m. MDT (20:30 UTC) when a gunman entered the parking lot of a King Soopers supermarket and began to fire at people. He was described by witnesses as wearing an "armored" vest and holding a "rifle", which turned out to be a semi-automatic Ruger AR-556 pistol that was used in the shooting; he also carried a 9mm semi-automatic handgun. He was first seen by employees and customers who watched him shoot at customers in the parking lot before turning and entering the store. The first victim was a repairman who was killed in a van parked next to the gunman's vehicle. The gunman then walked towards the store; along the way, he killed another person in the parking lot who was trying to flee, shooting him multiple times. Next, he killed two more people while entering the store through its eastern entrance. \c\cA man waiting in line with his family for his COVID-19 vaccine at the store's pharmacy witnessed the gunman shoot a woman at the front of the line before finding safety in a coat closet with his family. Some customers and employees reached safety through a back exit for the supermarket. Some were praised for their actions in helping evacuate and hide individuals away from the shooter. \c\cAt 2:33 p.m., the Boulder Police Department began receiving calls of a person with a "patrol rifle" in the area and shots being fired. Witnesses at the scene reported hearing anywhere from ten to thirty shots fired in rapid succession by the gunman. At 2:34 p.m., a Boulder Police dispatcher provided an initial description of the gunman as "a white male, middle-aged, dark hair, beard, black vest, short-sleeved shirt." The first responding officers arrived at the scene within two minutes of the first calls. Officer Eric Talley entered the store within 30 seconds of his arrival, and at around 2:37 p.m., an unidentified female officer radioed in to say that she and Talley were going in. Running towards gunfire, Talley was shot and killed by the gunman. He was the last victim in the shooting, according to Boulder police. \c\cBy 2:39 p.m., responding officers reported being fired upon repeatedly by the gunman. At around the same time, an armored police vehicle was used to break the store's front windows. Officers engaged the gunman in a shootout from 3:00 p.m. to 3:21 p.m. They also used a sound system to order him to surrender. According to police and witnesses, the gunman was laughing and occasionally mumbling. A store employee said that while she was hiding, she heard gunshots and screams and then only the store music and phones ringing afterwards. Police did not enter the store again until 3:22 p.m., fearing an ambush. Eventually, the gunman was shot in the leg; he surrendered by saying, "I surrender. I\'m naked", and at 3:28 p.m., he was taken into custody. Boulder police formally took him into custody using the handcuffs of slain officer Eric Talley. He had a leg gunshot wound at the time of his arrest, so he was first transported to Boulder Community Health Foothills Hospital,  and eventually transferred him to the Boulder County Jail, where he was held without bond. \c\cAfter the gunman was taken into custody, police searched through the store and evacuated people who had remained inside. A shelter-in-place order was issued in the area at 4:18 p.m. and lifted at 6:40 p.m. Up to fifteen agencies responded to the shooting, including the Jefferson County SWAT, the FBI, the ATF and local police departments. A fire department ladder truck was used to get a SWAT team onto the roof. At least three medical helicopters were summoned to a staging area at nearby Fairview High School. \c\cThere were ten fatalities in the shooting:\c\cOfficer Talley, who had been working with the Boulder Police Department since 2010, was one of the first police officers to arrive at the scene. His death marked the first time a Boulder police officer was killed in the line of duty since 1994, only the sixth such death in the department's history. Seven of the victims died inside the store, while the other three died outside. \c\cWhile Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold initially said several other police officers were injured during the response, the department later said that no other officers were injured. \c\cAhmad Al Aliwi Al-Issa (or Alissa), age 21, is from nearby Arvada, Colorado. He was born in Syria in 1999 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. His family immigrated to the U.S. in 2002 and moved to Arvada in 2014. Al-Issa's older brother said that Al-Issa has a history of paranoid, disturbed, and antisocial behavior that developed after Al-Issa was bullied in high school, and his brother was concerned for his mental health. Al-Issa was convicted of a misdemeanor in 2018 for punching a classmate at Arvada West High School. He pleaded guilty to an assault charge in relation to the incident and received two months of probation in addition to 48 hours of community service. \c\cAccording to a police affidavit, Al-Issa bought a semi-automatic Ruger AR-556 pistol. Boulder police clarified in a news conference on March 26 that they believed the AR-556 pistol was the only weapon used by the suspect during the shooting and added that he also had a 9mm handgun with him. Al-Issa's identity was already known to the Federal Bureau of Investigation due to a link to another person under investigation by law enforcement officials. \c\cAl-Issa expressed on his now-deleted Facebook page and to his high school wrestling teammates that he believed he was being targeted for harassment due to racism and Islamophobia. According to SITE Intelligence Group, "there was no indication on his Facebook account that suggested radical views of any kind, whether it be Islamist, anti-Trump, or anything else." Al-Issa's brother said he believed that the shootings were not a political statement. The Boulder County District Attorney is waiting to reveal more information about Al-Issa's motives while the FBI and other agencies are investigating the case, to ensure a fair trial. \c\cAfter the shooting, Al-Issa was charged with ten counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. Al-Issa's identity was revealed to the public on March 23, the day after the shooting. At Al-Issa's first court appearance on March 25, his lawyer asked for a mental health assessment. It was later reported that, due to threats, Al-Issa was moved to another county. \c\cAt around 8:00 p.m. on the day of the shooting, a procession honored Officer Eric Talley as his body was being taken to a funeral home. A separate memorial for the victims was created along a chain-link fence bordering the grocery store, as mourners placed candles, flowers, and other items along its base or through the chain-link. The Museum of Boulder began preserving stories and artifacts from the memorial. On April 16, it started planning both short-term and permanent memorials with the City of Boulder. \c\cGovernor Jared Polis ordered the state's flags to fly at half-staff for ten days: one day for each victim. President Joe Biden also ordered flags on federal property nationwide to be flown at half-staff. This order came on the same day as the expiration of a federal order to fly flags at half-staff to honor the victims of the Atlanta spa shootings of March 16, less than a week before. A week after the shooting, Talley's funeral was held; it included a 21-gun salute and another procession. \c\cSports teams in Colorado and victims of other mass shootings expressed sympathy for the victims and family members of the Boulder shooting. A vigil for the victims and survivors of the shooting was held on March 25. U.S. Representative Joe Neguse, whose district includes Boulder, spoke at the vigil about curbing gun violence. University of Colorado Boulder professor and poet Khadijah Queen also spoke at the vigil, which was organized by gun violence prevention group Moms Demand Action. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper that day, the family of one of the victims spoke about him and their appreciation for the outpouring of support. \c\cAl-Issa legally purchased a Ruger AR-556 pistol on March 16 at a local gun shop in Arvada that used Colorado's universal background check law, even though he was previously convicted of third-degree assault, a misdemeanor with a sentencing maximum of 18 months in county jail. Federal firearms laws only prohibit weapons purchases for those convicted of a felony, or a misdemeanor with a prison term of over 24 months.  He was reported to be carrying a 9mm handgun in addition to his primary weapon. \c\cFollowing the shooting, discussion was renewed on the topic of gun control. Particular discussion was raised over the Ruger AR-556 pistol, a type of AR-15 style rifle legally defined as a pistol. Semi-automatic AR-15 style rifles are modeled after the automatic ArmaLite AR-15 rifle. According to the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, a pistol is "designed to be gripped by one hand"; a rifle is a weapon designed "to be fired from the shoulder" with a single bullet fired for each pull of the trigger, among other criteria. As a result of this, the Ruger AR-556 pistol is designed with a 10.5-inch barrel and is sold with a stabilizing brace, as opposed to a stock (which would cause the AR-556 to be classified as a short-barreled rifle under the National Firearms Act of 1934), making it legally a pistol even though it is visually and operationally similar to a rifle. Similar to AR-15 style rifles, Ruger AR-556 magazines typically have a capacity of 30 rounds; but since Colorado law prohibits magazines carrying more than 15 rounds, some retailers sell a Colorado specific version of the gun that comes with a magazine that holds under 15 rounds. Police are investigating if Al-Issa used a 30-round magazine in the shooting, and also whether other firearms were connected to him. \c\cNational Rifle Association member and longtime gun violence researcher Garen Wintemute, a UC Davis Medical Center physician who is the director of the university's Violence Prevention Research Program, expressed concerns about the Ruger AR-556 pistol's "lethality over conventional handguns." A former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agent said about the Ruger AR-556 pistol, "It's not a sporting rifle, it's not a hunting rifle. It's made for the military and short-range combat."\c\cAt the national level, President Joe Biden called for an immediate ban on assault weapons; other Democratic politicians echoed his sentiments, including U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, U.S. Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, and former President Barack Obama. Biden also urged that loopholes be closed in the background check system and praised Officer Eric Talley, who was killed in the shooting, for his heroism. In an interview with CBS This Morning, Vice President Kamala Harris responded to the mass shootings by discussing the need for gun reform legislation. At the state level, members of the Colorado General Assembly began discussions on gun reform proposals. Gun control advocates were reported to be working on a bill on March 26 that would create a five-day waiting period in Colorado. \c\cSimilar calls for gun control and loopholes to be closed were echoed by newspaper editorial boards, and many celebrities. Satirical news site The Onion republished its \'No Way To Prevent This,\' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens article in response to the shooting. \c\cRepublican politicians, such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, have criticized the renewed push for gun control, saying that they believe gun control does not help lessen crime. Likewise, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin spoke out against two bills recently passed by the House of Representatives that were in favor of universal background checks banning almost all gun sales without federal government approval, saying his views were more in line with the bill he co-authored with Republican Senator Pat Toomey shortly after the Sandy Hook school shooting. In the Colorado General Assembly, which is fully controlled by the Democrats, Republican lawmakers acknowledged the difficulties of preventing gun reform legislation and have declared their intent to focus on mental health legislation as a preventive measure. \c\cOn April 8, Biden announced an executive order in response to the Boulder shooting that called for the U.S. Justice Department to clarify within 60 days whether a gun marketed with a stabilizing brace, such as the Ruger AR-556, effectively turns a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. On April 20, Governor Jared Polis signed two gun control bills into law, one of them requiring gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms within five days or be fined and the other mandating standards on gun storage, such as requiring licensed gun dealers to provide locking devices during firearm sales or transfers. The bills, which passed in the Colorado General Assembly following party-line votes, had been introduced before the shooting. \c\cA man who livestreamed the crime to a YouTube channel received criticism from some and praise from others. He had identified himself repeatedly as a journalist to law enforcement before being removed from the scene. At peak viewership during the event, the livestream had about 30,000 viewers, and many criticized YouTube for allowing the video to remain on its site. The company responded with a statement that the video had enough news or documentary context to remain, regardless of the violence shown. \c\cBefore officers arrived on the scene, a police dispatcher described the active shooter as a "white male"; the suspect's actual identity was released around 18 hours after the shooting. A police affidavit dated March 23 repeated Al-Issa's identity as a "white male". Deborah Richardson, ACLU of Colorado's executive director, said that early assumptions made by law enforcement about Al-Issa were affected by the perception that he was white. \c\cOn March 22, before the suspect's identity was made public, the Indian American race and inclusion editor of USA Today's Sports Media Group, Hemal Jhaveri, reacted to the shooting on Twitter, inaccurately saying, "It's always an angry white man. Always." She later expressed "regret" for the "careless error of judgement" in sending the tweet, and deleted it. By March 26, Jhaveri had been fired by USA Today, with her attributing this to the tweet and its promotion by alt-right Twitter users "as an example of anti-white bias and racism against whites". USA Today did not directly comment on her firing, instead stressing their commitment to "diversity, equity and inclusion".
On March 22, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, United States. Ten people were killed, including a local on-duty police officer. The alleged shooter, 21-year-old Ahmad Al Aliwi Al-Issa, was arrested after being shot in the right leg. He was temporarily hospitalized before being moved to the county jail. Legal proceedings against Al-Issa began on March 25. \c\cThe shooting began shortly after 2:30 p.m. MDT (20:30 UTC) when a gunman entered the parking lot of a King Soopers supermarket and began to fire at people. He was described by witnesses as wearing an "armored" vest and holding a "rifle", which turned out to be a semi-automatic Ruger AR-556 pistol that was used in the shooting; he also carried a 9mm semi-automatic handgun. He was first seen by employees and customers who watched him shoot at customers in the parking lot before turning and entering the store. At the time, there were at least 115 people inside the building and at least 25 others in the parking lot. \c\cThe first victim was a repairman who was killed in a van parked next to the gunman's vehicle. The gunman then walked towards the store; along the way, he killed another person in the parking lot who was trying to flee, shooting him multiple times. Next, he killed two more people while entering the store through its eastern entrance. \c\cA man waiting in line with his family for his COVID-19 vaccine at the store's pharmacy witnessed the gunman shoot a woman at the front of the line before finding safety in a coat closet with his family. Some customers and employees reached safety through a back exit for the supermarket. Some were praised for their actions in helping evacuate and hide individuals away from the shooter. \c\cAt 2:33 p.m., the Boulder Police Department began receiving calls of a person with a "patrol rifle" in the area and shots being fired. Witnesses at the scene reported hearing anywhere from ten to thirty shots fired in rapid succession by the gunman. At 2:34 p.m., a Boulder Police dispatcher provided an initial description of the gunman as "a white male, middle-aged, dark hair, beard, black vest, short-sleeved shirt." The first responding officers arrived at the scene within two minutes of the first calls. Officer Eric Talley entered the store within 30 seconds of his arrival, and at around 2:37 p.m., an unidentified female officer radioed in to say that she and Talley were going in. Running towards gunfire, Talley was shot and killed by the gunman. He was the last victim in the shooting, according to Boulder police. \c\cLess than thirty seconds after Talley's death, additional officers entered the store. By 2:39 p.m., responding officers reported being fired upon repeatedly by the gunman. At around the same time, an armored police vehicle was used to break the store's front windows. Officers engaged the gunman in a shootout from 3:00 p.m. to 3:21 p.m. They also used a sound system to order him to surrender. According to police and witnesses, the gunman was laughing and occasionally mumbling. A store employee said that while she was hiding, she heard gunshots and screams and then only the store music and phones ringing afterwards. \c\cPolice did not enter the store again until 3:22 p.m., fearing an ambush. Eventually, the gunman was shot in the leg; he surrendered by saying, "I surrender. I\'m naked", and at 3:28 p.m., he was taken into custody using Talley's handcuffs. He had a leg gunshot wound at the time of his arrest, so he was first transported to Boulder Community Health Foothills Hospital,  and eventually transferred him to the Boulder County Jail, where he was held without bond. \c\cAfter the gunman was taken into custody, police searched through the store and evacuated people who had remained inside. A shelter-in-place order was issued in the area at 4:18 p.m. and lifted at 6:40 p.m. Up to fifteen agencies responded to the shooting, including the Jefferson County SWAT, the FBI, the ATF and local police departments. A fire department ladder truck was used to get a SWAT team onto the roof. At least three medical helicopters were summoned to a staging area at nearby Fairview High School. \c\cThere were ten fatalities in the shooting:\c\cOfficer Talley, who had been working with the Boulder Police Department since 2010, was one of the first police officers to arrive at the scene. His death marked the first time a Boulder police officer was killed in the line of duty since 1994, only the sixth such death in the department's history. Seven of the victims died inside the store, while the other three died outside. \c\cWhile Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold initially said several other police officers were injured during the response, the department later said that no other officers were injured. \c\cAhmad Al Aliwi Al-Issa (or Alissa), age 21, is from nearby Arvada, Colorado. He was born in Syria in 1999 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. His family immigrated to the U.S. in 2002 and moved to Arvada in 2014. Al-Issa's older brother said that Al-Issa has a history of paranoid, disturbed, and antisocial behavior that developed after Al-Issa was bullied in high school, and his brother was concerned for his mental health. Al-Issa was convicted of a misdemeanor in 2018 for punching a classmate at Arvada West High School. He pleaded guilty to an assault charge in relation to the incident and received two months of probation in addition to 48 hours of community service. \c\cAccording to a police affidavit, Al-Issa bought a semi-automatic Ruger AR-556 pistol. Boulder police clarified in a news conference on March 26 that they believed the AR-556 pistol was the only weapon used by the suspect during the shooting and added that he also had a 9mm handgun with him. Al-Issa's identity was already known to the Federal Bureau of Investigation due to a link to another person under investigation by law enforcement officials. \c\cAl-Issa expressed on his now-deleted Facebook page and to his high school wrestling teammates that he believed he was being targeted for harassment due to racism and Islamophobia. According to SITE Intelligence Group, "there was no indication on his Facebook account that suggested radical views of any kind, whether it be Islamist, anti-Trump, or anything else." Al-Issa's brother said he believed that the shootings were not a political statement. The Boulder County District Attorney is waiting to reveal more information about Al-Issa's motives while the FBI and other agencies are investigating the case, to ensure a fair trial. \c\cAfter the shooting, Al-Issa was charged with ten counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. Al-Issa's identity was revealed to the public on March 23, the day after the shooting. At Al-Issa's first court appearance on March 25, his lawyer asked for a mental health assessment. It was later reported that, due to threats, Al-Issa was moved to another county. \c\cOn April 22, Al-Issa was charged with 43 new felony charges, including 32 counts of attempted murder, 10 counts of using a high-capacity magazine, and one count of first-degree assault. The 32 counts of attempted murder include those of eleven police officers, along with a number of civilians. If convicted, Al-Issa would be sentenced to life in prison, as Colorado abolished the death penalty a year before. \c\cAl-Issa's next court appearance is scheduled for May 25. \c\cAt around 8:00 p.m. on the day of the shooting, a procession honored Officer Eric Talley as his body was being taken to a funeral home. A separate memorial for the victims was created along a chain-link fence bordering the grocery store, as mourners placed candles, flowers, and other items along its base or through the chain-link. The Museum of Boulder began preserving stories and artifacts from the memorial. On April 16, it started planning both short-term and permanent memorials with the City of Boulder. \c\cGovernor Jared Polis ordered the state's flags to fly at half-staff for ten days: one day for each victim. President Joe Biden also ordered flags on federal property nationwide to be flown at half-staff. This order came on the same day as the expiration of a federal order to fly flags at half-staff to honor the victims of the Atlanta spa shootings of March 16, less than a week before. A week after the shooting, Talley's funeral was held; it included a 21-gun salute and another procession. \c\cSports teams in Colorado and victims of other mass shootings expressed sympathy for the victims and family members of the Boulder shooting. A vigil for the victims and survivors of the shooting was held on March 25. U.S. Representative Joe Neguse, whose district includes Boulder, spoke at the vigil about curbing gun violence. University of Colorado Boulder professor and poet Khadijah Queen also spoke at the vigil, which was organized by gun violence prevention group Moms Demand Action. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper that day, the family of one of the victims spoke about him and their appreciation for the outpouring of support. \c\cAl-Issa legally purchased a Ruger AR-556 pistol on March 16 at a local gun shop in Arvada that used Colorado's universal background check law, even though he was previously convicted of third-degree assault, a misdemeanor with a sentencing maximum of 18 months in county jail. Federal firearms laws only prohibit weapons purchases for those convicted of a felony, or a misdemeanor with a prison term of over 24 months. He was reported to be carrying a 9mm handgun in addition to his primary weapon. \c\cFollowing the shooting, discussion was renewed on the topic of gun control.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Germany is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 27 January 2020, the first case in Germany was confirmed near Munich, Bavaria. By mid February, the arising cluster of cases had been fully contained. On 25 and 26 February, multiple cases related to the Italian outbreak were detected in Baden-Württemberg. A large cluster linked to a carnival event was formed in Heinsberg, North Rhine-Westphalia; on 9 March 2020, the first two deaths in Germany were reported from Essen and Heinsberg. New clusters were introduced in other regions via Heinsberg as well as via people arriving from China, Iran and Italy, from where non-Germans could arrive by plane until 17–18 March. From 13 March, German states mandated school and kindergarten closures, postponed academic semesters and prohibited visits to nursing homes to protect the elderly. Two days later, borders to Austria, Denmark, France, Luxembourg and Switzerland were closed. \c\cBy 22 March, curfews were imposed in six German states while other states prohibited physical contact with more than one person from outside one's household. \c\cOn 15 April, Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of "fragile intermediate success" that had been achieved in the fight against the pandemic. The same day, a first loosening of restrictions was announced, continued in early May, and eventually, holiday travels were allowed in cooperation with other European countries. A number of state premiers pressed for faster relaxation of restrictions, putting them at odds with Merkel, who favoured a more cautious approach. Substantial local outbreaks in meat processing plants drew public attention beyond the epidemiological context to poor working conditions. By late August, infection numbers had returned to the levels of April, and a possible second wave of the pandemic was under debate. By mid October, it was believed by experts to be inevitable. A partial lockdown from 2 November, in which physical distancing rules were tightened while schools and kindergartens remained open, only temporarily halted the rise in case numbers; the total number of reported infections since the start of the pandemic crossed one million on 27 November. A hard lockdown was imposed on 15 December and extended several times, introducing movement restrictions for hard-hit districts, and later making FFP2 masks or other clinical masks mandatory on public transport and in shops. These extensions were mainly motivated by uncertainties associated with the appearance of the British variant and other mutations. High death rates in intensive care and nursing homes persisted into early February. On 10 February, the lockdown was extended until 7 March, and a gradual reopening of schools and daycare centres was agreed. A five-step plan was agreed on 3 March to end the second lockdown, from 1 March to 5 April 2021. On 24 March, the partial lockdown was extended until at least 18 April 2021. With the arrival of the third pandemic wave driven by variants, and a slow progress of vaccinations, the government was pushing in April for tightening of pandemic restrictions, and increasing the power of the federal level to implement uniform responses across hard-hit districts. \c\cVaccinations with the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine began on 27 December 2020 (inofficially one day earlier); vaccinations with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccine began in mid January and early February 2021 respectively. As of 19 April 2021[update], the RKI reported that 20.2 per cent of the total population have received their first of two required vaccination doses, and 6.7 per cent their second dose. On 16 March 2021, AstraZeneca vaccinations were stalled nationwide because of uncertain side effects and uncertain deaths of several people in the days after receiving it. Vaccinations with AstraZeneca resumed on 19 March after the European Medicines Agency deemed the vaccine "safe and effective"; on 31 March, on recommendation of the German vaccination commission STIKO, the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine was limited to those aged 60 or over. \c\cAs of 20 April 2021[update], the RKI has officially reported 3,153,699 cases, 80,006 deaths, and approximately 2,787,200 recoveries. The country's low fatality rate in the first and the onset of the second wave of the pandemic, compared to fatality rates in Italy and Spain, has generated a discussion and explanations that cite the country's higher number of tests performed, higher number of available intensive care beds with respiratory support and higher proportion of positive cases among younger people. The serious worsening of infection and death numbers in November and December 2020, which largely failed to raise a sense of alarm in the public, and frequent breaches of physical distancing rules led to a perception that Germany's status as a worldwide role model in fighting the pandemic had diminished. The September 2021 federal and numerous state elections were suggested as an additional hindrance in combating the second wave earlier and more decisively. \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 is lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cIn the implementation of federal and state guidelines to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, the Infection Protection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG) has played a central role. Enacted in 2000, the IfSG authorises state governments to issue regulations to control communicable diseases, and to order protective measures including quarantine, thus granting them considerable power in relation to the federal government, whose primary task is to coordinate the measures taken. \c\cDuring the pandemic, pressure by state premiers repeatedly forced Chancellor Merkel to soften anti-pandemic measures. \c\cIn March 2020, the federal government drafted a change to the IfSG to allow the federal government more power over the federal states. Among others it would allow the health ministry to prohibit border crossings, track the contacts of infected persons and enlist doctors, medicine students and other health care workers in the efforts against an infectious disease. A condition for use of the additional powers is the determination of an epidemic situation of national significance (de:Epidemische Lage von nationaler Tragweite) by the German Bundestag. The Bundestag made this determination on 25 March, the same day it approved the amendments to the IfSG. The amendments became law on 27 March. \c\cOn 18 November 2020, a reform of the IfSG which had been proposed by the ruling Grand Coalition of CDU/CSU and Social Democratic Party of Germany was passed in the Bundestag with 415 votes in favour, 236 against, and eight abstentions. The regulations of the law include a specification of the scope of measures which may be taken by individual states to combat a health emergency such as the current pandemic, with regard to social restrictions, the requirement to wear a nose-mouth covering, the temporary closure of shops, and the cancellation of mass events. The purpose of the law was to put measures that had been previously enacted by decree on a more firm legal basis that would prevent legal challenges. It also addressed complaints from across the political spectrum who had criticised the diminished role of the parliament in the preceding months. \c\cGermany has a common National Pandemic Plan, which describes the responsibilities and measures of the health care system actors in case of a huge epidemic. Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. On 4 March, the RKI published an extension of the national plan, which it had produced in collaboration with several other entities, for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Four major targets are included in this plan:\c\cReduce morbidity and mortality\c\cEnsure treatment of infected persons\c\cUpkeep of essential public services\c\cReliable and accurate information for decision-makers, medical professionals, media and public\c\cThe plan has three stages, which might eventually overlap due to regional differences in the evolution of the pandemic:\c\cContainment (circumstances of dedicated cases and clusters)\c\cProtection (circumstances of further spreading infections and unknown sources of infections)\c\cMitigation (circumstances of widespread infections)\c\cIn the containment stage health authorities are focusing on identifying contact persons who are put in personal quarantine and are monitored and tested. Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. As of 4 March, the pandemic was managed in the containment stage. In the protection stage the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The mitigation stage will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services. \c\cAs early as January 2020, the German Bundestag was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that "children [...] have [...] minor disease progressions" and that the risk of death of "over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%". It further stated that a "vaccine" is "unavailable", so all the more important is the "use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves". But until 24 March, the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance [de] (BBK) had never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation, was the criticism of some experts. \c\cOn 25 February, a 25-year-old man from Göppingen, Baden-Württemberg, who had recently returned from Milan, Italy, tested positive and was treated in Klinik am Eichert. On 26 February, Baden-Württemberg confirmed three new cases. The 24-year-old girlfriend of the 25-year-old man from Göppingen and her 60-year-old father, who worked as a chief physician at University Hospital Tübingen, tested positive and were admitted to the same hospital in Tübingen. A 32-year-old man from Rottweil, Baden-Württemberg, who had visited Codogno, Italy with his family on 23 February, tested positive and was admitted to a hospital for isolation. \c\cOn 27 February, Baden-Württemberg confirmed four new cases, for a total of eight cases in the region. Two women and a man from Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald and Freiburg, respectively, tested positive. They had had contact with an Italian participant at a business meeting in Munich; he was subsequently tested positive in Italy. A man from the district of Böblingen, who had had contact with the travel companion of the patient from Göppingen, also tested positive. \c\cOn 28 February, Baden-Württemberg confirmed five new cases, bringing the total number of cases in the state to thirteen. A man from Ludwigsburg with flu symptoms who had tested negative for influenza virus was automatically tested for SARS-CoV-2 and confirmed positive. A man from Rhine-Neckar returning from a short ski holiday with mild cold symptoms checked himself in to the emergency department of the University Hospital Heidelberg and tested positive. A 32-year-old man in Heilbronn tested positive and was admitted to a hospital. He had been in Milan on 21 February and fallen ill with flu symptoms on 23 February. A man from Nuremberg who was in Karlsruhe on business was admitted to the Karlsruhe City Hospital after testing positive. His family in Nuremberg was also ill with respiratory symptoms. A man from Breisgau who had travelled to Bergamo, Italy also tested positive and underwent isolation. \c\cAfter the ease of lockdown, a group of Germans who had been working in China was allowed to return. On arrival in Tianjin on 29 May 2020, Chinese authorities tested a 34-year-old engineer from Blaustein positive for the coronavirus. A test on departure in Frankfurt had shown no infection. \c\cIn late July, a cluster of new infections emerged around a religious group in Steinsfurt. Among the 105 members of a Romanian evangelistic movement, 40 tested positive for the virus on 28 July 2020, of whom 20 resided in the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis. Some 77 other individuals were wanted for testing, but did not respond or had left Germany on vacation when local authorities started the investigation. By 5 August, the number of active cases in Rhein-Neckar-Kreis had dropped from 20 to 4, with authorities judging that the outbreak had been contained within the community. \c\cOn 27 January 2020, the Bavarian Ministry of Health announced that a 52-year-old employee of Webasto, a German car parts supplier at Starnberg, Bavaria had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. He contracted the infection from a Chinese colleague who had received a visit in Shanghai from her parents from Wuhan. His was the first known case of a person contracting the virus outside of China from a non-relative – the first known transmission of the virus outside China being father to son in Vietnam. \c\cOn 28 January, three more cases were confirmed, a 27-year-old and a 40-year-old man as well as a 33-year-old woman. All three were also employees of Webasto. They were monitored and quarantined at the München Hospital in Schwabing. \c\cOn 30 January, a man from Siegsdorf who worked for the same company tested positive; on 31 January and 3 February respectively, both his children tested positive. His wife also tested positive on 6 February. A 52-year-old Webasto employee from Fürstenfeldbruck tested positive. \c\cOn 1 February, a 33-year-old Webasto employee living in Munich tested positive. On 3 February, another employee was confirmed positive. On 7 February, the wife of a previously diagnosed man tested positive. On 11 February, a 49-year-old Webasto employee tested positive, as did a family member of a previously diagnosed employee. \c\cAccording to reconstruction analysis published in September 2020, the outbreak at Webasto had not seeded the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, with the evidence pointing instead to the latter outbreak having been initiated by cases imported directly from China. \c\cOn 27 February, Bavaria confirmed that a man from Middle Franconia tested positive after he had contact with an Italian man who later tested positive as well. \c\cOn 8 March, an 83-year-old resident of the St. Nikolaus home of the elderly in Würzburg was brought into hospital and died four days later diagnosed with COVID-19, becoming the first reported death of the virus in Bavaria. By 27 March, ten more residents of the St. Nikolaus home of the elderly had also died of the virus and 44 residents and 32 employees tested positive. The residency complained about a lack of personnel and protective equipment. \c\cOn 12 August 2020, Bavarian health authorities admitted that they had not yet informed over 44,000 returning travellers about the results of their COVID-19 tests, mostly taken at mobile testing centres at highways. It was believed that there had been over 900 positive cases among these. The government explained the glitch with missing software and an unexpected large number of volunteers tested. Health Minister Melanie Huml reportedly offered her resignation to premier Soeder, whose decision to leave her in office was met with sharp criticism by the parliamentary opposition. In January 2021, Huml was moved to a position in the Bavarian State Chancellery. \c\cFrom 18 January 2021, pursuant to a 12 January decision, Bavaria made the wearing of FFP2 masks mandatory on public transport and in supermarkets, excepting bus drivers, ticket inspectors, and children aged up to 14 years. The new rule would not be policed until 24 January. The Bavarian government said it would provide masks free of charge to low-income groups and social welfare recipients. \c\cThe first case detected in the capital, Berlin, was reported on 2 March 2020. On 17 March, the government of Berlin announced plans to open a 1,000-bed hospital for COVID-19 patients on the grounds of Messe Berlin in the Westend locality of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. The hospital opened on 11 May 2020. \c\cBrandenburg's first case was detected on 3 March 2020. \c\cBremen's first case was detected on 1 March 2020. One person had already recovered as of 15 March 2020. \c\cHamburg's first case, a male paediatric member of staff at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, was confirmed on 27 February. As of 15 March 2020[update], there are 196 active cases. \c\cOn 28 February, Hesse officials confirmed three new cases in Lahn-Dill, Hochtaunuskreis and Giessen. The cases in Lahn-Dill and Giessen were linked to the cluster in NRW, and the case in Hochtaunuskreis to the one in Lahn-Dill. \c\cAfter the ease of lockdown for religious groups on 1 May, a church service on 10 May in Frankfurt led to a cluster that grew to 112 cases by 25 May. The service was later determined to have breached several regulations, including those that the major churches had given themselves. The church evaded penalties through participation in a study by the RKI, whose scientists had expressed great interest in studying the outbreak in detail. All of the infected had recovered by 24 June. \c\cOn 1 March 2020, Lower Saxony reported its first case. After the ease of lockdown in early May 2020 about 40 people met on 15 May for a private party in a restaurant in Moormerland. By 24 May at least 10 of the participants had tested positive and quarantine was ordered for 70 people. \c\cOn 31 May 2020, a new cluster with 36 confirmed infections was reported in Göttingen. The local authorities checked Hookah lounges to find the source of the infections. Mayor Rolf-Georg Köhler informed the public on 2 June that the cluster originated in Eid al-Fitr celebrations by several families on 23 May where social distancing rules had been ignored. On 4 June 2020, the city reported 86 infections from the cluster and some 216 people had been ordered in quarantine. All schools were closed again and all contact and team sports were prohibited for 2 weeks. \c\cOn 4 March 2020, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern reported three cases. \c\cOn 25 February, a 47-year-old man tested positive in Erkelenz, Heinsberg at North Rhine-Westphalia. He had been previously treated at University Hospital of Cologne on 13 and 19 February for a pre-existing medical condition. 41 medical staff members and patients were identified to have had contact with him at the hospital; one person from medical staff showed symptoms and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. \c\cOn 26 February, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, tested positive; both were isolated at University Hospital of Düsseldorf. His colleague and her partner also tested positive. \c\cOn 27 February, Heinsberg confirmed fourteen new cases: nine from Gangelt, two from Selfkant, one from the city of Heinsberg, one from Düsseldorf and one from Herzogenrath. Multiple cases were linked to the Gangelter Carnival. All of them were placed in home isolation. This brought the current total to twenty in the district. A medical doctor in Mönchengladbach tested positive and was quarantined at home. He had attended the same carnival event in Gangelt. \c\cOn 28 February, Aachen confirmed the first COVID-19 case in the region, a woman from Herzogenrath (Aachen district), who had attended the carnival event in Gangelt on 15 February and underwent home isolation. Heinsberg confirmed 17 new cases, bringing the current total to 37 cases in the district. \c\cOn 29 February, the number of confirmed cases in Heinsberg rose to sixty. Additionally, one case was confirmed in Bonn, three more in the Aachen district (one in Aachen and two in Würselen), and one in Lüdenscheid. Cologne, Mönchengladbach and Duisburg also each reported two cases. The first cases in Münster were confirmed. \c\cOn 1 March, cases in Heinsberg rose to 68. A case was confirmed in Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis, affecting a woman from Overath. \c\cOn 2 March, the number of positive cases in Heinsberg increased to 79. The Unna district reported its first case, a 61-year-old woman. \c\cOn 3 March, cases in Heinsberg rose to 84. Two more cases were confirmed in Münster. The first case was confirmed in Neuss. \c\cOn 4 March, the first case in Bochum was confirmed when a 68-year-old man returning from holiday in Italy tested positive. \c\cOn 5 March 195 cases were confirmed by laboratory test in Heinsberg. The local authorities announced that all schools, kindergartens, daycare facilities and interdisciplinary early intervention centres would remain closed until at least 15 March 2020. Six people tested positive in Münster. Four were pupils at Marienschule, one was a child under care in "Outlaw-Kita" day care centre in Hiltrup, and the sixth was a resident of Coesfeld, working at Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe in Münster. The school and the day care centre were closed as a precaution. \c\cOn 6 March, confirmed cases in Heinsberg rose to 220. A mobile medical care unit was deployed in Gangelt-Birgden. Bochum's second case was confirmed, after the wife of the city's first confirmed case also tested positive. \c\cOn 7 March, three cases were confirmed in Remscheid and one in Wermelskirchen. Bochum reported its third case, a 58-year-old man from Weitmar who had returned from a holiday in Italy. \c\cOn 8 March, the count of cases in the state rose to 484. Of these, 277 were in Heinsberg. Bochum recorded its fourth case after a woman tested positive after returning from a holiday in South Tyrol, Italy. She went into quarantine at home. A 44-year-old Münster resident tested positive and underwent quarantine with his family. Düsseldorf confirmed its fourth case, a man who had contact with individuals in Heinsberg. All cases in Düsseldorf were reported to be asymptomatic, or with mild symptoms. There were six new infections in Erkrath, Mettmann district. An additional three people were infected with the virus in Bergkamen, Unna district. They are believed to have come into contact with an infected person during a visit to Hamburg. \c\cOn 9 March, the first COVID-19 deaths in Germany, an 89-year-old woman in Essen and a 78-year-old man in Heinsberg, were reported. \c\cBy the evening of 10 March, the count of cases in the state rose to 648. All mass events in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 1000 participants were banned with immediate effect. \c\cOn 11 March, the number of positive cases in North Rhine-Westphalia increased to 801, including three deaths. \c\cOn 13 March, all schools and kindergartens were closed by the government of NRW. \c\cIn September, the city of Hamm became a hotspot after the obligation to wear masks and to keep distance had been ignored at three events with some 500 guests surrounding a Turkish wedding in early September. By 24 September, some 179 individuals from that wedding were described as "acute infected" by the local government. The number of infections per 100,000 citizens rose to 100 and new restrictions were introduced: Masks would have to be worn in schools for upper secondary education, events with more than 25 people would have to file an application and with 50 up to 150 participants, a concept for infection prevention would be required. On 6 October some 300 infected were linked to the wedding, some of them in the 3rd or 4th generation. \c\cIn October, the city of Cologne presented its #diesmalnicht (English: #notthistime) campaign discouraging gatherings, parades and similar hazardous behaviour for the commencement of the Cologne Carnival at 11:11 a.m. on 11 November 2020. Mayor of Cologne Henriette Reker announced that there would be a ban on the sale and consumption of alcohol outside of restaurants and pubs on 11 November 2020, with many establishments voluntarily remaining closed or not selling alcohol on that date. \c\cOn 26 February, a 41-year-old soldier who worked in Cologne-Wahn military airport and had attended a carnival event in Gangelt with the 47-year-old patient from North Rhine-Westphalia was admitted to Bundeswehr Central Hospital, Koblenz, the first case in Rhineland-Palatinate. \c\cOn 27 February, a 32-year-old man from Kaiserslautern, who had been in Iran, tested positive and was admitted to Westpfalz-Klinikum. \c\cOn 4 March, a woman and a child from Wachenheim tested positive and were quarantined. \c\cOn 4 March 2020, Saarland reported its first case. \c\cOn 3 March 2020, Saxony reported its first case. \c\cOn 10 March 2020, Saxony-Anhalt reported eight confirmed cases of COVID-19, making it the last federal state to be affected by the disease. As of 26 March, the subdivisions of Jessen and Schweinitz in the municipality of Jessen (Elster) are under quarantine, with no one apart from emergency workers allowed in or out. The cause is reported to be an increased number of COVID-19 infections in a retirement home there. \c\cOn 28 February 2020, Schleswig-Holstein reported its first case. \c\cOn 3 March 2020, Thuringia reported its first case. \c\cIn late March, a group of patients from Lombardy in Italy and the border region of Alsace in France were treated in Germany. \c\cOn 1 February, around 90 German citizens left Wuhan on a flight arranged by the German government. Upon arrival, they were quarantined in Rhineland-Palatinate for 14 days. \c\cOn 2 February, two of the arrivals from China tested positive and were moved from the quarantine location in Germersheim to an isolation unit at the University Hospital Frankfurt. \c\cAt a videoconference of Chancellor Merkel and the 16 state governors on 6 May 2020, when relaxations of pandemic measures were agreed as a result of the easing of the first wave of the pandemic, state governments were authorised to reimpose restrictions immediately in case of a new wave of cases reaching 50 per 100,000 people within 7 days in a locality ("seven-day incidence"). This measure, billed as "emergency brake", was intended to allow quick action against local outbreaks before the entire country would be affected. Starting from 14 September 2020, the RKI reported on the front page of its daily updates the countrywide 7-day incidence – that is the number of cases per 100,000 people within 7 days – as well as the number of districts with a 7-day incidence above 50; from 2 October 2020, the incidence was shown separately for those aged 60 and over, and from 28 December, also separately for those aged 80 and over. When imposing the new lockdown in response to the second wave in early November, the government stated that its goal was to reduce the 7-day incidence to about 50, so that contact tracing would again be possible. Other thresholds of the 7-day incidence also played a key role in measures taken locally; in the January 2021 extension and toughening of the measures to counter the second wave of the pandemic, a 7-day incidence of 200 triggered a travel ban for the affected district. \c\cBefore the adoption of the 7-day incidence as a key indicator, a major role in the public debate about whether and when the social distancing measures introduced in March 2020 could be relaxed was played by the effective reproduction number R. In its daily bulletins of 26–28 April 2020, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) estimated the value of R as 0.9, 1.0, and 0.9 respectively; it had been as low as 0.7 in mid-April. On 28 April, RKI president Wieler clarified that the 27 April value had been rounded up from a value of 0.96. The respective upper end-points of the confidence intervals (at the 95 per cent level) for the estimates of R were 1.1, 1.1, and 1.0. \c\cAt the 28 April press conference, Wieler also warned of pinning too many expectations on a single indicator such as R, as this was "only one index among many". He appealed to the public to apply physical distancing even as the federal and state governments began to relax restrictions on social movement,\c\cto "preserve" the success that had been achieved to date in the fighting the pandemic. \c\cThe R value again became the subject of increased public attention in the country in December 2020, with a surge in cases of a mutant coronavirus strain from the United Kingdom. The risk from higher transmission rates were stated by the government as a main reason for the toughening of pandemic restrictions in January 2021. On 20 April 2021, epidemiologist Lauterbach said that the majority of experts agreed that nightly curfews would reduce the R value by 10 to 20 per cent. \c\cSome experts were critical of the role of the 7-day incidence in pandemic policymaking; in an April 2021 interview, epidemiologist de:Gérard Krause of the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) criticized the incidence for being neither differentiating between age groups nor regarding severity of the disease, and suggested that the revision of the Infection Protection Act instead be based on the admissions to intensive care. \c\cOn 22 January 2020, the German government considered the spread of COVID-19 as a "very low health risk" for Germans and the virus in general as "far less dangerous" than SARS. New travel advisories would not be necessary. \c\cOn 27 January, after the first infections in Germany, the government continued to regard the probability of a spread as "very low". Even if individual cases emerged, authorities would be able to treat them. \c\cAt a press conference on 28 January, the Federal Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, stated that he was only worrying about conspiracy theories that were circulating on the Internet, and that the Federal Government would counter this problem through full transparency. Hotlines were established to calm down worried callers. After a case was suspected in a Lufthansa plane, the company suspended all flights to China. \c\cOn 29 January, reports surged that masks were sold out. The government ordered pilots of flights from China to describe the health status of their passengers and ordered passengers to fill in a contact document. The government and health authorities expected more isolated cases but were confident to prevent further spread. \c\cOn 1 February, German Health Minister Spahn warned that people infected with the Coronavirus and their contacts might be stigmatised and be socially excluded. He emphasised that the Germans evacuated from China would all be healthy. \c\cOn 13 February, at a meeting of EU Health Ministers, German Health Minister Spahn dismissed travel restrictions from or to China by single member states. He decidedly rejected measuring the temperature of inbound travellers. \c\cOn 18 February, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas had 8.4 tons of protective gear and clothing as well as disinfectants sent to China. This was the second shipment after Germany had sent 5.4 tons of it to China during the evacuation of the Germans. \c\cOn 24 February, the Light + Building Trade Fair in Frankfurt was postponed until September. \c\cOn 25 February, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Tod D. Wolters, was asked by senators if there were plans for restricting U.S. troop travel to other countries apart from Italy. He pointed to Germany as a potential candidate. AfD politician Alice Weidel demanded closing borders in Europe. \c\cOn 26 February, following the confirmation of multiple COVID-19 cases in North Rhine-Westphalia, Heinsberg initiated closure of schools, swimming pools, libraries and the town hall until 2 March. Games and training for FC Wegberg-Beeck were suspended. The international German Open Badminton in Mülheim was cancelled. The Cologne-Wahn military airport was temporarily closed. The German government opted not to implement travel restrictions on Italy over the coronavirus pandemic there. It also considered itself "far from" issuing a travel warning for the country, which would have enabled free cancellation of trips. \c\cOn 28 February, Germany first entered the top ten of countries that had the highest number of coronavirus infections as number nine, in Europe second only to Italy. ITB Berlin was cancelled by its organisers. Heinsberg extended closure of daycare facilities and schools to 6 March. The officials imposed a 14-day home isolation for people who had had direct contacts with individuals in the current cases as well as people who showed flu symptoms. Lufthansa cut the number of short- and medium-haul flights by up to 25%, and removed multiple long-haul routes resulting in 23 long-haul aircraft being taken out of operation. On the same day, Germany enacted new health security measures to include regulations for air and sea travel, requiring passengers from China, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran to report their health status before entry. Train railway companies must report passengers with symptoms to authorities and the federal police would step up checks within 30 kilometres of the border. The government also declared it would prepare a central acquisition of protection masks and suits to create a reserve, that not all events should be cancelled and that its crisis team would from then on meet twice a week. \c\cOn 29 February, it was reported that supermarket chains, such as Aldi and Lidl, had seen an increase in demand, particularly for tinned food, noodles, toilet paper (whose sales rose by 700% from February to March) and disinfectants. The Ministry of Health of North Rhine-Westphalia advised against panic buying, especially of masks, medications and disinfectants, to leave them for those really in need, assuring there would be no shortage of supply even in the event of a quarantine. A day earlier, after recent drastic price hikes and shortages especially of masks, medications and disinfectants which were the result of a steep increase in demand, calls had been made to consumers to leave these products for hospitals and medical practices. \c\cOn 1 March, the number of confirmed infections almost doubled within one day. German Interior Minister, Horst Seehofer, expressed his optimism that a vaccine would be available by the end of the year. The Finance Minister, Olaf Scholz, stated that the government was prepared for a stimulus package to mitigate the economical impact. The Health Minister, Jens Spahn, recommended that people with symptoms of a cold should avoid mass events. \c\cOn 2 March, the German Robert Koch Institute raised its threat level for Germany to "moderate" and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control raised its threat level for Europe from "moderate" to "high". The German Health Minister dismissed the closure of borders or companies or ending large events or direct flights between China and Germany as unnecessary or inappropriate. Germany sent lab equipment, protection suits, and gloves for the coronavirus in Iran. \c\cOn 3 March, the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, the Bavarian State Chamber of Medicine, the Bavarian Association of Paediatricians, and the Association of General Practitioners of Berlin and Brandenburg reported a lack of protection gear to handle COVID-19 cases. The Leipzig Book Fair cancelled the exhibition planned for mid-March. Markus Söder, Minister President of Bavaria and leader of the CSU, and the German Minister for Economics, Peter Altmaier, pushed for financial help for companies affected by the virus. \c\cOn 4 March, the crisis team considered the acquisition of more protection gear as an "extraordinary urgency". Germany prohibited the export of protection masks, gloves, and suits. North Rhine-Westphalia declared to order one million masks. A parliamentary discussion took place. The Health Minister, Spahn, warned that the consequences of fear could be far worse than the virus itself. Spokespersons of Greens and FDP praised the government for its management of the crisis. AfD leader Weidel disagreed and also proposed measuring fever at airports. SPD health policymaker Bärbel Bas stated that measuring fever made no sense because not every infected person has a fever. Israel ordered a 14-day quarantine for all travellers from Germany and four other European countries. \c\cTo address the severe shortage of hand disinfectants, the Federal Agency for Chemicals within the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health issued a general decree on 4 March which allowed pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies to produce and sell products based on isopropyl alcohol for this purpose. \c\cOn 5 March, the German Federal Office for Citizen Protection and Disaster Support (BBK) stated that the spread in Germany was "no catastrophe" and that citizens should prepare for real catastrophes instead. The leader of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, expressed concern that some countries showed an unwillingness to act or gave up. He admonished all countries to raise their commitment to the level of the threat. \c\cOn 6 March, the German Health Minister Spahn ruled out "any measure leading to restrictions on travel" within the European Union and spoke out against closing all schools and universities in Germany. Spahn recommended not to make unnecessary travels and suggested people coming from risk areas should stay at home. Spahn participated in a meeting with the other European Health Ministers to discuss the crisis. The EU and Robert Koch Institute emphasised that masks and disinfectants should not be used by healthy private persons. \c\cIn March, Germany banned prostitution for the duration of the pandemic. \c\cOn 8 March, the German Health Minister recommended to cancel events of more than 1000 attendees for the time being. The Deutsche Fußball Liga announced it would continue the season of its soccer leagues until its regular end in mid-May. Poland announced random temperature checks for bus passengers from Germany near a border crossing starting the next day. \c\cOn 9 March, Germany reported the first deaths. The number of COVID-19 infections had nearly doubled to more than 1200 within the last few days, which put pressure on the government to act. Angela Merkel's administration announced measures to cushion the economic blow. Merkel, who had publicly kept a low profile regarding the outbreak, emphasised it was important to slow down the spread and buy time. The government's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, stated that citizens could be "confident that the whole Federal Government, with the Chancellor at the helm, is doing everything possible to contain the spread of this virus". The Health Minister emphasised the responsibility of each individual to slow down spread and ruled out preemptive closing of daycare centres or schools. \c\cOn 10 March, Chancellor Merkel announced that between 60 and 70 per cent of Germans would get the virus, an estimate already made nine days earlier by the head virologist of the Charité, Christian Drosten. In reaction to a general ban on events with more than 1,000 participants put into immediate effect, Germany's Ice Hockey league DEL announced immediate cancellation of the 2019–2020 season, and that the championship title would remain vacant. Several matches of the soccer leagues, including Bundesliga derbies would be played behind closed doors, a first in the 57-year history of the Bundesliga. Berlin mayor Michael Müller (SPD) disagreed and stated that mass events should not be cancelled preemptively and expected the sold-out soccer match between Union Berlin and FC Bayern Munich on 14 March not to be behind closed doors. \c\cOn 11 March, having faced accusations of inaction the previous days, Merkel took the unusual step of dedicating an entire press conference on the topic of the COVID-19 crisis. She emphasised "We will do the necessary, as a country and in the European Union". She announced liquidity support for companies, especially via the German development bank KfW, to be realised before the week was over. She insisted again on not closing borders. Merkel recommended everyone avoid shaking hands, for example by looking a second longer and smiling instead. The German health minister added that mouth protection and disinfectants were needless for individuals and that it was enough to wash hands with soap rigorously. Shops noted a great increase in demand for provisions and sanitary products. The first member of the Bundestag to be tested positive was FDP politician Hagen Reinhold. Several members of the Bundestag for the SPD were placed under quarantine, including epidemiologist and Member of Parliament Karl Lauterbach, after attending a meeting on 2 March with a staff member of the German Ministry of Justice later testing positive for coronavirus. \c\cOn 12 March, U.S. President Trump announced (actually on 11 March 21:00 EDT local time) a 30-day travel ban for foreigners who travelled from Schengen area states, including Germany, effective 13 March 23:59 EDT. German foreign politicians were caught by surprise by the travel ban and criticised that it was not coordinated with them. They complained that the United Kingdom was not included. Although neighbouring countries had already closed schools, German Minister of Education Anja Karliczek rejected a nationwide closure of schools, while stating that the decision would need to be re-assessed daily as the pandemic evolved. The Kultusministerkonferenz debated whether the virus could threaten the upcoming Abitur school-leaving examination. Its director, Stefanie Hubig, decided the oral examinations in Rhineland-Palatinate between 16 and 25 March would take place according to plan. She also recommended cancelling class trips to risk areas. \c\cOn 13 March 14 of the 16 German federal states decided to close their schools and nurseries for the next few weeks. Germany's neighbours Czech Republic, Poland and Denmark closed their borders. Germany rushed to order 10,000 ventilators from Drägerwerk for intensive respiratory care, twice the order size of Italy and equivalent to the production of a whole year. Germany entered talks for softening its export stop of protective gear for other European Union states. The government decided to give financial support to artists, private cultural institutions and event companies that struggle in the crisis. Scholz and Altmeier assured unlimited credits to all companies of any size. Bundesliga announced that all soccer matches would be postponed until at least 2 April. \c\cOn 14 March, the number of confirmed infections had increased to 4,585, including nine fatalities. Several federal states widened their measures to limit public activities. For example, Berlin, Schleswig-Holstein and Saarland closed bars among other leisure venues. Cologne forbid all events in the city centre. An FDP member of Bundestag, Thomas Sattelberger, went public on Twitter that he was infected. He also criticised a video created by Germany's largest public broadcaster, ARD which had satirically portrayed COVID-19 as a boon through preferentially killing the old in the developed world, who ruined the planet with global warming and turbocapitalism. The authors of the video later apologised for hurting feelings and defended their work stressing it was a satire using exaggeration. \c\cOn 15 March, local elections in Bavaria took place amid the crisis. Many election workers dropped out so that the elections were "acutely threatened" and teachers had to be conscripted on one day's notice. German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer announced the closing of the borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark and Luxembourg. The measure would begin on 16 March and the transportation of goods and commuters would be exempt. Deutsche Bahn decided to reduce its regional traffic and, to protect its staff, suspended further ticket inspections. \c\cOn 16 March, the state of Bavaria declared a state of emergency for 14 days and introduced measures to limit public movement and provide additional funds for medicine supplies. Bavarian minister president Markus Söder ordered closures of all sports and leisure facilities starting on 17 March. Restaurants were ordered to limit their dine-in opening hours to before 3:00 pm; to ensure a minimum distance of 1.5 metres between guests; and to accommodate a maximum of 30 guests. Supermarkets, chemist's shops, banks, pet shops, and all businesses that sell essential basic needs are allowed extended opening times including on Sundays, while non-essential shops are to be closed at all times. \c\cItalian scientists, including virologist Roberto Burioni, warned Germany against underestimating the danger and the director of Eurac Research stated that Germany needed a lockdown or the numbers would go out of control. In the evening, Merkel announced measures similar to Bavaria for the entire country, agreed on by all federal states and the ruling coalition. This also includes a prohibition on travelling in coaches, attending religious meetings, visiting playgrounds or engaging in tourism. The government stressed it was no "shutdown". \c\cOn 17 March, Germany along with the European Union closed its borders to travellers from outside the bloc for 30 days, with exceptions for some European countries and designated essential purposes, and advised its citizens not to travel abroad. Inbound travel to Frankfurt Airport was suspended the same evening. Chancellor Merkel also stated that the European Commission had begun work on a collective tender for medical gear. \c\cThe Robert Koch Institute raised the health threat risk for COVID-19 in Germany to "high". Limits on the testing capacity and a delay of three to four days meant reported numbers were significantly lower than the actual ones. Employment agencies and job centres reported a tenfold increase in calls and had to relax sanctions. Berlin announced the plan to construct a hospital with the Bundeswehr for housing 1000 beds for COVID-19 patients. The Federal and State Governments agreed on a new emergency plan for German hospitals which includes doubling the current capacity of 28,000 intensive care beds, of which 25,000 are equipped with ventilation. After a man tested positive in a refugee centre in Suhl, a quarantine led to days of protest, physical resistance and escape attempts over fences or the sewage system. In an SEK operation with protection suits and tanks, 200 police forces calmed the situation and relocated 17 offenders. The Interior Minister of Lower Saxony warned that untrue news could trigger panic buying and conflicts, and demanded laws to punish publishing wrong information regarding the supply situation, including the medical one, or aspects of the virus. \c\cOn 18 March, Germany widened its travel restrictions to EU citizens from Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Luxembourg and Spain, who had up to that time been able to arrive by flight or ship. Germany still received flights from Iran and China due to bilateral agreements, although the German ministry of transportation had stated two days earlier that it would forbid passenger flights from there. The passengers were not tested for the virus and their temperatures were not taken due to the absence of administrative orders. The head of the Robert Koch Institute warned that the number of infected could rise to up to ten million in two months unless social contacts were reduced significantly, and called for a minimum distance of 1.5 metres to be maintained in all direct contact. The government began to bring back thousands of German travellers stranded in non-EU countries with charter flights. The public health insurance companies assured to cover all expenses related to the crisis with no limitation. \c\cOn 19 March, discussions of the Minister presidents of the German states and Merkel regarding a curfew were set for 22 March. A German manufacturer of breathing masks for hospitals and doctors complained that his warnings in early February that masks were selling out and his offer to reserve masks for hospitals had remained unanswered by the health ministry. The ministry explained to the press that they had received the messages but deemed itself not responsible and that the numerous offers could not be replied to due to prioritisation. Some hospitals reported they were already facing shortages of protective gears. A survey revealed that more than 80% of the doctors in private practice reported a lack of protective equipment. \c\cOn 20 March, Bavaria was the first state to declare a curfew, inspired by and identical to Austria, where it had been implemented four days before. The Bavarian curfew would begin at midnight and fine violators up to €25,000. It would remain permitted to go to work as well as to supermarkets, medics and pharmacies, under the condition that the trip is solitary or with housemates. Under the same condition, it is also permitted to do sports outside; to visit the life partner or aged, sick or disabled people who do not live in a facility; and to help others in general or provide for animals. Restaurants except drive-ins and for take-away, DIY shops and hairdressers would be shut down. The Federal government scheduled a discussion for 22 March to decide on a nationwide curfew and still faced opposition from the German Association of Towns and Municipalities and reservations, among others from the Governing Mayor of Berlin, Michael Müller, or Minister President of Thuringia, Bodo Ramelow. Annalena Baerbock, chairwoman of the Greens, criticised Bavaria's introduction of the curfew as counter-productive, saying there should not be a competition of which federal state is the fastest and strictest and that there would already be a round of voting on this question with all the federal states and the Chancellor in two days. Starting also at midnight, the state of Saarland, a region close France's badly affected Grand Est region, also put a similar curfew into place. Lufthansa donated 920,000 breathing masks to the health authorities. \c\cOn 21 March, after more and more residents of refugee centres tested positive for the virus, asylum seekers were unsettled. In Suhl, some threw stones at the police, threatened to set the residence on fire, and used children as human shields. Refugee organisations demanded smaller residencies, including accommodation in hotels and hostels. \c\cAccording to data collected on 17–18 March 2020 spending behaviour in a sample of 2500 people in Germany, with an age range from 16 to 65 years confirmed panic buying, showing a 35% increase in the purchase of noodles, 34% increase in canned food, and sanitiser (+33%), a 30% increase in frozen food, mineral water and soap, as well as a slightly lower degree in prepackaged meals (+8%), toilet paper 26%, facial tissue +24% and medication +19%. \c\cOn 22 March, the government and the federal states agreed for at least two weeks to forbid gatherings of more than two people and require a minimum distance of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) between people in public except for families, partners or people living in the same household. Restaurants and services like hairdressers were to be closed. Individual states and districts were allowed to impose stricter measures than these. Saxony joined Bavaria and the Saarland in prohibiting residents from leaving their dwellings except for good reasons, which are similar to the ones in the other two states; outdoor exercise is permitted under the new rules only alone or in groups of maximal five members of the same household. \c\cChancellor Merkel was quarantined because the physician who had vaccinated her two days earlier tested positive. Volkswagen bought medical equipment in China in a double-digit million euro range to donate it in Germany and voiced its intention to produce masks. \c\cOn 23 March, the government decided on a financial aid package totalling around 750 billion euros taking on new debt for the first time since 2013, to mitigate the damage of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy. Stephan Pusch, the District Administrator of Heinsberg, asked the Chinese president for help with protective equipment, because the reserve of masks and protective gowns would last only a few more days. Hospitals and doctors urged the government again to address the lack of masks and other protection gear. Berlin received 8000 masks from the nation's central provisioning, which would mean only one mask for every doctor's practice. Of the ten million masks promised by Federal Health Minister Spahn, only 150,000 had arrived so far. A transport plane arrived with masks and coronavirus test kits donated by Alibaba. Other Chinese tech companies like Oppo and Xiaomi also donated masks. Beiersdorf delivered 6000 litres of disinfectants as part of a larger donation of 500 tons. \c\cOn 24 March, a delivery of 6 million protective masks of type FFP-2 ordered by the German central provisioning to protect health workers was reported missing at an airport in Kenya. They had been produced by a German company and it was unclear why they had been in Kenya. 10 million protective masks had been ordered by the central provisioning altogether. The lack of protective equipment, especially of face masks and disinfectants, led hospitals to re-use disposable masks. Undertakers requested protective equipment and raising their status to being relevant for the system to get priority access to protective gear. Most dentists practices did not have FFP-2 masks and some considered closing their practices. Several alcohol manufacturers started to deliver disinfectants or alcohol to pharmacies and hospitals. Klosterfrau Healthcare announced it would donate 100,000 litres of disinfectant and Jägermeister provided 50,000 litres of alcohol for producing disinfectants. As of late March, Deutsche Krankenhaus-Gesellschaft (DKG) reported an estimated number of 28,000 intensive care beds, of which 20,000 had respiratory support. 70 to 80 per cent were occupied by non-COVID-19 patients. A project to find out the exact percentage of free intensive care beds in Germany had been started by Deutsche Interdisziplinäre Vereinigung für Intensiv- und Notfallmedizin (DIVI) and half of all hospitals joined it. \c\cOn 25 March, the German Bundestag approved, with a large majority, the stimulus package which the government had decided on two days earlier. It also suspended the constitutionally enshrined debt brake to approve the supplementary government budget of 156 billion euros. The Kultusministerkonferenz decided against cancelling the Abitur school-leaving examinations, which were currently under way in Hessen and Rhineland-Palatinate. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) warned that the epidemic had only just begun in Germany. \c\cOn 26 March, Robert Bosch GmbH announced it had developed a new COVID-19 test system, which could diagnose whether a patient was infected in less than 2.5 hours instead of days and could be run automatically at the point of care. According to Bosch, the test would be available in Germany in April and could check for 10 respiratory pathogens simultaneously with an accuracy of more than 95%. At night, it was reported the Interior Minister, Horst Seehofer, had decided to widen the scope of the entry restrictions, which had previously covered other EU- and non-EU citizens, to also prohibit asylum seekers from entering. \c\cOn 27 March, the stimulus package passed the German Bundesrat with large majority. It came into effect the same day with the signature of President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. \c\cDrägerwerk announced that the first respiratory devices of a total order of 10,000 by the health ministry were finished, but it was unclear where to deliver them. The fulfilment of the order would extend over a whole year as the company had received many orders from other countries and the German government had not asked them to be supplied first. Drägerwerk also announced it had doubled its production of breathing masks. \c\cOn the morning of 28 March, the body of Hesse's Minister of Finance Thomas Schäfer was found next to the Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line near Hochheim am Main. Volker Bouffier suspected that his suicide resulted from worries about the future in the wake of the corona crisis crushing him. \c\cOn 29 March, in Berlin and Hamburg two demonstrations for the adoption of more refugees were considered a violation of the contact ban and were dispersed by police forces. Adidas, Deichmann, H&M and many other retail companies which had their shops closed as part of the government restrictions announced that they planned to suspend rent payment according to the new law granting temporary relief during the corona crisis. Christine Lambrecht, called it "indecent and unacceptable" and Bundestag member Florian Post (SPD) published a video of himself burning an Adidas shirt and calling for a boycott of the company. \c\cOn 31 March, Jena was the first major German city to announce an obligation to wear masks, or makeshift masks including scarves, in supermarkets, public transport, and buildings with public traffic. Minister president of Bavaria, Markus Söder, stated that the problem of mask acquisition needed to be solved before discussing an obligation to wear masks, and demanded a national emergency production of protective masks. Intensive care physicians criticised the lack of protective clothing in nursing services, clinics and doctors\' practices as a state failure. \c\cOn 1 April, the project of a European Coronavirus app was publicised that, unlike apps of other countries, could satisfy the requirements of the EU's stringent data protection, releasable in Germany around 16 April. The project, titled Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT), involved eight European countries and, on the German side, participation came from the Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Robert Koch Institute, Technical University of Berlin, TU Dresden, University of Erfurt, Vodafone Germany and (for testing) Bundeswehr. The app would use Bluetooth to register close contact to other people with the app anonymously and warn the user when a person who had previously been in close contact officially registered an infection. Most German politicians demanded that public usage should be voluntary. \c\cOn 1 April, Health minister Jens Spahn forbade flights from Iran, effective immediately, on the basis of the new Infection Protection Act. Chancellor Merkel extended the social distancing measures to 19 April and asked people not to travel during the Easter holidays. \c\cOn 2 April, the Robert Koch Institute changed its previous recommendation that only people with symptoms should wear masks to also include people without symptoms. A general obligation to wear masks in public, not supported by the federal government and most regional governments, was discussed. It faced the counter-argument of general shortages of protection gear that could not even guarantee supply for the health care and maintenance system. At least 2,300 of German medical personnel in hospitals were confirmed to have contracted Sars-CoV-2. The number of cases from other medical sectors was not systematically collected and thus not known; most federal state governments and the Federal Health Ministry replied to a team of investigating journalists that no information could be given. In Bavaria, where 244 medical practices had been closed due to quarantine (141), lack of protection gear (82) and a lack of childcare (21), the Bavarian State Ministry for Health and Care instructed its health departments not to answer the request for information. \c\cOn 7 April, the Robert Koch Institute, in partnership with healthtech startup Thryve, launched the app Corona-Datenspende (Corona Data Donation) for voluntary consensual use by the German public to help monitor the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the effectiveness of measures taken against the pandemic. The app was designed to be used with a range of smartwatches and fitness trackers to share anonymised health data for scientific purposes. Project leader Dirk Brockmann stated that he hoped that 100,000 people would sign up. Later that day, the RKI announced that more than 50,000 users had downloaded the app. \c\cA preliminary result, published on 9 April, from a study by the University of Bonn, based on a sample from 1,000 residents of Gangelt in Heinsberg district, North Rhein-Westphalia (NRW) showed that two per cent of its population were infected, while 15 per cent of the residents have developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, regardless of whether they showed any symptoms. This constitutes a mortality rate of 0.37 per cent, significantly below the 0.9 per cent which Imperial College of the UK had estimated, or the 0.66 per cent found in a revised study last week. Several experts criticised that the Heinsberg study had been made public initially through a press conference – at which NRW Minister President Armin Laschet was also present – and expressed doubts about the method of statistical sampling used in the study, as well as other aspects. \c\cOn 13 April, the German National Academy of Sciences, Leopoldina, published its third ad hoc statement on the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The statement, which supplements its two predecessors, described strategies for a stepwise lifting or modification of measures against the pandemic, taking into account psychological, social, legal, pedagogic and economic aspects. Re-opening of classroom primary and lower-level secondary education as soon as feasible, with observation of hygiene and physical distancing measures, was recommended. The statement did not contain a timeframe for implementing its recommendations. Already before the release of the statement, Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that the recommendations of the report would be "very important" in political decision-making regarding the pandemic. \c\cOn 15 April, after a video conference with the Minister Presidents of the 16 Federal states, Chancellor Merkel stated that Germany had achieved "fragile intermediate success" in slowing the spread of the virus, but restrictions of public life remained key to preventing the spread of the virus from accelerating again. Shops with a retail space of up to 800 square metres, as well as bookshops, bike shops and car dealerships, would be allowed to reopen to the public on 20 April, providing they followed specified conditions of distancing and hygiene. Schools would start opening on 4 May, as well as hair salons, the latter under particularly strict conditions. It was agreed that large cultural events would not be allowed before 31 August. Other restrictions on social life, which had been imposed on 22 March – including the ban on gatherings of more than two people – were extended until at least 3 May. Merkel urgently recommended people to wear protective masks on public transport and while shopping, but stopped short of making them mandatory. \c\cOn 16 April, Bavarian State Premier Markus Söder stated that Oktoberfest would most likely be cancelled. While the government and state governors started to reach agreement to relax some aspects of the social distancing protocols, large events would be banned until at least 31 August. \c\cOn 20 April, as shops started to reopen – with differences from state to state in the level of restrictions – Chancellor Merkel thanked Germans for adhering, on the whole, to advice on staying at home and to physical distancing rules. At the same time, she warned that the country continued to be "at the start of this pandemic". If infections were to resurge, which would be visible after two weeks, another shutdown would follow, an outcome which had to be prevented for the sake of the economy. \c\cOn 21 April, Bavarian State Premier Söder announced that Oktoberfest would be cancelled. \c\cFor the first time in its 70-year history, the German Trade Union Confederation had cancelled its traditional demonstrations throughout Germany on 1 May, holding instead a three-hour online streaming event. Nevertheless, on that day a number of authorised and unauthorised gatherings took place in Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, Frankfurt and other German cities. In Berlin, 27 authorised protests were held, each capped at a maximum of 20 participants. \c\cOn May Day in Kreuzberg, several thousand protesters or spectators took part in demonstrations which, while unauthorised, were largely left alone by the police. Most of those gathered appeared to keep a safe distance from each other; however, from the early evening onwards, many hundreds were observed not to do so, leading Berlin's Senator for the Interior Andreas Geisel to sharply condemn the protesters for their "geballte Unvernunft" ("bunched-up lack of common sense"). After nightfall, several members of the police force were injured, who arrested 209 people. In Hamburg, police dissolved an unauthorised assembly of 350 people at Reeperbahn and later another one at Sternschanze, where some rioters threw objects at them. An assembly in Leipzig which, according to preliminary estimates by police, drew more than 200 participants, received a spontaneous permit by authorities. \c\cAfter a summit between Angela Merkel and state leaders on 30 April, the federal government allowed opening of museums, monuments, botanical gardens and zoos, and religious services under strict social distancing conditions. \c\cOn 4 May, the district of Coesfeld in North Rhine-Westphalia recorded 581 infections, an increase by 53 cases from two days earlier. It was reported that a large part of this increase had come from a proactive case tracing and testing of employees at a meat factory in Coesfeld city by the district health office. The plant was allowed to continue to operate under tight supervision by the office. \c\cOn a conference call between Chancellor Angela Merkel and 16 state premiers on 6 May, Merkel stated that the goal of slowing down the virus had been achieved and that the first phase of the pandemic was over, while asking everyone to remain cautious so as not to cause a second wave. At the same time, the federal government announced the lifting of more restrictions, while contact limitations would remain until 5 June. Under the newly agreed conditions, a maximum of two different households can meet in public. All shops are allowed to open, schools and kindergartens may open in phases, people in care homes are allowed visits from one permanent contact person, outdoor sports without physical contact can resume, and Bundesliga matches may resume starting 15 May, behind closed doors (the latter practice being known in Germany as de:Geisterspiele). The decision on specific opening dates, including those for the restaurant sector, has been left to individual states. Local governments were authorised to reimpose restrictions immediately in case of a new wave of cases reaching 50 per 100,000 people within 7 days in a locality. \c\cOn 7 May, a test of 200 employees at the Coesfeld meat processing plant, where cases had first been reported on 4 May, revealed 151 were positive for COVID-19. North Rhine-Westphalia State Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann stated that the shared accommodation of workers in tight quarters was a possible reason for the outbreak. He also stated that the number of new infections in Coesfeld district had been 61 per 100,000 people over the previous week. The plant was closed until further notice, while schools and day care facilities in the district were allowed to open as planned on 11 May. On 9 May, the RKI gave the number of infections in the Coesfeld district in the past week as 76 cases per 100,000, while all other districts in North Rhine-Westphalia were reported to have remained considerably below the government-set threshold of 50 cases per 100,000. \c\cBy the afternoon of 10 May, five locations in Germany reported an exceedance of the threshold: besides Coesfeld, these were the city of Rosenheim in Bavaria (the latter having had a first exceedance on 7 May); the districts Greiz and Sonneberg in Thuringia; and the district Steinburg in Schleswig-Holstein. \c\cOn 12 May, the Senate of Berlin agreed to a traffic light-type warning system for a re-tightening of coronavirus restrictions. Besides the number of new infections per 100,000 residents in the preceding seven days, which had been agreed upon earlier by the federal government with the German states, it also considers the development of the reproduction number R and the capacity of intensive-care hospital beds. \c\cOn 13 May, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer announced that border controls with several neighbouring countries would be eased starting 15 May. On that day, controls at the border with Luxembourg would be scrapped, and the goal would be to have free travel to Austria, France, and Switzerland starting 15 June. \c\cOn 14 May, the German government tabled a law aimed in particular at improving the protection of risk groups and enabling a better understanding of the progress of the pandemic. It came into effect the following day. Regular contacts of persons at risk, such as in nursing homes, are to be subject to more thorough coronavirus testing, to recognise outbreaks early and to break transmission chains. Laboratories are now required to report negative test results, and to provide the probable place of infection if available; data will be reported to RKI in anonymised form. Carers in facilities for the aged, including volunteers and trainees, will be entitled to a one-off tax-free payment of up to 1,500 euros. The costs of intensive care treatment of COVID-19 patients from other European countries will be borne by Germany if the patients are unable to be treated in their home countries due to lack of\c\ccapacity. \c\cOn 15 May, it was reported that Labour Minister Hubertus Heil was to present a government proposal on 18 May to Germany's "corona cabinet", aimed at improving hygiene standards in meat processing plants through measures including prohibition of subcontractors. During the days prior, several German states had reported outbreaks in meat plants. \c\cOn 20 May, in response to the recent outbreaks of COVID-19 at several meat processing plants, the German government agreed on a new framework of regulations for the industry, including an effective ban on subcontracting at meat packing plants, as well as tighter supervision of any living quarters provided by the employers. The draft was to be put into a law which still required parliamentary approval. \c\cNew outbreaks at initial reception facilities (called Ankerzentren in several German states) and other housing for refugees continued to be reported in several parts of Germany. On 21 May 137 out of 580 residents at an Ankerzentrum in Geldersheim, Bavaria, were reported to have been infected. Several dozen residents had angrily demanded on 18 May that the quarantine, which by then had been in place for over seven weeks, be lifted. A spokesperson of the local government of Lower Franconia expressed his understanding for the protests. \c\cOn 23 May, local authorities in Frankfurt told a news agency that more than 40 people had tested positive for the coronavirus after attending a church service on 10 May. It was reported that the church had adhered to official social distancing and hygiene rules. \c\cOn the weekend of 23/24 May, it became known that Thuringia State Premier Bodo Ramelow intended to lift all general coronavirus related restrictions after 5 June, the expiry date of the then current set of restrictions. The announcement met with a heated debate and severe criticism from health experts including epidemiologist Karl Lauterbach, as well as the media. \c\cThe plans of Thuringia State Premier Ramelow continued to be the subject of intense debate. A survey by public broadcaster ZDF found that of those polled throughout Germany, 72 per cent were against Ramelow's plans. 56 per cent of respondents deemed the restrictions currently in place as neither too tight nor too relaxed. \c\cOn 3 June, the German federal cabinet agreed to allow travels to all 26 EU countries, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein starting 15 June, subject to the pandemic being sufficiently under control in the destination country. Travel warnings would still be maintained with regard to countries where large-scale curfews or entry restrictions remain in place. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas stated that he anticipated Spain to open its borders to travellers on 21 June, rather than the currently set date of 1 July. Norway stated that it would consider to allow entry from certain neighbouring countries, which would include Germany. \c\cOn 9 June, the state cabinet of Thuringia agreed to lift most contact restrictions starting 13 June. In the new Grundverordnung (basic regulation), citizens are encouraged to strive to keep physical social contact with others at a low level, and to keep the group of people who they have such contact with steady. The minimum physical distance requirement of 1.5 metres is dropped for groups from at most two households. The use of face masks in public transport and in shops continues to be required. Folk festival and sports event organisers may apply for an exemption from the general prohibition of such events. \c\cIn mid June 2020, the German government launched a COVID-19 tracing app. On 23 October, the Corona-Warn-App was reported to have 16 million active users. From 19 October, it exchanged warnings with apps from Ireland and Italy, and other European countries were expected to follow. The app is anonymous and while its use is voluntary, the government later included it in its official recommendations. \c\cOn 17 June, German authorities announced that a total of 657 people had tested positive at a slaughterhouse run by meat processing firm Tönnies in the city of Gütersloh, out of 983 completed tests. Numbers were expected to rise once the total number of just over 1,000 tests had been completed. As a consequence, schools in the districts were closed until the start of the summer holidays on 29 June. Tönnies apologised for the outbreak. The company announced later that over 5,000 further members of the workforce would be tested, with the production staff ordered to stay inside their living quarters when not at work until the remaining meat products had finished processing. Virologist Isabella Eckerle stated that she considered it "extremely unlikely" that the spate of infections had been the result of workers returning to their home countries in Eastern Europe over the preceding long weekend, and that a superspreading event was more likely to have been the cause of the outbreak. \c\cBy 20 June 2020, the number of positive tests exceeded 1,000. On 23 June, against the backdrop of a rise in confirmed cases to above 1,500, Minister President Armin Laschet and State Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann announced that neighbouring districts of Gütersloh and Warendorf would, until 30 June, be subject to the same contact restrictions as in March. Schools in Gütersloh would also close until the summer break. In the meantime, wide testing of the local population would be carried out to establish the extent of the outbreak; to that date, merely 24 positive tests had been returned from those who did not work at Tönnies. In response to the development, Bavaria issued a temporary ban for hotels to accommodate guests coming from any district which exceeded the threshold of 50 infections per 100,000 residents in the past seven days, unless travellers could produce an up-to-date negative coronavirus test. \c\cOn 29 June, it was proclaimed by Laschet and Laumann that the lockdown of Warendorf district would end on the night of 30 June, while it would be extended in Gütersloh district by another week. \c\cOn 21 September, a report from the Detmold regional government from mid May surfaced, which stated that violations of hygiene rules had been found by inspectors already before the outbreak, with no workers in the slaughter areas having worn masks at an inspection on 15 May, and canteens and toilets not being up to standards. The report also criticised that the next inspection had only been carried out two weeks after. \c\cOn midnight from 1 to 2 July, in the course of implementing a recommendation of the Council of the European Union from 30 June on phasing out temporary entry restrictions, Germany allowed unrestricted entry from eleven countries outside the European Union. Extended entry possibilities from all such countries were created, with the list of "important reasons" including: healthcare workers, health researchers and geriatric care workers; skilled and highly qualified foreign workers if their employment is necessary from an economic perspective and requires presence in Germany; and foreign students whose course of study is not fully possible from abroad. \c\cOn 6 July, the supreme administrative court of North Rhine–Westphalia (Oberverwaltungsgericht für das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen) suspended the extension until 7 July of the lockdown in Gütersloh district. In its ruling, the court stated that more differentiated lockdown measures depending on the location within the district would have been appropriate and possible, given the extensive testing in the district that had taken place after the outbreak at Tönnies. \c\cA preprint on the origins of the Tönnies meat factory outbreak, authored by researchers from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, the Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, and the Heinrich Pette Institute, was uploaded on SSRN on 23 July. The researchers reconstructed the origins of the outbreak, and found that a single superspreader had transmitted the virus within a radius of over eight metres to co-workers. They suggested that transmission of the virus may have been facilitated by the low temperatures in the factory, its limited fresh air supply, and the strenuous nature of the work. On the other hand, the living conditions in the dormitories appeared to not have played a major role in the evolution of the outbreak. \c\cOn 24 July, authorities announced that Germany would offer free voluntary coronavirus tests to all returning holidaymakers, with arrivals from designated high-risk countries – which at the time included 130 countries – being eligible for tests on the same day. Testing facilities would be set up at airports. \c\cOn 1 August, some 20,000 people protested in Berlin against the anti-pandemic measures. A large majority of participants ignored the mask and physical distancing requirements. In the late afternoon, police ordered demonstrators to leave the scene, on the grounds that organisers had failed to enforce coronavirus hygiene rules. The assembly leader was charged by police for this offence. Several local and federal politicians severely criticised the flouting of coronavirus rules, and considered the protesters\' demands to be starkly at odds with the severity of the crisis. Germany had recently logged an uptick in daily coronavirus cases. Police reported that 45 of its officers were injured, with three being hospitalised. In a survey by Forsa Institute published on 8 August, a large majority of 91 per cent of respondents rejected demonstrations against coronavirus restrictions such as the one on 1 August. \c\cAccording to a new regulation issued by Health Minister Jens Spahn that came in force on 8 August, travellers returning to Germany from designated high-risk countries are required to undergo a coronavirus test within three days of arrival, unless they are able to produce a recent negative test result when entering Germany. Previously on 1 August, free coronavirus testing had been offered to all returning travellers, and travellers from high-risk countries had been required to report to their local public health office already earlier. Testing facilities were made available at airports. \c\cOn 27 August, as numbers of daily infections rose to levels of April, Merkel and the state leaders agreed on a raft of measures, including a minimum fine of €50 for not wearing a mask in shops or on public transport (not implemented in Saxony-Anhalt as premier Reiner Haseloff pointed to low infection figures in the state). Additionally, free coronavirus tests for travellers returning to Germany from non-risk areas would be ended, while an aim was formulated that travellers returning from high-risk areas would be quarantined. No restrictions were placed on the number of people meeting at private gatherings; however, Merkel and the state leaders appealed to the public to "critically weigh" the risks associated with such events. \c\cOn 19 September, it was reported that Health Minister Spahn pushed for enactment of regulations for the distribution of future COVID-19 vaccines in Germany. Medical doctors, ethics experts and social scientists would participate in drafting such regulations, targeted to be completed by the end of October. Spahn had previously expressed his view that those with co-morbidities, the aged, and employees in the health sector should be offered prioritised access to such vaccines. \c\cOn 29 September, Chancellor Angela Merkel explained that the government's guidelines to tackle the virus, encapsulated in the acronym AHA, which stands for distancing, hygiene and masks, will be extended to become AHACL. The "C" stands for the coronavirus warning app introduced in June, and "L" for German or airing a room. "Regular impact ventilation in all private and public rooms can considerably reduce the danger of infection," the government's recommendation explained. \c\cEarly in the month, there was a sharp upturn in daily reported cases. On 8 October, 4,096 new cases were reported by the Robert Koch Institute, compared to 2,828 the day before. RKI President Lothar Wieler warned of the possibility of the number of daily cases exceeding 10,000 in the coming weeks, or of an uncontrolled spread occurring, but expressed his hopes that this could be averted. He said that experts saw larger outbreaks as well as numerous smaller ones throughout the country as contributing to the surge of cases. Health Minister Spahn urged Germans to assiduously follow the AHACL formula. He said that many of the recent cases were due to youths who were socially active without giving sufficient regard to the higher risks that the virus posed to the aged. \c\cOn 17 October, Chancellor Angela Merkel used her weekly podcast to urge German residents to "refrain from any trip that is not really necessary, any celebration that is not really necessary", and to stay at home "whenever possible". Head of the Chancellery Helge Braun spoke of an "enormous" need for contact tracers. \c\cAs of 31 October, the Bundeswehr had 3,200 soldiers participate in pandemic containment measures, \c\cprincipally in contact tracing, with plans to add a further 720 soldiers. The Bundeswehr confirmed it had a total contingent of 15,000 soldiers ready for deployment in the crisis. \c\cOn 21 October, Health Minister Spahn tested positive for the coronavirus and began self-isolation with cold-like symptoms.  \c\cOn 22 October, the RKI reported a record 11,287 infections, a sharp rise from the 7,595 cases reported on 21 October, RKI President Wieler called the situation "very serious". \c\cOn 28 October, as the number of new reported infections continued to rise and the established system of tracing of contacts of confirmed positive cases was no longer possible to maintain in Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel and the leaders of the 16 German states convened for an emergency video conference, after which they announced a partial lockdown, promoted by the government as "wave break", effective from 2–30 November. During the lockdown period, a maximum of ten people from at most two households would be allowed to meet; religious congregations and street protests would be subject to exemptions. Schools and kindergartens would remain open. Restaurants and cafes would only be able to sell takeaway food. Small firms would be able to access direct compensation based on their November 2019 revenue. \c\cOn 1 November, Spahn called for the public to prepare for "months of restrictions and abstinence". At a press conference on 2 November, Merkel also spoke of the need to "limit private contacts", saying that the measures were intended to create conditions for a "tolerable December". \c\cAhead of a meeting of Chancellor Merkel with the state ministers-presidents on 16 November, a draft proposal by the federal government surfaced which called for a universal mask requirement in schools including during breaks, as well as other measures. After strong resistance of the state chiefs, Merkel conceded to their demand to postpone any decision until a further meeting to be held the following week. \c\cOn 25 November, as it emerged that the lockdown had to date served to stabilise daily infection numbers but not reduced them, Chancellor Merkel and the leaders of the federal states agreed to an extension of the partial lockdown until at least 20 December. From 1 December, social gathering restrictions will be tightened to allow only private gatherings of at most five people from at most two different households, down from a previous limit of ten people, not counting children up to 14 years of age. This limit will be temporarily raised again to ten people for the period from 21 December 2020 until 1 January 2021, covering Christmas. Individual states are authorised to further tighten these restrictions in districts with more than 200 diagnosed infections per 100,000 residents in the past seven days. To reduce the transmission risk at Christmas gatherings, the start of school holidays was planned for 19 December. Retail outlets with more than 800 square metres of sales area will be required to leave 20 square metres of space for each customer, up from the previous requirement of 10. \c\cOn 27 November, the total number of reported infections since the start of the pandemic reached one million. \c\cOn 2 December, the countrywide lockdown was extended until 10 January. Berlin's governing mayor Michael Müller announced that the city would not relax the gathering rules. On 6 December, Bavarian premier Markus Söder announced that his state would likewise adopt stricter measures, including a nightly curfew from 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. in hotspots. Saxony, which had become the most afflicted German state, announced on 8 December that as its hospitals were "extremely burdened", it would impose a hard lockdown in which the Christmas break at schools, daycare centres and select shops would start early on 14 December. This and other recommendations were contained in a report by the German national science academy Leopoldina issued the same day. \c\cThe RKI raised its assessment of the level of danger to the health of the general population to "very high" on 11 December. \c\cOn 13 December, Chancellor Merkel and the state premiers agreed to a hard lockdown to be imposed from 16 December. Under the new regulations, schools will be closed. During the Christmas period from 24 to 26 December, social gathering rules will be relaxed to allowing one household to invite a maximum of four close family members from other households. New Year events would be banned, as would be drinking of alcohol in public places for the whole lockdown period. The latter measure ended the operations of pop-up Glühwein (mulled wine) shops, which had previously acted as a substitute for the cancelled Christmas markets in Cologne but had also drawn sharp criticism for undermining social distancing restrictions. \c\cThe first case of a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that had originated in the United Kingdom, and which appeared to be considerably more transmissible than the original virus, was confirmed by authorities on 24 December. It was detected in a woman who had been travelling by plane from London to Frankfurt. \c\cAt a videoconference of Chancellor Merkel with the 16 state premiers on 5 January, the lockdown was extended by three weeks until 31 January. The high number of daily infections – far above the levels allowing contact tracing – and a worryingly large number of coronavirus-related deaths were given as reasons; additionally, the uncertainties surrounding the more infectious variant of the virus originating in the United Kingdom, of which the first case had been detected in Germany on 24 December. The government also announced a toughening of physical distancing requirements, with people only being able to meet with one other person outside their own household. In districts with more than 200 infections per 100,000 inhabitants over the past seven days, people would be restricted to travel a maximum of 15 kilometres from their place of residence, unless they had a good reason for travelling further. One rationale for the latter measure had been reports of day trippers thronging popular winter destinations. \c\cThe first case in Germany of the South African COVID-19 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was confirmed by authorities on 12 January in a man returning with his family from a long-term stay in South Africa. Like the mutation originally detected in the United Kingdom, it appeared to be more transmissible than the original strain of the virus. It had not yet been ascertained if other family members, who had tested positive only after having tested negative at the time of their arrival in Germany, had also acquired the variant. \c\cIn an interview on 12 January with Deutschlandfunk, epidemiologist Krause urged for a massive step-up of the protection of residents of nursing homes and geriatric clinics in order to prevent a large number of deaths. \c\cOn 19 January, Merkel and the 16 state governors agreed to extend the lockdown until 14 February, and toughened it by a new requirement to wear filter masks such as FFP2 respirators. Employers are required, wherever possible, to allow employees to work from home – popularly known in Germany as the pseudo-anglicism "Homeoffice" – until 15 March. \c\cOn 21 January, an analysis by the Berlin Charité hospital of a coronavirus sample from a patient in a recent outbreak in Garmisch-Partenkirchen was published. The report said that, contrary to initial concerns, the sample did not show a new mutation, but rather a variant of the virus that had first been detected in March 2020. Up to the time of the report, 66 patients and staff at a hospital in Germisch-Partenkirchen had tested positive for that variant. \c\cThe first case in Germany of the Brazilian variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was confirmed by authorities on 22 January in a traveler who had arrived at Frankfurt airport from Brazil one day earlier. He showed no symptoms. Also on 22 January, the total death toll in Germany crossed the 50,000 mark, according to the Robert Koch Institute. \c\cAmidst concerns about coronavirus variants spreading in Germany, authorities on 29 January released a regulation under which – with exceptions including for those having the right to reside in Germany, as well as for those travelling in relation to urgent medical transports or for humanitarian reasons – an entry ban was imposed for travellers from "countries designated as regions with variants". The countries included were the United Kingdom, Ireland, Brazil, Portugal and South Africa, starting from 30 January, with Lesotho and Eswatini to follow on 31 January. The restrictions were set to run until 17 February. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer had said a few days earlier that the German government was mulling plans to drastically reduce air travel. \c\cThe RKI reported that the seven-day incidence had dropped to 48 in the city of Munich. Mayor Dieter Reiter nevertheless stated that only if the value could be kept below the threshold of 50 over the coming week would there be grounds to discuss relaxation of the lockdown restrictions for the city. \c\cOn 10 February, Merkel and the heads of the German states agreed on extending the lockdown until 7 March, with hairdressers to be allowed to reopen on 1 March under strict conditions. Schools and daycare centres were agreed to be "the first to gradually reopen", with the decision on the timing and the modalities left to individual states. In view of the mutations of the virus, it was agreed that the relaxation of the restrictions would be discussed only after the seven-day incidence had dropped to below 35, rather than the threshold of 50 which had been in place since May 2020. \c\cOn 12 February, Health Minister Spahn announced that Germany would unilaterally close its borders to neighouring countries Czechia and Austrian province Tyrol, citing concerns about coronavirus variants. Exceptions were made for truck drivers and other essential professions, subject to a negative coronavirus test taken at most 48 hours prior to crossing the border.  The European Commission wrote an official complaint letter to Germany – along with Hungary, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland –, calling for less restrictive measures. On 23 February, Minister of State Michael Roth rejected the criticism, saying that the measure did align with the Schengen Agreement. \c\cOn 3 March, the German government and the state ministers agreed on a five-step exit plan for the gradual re-opening of businesses and leisure facilities, where each additional step of relaxation was made contingent on the seven-day incidence not exceeding the value of 50 in the relevant region or state for the preceding 14 days. The first step, consisting in the discretionary opening of some school classes, daycares, and hairdressers, had already taken place on 1 March. The plan included an "emergency brake" to return to current lockdown measures, should the seven-day incidence in a region stay above the value of 100 over three consecutive days. \c\cGerman discounter chain Aldi offered COVID-19 self-tests in its shops from 6 March; they sold out rapidly in some shops, as did those sold online by competitor Lidl. \c\cFrom 8 March, the government footed the bill for one weekly rapid test per resident, to be administered by trained personnel. On 16 February, Health Minister Spahn had given a projected starting date of 1 March. \c\cOn 10 March, RKI President Wieler said, referring to the recent increase in daily case numbers, that there were "clear signs" that the third wave of the pandemic had already begun. \c\cFrom 15 March until 18 March, Germany temporarily suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine "as a precaution" according to the Health Ministry, and on 30 March restricted its use in patients under the age of 60 years (see section Vaccination below). \c\cOn 24 March, the partial lockdown was extended until at least 18 April 2021. In a step that was considered highly unusual, Merkel withdrew her plan of a five-day period of shop closure beginning 1 April and no physical church services. \c\cOn 30 March, Interior Minister Seehofer announced that border controls for entries from South Tyrol had been scrapped, while those from the Czech Republic would remain in place for another two weeks. The compulsory coronavirus testing and quarantine requirements were to stay in place for the same period in both cases. \c\cOn 9 April, it was announced that Chancellor Merkel was planning to transfer powers from individual states to the federal level over the pandemic response, through amending the Infection Protection Act. This was specifically to unify the response in the case of high case incidences, which up to that time was a matter of the states. The same day, a meeting of Merkel with state premiers that had been scheduled for 12 April was announced to have been cancelled. The cabinet agreed on the amendments on 13 April; the Bundestag (parliament) decided however not to waive the deliberation period. The first reading in the Bundestag was scheduled for 16 April and the voting for 21 April. \c\cThe amendments contained a range of measures to be taken, at the level of districts or cities (not states), in case of the seven-day incidence exceeding the threshold of 100 on three consecutive days. Besides contact restrictions, the measures included a curfew between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. the following day, with exceptions such as for traveling to work, caring for children and the elderly, and animal care. Daycare centres would close and schools suspend classroom teaching, with possible exceptions, if the incidence exceeded the threshold of 200. \c\cIn an open letter, the leaders of the Society for Aerosol Research criticised measures that focus on restricting outdoor activity. They said protection against infection must take place above all where people spend time indoors, because "the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses takes place almost without exception indoors." Afterwards, the planned curfew conditions were relaxed to starting an hour later, at 10:00 p.m, and allowing individual walks and individual sports until midnight. \c\cOn 14 April, the German physicians\' union Marburger Bund called for a faster enactment of the measures, which were commonly referred to as Corona-Notbremse ("corona emergency brake"). Its head said that the amendments were already late, and that any later enactment would risk the situation in hospitals to get out of control. FDP party deputy leader Wolfgang Kubicki said on 20 April that his party was contemplating legal measures against curfews, which it deemed to be disproportionate. \c\cA national mourning day for the nearly 80,000 fatalities of the coronavirus in Germany was held on 18 April. President Steinmeier and Chancellor Merkel attended a memorial service at Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the morning. \c\cOn 9 November 2020, the German vaccination commission STIKO, an independent advisory group which is part of the RKI, published a position paper jointly with the German Ethics Council and the Leopoldina Academy of Sciences on how access to a future COVID-19 vaccine should be regulated, given that sufficient quantities of such a vaccine would not immediately be available to everybody willing to undergo vaccination. The document highlighted the need to comply with medical, legal and ethical principles, and urged for the prioritisation scheme to be made transparent to the public. \c\cOn 18 December, Health Minister Spahn unveiled the government vaccination plan at a press conference. He warned that "we will have to live with this virus for a long time yet." The plan deviated from a STIKO proposal published the previous day in that it subdivided the population into three groups, instead of five as proposed by STIKO; and it allowed for priorisation within each of the groups, which Spahn defended against criticism from general practitioners and police as "allow[ing] a certain flexibility on the ground". \c\cThe first 9,750 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were delivered to Germany's 16 states on 26 December. The state of Saxony-Anhalt started vaccinations the same day, one day before the official start. The first to receive the vaccine were German residents over the age of 80, as well as caregivers and hospital staff who were considered to be at particular risk. \c\cA first batch of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, of about 63,000 doses, arrived in Lower Saxony on 11 January 2021. \c\cBy early January 2021, criticism was mounting over the slow progress of the vaccination program. The government tasked the RKI with investigating if, as in other countries, the second jab could be postponed. On 8 January, the German Health Ministry announced that regulators of the European Medicines Agency had approved the extraction of six, instead of five, doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from each vial, and that this practice would be immediately adopted in Germany. \c\cProduction issues hampered the rollout of vaccines in the European Union and consequently also in Germany, as the country had ordered its vaccines through the bloc. On 22 January, it transpired that AstraZeneca would, after the expected approval of its vaccine by the European Union on 29 January, only be able to deliver 31 million doses, instead of the agreed 80 million doses. There were also difficulties reported with the delivery of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. AstraZeneca said on 31 January that it would supply 9 million additional doses during the first quarter, while BioNTech said that its new production plant in Marburg would allow them to increase their supply to the European Union from the initially planned 1.3 billion to 2 billion. \c\cOn 3 February, Spahn said that he expected that citizens would be able to choose between the three EU-approved vaccines in a few months. He flagged that the Russian Sputnik V vaccine could be produced in Germany, which could thus take a supportive role before EU approval; a recent study had shown a high efficacy of the Sputnik V vaccine. Spahn had said in late January that Germany would be open to the adoption of vaccines from Russia and China after EU approval, provided that they were safe and effective. \c\cBy 10 February, the number of second vaccinations – two vaccinations being necessary for each of the three vaccines approved as of that date – had risen to above 1.1 million, comprising about 1.32 per cent of the population. Difficulties with vaccine delivery had prompted authorities to retain vaccines for use in the second vaccination and consequently, a decrease in the daily number of first vaccinations. \c\cBy 15 March, 6,507,159 people have been given the first dose of the vaccine. \c\cOn 15 March, Germany temporarily suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine "as a precaution" according to the Health Ministry, with Health Minister Spahn saying that the risk of blood clots developing after administration of the vaccine was low but could not be ruled out. While the German Medical Association supported the decision, others including epidemiologist Karl Lauterbach criticized it. Vaccinations with AstraZeneca resumed on 19 March after the European Medicines Agency deemed the vaccine "safe and effective". \c\cOn 30 March, on recommendations of Germany's vaccine panel, the use of AstraZeneca was restricted to patients 60 and older, except for patients for whom a COVID-19 infection was expected to pose a high risk, and who additionally had agreed to take the vaccine despite the small risk of serious side-effect. \c\cOn 8 April, following a meeting with his European Union counterparts the previous day, Spahn said that as the European Commission was not intending to buy the Sputnik V vaccine for the entire bloc, Germany would enter exclusive negotiations with Russia, in spite of an agreement of the bloc in early 2021 to shun exclusive negotiations with suppliers. The state of Bavaria had already signed a letter of intent to buy up to 2.5 million doses, and planned to manufacture the vaccine in Illertissen. Any purchases would be subject to approval from the European Medicines Agency. \c\cOn 25 January 2021, the Health Ministry announced that Germany had bought 200,000 doses of experimental antibody cocktails for €400 million, to be administered at university hospitals only, and to be used only on high-risk patients at an early stage of the illness. The drugs, Bamlanivimab and REGN-COV-2, had been used on US President Donald Trump after he caught the virus in October 2020. The use of the drugs, which had not received approval by the European Medicines Agency, was permitted under a compassionate use clause. \c\cGermany officially entered a recession given that its economy contracted 2.2% during the first quarter of 2020. \c\cAs of 1 April, almost half a million companies in Germany had sent their workers on a government-subsidized short-time working scheme known as Kurzarbeit. The German short-time work compensation scheme is similar to schemes in France and Britain. \c\cOn 8 April, Germany reverted a travel ban for seasonal agricultural workers, allowing 80,000 Eastern Europeans to enter between April and May to harvest seasonal foods. \c\cIn a press release from 29 April, the Federal Government predicted that gross domestic product to decline by 6.3 per cent in 2020, \c\cwith the sharpest drop in economic output, and the peak in Kurzarbeit short-time working, occurring in the second quarter. \c\cOn 22 May, in an article published in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the German Council of Economic Experts stated its views on the design of the planned coronavirus recovery package. In particular, it weighed in on the debate about whether the recovery package should include a higher cash incentive for buying electric cars, a plan which the Merkel government had favoured. The Council recommended against any sector specific aid measures, and advocated focusing on investments in education and infrastructure, lowering the cost of energy, and allowing companies to balance losses with gains from previous and expected gains for future years. \c\cOn 3 June, the Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) announced that the jobless figure in Germany had risen in May to 2.813 million, a year-on-year increase of 577,000, bringing the unemployment rate to 6.1 per cent. In his analysis, BA director Detlef Scheele stated that even though the coronavirus crisis had hit the labour market with unprecedented severity, it was coping reasonably well in his opinion. \c\cAccording to the Federal Statistical Office, exports dropped in April by 31 per cent compared to the previous year, which was unprecedented since 1950, when trade balance statistics began to be collected. \c\cOn 29 June, the German parliament passed the €130 billion stimulus package that had been adopted by the government on 12 June. Actions include a temporary reduction in VAT until the end of 2020, and a bonus for families with children amounting to €300 per child, to be paid in two instalments of €150 in September and October 2020. \c\cOn 8 July 2020, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier announced the release of non-repayable bridging funds for medium-sized companies with annual turnover not exceeding €750 million which have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The amount of aid depends on revenue lost, and on the number of employees. Companies have to apply for the funds through their tax advisors or auditors, a step that was intended to safeguard from abuse of the scheme, also in view of evidence that aid that had been made available at the beginning of the crisis had been misused. On occasion of presenting the scheme, Altmaier stated that he expected some sectors of the economy to return to a phase of growth from October 2020. \c\cIn late August 2020, the Federal Statistical Office reported a decrease in gross domestic product of 9.7% in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the first. This was attributed to the collapse in exports as well as health protection measures during the pandemic; the latter had shut down whole industries such as those related to conferences and concerts. Economists expected a rebounding of the economy in the third quarter due to the easing of coronavirus related restrictions, but saw the possibility of a second wave of infections hanging as a threat over those predictions. \c\cTo mitigate the impact of the second lockdown from November 2020 on businesses, the self-employed, and associations and institutions who were required to close, the German government introduced an "umbrella" scheme, initially with an estimated budget of €30 billion. The scheme, termed Novemberhilfe (November aid), received approval under the Temporary Framework of the European Commission. With the lockdown continuing into January 2021, further aid was made available under new schemes. As with the Novemberhilfe and the measures earlier agreed in July 2021, companies were usually required to lodge applications for these funds through tax advisors or auditors. The complex and changing rules for eligibility for funding led to complaints by these professions that they were overburdened. \c\cBased on preliminary calculations, the Federal Statistical Office reported on 14 January 2021 that the gross domestic product had shrunk by 5.0 per cent in 2020 as compared to the previous year. While price-adjusted private consumption had shrunk by a record 6.0 per cent, this had been partly offset by a government consumption increase of 3.4 per cent, in which the purchase of protective equipment and hospital costs had played a role. For the first time since 2011, Germany recorded a budget deficit, which at 4.8 per cent was second only to that of 1995, when the debts of the Treuhand were transferred to the federal budget. \c\cIn March 2021, the Karlsruhe social court ruled that a one-off payout of €150 to adult recipients of basic social income (commonly known in Germany as Hartz IV) eligible as of May 2021, was unconstitutional. The payout had been agreed upon in February by the ruling CDU/CSU and SPD coalition as a support measure in the pandemic. The court said that an increase of about €100 for each month of the pandemic was necessary. \c\cOn 26 March, the Federal Constitutional Court stopped a German law for the roll-out of an aid package totalling €750 billion that had been agreed by the European Council in summer 2020. The legal challenge had been mounted by Bernd Lucke and others, who rejected the repayment of debts in the name of all EU countries jointly. The European Commission expressed optimism that the package could still be rolled out from the end of June 2021 as planned. On 24 April, the court rejected the legal challenge. The main court proceedings were still pending. \c\cAccording to a study by the Cologne Institute for Economic Research whose results were published on 20 April, private consumption had dropped in 2020 by 6.1 per cent, the largest amount in 70 years, translating to €1,250 per capita. The drop was ascribed to an increased savings ratio and lower incomes during the pandemic. \c\cOn 31 March, city-county Jena, Thuringia, was the first large German city to introduce an obligation to wear masks, or makeshift masks including scarves, in supermarkets, public transport, and buildings with public traffic, from 6 April, very successfully. On 2 April, the Robert Koch Institute, the federal epidemic authority, changed its previous recommendation that only people with symptoms should wear masks to also include people without symptoms. The district of Nordhausen, Thuringia, followed the example of Jena, with effect from 14 April, the city of Erfurt on 22 April. \c\cGerman chancellor Merkel and state governors first gave "strong advice" to wear face masks in public starting 20 April. Saxony made it mandatory from that day, Saxony-Anhalt followed starting 23 April and (the rest of) Thurinigia starting 24 April, then finally the governors agreed to make it mandatory, so most other states followed starting 27 April, except Schleswig-Holstein, which introduced requirements starting 29 April, and Berlin, where shops were initially excluded but were then included starting 29 April. \c\cAs of 24 April, most German states had no penalties for not wearing a mask. However, not wearing masks in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania can result in a €25 fine, in Hesse a €50 fine, and in Bavaria, not wearing a face mask while on public transportation or in a shop can result in a €150 fine for first-time offenders. There are exceptions for mask wearing for young children, severely disabled persons, or with those with respiratory diseases such as asthma. \c\cIn March 2020, car manufacturers announced donations of several hundred thousand masks to hospitals, and health authorities. Daimler donated 110,000 masks of their pandemic protection reserve and BMW donated 100,000 breathing masks. Volkswagen announced a donation of 200,000 masks of FFP-2 and FFP-3 types and were looking into manufacturing medical equipment parts. On 8 April, the CEO of BMW, Oliver Zipse, announced the production of FFP2 masks both for the general public and for its workers with a target of hundred of thousands of masks each day, together with the donation to Bavaria of two million simpler masks within the following two weeks. \c\cOn 28 March, more than three million protective masks bought by Volkswagen arrived at Frankfurt airport from Shanghai. They were the first shipment of a larger donation of medical equipment worth 40 million euros which were brought to hospitals and federal agencies in Hesse and Lower Saxony. \c\cOn 30 March, Deutsche Bank donated 375,000 surgical masks that they had acquired during the SARS epidemic. \c\cIn April, a German company placed an online order for 10 million masks, valued at €15 million, to a fraudulently cloned website of a Dutch supply company. Irish Garda Síochána and Dutch authorities recovered €880,000 from a Dutch account and €498,000 from a Nigerian account, both tied to the scam. \c\cOn 3 April, Berlin's Senator of the Interior Andreas Geisel accused the United States agents of appropriating a shipment of 200,000 3M-made face masks meant for Berlin police from the airport in Bangkok. Andreas Geisel considered it an "act of modern piracy", SPD acting chairman Rolf Mützenich asked for an investigation and a response from the government, and Berlin mayor Michael Müller blamed Trump for it and called it "inhuman and unacceptable". However, these claims were rejected by 3M officials, who stated that they have "no records of an order for respiratory masks from China for the Berlin police" and Berlin police later admitted the shipment was not seized by U.S. authorities, but was believed to have been bought at a better price, possibly by a German merchant or China. As a result, Berlin opposition member Burkard Dregger accused the Berlin senate of deception for the purpose of covering up their failure to provide the masks. Politico Europe reported that "the Berliners are taking a page straight out of the Trump playbook and not letting facts get in the way of a good story."\c\cGerman officials reported that U.S. buyers were paying far above the market price and were outbidding European buyers for masks. \c\cIn early March 2021, members of the German parliament Nikolas Löbel and Georg Nüßlein resigned from the ruling CDU/CSU party over a scandal that had broken about them having allegedly earned six-figure sums from brokering sales contracts for face masks. Löbel also resigned from the parliament. Later de:Alfred Sauter, a lawmaker in the Bavarian state parliament, was embroiled in the same scandal and resigned from the CSU. The scandal (which came to be known as Maskenaffäre, "mask affair" in Germany) led to a public discussion on transparency and ethics. In response to the scandal, the CDU/CSU party released on 15 March tightened rules for such dealings. The previous day, it had performed poorly at two state elections, which observers saw as being connected to the loss in popularity due to the scandal. 
The Uyghur genocide is the ongoing series of human rights abuses perpetrated by the Chinese government against the Uyghur people and other ethnic and religious minorities in and around the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of the People's Republic of China. Since 2014, the Chinese government, under the direction of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the administration of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, has pursued policies leading to more than one million Muslims (the majority of them Uyghurs) being held in secretive internment camps without any legal process in what has become the largest-scale and most systematic detention of ethnic and religious minorities since the Holocaust. Thousands of mosques have been destroyed or damaged, and hundreds of thousands of children have been sent to boarding schools. \c\cCritics of the policy have described it as the forced assimilation of Xinjiang and have called it an ethnocide or cultural genocide, while some governments, activists, independent NGOs, human rights experts, academics, government officials, and the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile have called it a genocide. \c\cIn particular, critics have highlighted the concentration of Uyghurs in state-sponsored internment camps, suppression of Uyghur religious practices, political indoctrination, severe ill-treatment, as well as extensive evidence and other testimonials detailing human rights abuses including forced sterilization, contraception, abortion, and infanticides. Chinese government statistics show that from 2015 to 2018, birth rates in the mostly Uyghur regions of Hotan and Kashgar fell by more than 60%. In the same period, the birth rate of the whole country decreased by 9.69%, from 12.07 to 10.9 per 1,000 people. Chinese authorities acknowledged that birth rates dropped by almost a third in 2018 in Xinjiang, but denied reports of forced sterilization and genocide. Birth rates have continued to plummet in Xinjiang, falling nearly 24% in 2019 alone when compared to just 4.2% nationwide. \c\cInternational reactions have been mixed, with dozens of United Nations (UN) member states issuing opposing letters to the United Nations Human Rights Council in support and condemnation of China's policies in Xinjiang in 2020. In December 2020, the International Criminal Court declined to take investigative action against China on the basis of not having jurisdiction over China for most of the alleged crimes. The United States was the first country to declare the human rights abuses a genocide, announcing its determination on January 19, 2021, although the US State Department's Office of the Legal Adviser concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove genocide. This was followed by Canada's House of Commons and the Dutch parliament each passing a non-binding motion in February 2021 to recognize China's actions as genocide. \c\cThe 1980s were a period of developing support for minority languages; the Chinese government was providing various writing platforms and creating multiple language materials to accommodate the minority population, which included Uyghurs. The Uyghur language has around 10 million speakers, and the language is shared with other minority groups in the region. \c\cIn 1984, some of the essential laws to date were put in place; the Chinese nationality law, which grants all citizens—regardless of linguistic background—the right to take legal action with their language and supports the development of different minority cultural literature and historic preservation. \c\cIn the early years, national minority identification was seen as essential to national development despite the condescension these minorities face; negative perceptions towards minority languages led to negative stereotypes about the Uyghurs. Also, Standard Mandarin Chinese was required to establish national solidarity, at the expense of other varieties of Chinese and other languages. \c\cHistorically, various Chinese dynasties have exerted control over parts of modern-day Xinjiang. The region came under modern Chinese rule as a result of the westward expansion of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty during the 1700s, which also saw the conquests of Tibet and Mongolia. \c\cAfter the 1928 assassination of Yang Zengxin, the governor of the semi-autonomous Kumul Khanate in east Xinjiang under the Republic of China, Jin Shuren, succeeded Yang as the governor of the Khanate. On the death of the Kamul Khan Maqsud Shah in 1930, Jin entirely abolished the Khanate and took control of the region as a warlord. In 1933, the breakaway First East Turkestan Republic was established in the Kumul Rebellion. In 1934, the First Turkestan Republic was conquered by warlord Sheng Shicai with the aid of the Soviet Union before Sheng reconciled with the Republic of China in 1942. In 1944, the Ili Rebellion led to the establishment of the Second East Turkestan Republic which depended on the "tacit consent" of the Soviet Union for trade, arms, and its continued existence until it was absorbed into the People's Republic of China in 1949. \c\cFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, the Chinese government sponsored a mass migration of Han Chinese to the region and introduced several policies that were designed to suppress the cultural identity and religion of the Uyghurs. During this period, several Uyghur independence organizations emerged with potential support from the Soviet Union, with the East Turkestan People's Party being the largest organization in 1968. During the 1970s, the Soviets supported the United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan (URFET) to fight the Chinese. \c\cIn 1997, a police roundup and the execution of 30 suspected "separatists" during Ramadan led to large demonstrations in February 1997 which resulted in the Ghulja incident, a People's Liberation Army (PLA) crackdown on protesters which resulted in at least nine deaths. The Ürümqi bus bombings later that month killed nine people and injured 68 and the responsibility for them was claimed by Uyghur exile groups. In March 1997, a bus bomb killed two people with responsibility claimed by Uyghur separatists and the Turkey-based Organisation for East Turkistan Freedom. \c\cIn July 2009, riots broke out in Xinjiang in response to a violent dispute between Uyghur and Han Chinese workers in a factory which resulted in over one hundred deaths. Following the riots, Uyghur terrorists killed dozens of Han Chinese in coordinated attacks from 2009 to 2016. These included the August 2009 syringe attacks, the 2011 bomb-and-knife attack in Hotan, the March 2014 knife attack in the Kunming railway station, the April 2014 bomb-and-knife attack in the Ürümqi railway station, and the May 2014 car-and-bomb attack in an Ürümqi street market. The attacks were conducted by Uyghur separatists, with some orchestrated by the UN-designated terrorist organization Turkistan Islamic Party (formerly the East Turkistan Islamic Movement). \c\cDuring the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics the Chinese state became obsessed with weiwen (stability maintenance) which led to an intensification of repression across the country. Some within the Party warned that increased action to combat instability which might not even exist could lead to a spiral of repression and unrest. \c\cIn April 2010, after the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, Zhang Chunxian replaced the former CCP secretary Wang Lequan, who had been behind religious policies in Xinjiang for 14 years. Following the unrest party theorists began to call for implementing a more monocultural society with a single “state-race” which would allow China to become “a new type of superpower.” Policies to further this goal were first implemented by Zhang Chunxian. Following an attack in Yunnan Province Xi Jinping told the politburo “We should unite the people to build a copper and iron wall against terrorism,” and “Make terrorists like rats scurrying across the street, with everybody shouting, ‘Beat them!’” In April 2014 Xi traveled to Xinjiang and told police in Kashgar that “We must be as harsh as them, and show absolutely no mercy.” A suicide bombing occurred in Ürümqi on the last day of his visit. \c\cIn 2014 a secret meeting of Communist Party leadership was held in Beijing to find a solution to the problem, the plan they decided on would become known as the Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism. In May 2014, China publicly launched the "Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism" in Xinjiang in response to growing tensions between the Han Chinese and the Uyghur populations of Xinjiang. In announcing the campaign, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping stated that "practice has proved that our party's ruling strategy in Xinjiang is correct and must be maintained in the long run."\c\cIn 2016 there was a brief window of opportunity for Uyghurs with passports to flee abroad, many did so but had to leave relatives and children without passports behind. Many of these families have not been reunited. \c\cFollowing guidance from Beijing Party leadership in Xinjiang commenced a “People's War” against the “Three Evil Forces” of separatism, terrorism, and extremism. They deployed two hundred thousand party cadres to Xinjiang and the launched the Civil Servant-Family Pair Up program. Xi was dissatisfied with the initial results of the People's War and replaced Zhang Chunxian with Chen Quanguo in 2016. Following his appointment Chen oversaw the recruitment of tens of thousands of additional police officers and the division of society into three categories: trusted, average, untrustworthy. He instructed his subordinated to “Take this crackdown as the top project,” and “to preëmpt the enemy, to strike at the outset.”\c\cFollowing a meeting with Xi in Beijing Chen Quanguo held a rally in Ürümqi with ten thousand troops, helicopters, and armored vehicles. As they paraded he announced a “smashing, obliterating offensive,” and declared that they would “bury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the People’s War.” He ordered them to “Round up everyone who should be rounded up,” and by April 2017 mass arrests had begun. \c\cNew bans and regulations were implemented on April 1, 2017. Abnormally long beards and the wearing of veils in public were both banned. Not watching state-run television or listening to radio broadcasts, refusing to abide by family planning policies, or refusing to allow one's children to attend state-run schools were all prohibited. \c\cAlleged "re-education" efforts began in 2014 and were expanded in 2017. Chen ordered that the camps “be managed like the military and defended like a prison.” At this time, internment camps were built for the housing of students of the "re-education" programs, most of whom are Uyghurs. The Chinese government did not acknowledge their existence until 2018 and called them "vocational education and training centers." This name was changed to "vocational training centers" in 2019. The camps tripled in size from 2018 to 2019 despite the Chinese government stating that most of the detainees had been released. \c\cIn 2017 China's Ministry of Public Security began procure race-based monitoring systems which could reportedly identify whether or not an individual was Uyghur. Despite its questionable accuracy this allowed an “Uyghur alarm” to be added to surveillance systems. Enhanced border controls were also implemented with guilt being presumed in the absence of evidence, according to Zhu Hailun “If suspected terrorism cannot be ruled out, then a border control should be implemented to insure the person’s arrest.”\c\cIn 2017, 73% of foreign journalists in China reported being restricted or prohibited from reporting in Xinjiang, up from 42% in 2016. \c\cThe Chinese government has engaged in a propaganda campaign to defend its actions in Xinjiang. \c\cChina initially denied the existence of the Xinjiang internment camps. In 2018, after being forced to admit that the Xinjiang internment camps exist, the Chinese government initiated a propaganda campaign to portray the camps as humane and to deny human rights abuses occur in Xinjiang. \c\cThe Chinese government has used social media as a part of its extensive propaganda campaign. China has spent heavily to purchase Facebook advertisements in order to spread propaganda designed to incite doubt on the existence and scope of human rights violations occurring within Xinjiang. Douyin, the mainland Chinese sister app to ByteDance-owned social media app TikTok, presents users with significant amounts Chinese state propaganda pertaining to the human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Between July 2019 and early August 2019, CCP-owned tabloid The Global Times paid Twitter to promote tweets that deny that the Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang; Twitter later banned advertising from state-controlled media outlets on 19 August after removing large numbers of pro-Beijing bots from the social network. \c\cChina has responded to allegations of abuse by women imprisoned in the camp system by mounting explicit attacks on their credibility and character. Instead of directly refuting their accusations Chinese authorities have instead tried to discredit them. Authorities have disclosed what they state is confidential medical information, for instance about one women's fertility and another's STD status, as well as personal information, such as the alleged infidelity of one witness, in order to show that the women where of bad character which in the Authority's view would invalidate their testimonies. They impugned one witness by stating that “Everyone knows about her inferior character. She’s lazy and likes comfort, her private life is chaotic, her neighbours say that she committed adultery while in China.” The released personal information does not in general appear to contradict the testimonies of the witnesses. However, according to the Chinese government “some anti-China forces ignore facts and truth and wantonly fabricate all kinds of Xinjiang-related lies. People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, including Xinjiang women, live and work in peace and contentment.”\c\cPresentations given by Chinese authorities in an attempt to dispel the allegations of abuse are closed to foreign journalists and feature pre-recorded questions as well as pre-recorded monologues from people in Xinjiang including relatives of witnesses. These efforts to discredit witnesses have been contributed to by both the Xinjiang's publicity department and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \c\cChinese government propaganda attacks have targeted international journalists covering human rights abuses in Xinjiang. After providing coverage critical of Chinese government abuses in Xinjiang, BBC News reporter John Sudworth was made subject to a campaign of propaganda and harassment by Chinese state-affiliated and CCP-affiliated media. Public attacks against Sudworth and his family led them to flee China for Taiwan for fear of their safety. Sudworth is married to Yvonne Murray who reports for Raidió Teilifís Éireann. \c\cIn April 2021, the Chinese government released propaganda videos titled, "Xinjiang is a Wonderful Land", and produced a musical titled "The Wings of Songs" in order to portray Xinjiang as harmonious and peaceful. The Wings of Songs portrays an idyllic rural landscape with a cohesive ethnic population notably devoid of repression, surveillance, and Islam. \c\cChina has used the global "war on terror" of the 2000s to frame "separatist" and ethnic unrest as acts of Islamist terrorism to legitimize its policies in Xinjiang. \c\cIn December 2015, the Associated Press reported that China had effectively expelled Ursula Gauthier, a French journalist, "for questioning the official line equating ethnic violence in the western Muslim region with global terrorism." Gauthier, who was the first foreign journalist forced to leave China since 2012, was subject to what the AP described as an "abusive and intimidating campaign" by Chinese state media that accused her of "having hurt the feelings of the Chinese people" and that a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman accused her of emboldening terrorism. \c\cIn August 2018, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination decried the "broad definition of terrorism and vague references to extremism" used by Chinese legislation, noting that there were numerous reports of detention of large numbers of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities on the "pretext of countering terrorism". \c\cIn 2019, the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, Sam Brownback, and Nathan Sales have each said that the Chinese government consistently misuses "counterterrorism" as a pretext for cultural suppression and human rights abuses. \c\cIn 2021 Shirzat Bawudun, the former head of the Xinjiang department of justice, and Sattar Sawut, the former head of the Xinjiang education department, were sentenced to death on terrorism and extremism charges. Three other educators and two textbook editors were given lesser sentences. \c\cMosques, Muslim shrines, and cemeteries in Xinjiang have been the target of systematic destruction. An estimated 16,000 mosques have been destroyed or damaged, minarets have been knocked down and "decorative features scrubbed away or painted over". \c\cIn 2005, Human Rights Watch reported that "information scattered in official sources suggests that retaliation" against mosques not sponsored by the Chinese state was prevalent and that the Xinjiang Party Secretary expressed that Uyghurs "should not have to build new places for religious activities." The Chinese government prohibited minors from participating in religious activities in Xinjiang in a manner that, according to Human Rights Watch, "has no basis in Chinese law."\c\cAccording to an analysis from The Guardian, over one-third of mosques and religious sites in China suffered "significant structural damage" between 2016 and 2018, with nearly one-sixth of all mosques and shrines completely razed. This included the tomb of Imam Asim, a mud tomb in the Taklamakan Desert, and the Ordam shrine at the mazar of Ali Arslan Khan. According to The Guardian, Uyghur Muslims believe that repeated pilgrimages to these tombs would fulfill a Muslim's obligation to complete the Hajj. \c\cId Kah Mosque is the largest mosque in Xinjiang and the largest in China. Radio Free Asia, a United States government-funded, nonprofit international broadcasting corporation, reported that in 2018, a plaque containing Quranic scriptures, that had long hung outside the front entrance of the mosque, had been removed by the authorities. Turghunjan Alawudun, director of the World Uyghur Congress, told Radio Free Asia that the plaque was removed as "one aspect of the Chinese regime’s evil policies meant to eliminate the Islamic faith among Uyghurs... and Uyghurs themselves." In 2019, Bellingcat reported that "there is systematic repression and imprisonment of the Muslim Uighur minority in Xinjiang, and the destruction of cultural and religiously significant Islamic buildings in this province may be a further part of this ongoing repression." As of 2020, Kashgar no longer had any working mosques; the Id Kah mosque had been transformed from a functioning mosque into a tourist attraction. \c\cIn 2011, schools in Xinjiang transitioned to what officials call a policy of bilingual education. The primary medium of instruction is now Mandarin Chinese, with only a few hours a week devoted to Uyghur literature. Despite this emphasis on bilingual education, few Han children are taught to speak Uyghur. \c\cUyghur students are also increasingly being sent to residential schools far from their home communities where they cannot speak Uyghur. According to a 2020 report from Radio Free Asia, monolingual Mandarin Chinese education has been introduced in an influential high school in Kashgar which formerly provided bilingual education. \c\cSayragul Sauytbay, an ethnic Kazakh teacher who later fled China, described how she was forced to teach at an internment camp, saying the camp was "cramped and unhygienic" with her detainee students given only basic sustenance. Sauytbay added that authorities forced the detainees to learn Chinese, sit through indoctrination classes, and make public confessions. Furthermore, she mentioned that rape and torture were commonplace and that authorities forced detainees to take a particular medicine that left some individuals sterile or cognitively impaired. \c\cIn 2021 the standard Uyghur language textbooks used in Xinjiang since the early 2000s were outlawed and their authors and editors sentenced to death or life imprisonment on separatism charges. The textbooks had been created and approved by relevant government officials, however according to the AP in 2021 the Chinese government said that the "2003 and 2009 editions of the textbooks contained 84 passages preaching ethnic separatism, violence, terrorism and religious extremism and that several people were inspired by the books to participate in a bloody anti-government riot in the regional capital Urumqi in 2009.”\c\cThe Uyghur Human Rights Project has identified at least 386 Uyghur intellectuals who have been imprisoned, detained, or disappeared. They were detained and have disappeared since early 2017 as victims of the massive campaign of ethnoreligious repression carried out by the Chinese government in the Uyghur homeland. \c\cUyghur economist Ilham Tohti was sentenced to life in prison in 2014. Amnesty International called his sentence unjustified and deplorable. Rahile Dawut, a prominent Uyghur anthropologist who studied and preserved Islamic shrines, traditional songs, and folklore, has been disappeared. \c\cAccording to Radio Free Asia, the Chinese government jailed Uyghur Imam Abduheber Ahmet after he took his son to a religious school not sanctioned by the Chinese state. Radio Free Asia reported that Ahmet had previously been lauded by China as a "five-star" imam but was sentenced in 2018 to over five years in prison for his action. \c\cIn September 2019, Agence France-Presse (AFP) visited 13 destroyed cemeteries across four cities and witnessed exposed bones remaining in four of them. Through an examination of satellite images, the press agency determined that the grave destruction campaign had been ongoing for more than a decade. According to a previous AFP report, three cemeteries in Xayar County were among dozens of Uyghur cemeteries destroyed in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2019. The unearthed human bones from the cemeteries in Xayar County were discarded. In January 2020, a CNN report based on an analysis of Google Maps satellite imagery said that Chinese authorities have destroyed more than 100 graveyards in Xinjiang, primarily Uyghur ones. CNN has linked the destruction of the cemeteries to the government's campaign to control the Uyghurs and Muslims more broadly. The Chinese government says the cemetery and tomb destruction are relocations due to the poor conditions that the cemeteries were in and say that the dead are re-interred in new standardized cemeteries. \c\cAmong the destroyed cemeteries is Sultanim Cemetery (37°07′02′′N 79°56′04′′E\ufeff / \ufeff37.11722°N 79.93444°E\ufeff / 37.11722; 79.93444), the central Uyghur historical graveyard with generations of burials, and the most sacred shrine in Hotan city, which was demolished and converted into a parking lot between 2018 and 2019. CGTN, a Chinese state-owned international channel affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, said that the graves were relocated. \c\cAccording to gender studies expert Leta Hong Fincher, the Chinese government has offered Uyghur couples incentives to have fewer children, and for women to marry outside of their race. According to the outreach coordinator for the U.S.-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, Zubayra Shamseden, the Chinese government "wants to erase Uighur culture and identity by remaking its women."\c\cMarriages between Uyghurs and Han Chinese persons are encouraged with subsidies by the government. In August 2014, local authorities in Cherchen County (Qiemo County) announced, "Incentive Measures Encouraging Uighur-Chinese Intermarriage," including a 10,000 CNY (US$1,450) cash reward per annum for the first five years to such intermarried couples as well as preferential treatment in employment and housing plus free education for the couples, their parents and offspring. County CCP Secretary Zhu Xin remarked:\c\cIn October 2017, the marriage of a Han Chinese man from Henan Province to an Uyghur woman from Lop County was celebrated on the county's social media page:\c\cDarren Byler, an anthropologist and China expert at the University of Washington, said that a social media campaign in 2020 to marry off 100 Uyghur women to Han Chinese men indicated that, "a certain racialized power dynamic is a part of this process," commenting, "It does seem as though this is an effort to produce greater assimilation and diminish ethnic difference by pulling Uighurs into Han-dominated relationships."\c\cAccording to reports from Radio Free Asia, in March 2017, Salamet Memetimin, an ethnic Uyghur and the Communist Party Secretary for Chaka township's Bekchan village in Qira County, Hotan Prefecture, was relieved of her duties for taking her nikah marriage vows at her home. In interviews with Radio Free Asia in 2020, residents and officials of Shufu County (Kona Sheher), Kashgar Prefecture (Kashi) stated that it was no longer possible to perform traditional Uyghur nikah marriage rites in the county. \c\cChinese authorities discourage the wearing of headscarves, veils, and other Islamic dress in the region. On May 20, 2014, a protest broke out in Alakaga (Alaqagha, Alahage), Kuqa (Kuchar, Kuche), Aksu Prefecture when 25 women and schoolgirls were detained for wearing headscarves. According to a local official, two died and five were injured when special armed police fired into the protesters.  Subsequently, a Washington Post team was detained in Alakaga and ultimately deported from the region. \c\cManuals leaked from the Xinjiang internment camps have noted that some inmates have been detained for wearing traditional clothing. \c\cAccording to Radio Free Asia, in 2015, a list of banned names for children called "Naming Rules For Ethnic Minorities", was promulgated in Hotan, banning potential names including "Islam", "Quran", "Mecca", "Jihad", "Imam", "Saddam", "Hajj", and "Medina". Use of the list was later extended throughout Xinjiang. Legislation that came into effect in Xinjiang on 1 April 2017 made it illegal to name children names that the Chinese Government deemed to "exaggerate religious fervor". This prohibition included a ban on naming children "Muhammad". \c\cThe Xinjiang internment camps are a part of the Chinese government's strategy to govern Xinjiang through the detention of ethnic minorities en masse. Researchers and organizations have made various estimates of the number of people who have been detained in Xinjiang internment camps. In 2018, United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination vice chairperson Gay McDougall indicated that around 1 million Uyghurs were being held in internment camps. In September 2020, a Chinese government white paper revealed that an average of 1.29 million workers went through "vocational training" per year between 2014 and 2019, though it does not specify how many of the people received the training in camps or how many times they went through training. Adrian Zenz stated that this "gives us a possible scope of coercive labor" occurring in Xinjiang. There have been multiple reports that mass deaths have occurred inside the camps. \c\cIn March 2019, Adrian Zenz told the United Nations that 1.5 million Uyghurs had been detained in camps, saying that his number accounted for both the increases in the size and scope of detention in the region and public reporting on the stories of Uyghur exiles with family in interment camps.[citation needed] In July 2019, Zenz wrote in the Journal of Political Risk that he speculated that 1.5 million Uyghurs had been extrajudicially detained, which he described as being "an equivalent to just under one in six adult members of a Turkic and predominantly Muslim minority group in Xinjiang." In November 2019, Zenz estimated that the number of internment camps in Xinjiang had surpassed 1,000. In July 2020, Zenz wrote in Foreign Policy that his estimate had increased since November 2019, estimating that a total of 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities had been extrajudicially detained in what he described as "the largest incarceration of an ethnoreligious minority since the Holocaust," arguing that the Chinese Government was engaging in policies in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. \c\cAccording to 2020 study by Joanne Smith Finley, "political re-education involves coercive Sinicization, deaths in the camps through malnutrition, unsanitary conditions, withheld medical care, and violence (beatings); rape of male and female prisoners; and, since the end of 2018, transfers of the most recalcitrant prisoners – usually young, religious males – to high-security prisons in Xinjiang or inner China. Other camp "graduates" have been sent into securitized forced labour. Those who remain outside the camps have been terrified into religious and cultural self-censorship through the threat of internment". \c\cEthan Gutmann estimated in December 2020 that 5 to 10 percent of detainees have died each year in the camps. \c\cChina has subjected Uyghurs who live in Xinjiang to torture. \c\cMihrigul Tursun, a young Uyghur mother, said that she was "tortured and subjected to other brutal conditions".  In 2018, Tursun gave testimony during which she described her experience while at the camps; she was drugged, interrogated for days without sleep, subjected to intrusive medical examinations, and strapped in a chair and jolted with electricity. It was her third time being sent to a camp since 2015. Tursun told reporters that she remembers interrogators telling her: "Being a Uighur is a crime." China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying has stated that Tursun was taken into custody by police on "suspicion of inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination" for a period lasting 20 days, but denies that Tursun was ever detained in an internment camp. \c\cAnother past detainee, Kayrat Samarkand, said that "\'[t]hey made me wear what they called \'iron clothes,\' a suit made of metal that weighed over 50 pounds [23 kg]... It forced my arms and legs into an outstretched position. I couldn\'t move at all, and my back was in terrible pain...They made people wear this thing to break their spirits. After 12 hours, I became so soft, quiet and lawful.\'"\c\cWaterboarding is reportedly among the forms of torture which have been used as part of the indoctrination process. \c\cBeginning in 2019, reports of forced sterilization in Xinjiang began to surface. Zumrat Dwut, a Uyghur woman, says that she was forcibly sterilized by tubal ligation during her time in a camp before her husband was able to get her out through requests to Pakistani diplomats. The Xinjiang regional government denies that she was forcibly sterilized. \c\cIn April 2021, exiled Uyghur doctor Gülgine reported that forced sterilization of ethnic Uyghurs persisted since the 1980s. Since 2014 there was an indication for a sharp increase in sterilization of Uyghur women to ensure that Uyghurs would remain a minority in the region. Gülgine said "On some days there were about 80 surgeries to carry out forced sterilizations". She presented intrauterine devices (IUDs) and remarked that "these devices were inserted into women's wombs" to forcibly cause infertility. \c\cKayrat Samarkand described his camp routine in an article for NPR: "In addition to living in cramped quarters, he says inmates had to sing songs praising Chinese leader Xi Jinping before being allowed to eat. He says detainees were forced to memorize a list of what he calls \'126 lies\' about religion: \'Religion is opium, religion is bad, you must believe in no religion, you must believe in the Communist Party,\' he remembers. \'Only [the] Communist Party could lead you to the bright future.\'"\c\cDocuments which were leaked to The New York Times by an anonymous Chinese official advised that "Should students ask whether their missing parents had committed a crime, they are to be told no, it is just that their thinking has been infected by unhealthy thoughts. Freedom is only possible when this \'virus\' in their thinking is eradicated and they are in good health."\c\cThe Heritage Foundation reported that "children whose parents are detained in the camps are often sent to state-run orphanages and brainwashed to forget their ethnic roots. Even if their parents are not detained, Uyghur children need to move to inner China and immerse themselves into the Han culture under the Chinese government's \'Xinjiang classrooms\' policy."\c\cIn 2021 Gulbahar Haitiwaji reported being coerced into denouncing her family after her daughter had been photographed at a protest in Paris. \c\cAccording to Quartz, the Xinjiang region is described as a "\'cotton gulag\' where prison labor is present in all steps of the cotton supply chain..."\c\cTahir Hamut, a Uyghur Muslim, worked in a labor camp during elementary school when he was a child, and he later worked in a labor camp as an adult, performing such tasks as picking cotton, shoveling gravel, and making bricks. "Everyone is forced to do all types of hard labor or face punishment," he said. "Anyone unable to complete their duties will be beaten."\c\cIn December 2020, an investigative report by BuzzFeed News revealed that "[f]orced labor on a vast scale is almost certainly taking place" inside the Xinjiang internment camps, with 135 factory facilities identified within the camps covering over 21 million square feet (2.0 km2) of land. The report noted that "[f]ourteen million square feet of new factories were built in 2018 alone" within the camps and that "former detainees said they were never given a choice about working, and that they earned a pittance or no pay at all". \c\cA Chinese website hosted by Baidu has posted job listings for transferring Uyghur laborers in batches of 50 to 100 people. The 2019 Five Year Plan of the Xinjiang government has an official "labour transfer programme" "to provide more employment opportunities for the surplus rural labour force". These batches of Uyghurs are under "half-military" style management and direct supervision. A seafood processing plant owner said that the Uyghur workforce in his factory had left for Xinjiang due to the COVID-19 pandemic and were paid and housed properly. \c\cFormer inmates have said that they were subjected to medical experimentation. \c\cBBC News and other sources reported accounts of organized mass rape and sexual torture carried out by Chinese authorities in the internment camps. \c\cMultiple women who were formerly detained in the Xinjiang internment camps have publicly made accusations of systemic sexual abuse, including rape, gang rapes, and sexual tortures, such as forced vaginal and anal penetrations with electric batons, and rubbing chili pepper paste on genitals. Sayragul Sauytbay, a teacher who was forced to work in the camps, told the BBC that employees of the internment camp in which she was detained conducted rapes en masse, saying that camp guards "picked the girls and young women they wanted and took them away". She also told the BBC of an organized gang rape, in which a woman around age 21 was forced to make a confession in front of a crowd of 100 other women detained in the camps, before being raped by multiple policemen in front of the assembled crowd. In 2018, a Globe and Mail interview with Sauytbay indicated that she did not personally see violence at the camp, but did witness malnourishment and a complete lack of freedom. Tursunay Ziawudun, a woman who was detained in the internment camps for a period of nine months, told the BBC that women were removed from their cells "every night" to be raped by Chinese men, and that she was subjected to three separate instances of gang rape while detained. In an earlier interview, Ziawudun reported that while she "wasn\'t beaten or abused" while in the camps, she was instead subjected to long interrogations, forced to watch propaganda, had her hair cut, was under constant surveillance, and kept in cold conditions with poor food, leading to her developing anemia.  Qelbinur Sedik, an Uzbek woman from Xinjiang, has stated that Chinese police sexually abused detainees during electric shock tortures, saying that "there were four kinds of electric shock... the chair, the glove, the helmet, and anal rape with a stick". \c\cChinese government officials deny all allegations that there have been any human rights abuses within the internment camps. Reuters reported in March 2021 that Chinese government officials also disclosed personal medical information of women witnesses in an effort to discredit them. \c\cIn February 2021 the BBC released an extensive report which alleged that systematic sexual abuse was taking place within the camps. The gang rapes and sexual torture were alleged to be part of a systemic rape culture which included both policemen and those from outside the camps who pay for time with the prettiest girls. CNN reported in February 2021 about a worker and several former female inmates which survived the camps; they provided details about murder, torture and rape in the camps, which they described as routinely occurring. \c\cChina performs regular pregnancy checks on hundreds of thousands of minority women within Xinjiang. \c\cResearcher Adrian Zenz, citing the 2019 China Population and Employment Yearbook, reported that 80% of new IUD placements (insertions minus removals) in the People's Republic of China in 2018 occurred in Xinjiang, despite the region only constituting 1.8% of the country's population. Zenz points out that birth rates in counties whose majority population consists of ethnic minorities began to fall in 2015, "the very year that the government began to single out the link between population growth and \'religious extremism\'". Prior to the recent drops in birth rates, the Uyghur population had had a high growth rate, at 2.6 times the Han growth rate between 2005 and 2015. \c\cAccording to a fax provided to CNN by the Xinjiang regional government, birth rates in the Xinjiang region fell by 32.68% from 2017 to 2018. In 2019, the birth rates fell by 24% year over year, a significantly greater drop than the 4.2% decline in births experienced across the entire People's Republic of China. According to Zenz, population growth rates in the two largest Uyghur prefectures in Xinjiang, Kashgar and Hotan, fell by 84% between 2015 and 2018. \c\cAccording to Adrien Zenz Chinese government documents mandate that birth control violations of Uyghurs are punishable by extrajudicial internment. \c\cAlso in 2019, The Heritage Foundation reported that officials forced Uyghur women to take unknown drugs and liquids that caused them to lose consciousness, and sometimes caused them to stop menstruating. In 2020, public reporting continued to indicate that large-scale compulsory sterilization was being carried out, with the Associated Press reporting that the there is a "widespread and systematic" practice of forcing Uyghur and other ethnic minority women to take birth control medication in the Xinjiang region. Many women have stated that they have been forced to receive contraceptive implants. \c\cThe regional authorities do not dispute the decrease in birth rates but strongly deny that genocide and forced sterilization is occurring; Xinjiang authorities have publicly maintained that the decrease in birth rates is due to "the comprehensive implementation of the family planning policy." The Chinese Embassy in the United States said the policy was positive and empowering for Uyghur women, writing that, "in the process of eradicating extremism, the minds of Uygur women were emancipated and gender equality and reproductive health were promoted, making them no longer baby-making machines. They are more confident and independent." Twitter removed the Tweet as it violated their policies. \c\cBeginning in 2018, over one million Chinese government workers began forcibly living in the homes of Uyghur families to monitor and assess resistance to assimilation, as well as to watch for frowned-upon religious and cultural practices. \c\cThe "Pair Up and Become Family" program is a program during which Han Chinese men assigned to monitor the homes of Uyghurs slept in the same beds as Uyghur women. According to Radio Free Asia, these Han Chinese government workers have been trained to call themselves "relatives" and have been engaging in the forcible co-habitation of Uyghur homes for the purpose of promoting "ethnic unity". Radio Free Asia reports that these men "regularly sleep in the same beds as the wives of men detained in the region's internment camps." Uyghur activists have criticized this program for being a part of a campaign of "mass rape disguised as \'marriage\'" and the "total annihilation of the safety, security and well-being of family members", while Chinese officials have stated that co-sleeping is acceptable, provided that a distance of one meter is maintained between the women and the "relative" assigned to the Uyghur home. Human Rights Watch has condemned the Pair Up and Become Family Program as a "deeply invasive forced assimilation practice."\c\cA 37-year-old pregnant woman from the Xinjiang region said that she attempted to give up her Chinese citizenship to live in Kazakhstan but was told by the Chinese government that she needed to come back to China to complete the process. She alleges that officials seized the passports of her and her two children before coercing her into receiving an abortion to prevent her brother from being detained in an internment camp. \c\cA book by Guo Rongxing on the unrest in Xinjiang states that the 1990 Baren Township riot protests were the result of 250 forced abortions imposed upon local Uyghur women by the Chinese government. \c\cEthan Gutmann, an independent researcher and expert on human rights abuses in China, concluded that organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience became prevalent when members of the Uyghur ethnic group were targeted in security crackdowns and "strike hard campaigns" during the 1990s. According to Gutmann, organ harvesting from Uyghur prisoners dropped off by 1999 with members of the Falun Gong religious group overtaking the Uyghurs as a source of organs. \c\cIn the 2010s, concerns about organ harvesting from Uyghurs resurfaced. According to a unanimous determination by the China Tribunal in May 2020, China has persecuted and medically tested Uyghurs. Its report expressed concerns that Uyghurs were vulnerable to being subject to organ harvesting but did not yet have evidence of its occurrence. In November 2020, Gutmann told Radio Free Asia that a former hospital in Atsu, China, which had been converted into a Xinjiang internment camp, would allow local officials to streamline the organ harvesting process and provide a steady stream of harvested organs from Uyghurs. Later, in December 2020, human rights activists and independent researchers told Haaretz that individuals detained in the Xinjiang internment camps "are being murdered and their organs harvested." At that time, Gutmann told Haaretz that he estimates that at least 25,000 Uyghurs are killed in Xinjiang for their organs each year and that crematoria have been recently built in the province in order to more easily dispose of victims\' bodies. Gutmann said that Chinese also created "fast lanes" for the movement of human organs in local airports. \c\cIn 2020, a Chinese woman said that Uyghurs were slaughtered on demand to provide halal organs for primarily Saudi customers. She said that in one such instance in 2006, 37 Saudi clients received organs from killed Uyghurs at the Department of Liver Transplantation of Tianjin Taida Hospital. Dr. Enver Tohti, a former oncology surgeon in Xinjiang, supported the allegations. \c\cThe Chinese government has relocated more than 600,000 Uyghurs to industrial workplaces as a part of a forced labor program. \c\cIn January 2020, videos began to surface on Douyin showing large numbers of Uyghurs being placed into airplanes, trains, and busses for transportation to forced factory labor programs. In March 2020, the Chinese government was found to be using the Uyghur minority as forced sweatshop labor. According to a report published by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), no fewer than around 80,000 Uyghurs were forcibly removed from Xinjiang and used as forced labor in at least twenty-seven factories around China. According to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, a UK-based charity, corporations such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Adidas, Amazon, Apple, BMW, Fila, Gap, H&M, Inditex, Marks & Spencer, Nike, North Face, Puma, PVH, Samsung, and Uniqlo sourced from these factories. Over 570,000 Uyghurs are forced to pick cotton by hand in Xinjiang. The Chinese forced labor system is designed to reduce the Uyghur population density. \c\cChina has been accused of coordinated efforts to coerce Uyghurs living overseas into returning and using family still in China to pressure members of the diaspora not to make trouble. China denies the accusations as they deny all other accusations related to the Uyghur genocide. \c\cChina's all encompassing surveillance system extends overseas and special emphasis is placed on monitoring the Uyghur diaspora. \c\cIn March 2021 Facebook discovered that hackers based in China had been conducting cyberespionage against members of the Uyghur diaspora. \c\cChinese authorities have been utilizing biometric technology to track individuals in the Uyghur community. According to Yahir Imin, a 38-year-old Uyghur, Chinese authorities in Xinjiang drew blood, scanned his face, recorded his fingerprints, and documented his voice. As stated in the article written by Sui-Lee Wee, a key piece in China's strategy is to collect genetic material from millions of people in the Xinjiang region. The genetic material contributes to an extensive database that can track Uyghur individuals who defy the campaign. China has been exploring the use of facial recognition technology to sort people by ethnicity, and how to use DNA to tell if an individual is an Uyghur. According to an assistant professor at the University of Windsor in Ontario, Mark Munsterhjelm, The PRC is creating "technologies used for hunting people."\c\cIn 2017, security-related construction tripled in Xinjiang. According to Charles Rollet, "the projects [in China] include not only security cameras but also video analytics hubs, intelligent monitoring systems, big data centers, police checkpoints, and even drones," with drone manufacturer DJI having provided surveillance drones to local police since 2017 as well. The Ministry of Public Security has invested billions of dollars into two main government plans: the Skynet project (天网工程) and the Sharp Eyes project (雪亮工程). These two projects combined are reaching to oversee China's population by the year 2020 through video camera facial recognition to "resolutely achieve no blind spots, no gaps, no blank spots”.  According to Morgan Stanley, by 2020, there will be installments of 400 million security cameras. Various Chinese start-ups have been building algorithms to allow the Chinese government to track the Muslim minority group. These start-ups include SenseTime, CloudWalk, Yitu, Megvii, and Hikvision. \c\cIn July 2020, the United States Department of Commerce sanctioned 11 Chinese firms, two of which were subsidiaries of BGI Group, for violating the human rights of Uyghur Muslims and minorities belonging to other ethnicities in China, by exploiting their genetic sequence. The BGI Group along with an Abu Dhabi-based AI and cloud computing firm Group 42 – accused of espionage in 2019 – were named by the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department in an October 2020 warning issued to Nevada against the use of the 200,000 COVID-19 test kits donated by UAE under the partnership of G42 and the BGI Group. The US intelligence agencies have warned of foreign powers exploiting patient's medical samples to dig into their medical history, genetic traits, illnesses, etc. \c\cAround 2013, Xinjiang Party secretary Chen Quanguo launched "Physicals for All", purportedly a medical care program. "Every Xinjiang resident between the ages of twelve and 65" was required to provide DNA samples. Also collected were data on "blood types, fingerprints, voice-prints, iris patterns". \c\cOfficials in Tumxuk have gathered hundreds of blood samples from Uyghurs, contributing to a mass DNA-collection campaign. Tumxuk was named a "major battlefield for Xinjiang's security work" by the state news media. In January 2018, a forensic DNA lab overseen by the Institute of Forensic Science of China was built in Tumxuk. Documents from the lab showed that the lab was supported by software created by Thermo Fisher Scientific, a Massachusetts company. This software was used in correspondence to create genetic sequencers, helpful in analyzing DNA. In response, Thermo Fisher declared in February that it would cease sales to the Xinjiang region as a result of "fact-specific assessments". \c\cSecurity officials have ordered residents in China's northwest region to install GPS tracking devices in their vehicles so authorities can track their movements. This measure affects residents in the Xinjiang region and authorities have said that it "is necessary to counteract the activities of Islamist extremists and separatists". An announcement from officials in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture proclaimed that "there is a severe threat from international terrorism, and cars have been used as a key means of transport for terrorists as well as constantly serving as weapons. It is, therefore, necessary to monitor and track all vehicles in the prefecture."\c\cIn 2008, Michael Clarke, an Australian terrorism scholar, noted that "there has emerged within the Uighur émigré community a tendency to portray the Uighurs as experiencing a form of \'cultural genocide\'", citing as an example a 2004 speech by World Uyghur Congress president Erkin Alptekin. In a 2012 Wall Street Journal op ed, Uyghur activist Rebiya Kadeer described the CCP following “policies of Uighur cultural genocide”. In 2018, UCL human rights scholar Kate Cronin-Furman argued in 2018 that the Chinese state policies constituted cultural genocide. \c\cIn July 2019, Adrian Zenz, a German academic, used the term in an article in the Journal of Political Risk entitled "Break Their Roots: Evidence for China's Parent-Child Separation Campaign in Xinjiang", and his research was cited by news sources such as the BBC. James Leibold, a professor at Australia's La Trobe University, in July 2019 called the treatment of Uyghurs by the Chinese government a "cultural genocide" and stated that "in their own words, party officials are \'washing brains\' and \'cleansing hearts\' to \'cure\' those bewitched by extremist thoughts." The term was used in editorials, for instance in the Washington Post, at this point. \c\cSince the release of the Xinjiang papers and the China Cables in November 2019, various journalists and researchers have called the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs an ethnocide or a cultural genocide. In November 2019, Zenz described the classified documents as confirming "that this is a form of cultural genocide". Foreign Policy published an article by Azeem Ibrahim in which he called the Chinese treatment of Uyghurs a "deliberate and calculated campaign of cultural genocide" after the release of the Xinjiang papers and China Cables. \c\cThrough June 2020, most scholars, media commentators, and international barristers cautiously labeled the human rights situation in Xinjiang as a cultural genocide. \c\cIn June 2019, the China Tribunal, an independent judicial investigation into forced organ transplantation in China concluded that crimes against humanity had been committed beyond reasonable doubt against China's Uyghur Muslim and Falun Gong populations. \c\cThe use of the full "genocide" term did not gain traction until after the publication of a report by Adrian Zenz for the Jamestown Foundation and an article by the Associated Press in late June 2020 on forced sterilizations. \c\cIn July 2020, Zenz said an interview with National Public Radio (NPR) that he had previously argued that the actions of the Chinese government are a cultural genocide, not a "literal genocide", but that one of the five criteria from the Genocide Convention was satisfied by more recent developments concerning the suppression of birth rates so "we do need to probably call it a genocide". The same month, the last colonial governor of British Hong Kong, Chris Patten, said that the "birth control campaign" was "arguably something that comes within the terms of the UN views on sorts of genocide" and the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China demanded an independent UN investigation. At roughly the same time, U.S. senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris urged the Trump administration to investigate the allegations. \c\cAlthough the People's Republic of China (PRC) is not a member of the International Criminal Court, on 6 July 2020 the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile and the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement filed a complaint with the ICC calling for it to investigate PRC officials for crimes against Uyghurs including allegations of genocide. The ICC responded in December 2020 and "asked for more evidence before it will be willing to open an investigation into claims of genocide against Uighur people by China, but has said it will keep the file open for such further evidence to be submitted."\c\cAn August 2020 Quartz article reported that some scholars hesitate to label the human rights abuses in Xinjiang as a "full-blown genocide", preferring the term "cultural genocide", but that increasingly many experts were calling them "crimes against humanity" or "genocide". Also in August 2020 the spokesperson for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign described China's actions as genocide. \c\cIn October 2020, the U.S. Senate introduced a bipartisan resolution designating the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Chinese government against the Uyghur people and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang as genocide. Around the same time, the House of Commons of Canada issued a statement that its Subcommittee on International Human Rights of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development was persuaded that the Chinese Communist Party's actions in Xinjiang constitute genocide as laid out in the Genocide Convention. The 2020 annual report by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China referred to the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs as "crimes against humanity and possibly genocide."\c\cIn December 2020, lawyers David Matas and Sarah Teich wrote in Toronto Star that "One distressing present day example [of genocide] is the atrocities faced by the Uighur population in Xinjiang, China."\c\cIn January 2021, U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S. government would be officially designating the crimes against the Uyghurs and other Turkic and Muslim people living in China as a genocide. This declaration, which came in the final hours of the Trump administration,  had not been made earlier due to a worry that it could disrupt trade talks between the US and China. On the allegations of crimes against humanity Pompeo asserted that "These crimes are ongoing and include: the arbitrary imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty of more than one million civilians, forced sterilization, torture of a large number of those arbitrarily detained, forced labor and the imposition of draconian restrictions on freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression and freedom of movement."\c\cHowever, there was internal disagreement within the administration with the Office of the Legal Advisor concluding that although the situation in Xinjiang amounts to crimes against humanity, there was insufficient evidence to prove genocide. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying responded to the designation by calling Pompeo a "doomsday clown", and dismissing the allegations of genocide as "wastepaper" and "pseudo-propositions and a malicious farce concocted by individual anti-China and anti-Communist forces represented by Pompeo". On 19 January 2021, incoming U.S. president Joe Biden's secretary of state nominee Antony Blinken was asked during his confirmation hearings whether he agreed with Pompeo's conclusion that the CCP has committed genocide against the Uyghurs, he contended "That would be my judgment as well." During her confirmation hearings Joe Biden's nominee to be the US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield stated that she believed what was currently happening in Xinjiang was a genocide, adding "I lived through and experienced and witnessed a genocide in Rwanda."\c\cIn January 2021, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stated that, "[t]here is a reasonable basis to believe that the government of China is committing crimes against humanity."\c\cWhen asked about the situation by a reporter, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that "what's happening to the Uyghurs is utterly abhorrent" but that "the attribution of genocide is a judicial matter". Chinese state media ran op-eds and reports disputing the use of the term “genocide". \c\cThe US designation was followed by Canada's House of Commons and the Dutch parliament each passing a non-binding motion in February 2021 to recognize China's actions as genocide. \c\cIn February 2021, a report released by the Essex Court Chambers concluded that "there is a very credible case that acts carried out by the Chinese government against the Uighur people in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region amount to crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide, and describes how the minority group has been subject to "enslavement, torture, rape, enforced sterilisation and persecution." "Victims have been "forced to remain in stress positions for an extended period of time, beaten, deprived of food, shackled and blindfolded”, it said. \c\cThe legal team state they have seen “prolific credible evidence” of sterilisation procedures carried out on women, including forced abortions, saying they “clearly constitute a form of genocidal conduct”. \c\cAccording to a March 2021 Newlines Institute report that was written by over 50 worldwide experts on China, genocide, and international law, the Chinese government breached every article in the Genocide Convention, writing that “simply put, China's long-established, publicly and repeatedly declared, specifically targeted, systematically implemented, and fully resourced policy and practice toward the Uyghur group is inseparable from \'the intent to destroy in whole or in part\' the Uyghur group as such." The report, published by the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said there were credible reports of mass deaths under the mass internment drive, while Uighur leaders were selectively sentenced to death or sentenced to long-term imprisonment. “Uyghurs are suffering from systematic torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, including rape, sexual abuse, and public humiliation, both inside and outside the camps,” the report stated. The report argued that these policies are directly orchestrated by the highest levels of state, including Xi and the top officials of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang. It also reported that the Chinese government gave explicit orders to "eradicate tumours", "wipe them out completely", "destroy them root and branch", “round up everyone", and "show absolutely no mercy", in regards to Uyghurs, and that camp guards reportedly follow orders to uphold the system in place until ‘Kazakhs, Uyghurs, and other Muslim nationalities, would disappear...until all Muslim nationalities would be extinct’.” According to the report "Internment camps contain designated “interrogation rooms,” where Uyghur detainees are subjected to consistent and brutal torture methods, including beatings with metal prods, electric shocks, and whips."\c\cIn July 2019, 22 countries issued a joint letter to the 41st session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), condemning China's mass detention of Uyghurs and other minorities, calling upon China to "refrain from the arbitrary detention and restrictions on freedom of movement of Uyghurs, and other Muslim and minority communities in Xinjiang". In the same session, 50 countries issued a joint letter supporting China's Xinjiang policies, criticizing the practice of "politicizing human rights issues". The letter stated, "China has invited a number of diplomats, international organizations officials and journalist to Xinjiang" and that "what they saw and heard in Xinjiang completely contradicted what was reported in the media."\c\cIn October 2019, 23 countries issued a joint statement to the UN urging China to "uphold its national and international obligations and commitments to respect human rights". In response, 54 countries (including China itself) issued a joint statement supporting China's Xinjiang policies. The statement "spoke positively of the results of counter-terrorism and de-radicalization measures in Xinjiang and noted that these measures have effectively safeguarded the basic human rights of people of all ethnic groups."\c\cIn February 2020, the UN demanded unobstructed access in advance of a proposed fact-finding visit to the region. \c\cIn October 2020, more countries at the UN joined the condemnation of China over human rights abuses in Xinjiang with German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen speaking on behalf of the group. The total number of countries that condemned China increased to 39, while the total number of countries that defended China decreased to 45. Notably, 16 countries that defended China in 2019 did not do so in 2020. \c\cThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights began to discuss the possibility of a visit to Xinjiang with China in order to examine "the impact on human rights of its policies" in September 2020. Since then, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has since been negotiating terms of access to China, but the High Commissioner has not visited the country. In February 2021, the Chinese Foreign Minister gave a speech to the United Nations Human Rights Commission in which he stated that Xinjiang is "always open" and the country "welcomes the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Xinjiang". \c\cAt a March 2021 meeting of the UN Human Rights Council, the United States ambassador condemned China's human rights abuses in Xinjiang as "crimes against humanity and genocide", while 64 countries (including China) issued a statement that urged member states against interfering in Chinese affairs in Xinjiang and against “making unfounded allegations against China out of political motivations". \c\cIn 2019, the European Parliament awarded its Sakharov Prize for Freedom and Thought to Ilham Tohti, a Uyghur intellectual and activist who had been sentenced to life in prison on charges pertaining to Uyghur separatism. As of March 2021, China has prohibited European Union diplomats from visiting Tothi. The European Union has called upon China to release Tothi from his detention in prison. \c\cIn March 2021, European Union ambassadors agreed on sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against four Chinese officials and one Chinese entity for human rights abuses against Uyghurs. Among those sanctioned by the EU was Zhu Hailun who was described as the architect of the indoctrination program. In the same month, negotiations for a group of Ambassadors from European Union countries to visit Xinjiang stalled due to the Chinese government's denial of their request to visit Ilham Tohti, an imprisoned Uyghur scholar. \c\cSeveral African countries, including Algeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Nigeria, and Somalia, signed a July 2019 letter that publicly praised China's human rights record and dismissed reported abuses in Xinjiang. Several African countries, including Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique and Sudan, signed an October 2019 letter that publicly expressed support for China's treatment of Uyghurs. \c\cIn July 2020, The Globe and Mail reported that human rights activists, including retired politician Irwin Cotler, were encouraging the Parliament of Canada to recognize the Chinese actions against Uyghurs as genocide and impose sanctions on the officials responsible. \c\cOn 21 October 2020, the Subcommittee on International Human Rights (SDIR) of the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development condemned the persecution of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang by the Government of China and concluded that the Chinese Communist Party's actions amount to the genocide of the Uyghurs per the Genocide Convention. \c\cOn 22 February 2021, the Canadian House of Commons voted 266–0 to approve a motion that formally recognizes China as committing genocide against its Muslim minorities. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet did not vote. China's Ambassador to Canada responded to the motion by calling the allegations of genocide and forced labor the “lie of the century.”\c\cOn 11 April 2021, Canada issued a travel advisory stating that individuals with "familial or ethnic ties" could be "at risk of arbitrary detention" by Chinese authorities when traveling in the Xinjiang region. Radio Canada International reported that the announcement described that China had been "increasingly detaining ethnic and Muslim minorities in the region without due process."\c\cUN counter-terrorism chief Vladimir Voronkov visited Xinjiang in June 2019. The visit prompted anger from the U.S. State Department. The U.S. has called these visits "highly choreographed" and characterized them as having "propagated false narratives."\c\cIn 2020, the United States Congress passed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act in reaction to the internment camps. Lawmakers also proposed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act requiring the assumption that all Xinjiang goods are made with forced labor and therefore banned. In September 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security blocked imports of products from five entities in Xinjiang to combat the use of forced labor, while shelving broader proposed bans. A senior US diplomat called upon other countries to join the United States denunciations against the Chinese government's policies in Xinjiang. Senators Cornyn, Merkley, Cardin, and Rubio signed a letter to request Mike Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, to issue a determination of genocide. The National Review reports that "U.S. government genocide determinations are an incredibly tricky thing. They require solid evidence to meet the criteria set out under the 1948 Genocide Convention." When determinations are issued there isn\'t much change or an effect that they will bring in the short run. Although, "there's a strong, well-documented case for a determination in this case." As of November 2020, US Senators Menendez and Cornyn are leading a bipartisan group to recognize the CCP's actions in Xinjiang as a genocide by way of a Senate resolution, which would make the United States Senate the first government to "officially recognize the situation as a genocide."\c\cOn 19 January 2021, Pompeo announced that the United States Department of State had determined that "genocide and crimes against humanity" had been perpetrated by China against the Uyghurs, with Pompeo stating: "the People's Republic of China, under the direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party, has committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uighurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups, including ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz... [i]n the anguished cries from Xinjiang, the U.S. hears the echoes of Nazi Germany, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur." The announcement was made on the last day of the presidency of Donald Trump. \c\cAt the end of the Trump presidency, the incoming Biden administration had already declared as the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign that such a determination should be made, and that America would continue to recognize the Xinjiang activity as a genocide. On 16 February 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden commmented in a CNN town hall meeting in Wisconsin that Xi Jinping's rationale for justifying his policies, the idea that there "must be a united, tightly controlled China", derives from the fact that "Culturally, there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow." He also promised in the same meeting that "there will be repercussions for China" for its human rights violations. Some sources interpreted Biden's statements as excusing Chinese policy towards Uyghurs on cultural relativist grounds, whereas an opposite view deemed it a misrepresentation. \c\cMany countries in the Middle East signed a UN document defending China's human rights record. A spokesperson for the Turkish Foreign Ministry criticized the camps. Iraq and Iran have also signed the document while Saudi Arabia and Egypt have been accused of deporting Uyghurs to China. The United Arab Emirates has formally defended China's human rights records. These countries have appreciated China's respect for the principle of non-interference in other countries\' affairs and have therefore placed  significance on their economic and political relations. Qatar supported China's policies in Xinjiang until August 21, 2019; Qatar was the first Middle Eastern country to withdraw its defense of the Xinjiang Camps. \c\cRussia, Belarus, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan have expressed support for China's policies in Xinjiang. Russia signed both statements at the UN (in July and October 2019) that supported China's Xinjiang policies. NPR reported that Kazakhstan and "its neighbors in the mostly Muslim region of Central Asia that have benefited from Chinese investment aren\'t speaking up for the Muslims inside internment camps in China". \c\cNepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have signed a UN document supporting China's policies in Xinjiang. \c\cCambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and the Philippines have issued statements of support for China's policies. According to The Moscow Times, Thailand, Malaysia, and Cambodia have all deported Uyghur people at China's request.  In 2020, Malaysia minister Mohd Redzuan Md Yusof said that Malaysia would not entertain requests from Beijing to extradite Uighurs if they felt their safety was at risk. \c\cIn 2009, remarks by Prime Minister Erdogan were published by the Anatolian News Agency where he denounced the "savagery" being inflicted on the Uyghur community and called for an end of the Chinese government's attempts to forcibly assimilate the community. Later at the Group of Eight summit in Italy, Erdogan stated that "The incidents in China are, simply put, a genocide. There's no point in interpreting this otherwise."\c\cIn 2019, the Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning what it described as China's "reintroduction of concentration camps in the 21st century" and "a great cause of shame for humanity". In response to a question regarding the reported death of Uyghur musician Abdurehim Heyit within the Xinjiang internment camps, a spokesperson for the Turkish Foreign Ministry stated that "more than one million Uyghur Turks incurring arbitrary arrests are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in internment camps and prisons". \c\cIn March 2021, the Turkish parliament rejected a motion to call the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs a genocide. \c\cIn 2021, it was reported that authorities arrested Uyghur protesters in Ankara following a complaint by the embassy of China in Turkey. \c\cIn December 2020, France said that it will oppose the proposed Comprehensive Agreement on Investment between China and the European Union over the use of forced labour of Uyghurs. In February 2021, the French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced "institutionalised repression" of Uyghurs at the UN Human Rights Council. \c\cIn March 2021 Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin tweeted a condemnation of the human rights situation in Xinjiang. \c\cOn February 25, 2021, the Netherlands parliament passed a non-binding resolution declaring the Chinese government's actions against the Uyghurs as a genocide. \c\cOn 10 October 2020, Britain's Shadow Foreign Secretary, Lisa Nandy suggested that Britain must oppose giving China a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in protest against its abuse of Uyghur Muslims. She added that the UN must be allowed to conduct an inquiry into possible crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. \c\cIn September 2020. A letter signed by more than 120 MPs and peers, including senior Tories and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, has accused China of a “systematic and calculated programme of ethnic cleansing” against the country's Uighur Muslim minority, and compared China to Nazi Germany. \c\cIn January 2021, the British parliament rejected a resolution which would have banned the UK from trading with countries engaged in genocides. Prime Minister Boris Johnson opposed the resolution. \c\cIn January 2021, foreign secretary Dominic Raab made a statement over China's human rights violations against Uyghurs, accusing China of "extensive and invasive surveillance targeting minorities, systematic restrictions on Uighur culture, education, and the practice of Islam, and the widespread use of forced labour."\c\cIn January 2021, The Guardian reported that the UK government "fended off an all-party effort to give the courts a chance to designate China guilty of genocide on the day that Blinken said China was intent on genocide in Xinjiang province."\c\cIn March 2021, the UK and the EU sanctioned four Chinese officials, including Zhu Hailun and Wang Junzheng, for their involvement in violating the human rights of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. In response, China imposed sanctions on nine UK citizens for spreading "lies and disinformation" about human rights abuses in Xinjiang. \c\cOn April 22, 2021, The House of Commons passed a non-binding parliamentary motion declaring China's human rights abuses in Xinjiang as a genocide. \c\cIn September 2019, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne stated, "I have previously raised Australia's concerns about reports of mass detentions of Uyghurs and other Muslim peoples in Xinjiang. We have consistently called for China to cease the arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and other Muslim groups. We have raised these concerns—and we will continue to raise them—both bilaterally and in relevant international meetings." In March 2021, the federal government blocked a motion by Rex Patrick to recognize China's treatment of the Uyghurs as a genocide. \c\cIn 2018, New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern raised the issue of Xinjiang while visiting Guangdong Party Secretary Leader Li Xi. Ardern also raised such concerns during China's periodic review at the UN in November 2018, to immediate pushback from China. \c\cArdern discussed Xinjiang privately with Xi Jinping during a 2019 visit to Beijing after the Christchurch mosque shootings. The New York Times accused New Zealand of tiptoeing around the issue for economic reasons as the country exports many products to China, including milk, meat, and wine. \c\cAs of July 2020, Amnesty International has not taken a position on whether the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs constituted a genocide. Genocide Watch "considers the forced sterilizations and forcible transfer of children of Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities in Xinjiang to be acts of genocide" and subsequently issued a Genocide Emergency Alert in November 2020. \c\cIn January 2020, President Ghulam Osman Yaghma of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile wrote that "the world is silently witnessing another Holocaust like genocide in East Turkistan....as the President of East Turkistan Government-in-Exile, on behalf of East Turkistan and its people, we again call on the international community including world governments to acknowledge and recognize China's brutal Holocaust like the oppression of East Turkistan's people as a genocide."\c\cThe Uyghur American Association previously expressed concern at the deportation of 20 Uyghur refugees from Cambodia to China in 2009, and has said that Beijing's military approach to terrorism in Xinjiang is state terrorism. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has issued statements describing the conditions in Xinjiang as crimes against humanity. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, "the Chinese government's campaign against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang is multi-faceted and systematic. It is characterized by mass detention, forced labor, and discriminatory laws, and supported through high-tech manners of surveillance."\c\cIn September 2020, nearly two dozen activist groups, including the Uyghur Human Rights Project, Genocide Watch, and the European Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, signed an open letter urging the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to investigate whether crimes against humanity or genocide were taking place in Xinjiang. \c\cIn March 2021, the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, a think tank at the Fairfax University of America, released a report stating that the "People's Republic of China bears State responsibility for committing genocide against the Uyghurs in breach of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide." According to the report, the determination of the "intent to destroy the Uyghurs as a group is derived from objective proof, consisting of comprehensive state policy and practice, which President Xi Jinping, the highest authority in China, set in motion." The legal analysis of the Newlines Institute concludes that the People’s Republic of China is responsible for breaches of each provision of Article II of the Genocide Convention. \c\cHuman Rights Watch followed in April 2021 with a report outlining "that the Chinese government has committed — and continues to commit — crimes against humanity against the Turkic Muslim population."  The report made in collaboration with the Stanford Human Rights & Conflict Resolution Clinic also sets out recommendations for concerned governments and the UN. \c\cIn April 2021, Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs and human rights academic William Schabas wrote an article for Project Syndicate criticising the US State Department's claim of genocide, calling the charge "flimsy" and stating that there had been no proof of genocide provided by the US State Department. They also urged the State Department to withdraw the claims, stating that “Unless the State Department can substantiate the genocide accusation, it should withdraw the charge. It should also support a UN-led investigation of the situation in Xinjiang.” During a January 2021 interview, despite the interviewer's repeated prompting, Sachs evaded questions about China's repression of the Uyghurs by alluding to "huge human rights abuses committed by the U.S." Subsequently, 19 advocacy and rights groups jointly wrote a letter to Columbia University questioning Sachs\' comments. The letter's signatories wrote, "Professor Sachs aligns perfectly with the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs\' attempts to deny responsibility for their treatment of the Uyghurs by digressing to the history of U.S. rights violations, all the while avoiding discussions of their own," adding, "By highlighting the perspective of the PRC government and trivializing the perspective of those oppressed by that government, Professor Sachs betrays his institution's mission."\c\cIn reaction to the proposed Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in 2020 to impose sanctions on "any foreign person who \'knowingly engages\'" and require firms to disclose their dealings with Xinjiang, the president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association said that blanket import bans on cotton or other products from Xinjiang from such legislation would "wreak havoc" on legitimate supply chains in the apparel industry because Xinjiang cotton exports are often intermingled with cotton from other countries and there is no available origin-tracing technology for cotton fibers. On September 22, 2020, the US Chamber of Commerce issued a letter stating that the act "would prove ineffective and may hinder efforts to prevent human rights abuses." Major companies with supply chain ties to Xinjiang, including Apple Inc., Nike, Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company, have lobbied Congress to weaken the legislation and amend its provisions. \c\cIn February 2021, a policy was established by 12 Japanese companies to cease business deals with some of the Chinese firms involved in or benefitting from forced labor of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. \c\cIn July 2020, Marie van der Zyl, the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, pointed to similarities between the mass detention of Uyghur Muslims and concentration camps in The Holocaust. On International Holocaust Remembrance Day in January 2021, van der Zyl urged the Chinese government to step back from committing atrocities. \c\cIn December 2020, the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth Ephraim Mirvis published an op-ed in The Guardian on the occasion of hanukkah in which he condemned the persecution of the Uyghurs and called for international action to address the "unfathomable mass atrocity" taking place in China. The Chief Rabbi generally refrains from making comments on non-Jewish political issues. Mirvis is part of a wider Jewish protest movement which has sprung up in opposition to the human rights abuses in Xinjiang, protesters are largely motivated by memories of the Holocaust and a desire to prevent a repeat of that horror. In addition to liberal British Jews who have long been involved in international human rights issue the plight of the Uyghur also draws significant interest and support from Britain's Orthodox community. According to Orthodox Rabbi Herschel Gluck “This is something that is felt very deeply by the community. They feel that if ‘Never again’ is a term that needs to be used, this is certainly one of the situations where it applies.”\c\cIn March 2021, a group of sixteen Rabbis and a Cantor from across California's Jewish religious spectrum sent a letter to Representative Ted Lieu urging him to take action in support of the Uyghurs. The grassroots organization Jewish Movement for Uyghur Freedom works to bridge the gap between the Uyghur and Jewish communities as well as advocate on their behalf. In contrast to the earlier Save Darfur campaign major Jewish donors and organizations have tread softly due to a fear of reprisals against themselves and associated businesses by the Chinese government. Major Jewish groups which have spoken out on the Uyghur genocide or taken policy positions on it include the Union for Reform Judaism, the American Jewish Committee, the Rabbinical Assembly, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. \c\cThe Chinese Consulate in Almaty, Kazakhstan has been the site of a daily protest demonstration, primarily made up of old women whose relatives are believed to be detained in China. Regular protests from local Uyghurs have been held at Chinese diplomatic sites in Istanbul, Turkey, where several hundred Uyghur women protested on International Women's Day in March 2021. In London regular protests outside an outpost of the Chinese embassy have been organized by an Orthodox Jewish man from the local neighborhood. He has held protests at least twice a week since February 2019. \c\cIn March 2021, hundreds of Uyghurs living in Turkey protested the visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Istanbul by gathering both in Beyazit Square and near China's Consulate-General in Istanbul. Over two-dozen NGOs that focus on the rights of Uyghurs were involved in organizing the protests. \c\cIn the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the Xinjiang papers which made public Chinese policies towards the Uyghurs, calls were made for a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, including from U.S. Congressman John Katko. In a 30 July 2020 letter, the World Uyghur Congress urged the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to reconsider the decision to hold the Olympics in Beijing. In a non-binding motion in February 2021, the Canadian House of Commons called for the IOC to move the Olympics to a new location. The IOC met with activists in late 2020 about their request to move the Olympics. In March 2021, the President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach opposed a boycott, which would also damage the IOC image and finances, and said that the IOC must stay out of politics.
On 23 April 2021, a man stabbed a police employee to death at a police station in Rambouillet, France, in an attack apparently motivated by terrorism. \c\cAt around 2:20pm on 23 April 2021 a fatal stabbing occurred in Rambouillet, Yvelines, Île-de-France. An administrative assistant was twice stabbed in the throat in the secure entrance to the police station in which she worked. The knifeman was shot dead by police at the scene. \c\cThe attacker was a 36-year-old Tunisian man who arrived in France illegally in 2009. He had since obtained residency papers and was unknown to security services. He had recently moved to Rambouillet. \c\cMany stabbings, bombings & shootings have occurred in France during the late 20th and early 21st century. French authorities are treating the Rambouillet murder as a terrorist attack.   President Emmanuel Macron affirmed his opposition to Islamic terrorism. National Rally leader Marine Le Pen criticised the decision to grant French residency to an illegal immigrant.
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted crime and illicit economies such as organised crime, terrorism, street crime, online crime, illegal markets and smuggling, human and wildlife trafficking, slavery, robberies and burglaries. \c\cThe Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime has stated in a policy brief in March 2020 that while understanding the long-term impact at these early stages of the pandemic is difficult, some things are clear: the pandemic has caused a decrease in some organized-criminal activities, while providing new opportunities in other areas, causing a change in the "organized-criminal economy" that may be long term. The report states that some criminal organisations could take advantage of the situation by expanding activities, with a possibility of "the emergence of criminal groups as suppliers and \'partners\' of the state in maintaining order". \c\cCOVID-19 caused a reduction in many types of crime around the world. A report by USA Today on 4 April 2020 showed a decrease in criminal incidents (in America) since 15 March in nineteen out of twenty police agencies examined. However, the report also noted an increase in domestic violence. Some police departments are intentionally arresting fewer people to prevent potential spread of coronavirus in jails; tackling the issues in alternative ways rather than making "physical arrests". Associated Press reported that in Chicago drug arrests fell 42% since the lockdowns, compared with the same period in 2019. Overall, crime in Chicago declined 10% following the outbreak of the pandemic. This decrease is being seen across cities globally as restrictions were increased to contain the virus. \c\cA detailed examination for one UK police force found variation in the onset of change by crime type when compared to 5-year averages. Some types of crime declined immediately from ‘global pandemic’ announcement from the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020, others later. Incidence of assault was inelastic but responsive to reduced workplace mobility. \c\cFollowing an increase in movement restrictions across nations, there are fewer people on the streets, causing a decrease in street crime. And with a larger population staying indoors at home, thefts and residential burglaries have decreased. In Colombia and El Salvador, following the lockdowns, many types of crime saw a decrease. In Peru, crime levels fell 84% in March. Alleged Serbian drug lord Dragoslav Kosmajac died of COVID-19. Karachi, one of "Asia's most crime-ridden cities", saw an entire week in March go by without any car thefts. In New York City, grand larceny declined by over 50% in April compared to the same period last year; however, the city saw a rise in commercial burglaries despite the overall fall of ~29% in major crimes. In Mexico, amid the pandemic, some criminal groups were seen handing out food supplies, while in other places in Mexico some criminals were facing unemployment. In Australia, border police found methamphetamine (crystal meth/ ice) being smuggled into the country in hand sanitizer bottles. \c\cCounterfeiting and fraud directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic has also been uncovered. In the beginning of March 2020, over 34,000 counterfeit surgical masks were seized by law enforcement authorities worldwide as part of Operation Pangea, supported by Interpol and Europol. Police in India seized thousands of fake N95 masks, raided shops selling overpriced masks and sanitizers, and initiated a case against hoarders of personal protective equipment (PPE). In the United States, individuals were arrested after impersonating doctors and demanding payments for treatment. \c\cOperation Stolen Promise was enacted with aid from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Food and Drug Administration, the US Postal Inspection Service, the US Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Working Group, an intelligence coalition formed by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The operation investigated and seized shipments of "mislabeled, fraudulent, unauthorized, or prohibited" COVID-19-related items. \c\cWith more people spending more time online, cyber crime has increased. With work from home increasing, more and more corporate data is being accessed from homes that may not have the same level of security as office systems. The World Health Organization published a cyber security notice warning people of fraudsters imitating WHO employees. \c\cAnother cyber fraud in America resulted in money that was meant for the unemployed being redirected to fraudulent accounts. The scale of it involves millions of dollars and it appears that the cyber-criminals are Nigerian. \c\cAccording to government data, one in three workers in the UK have been working from home due to lockdown following the spread of COVID-19, which has resulted in an increase in the cyber-attacks on employees. Reportedly, the lack of knowledge about cyber-attacks and cyber-security has been claimed as a prime reason behind rising cyber-crime in the UK during the pandemic. \c\cAmid the reported global increase in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations called for a domestic violence "ceasefire". \c\cIn Peru, the number of women reported missing has surged from five per day from before COVID-19 to eight during the lock-downs. In total, 915 women in Peru were reported missing and feared dead during the three months quarantine. \c\cAn intelligence report compiled by the FBI's Houston branch warned against the likely increase of hate crime incidents against Asian Americans, based on the assumption that a portion of the US public associate the pandemic with China and Asian American populations. They also referenced multiple incidents of hate crimes already perpetrated across the country such as three Asian American family members stabbed by an individual who claimed that the family was Chinese and spreading the virus. \c\cIn its magazine Al-Naba, ISIL recommended that its members exploit the pandemic in order to carry out terrorist attacks. Some extremists regard the virus as being divine punishment for human sins, both in the West and in Muslim countries. The International Crisis Group said that the pandemic would harm international counterterrorism efforts. \c\cIn April in India, an advisory was circulated among Delhi police staff of a potential ISIL attack on police personnel in the field, in the form of a lone wolf attack or "stabbing, firing or hitting by vehicles". Between January and May 2020, Indian security forces conducted 27 counterterrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir in which more than 64 terrorists were killed. Out of these, at least 18 were killed during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. In the first week of May, five Indian Army special forces para commandos were killed by terrorists. Riyaz Naikoo, a commander of the terrorist organization Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, in his last audio message in April 2020, told his followers to follow health safety guidelines that health experts were sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic. He was killed shortly after. \c\cAlso in May a series of attacks in Afghanistan resulted in the deaths of 56 people. The targets included a hospital's maternity ward and a funeral, resulting in the deaths of babies, hospital staff, and people at the funeral. \c\cA railway worker from London contracted COVID-19 and died after a man assaulted her and a coworker. The man said he had the virus and proceeded to spit and cough in the women's faces before running away. Police responding to a domestic incident in Durham, England, were spat on by a teenager who shouted at officers that he hoped he had COVID-19; he was charged with assaulting an emergency worker. Between April 1 and June 6, 2020, the Irish police were purposefully spat or coughed on by individuals on 93 occasions, causing the department to increase their use of spit hoods by 70%. \c\cIn the United States, multiple police departments documented individuals coughing or spitting on responding officers and saying that they had COVID-19. Charges that could be filed against these individuals range from second-degree assault or terrorist threatening. A New Jersey woman spat on a police officer and told responding officers that she was positive for COVID-19 while they were arresting her. Similar cases were reported in Florida, Colorado, Michigan, Ohio, and other states. \c\cIn India, the Tablighi Jamaat religious event hosted by an Islamic missionary group became the country's largest super-spreader, resulting in various type of criminal charges being filed against the attendees for not heeding lockdown restrictions. More than 800 foreigners who attended the event were tracked down and their visas blacklisted. Indian media reported that those who were quarantined by the government spat on healthcare personnel among other things, resulting in numerous charges under the Indian Penal Code. The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, in a television interview, said that "to hide a disease which is infectious is definitely a crime. And this crime has been done by those associated with the Tablighi Jamaat". The National Security Act and murder charges were filed against some of the Tablighi Jamaat attendees. \c\cIn New Delhi, India, new guidelines were circulated among the police with relation to policing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 11-page order included guidelines such as "maintaining six feet distance from the victim at a crime spot" and "sanitizing weapons". Israel allowed its domestic security agency to secretly collect cellphone data to track carriers of coronavirus. The same technology was being used for counterterrorism and had not been disclosed publicly before its implementation for COVID-19. \c\cIn Italy and Spain, there has been a redeployment of carabinieri and military troops, respectively. The pandemic has also impacted the criminal justice system. In the United Kingdom, as part of contingency plans, murder investigations may be limited due to the additional workload the pandemic has created. Brazil has put anti-slavery enforcement operations on indefinite hold. \c\cThe pandemic has added to the workload of various police agencies. Acknowledging the increased workload, Polish police lightheartedly wrote in a tweet on 19 March, "Please stop all criminal activities until further notice", a message that was directed at criminals, adding, "we will appreciate the expected cooperation related to refraining from committing crimes". In the Indian state of Bihar, an additional director general of police admitted that the police were more focused on enforcing the lockdown, but that policing was also being done, thereby increasing their workload significantly. \c\cThe pandemic caused a disruption to various transnational operations such as a long-planned joint operation by six countries (Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime against organized crime and drug traffickers in the region. A reduction in legal cross-border traffic and restrictions on international air traffic made long-distance smuggling more difficult. \c\cThere has also been impact based on the potential for law enforcement officials to make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19, although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the immediate health risk to be low. In the case of contact with an individual with COVID-19, CDC recommends that law enforcement officials follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians. \c\cThe Crown Prosecution Service of United Kingdom has advised out of court disposals for less serious crimes. In the United States, the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel has been reduced because of the pandemic situation. \c\cGovernments in Iran and Afghanistan have reduced the number of prisoners to limit the spread of the virus. The Supreme Court of India directed all Indian state governments to consider releasing some prisoners, resulting in as many as 34,000 being temporarily released. The United States and Indonesia also released prisoners.
{"SpaceX Crew-2 is the second crewed operational flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft, and its third overall crewed orbital flight. The mission launched on 23 April 2021 at 09:49:02 UTC (5:49:02 AM EDT). The Crew-2 mission is transporting four members of the crew to the International Space Station (ISS). Crew-2 also used the same capsule as Demo-2 (Endeavour) and used the same booster as Crew-1 (B1061.1). \c\cOn 28 July 2020, JAXA, ESA and NASA confirmed their astronaut assignments aboard this mission. \c\cGerman astronaut Matthias Maurer was the backup for Pesquet, while Japanese astronaut Satoshi Furukawa trained as backup to Hoshide. \c\cThe second SpaceX operational mission in the Commercial Crew Program launched on 23 April 2021. The Crew Dragon Endeavour (C206), will dock to the International Docking Adapter (IDA) on the Harmony module. This mission is the first with astronauts onboard with a previously used booster rocket. \c\cAll crew are veteran astronauts, though this is Megan McArthur's first visit to the ISS (as her first spaceflight was a shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope).  Alongside the three other crew members, Megan McArthur is using the same seat of the SpaceX Crew Dragon Endeavour in this mission which her husband, Bob Behnken, used in SpaceX Demo-2 mission, the first mission of the Endeavour capsule. Akihiko Hoshide will serve as the second Japanese ISS commander during his stay. It is the second mission by Thomas Pesquet to the International Space Station and will be called Alpha, after Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to Earth, following the French tradition to name space missions after stars or constellations. \c\cThe SpaceX Crew-2 is arrived at the ISS on 24 April 2021, well ahead of the launch and docking of the Nauka module launching on a Proton-M launch vehicle on 15 July 2021 that will carry a portion of the European Robotic Arm (the other portion arrived aboard the STS-132 Space Shuttle mission on 16 May 2010, and is attached to the Rassvet module).[citation needed]"}
This is a summary of notable incidents that have taken place at various European amusement parks, water parks, or theme parks. This list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of every such event, but only those that have a significant impact on the parks or park owners, or are otherwise significantly newsworthy. \c\cThe term incidents refers to major accidents, injuries, deaths that occur at a European park. While these incidents were required to be reported to regulatory authorities due to where they occurred, they usually fall into one of the following categories:\c\cCaused by negligence on the part of the guest. This can be refusal to follow specific ride safety instructions, or deliberate intent to break park rules. \c\cThe result of a guest's known, or unknown, health issues. \c\cNegligence on the part of the park, either by ride operator or maintenance. \c\cAct of God or a generic accident (e.g., slipping and falling), that is not a direct result of an action on anybody's part. \c\cOn 8 May 2012, a 20-year-old man entered a restricted area of the ride and walked into the tunnel. He was rescued and then arrested by the police. The ride resumed operation shortly after. \c\cOn 30 June 2004, due to a strong gust of wind, the Sky Ride cables became caught, jamming the ride. About 80 people were on the ride, and nine people had to be rescued by being abseiled down 60-metre (200 ft) cables. \c\cDuring the 2007 Scarefest season, a fire broke out in the Forbidden Valley section of the park due to a halogen lamp that damaged the roof and mechanics of the ride. The damage was reparable, but the ride had to be closed for six months before reopening midway through the 2008 season. Fortunately, nobody was harmed. \c\cThe Sky Ride suffered another fire on 21 July 2009 in Cloud Cuckoo Land, due to a faulty vending machine. The fire completely destroyed the whole station. Over the following season, the station was rebuilt, and was ready for the 2010 season. \c\cOn 20 July 2006, when the train was entering the tunnel section of its course, the train split into two halves, leaving the rear part behind with the front part continuing up the hill. The front half of the train failed to make it over the slope, rolled back into the tunnel, and collided with the rear half. Six people were taken to hospital, including two women with leg injuries, and 23 others were treated for cuts and bruises. Following the incident, the ride was closed for eight months and reopened in April 2007. \c\cOn 2 November 2013, four people were injured after being hit by flying guide wheels when they fell off one of the trains. \c\cOn 2 June 2015, a train with 16 passengers collided at 32 km/h (20 mph) with a stationary test car that had failed part way round the track. Four passengers — two male, two female, aged between 17 and 27 — suffered serious leg injuries and were airlifted to nearby hospitals for treatment. One of the casualties had to have her left leg amputated due to her injuries while a second casualty had to have her right leg amputated due to the extent of her injuries. A fifth person with neck and abdominal injuries was also taken to hospital. The other 11 riders were believed to have only minor injuries and received medical treatment at the scene. This has been stated to be the biggest incident to ever occur at Alton Towers. The theme park was closed until 7 June 2015 pending the completion of the investigation. Ride staff operating The Smiler at the time of the incident were investigated, after reports that it was manually restarted in similar fashion to the Alton mouse during its incident in 1991, however the criminal investigation concluded that the crash was not caused by individual staff error. This accident also caused Spinball Whizzer and three other roller coasters at sister parks Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures to close until safety procedures were evaluated; these rides reopened shortly afterwards. The Smiler reopened on March 19, 2016. Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd was prosecuted at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on 22 April 2016, in which the firm pleaded guilty, and were sentenced to a £5 million fine on 27 September 2016 after a two-day hearing at Stafford Crown Court.  Victims are suing Alton Towers in the civil courts. \c\cOn 30 May 1972, one of the train cars started to climb the cable hill when the cable suddenly snapped. With there being no anti-rollback device on this attraction, the train rolled back into the station colliding with the other train. Five children were killed and thirteen others injured. The ride (the park's main attraction) was permanently closed, leading to the decline in the popularity of the funfair and its eventual closure at the end of the 1974 season. \c\cOn 10 May 2017, a 2-year-old girl suffered injuries after being struck by another vehicle that was coming towards her. Her father jumped over a fence to rescue her once the ride operator immediately pressed the emergency stop button and brought each car to a sudden halt. The girl was then given first aid assistance from the park's medical staff shortly thereafter. The ride later re-opened, having all its seat belts on each vehicle being checked beforehand during its temporary closure.[citation needed]\c\cOn 28 August 1994, ten people suffered minor injuries when one of the coaster trains collided into another parked at the station. All were treated at a local hospital. \c\cOn 11 August 2009, two trains carrying a total of 32 guests collided, resulting in 21 guests requiring treatment at a nearby hospital for injuries ranging from whiplash and broken noses, to cuts and bruises. \c\cOn 31 August 2000, 23 people were injured, when two trains collided due to a failure of the ride's braking system. \c\cOn 14 June 2011, a train stopped abruptly, causing minor injuries to its occupants. One person was reported to be hospitalised with whiplash injury. \c\cIn May 2004, due to an electrical fault, the entire ride station, along with parts of two other rides, were completely destroyed by a fire. Firefighters used water from the nearby Valhalla ride to put the fire out. The Grand National's station was rebuilt, and the ride reopened on 28 October 2004 after all repairs were completed. \c\cOn 24 October 2014, a 58-year-old man broke his neck whilst riding the Grand National with his 13-year-old nephew. Upon returning to the station, he was found slumped in the carriage and was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital. \c\cOn 21 July 2000, an 11-year-old boy died after falling out of a ride vehicle on the Space Invader roller coaster. Reports say that he may have panicked on the dark ride and unfastened his seatbelt. As a result of the accident, the ride was closed and carriages were re-fitted with over the head restraints. The ride opened after a short hiatus as Space Invader 2. \c\cOn 29 August 2011, a 58-year-old woman sustained severe leg injuries when the Jungle River Log Flume became stuck and jolted, throwing her out of the cabin. She was riding with her four-year-old granddaughter when the accident happened. It is believed that the ride stalled as it didn\'t have enough water in it. The granddaughter was taken to hospital with minor bruising. In July 2017, the ride was replaced by a ferris wheel due to the accident. \c\cOn 30 August 2011 at 3:15pm, emergency services were called to the ride after reports that the arm had collapsed. Firefighters used ropes and ladders to rescue the 22 passengers who had become lodged at a 90 degree angle. Seven passengers were injured and taken to hospital, including one woman with life-threatening head injuries. It was reported that the ride had maintenance done in the previous few days. \c\cOn 8 April 2019, four people were injured when the ride became loose.[citation needed]\c\cOn 23 August 2011, a 12-year-old boy fell from the ride. Fortunately, he survived. Witnesses say the boy clung to the ride until he fell 9 m (30 ft). \c\cOn 22 October 2001, a 59-year-old employee was killed as he was struck by a train when he was performing maintenance on the ride. Prime Resorts Limited was fined £40,000 and ordered to pay £20,000 costs, after a court decided the death was caused by fundamental management errors. \c\cOn 7 June 2012, a 4-year-old girl fell from an elevated walkway used as the queue for the Tomb Blaster attraction. The girl suffered broken ribs, a cracked skull, and brain hemorrhage after falling 4.3 m (14 ft) through a hole in the wooden fencing. On Friday 9 January 2015, Chessington plead guilty to the incident labeling it a result of improper maintenance. H&S investigators said the fall happened as a result of water from the roof dripping onto the paneling, rotting the wood. On Monday 12 January 2015, Chessington World of Adventures Operations Ltd. was fined £150,000 as a result of the fall. Operator Merlin Entertainments apologised and said that they had since spent millions on remedial work across the park to ensure something  similar could never occur again. One improvement made involved adding a steel rail fence to the Tomb Blaster queue. \c\cOn 1 April 1994, a 9-year-old boy was killed after being flung off the 58-year-old "Water Chute" ride when a steel hoop collapsed in wet and windy conditions and fell onto the open-topped carriage in which he was travelling. \c\cOn 3 August 2012, a 42-year-old woman collapsed and died of a heart attack after coming off the Maelstrom ride. It has been stated that the woman was on a day out with her 14-year-old daughter, who later posted on Facebook "RIP Momma, I love you". \c\cOn 9 May 2017, an 11-year-old girl fell out of a raft on the Splash Canyon Rapids ride. She then climbed an \'algae-covered travellator\' before slipping and falling into a deeper pool of water where she drowned. According to Drayton Manor's director, George Bryan, park staff responded immediately and rescued the girl from the water. The girl was airlifted to Birmingham Children's Hospital, but was proclaimed dead from her drowning soon after arrival. The park was temporarily closed after the incident. \c\cOn 16 August 2018, a 37-year-old employee of the park was hit by a train on the Hyperion roller coaster when picking up a cell phone, which had been dropped in the station by one of the guests. Shortly after he died due to the injuries. \c\cOn Saturday, 26 May 2018, a large fire destroyed the ride and parts of the Dutch- and Scandinavian-themed areas. Seven first responders suffered smoke inhalation. No visitors were injured, as the park evacuated 25,000 guests. Reopened in July 2020\c\cOn 5 August 2020, a park employee was taken to the hospital after suffering injuries to his legs while trying to repair the ride. His injuries were not considered to have been life-threatening despite having been serious. \c\cOn 1 June 2004, a 32-year-old employee was injured by the Magnum Force roller coaster due to him crossing through a restricted area under the coaster as a shortcut through the park. \c\cOn 22 May 2015, a 15-year-old girl and a 26-year-old woman were injured after a footrail dislodged while in motion and landed in the queue for the ride. The 15-year-old girl was taken to Scarborough General Hospital where she received treatment for her head injuries, whereas the 26-year-old woman was treated at the scene. Although both sustained head injuries, North Yorkshire Police released a statement claiming that neither was life-threatening. The ride was taken out of operation in accordance with Flamingo Land's operational procedures, and underwent a full inspection in conjunction with North Yorkshire Police and the HSE (Health and Safety Executive). The ride has since reopened with nets above the waiting line to catch any falling items, and is in full operation. \c\cOn 26 December 2016, a 6-year-old girl suffered head injuries while riding in the rotating teacups. She was hospitalized at Borgo Trento Hospital in Verona. \c\cOn 2 June 2000, a 12-year-old boy died as a result of injuries sustained at Gray's Amusement Park in Ingoldmells near Skegness. He was hit in the chest by a manual swing, known as The Swinging Gym. The incident was described as a tragic accident. \c\cOn 17 May 2006, a 56-year-old park employee was performing safety checks on the train when his head hit on a bridge as the train dragged him through a tunnel, killing him. \c\cOn 13 July 2002, a 15-year-old girl with Down syndrome fell 9 m (30 ft) from a Ferris wheel. The teenager was taken to hospital, but died two days later from her injuries. The park was fined a total of £80,000 for failing to ensure a person's safety, and not carrying out risk assessments. \c\cOn 17 September 2018, The Crazy Train rollercoaster malfunctioned, which caused wheels to fly off the ride. 21 people including children were trapped 15 m (50 ft) above the ground for up to two hours. \c\cOn 9 April 2005, 18 people were injured when a Flying Swinger ride collapsed at Guillena Zoo near Seville, Spain. Out of all the 18 injured, 15 were children. Four were seriously injured, including an 11-year-old girl and a woman, who were airlifted to a hospital in Seville, after sustaining serious head and leg injuries. Witnesses said that the attraction's main support snapped in two, trapping victims under the debris. The ride, built in 2001, had just passed all of its required safety inspections. \c\cOn 15 August 2014, an 11-year-old girl was killed after being run over by several gondolas. The girl entered the ride via an unlocked door. When an employee turned on the ride and did not notice the girl was not inside the gondola, the girl tripped and fell. An employee of the park was sentenced to a fine of €2,400 for negligent homicide. After the incident, the ride was closed and sold. \c\cOn 29 April 2007, a 21-year-old park employee was killed by a ride vehicle on The Xtreme Racer, a roller coaster at the Billund, Denmark park, as she climbed over a security fence to retrieve a guest's wallet. \c\cA 20-year-old woman died on 21 June 2001 following an accident the previous day when two carriages on the Twister roller coaster collided.  Police decided not to prosecute a maintenance worker, who claimed that he had only received an hour's training on that ride and had not seen its manual. Faulty wiring had also caused a malfunction on the ride. In October 2004, the deputy coroner ruled death by misadventure. On 14 November 2006, the park was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of riders, and the ride operator was charged with failing to ensure safety through his work. Both pleaded guilty. The ride manufacturer, Reverchon Industries SA, was convicted of two charges of failing to ensure the ride's safe design and construction. \c\cOn 30 May 2019, a 6-year-old boy fell from a ride carriage and suffered head injuries. The child was later airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary and fully recovered. After the accident, the ride was shut down for the rest of the 2019 season and was later sold. \c\cOn 14 July 2016, a 55-year-old man nearly fell 26 m (85 ft) from his seat off the ride after his safety restraints were unlocked. His carer rescued him by grabbing onto his wrists. \c\cIn June 1994, a deer was decapitated by the roller coaster when it stumbled onto the tracks. The roller coaster smashed into the deer in a collision, causing passengers to be covered in blood. The ride was closed and reopened shortly. A 12 year old boy was injured in the accident and was taken to hospital. \c\cIn September 2014, another deer was hit by a train. No riders were injured, but the deer was killed instantly. The ride was shut down for 30 minutes and resumed normal operation afterwards. \c\cOn 15 July 2006, 21 people were injured when two trains on the Lisebergbanan rollercoaster collided. The crash happened when the chain that pulls trains up the initial climb malfunctioned, causing a fully loaded train to roll backward into the loading platform, hitting another train that was unloading riders. Since only part of the train was on the lift, the anti-rollback mechanism had not fully engaged and broke. The steel roller coaster was built in 1987 and is one of Sweden's largest, reaching speeds up to 80 km/h (50 mph). Since the accident the roller coaster has opened again, after a technical adjustment and is in full operation. \c\cOn 8 October 2006, a woman in her thirties was seriously injured on the Flumeride log boat ride. At the second and final drop, a 14 m (46 ft) slope, the woman apparently panicked, and tried to keep the log boat from travelling down the slope by holding onto the railings. She was ejected from the boat into the water and slid down the slope, where she was hit in the head by at least one of the two following log boats. Since she had managed to temporarily keep the log boat from dropping down the slope, the following two log boats passed the last safety gate, and couldn\'t be stopped from falling down the last slope where the woman was located. The event was witnessed by the staff who stopped the ride, but were unable to prevent two of the log boats from continuing. The woman, who was travelling together with her 11-year-old daughter and another woman, was taken to Sahlgrenska University Hospital, where she was reported to be in critical but stable condition. An investigation has been initiated by the authorities, and Liseberg has also initiated an internal inquiry. She eventually fully recovered.[citation needed]\c\cOn 15 July 2008, 30 people were injured when the ride collapsed. The park manager stated that he believes a ball bearing on the ride failed. The ride was dismantled on 17 July 2008. Investigators then confirmed on 19 July 2008 that they had discovered a faulty drive shaft during their inspection. They believed that one of the axles that is designed to hold the passenger carriage horizontal failed. The drive shaft had been replaced by Huss Maschinefabrik, the ride's manufacturer, in 2003. \c\cOn 16 July 2007, an 18-year-old park worker with mild cerebral palsy died after falling 24 m (80 ft) from the Rat ride at the Scottish Park. He was on a day off on 15 July 2007 when it is believed he saw one of the carriages stuck on the ride. He climbed up to attempt to fix the ride; however when it started to move he was dragged to the highest point, when he lost his grip and fell. The park voluntarily closed the ride even after it passed inspection. \c\cOn 10 August 2015, a woman broke her leg after one of the bungee lines snapped on a slingshot-style bungee ride, causing the carriage to hit one of the supporting poles. \c\cOn 4 July 2011, nine people, ranging in age from 9 to 49, had to be rescued from the Tsunami roller coaster, after a mechanical failure on the ride left them stranded 60 ft (18.2m) above the ground for up to eight hours. \c\cOn 26 June 2016, the roller coaster derailed, falling into the crowd below, injuring seven children and two adults. On the way down, it hit the main structure and came to rest on a nearby children's ride. Ten park guests were taken to local hospitals for treatment. The park was evacuated following the incident. The ride was dismantled and removed eight months later. \c\cAround 2013, there was an incident on the White Water Log Flume in which a woman's leg was trapped between a barrier and a splashback on the ride's structure, causing a serious injury. \c\cIn August 2015, three people were injured when the White Water Log Flume slipped on its track, and later the same month a 58-year-old woman and three teenagers had to walk down from the top of the ride after it stuck at the highest point. \c\cOn 28 September 2007, a man was killed at the Mirabilandia theme park in Ravenna, Italy, when he was  hit in the head by the leg of a female rider on the Katun inverted coaster. The girl whose leg struck the man was injured. The man was in a restricted area when he was struck, however the ride was still closed so officials could investigate. \c\cOn 13 August 2011, a 24-year-old ride operator was crushed by two trains at the Naudières theme park in Sautron, France. The man left the control booth of the ride whilst it was in motion. He slipped trapping his legs beneath the track and then was hit by a train, trapping him between two cars, crushing him beneath the ride's structure. Doctors amputated his legs at the scene, but he later died of his injuries. The park closed the next day due to \'very bad weather\'. \c\cOn 4 April 2005, the former golf coaster was stopped by a guest while going into a curve that would naturally slow down the ride. The technician called managed to make the ride work again, but it ended up colliding with the technician's machine, hurting several rider's legs, one seriously. The attraction was closed down and removed from the park afterwards. \c\cOn 15 April 2004, a 16-year-old girl from Pontypool was killed after falling approximately 30 m (100 ft) from the top of the Hydro (now called Drenched) ride.  During the Coroner's inquest, the jury returned a narrative verdict stating that the victim died due to not being properly restrained.  In February 2008, Oakwood was charged by the Health and Safety Executive for park staff not ensuring that guests were properly and safely restrained.  On 22 May 2008, magistrates in Haverfordwest magistrates court rejected Oakwood Leisure Limited's request for an adjournment and directed that the hearing should proceed on the assumption of a not guilty plea.  The magistrates declined jurisdiction and adjourned the case which was committed for crown court trial in Swansea Crown Court on 7 July 2008. The magistrates\' court was limited to fining the company £20,000, the crown court can impose an unlimited fine. On 8 July 2008, Oakwood plead guilty under the Health and Safety Act 1974 for failing to conduct its business such to ensure that its guests were not exposed to risks. In December 2008 the company was fined £250,000 plus £80,000 in costs. \c\cOn July 15, 2005, a brake failure on the then brand-new coaster caused an incoming train to crash into several others on the brake run, slightly injuring 11 riders. \c\cOn August 22, 2009, a 35-year old woman was thrown from the ride on a hairpin turn, approximately 10 metres (33 ft) above ground. She died of cardiac arrest some 10 minutes later. An investigation reported that the woman had not followed safety procedures, and thus her death was not declared as a direct result of the park. The coaster reopened some time later. \c\cOn July 4, 2020, around 1:45 PM, a 32-year old woman was ejected from the car mid-ride, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Following an investigation, it was determined that park owner Gilles Campion had deemed the ride's seatbelts unnecessary after the ride passed its November 2019 safety inspection, and subsequently had them removed from the ride vehicles. The ride was scrapped some time after. \c\cOn August 17, 2005, the front car of the Looping derailed mid-ride, seriously injuring 4 riders and placing one of them in a coma. The coaster was removed immediately and placed in storage for several years. In 2007, three of the four victims received 6,000 € in expenses, and after a lengthly court battle, park owner Gilles Campion was given a suspended 4 month prison sentence and ordered to pay for all damages. \c\cOn 13 April 2019, a 44-year-old mother and her 7-year-old son were ejected from the 55-metre-tall (180-foot) aerial chair-swing when parts of their seat tore off, due to their chair hitting a nearby ride after reportedly going too fast on too wide an angle. The boy suffered an exposed fracture on his right leg, while his mother lacerated her left knee, broke her right hand and suffered a concussion. \c\cOn 16 July 2017, 33 people were injured when two trains collided with each other as the train they were riding in failed to stop after finishing its run and hit another one which was just about to leave the station. 27 of them were taken to the hospital suffering minor injuries. Paramedics said that six children who were under the age of 10 were also injured in the accident. An emergency service spokesperson said that none of the injuries were considered serious and the guests who were riding have all been treated for neck, back and stomach pains. \c\cOn 26 May 2016, 15 passengers were evacuated from the ride after being stuck 14 m (45 ft) in the air for 40 minutes when it broke down during the morning hours of operation. No injuries were reported. \c\cOn 1 May 2001, a fire broke out at the Phantasialand theme park in Brühl, near Cologne, Germany. 54 people were injured during the fire, however no one was seriously hurt. The fire broke out on the powered roller coaster Grand Canyon Achterbahn, which was located inside the structure of the bigger roller coaster Gebirgsbahn on a day when the park was filled with 20,000 visitors. The park's founder said a cable fire was most likely the cause of the blaze. There were 150 passengers on the two rides when the fire broke out. Some passengers of the Gebirgsbahn were only able to exit the cars using a 18 m (60 ft) ladder. The mostly polystyrene facade was coated with a fire-resistant film; however, it had lost its effect after years of operation and caught fire. The two roller coasters and the nearby Tanagra Theater were completely destroyed and demolished shortly after. Following this accident, the park improved the safety standards on many of its attractions. This resulted in some compromises. Some of the effects on the park's rides had to be removed, the upper floor of the IMAX simulator Galaxy (later: Race for Atlantis) was permanently closed and the track of the Gondelbahn 1001-Nacht dark ride was shortened to make room for a rescue passage for firetrucks. The park also installed new sprinkler systems in some of the rides like the Silbermine dark ride. Today the rapid river River Quest is located on the site of the two roller coasters. The Tanagra Theater was replaced with the Vekoma Mad House Feng Ju Palace. \c\cOn 14 May 2011, a 48-year-old man died while riding Black Mamba, an inverted roller coaster. According to German safety inspectors, the roller coaster and all safety features were sound and passed extensive testings by the TÜV. Autopsy showed that the death was caused by a heart attack. \c\cOn 14 March 2017, a 58-year-old employee fractured his neck while performing maintenance on the ride. He later died from his injuries. \c\cOn 5 July 2006, a 6-year-old Belgian boy drowned as he was dragged underwater by the current. The boy was with a group of friends and supervisors in a boat propelled by rapids, waterfalls and geysers in the attraction \'La Descente du Styx\'. It is alleged that the boy stood up too early as the boat reached the end point. Another boat collided with the boy's boat, knocking him into the water. Two people dived in after the boy, but he\'d disappeared in the artificial waves of the attraction. When he was found 20 minutes later, resuscitation efforts were of no avail. \c\cIn July 2004, an 11-year-old boy was hit by lightning at the foot of the Tonnerre de Zeus (Zeus\' Thunder). The park had continued operating despite weather warnings. \c\cOn 18 May 2009, a 55-year-old park employee died after being run over by a roller coaster train as he was performing maintenance. \c\cOn 14 September 2018, a 19-year-old man was injured after falling while waiting in line to ride the log flume. He suffered a traumatic cranioencephalic injury and fractured his arms and legs. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment and later recovered. \c\cOn 7 April 2017, an online viral video showed a man being hit by a passing pigeon while riding the Red Force roller coaster, which attains up to 180 km/h (112 mph) . The area of the park also opened the same day when it occurred. The man suffered minor injuries and received some cuts on his face, which was bleeding after the ride. \c\cOn 25 August 2004, a 59-year-old employee was killed after he became trapped. The park was fined £95,000 for breaching health and safety laws, and were also ordered to pay £50,000 in costs.[citation needed]\c\cOn 5 April 2010, a Viennese man was seriously injured after trying to jump onto a high-speed carousel ride at Vienna's Prater amusement park. The 34-year-old was drunk when he attempted to get back on the ride after it had started by hurling himself at the spinning carousel. He died soon after from multiple life-threatening injuries. \c\cThree people were injured on the Volare roller coaster on 22 October 2010, when a crane crashed against the ride. The \'wagon\' steered into the crane's hoist, set close to the ride. A 21-year-old Macedonian man sustained serious head injuries when he fell 8 m (26 ft) to the ground from the platform supported by the crane. One tourist sustained a broken arm while her friend suffered cuts and bruises. The official accident report says the employee operating the roller coaster was unaware the worker was busy on the scaffolding when he started up the ride. Newspapers, however, report that the attraction has been in operation many times while the painters were busy. \c\cOn 11 September 1999, an 8-year-old girl died after falling from the coaster and hitting her head on a steel support. On 19 February 2003, Dreamland Leisure denied the charge but was found guilty of negligence in ensuring guest safety. The company was fined £25,000 and ordered to pay £140,000 in costs and  £15,000 in compensation to the victim's mother. \c\cOn 7 July 2014, a teenager was killed after his harness sprung open on Inferno, a ZacSpin coaster at Terra Mítica in Benidorm, Spain. All other ZacSpin across the world ceased operations pending investigation findings from Terra Mítica and later reopened. \c\cIn April 2014, a 14-year-old girl from Colchester was injured by the safety bar. In a subsequent claim against the park's insurers, she was awarded £20,000 for nerve damage, a swollen knee joint, long-term hypersensitivity, and soft tissue damage. The claim stated that the ride attendants put too many guests into the ride vehicle, which forced the victim's legs into the safety barrier. The ride closed in November 2015, and closed permanently in 2019. This was unrelated to the accident. \c\cIn the ride's opening year of 1987, a 7 year-old boy was thrown from a boat and lost an ear.  The news was broken by Children's BBC TV news programme, Newsround. \c\cOn 31 August 2000, an 11-year-old boy broke both his legs and was left with slurred speech after suffering a brain injury (left vertebral artery dissection) on the ride caused by falling out of the car.[citation needed]\c\cOn 15 September 2018, a seat's rear fibreglass cover fell off mid-ride, just missing the riders. The seat was unoccupied (labelled \'Do not use\') at the time of the incident. Nobody was injured.[citation needed]\c\cOn July 21, 2000, a fire broke out in the Ranger County area of the park. The fire started at 3pm at Mr. Rabbit's Tropical Travel, quickly spreading to Wicked Witches Haunt. Wicked Witches Haunt was removed and the indoor section of Mr Rabbit's Tropical Travels was destroyed. No one was injured. The cause of the fire is unknown, but sources say that the fire was started by a lit cigarette that was thrown aside. \c\cOn September 22, 2001, two teenagers sustained minor injuries when one support on a gondola broke on Zodiac; a HUSS Enterprise flat ride. The gondola repeatedly hit the decking at the bottom of the ride whilst the operator attempted to stop the ride. The incident was taken to court, where the judge criticised the length of time it took to shut down the ride after an abnormal noise had been noticed. The park was fined £65,000 and made to pay an extra £35,000 in costs. \c\cOn 10 July 2010, a 15-year-old girl died and three other teenagers were injured when the mechanical arm of the Pèndol broke and the basket carrying the four teens fell onto a nearby ride. \c\cOn 4 July 2008, four unidentified people were injured while riding the Cobra coaster. The ride vehicle broke in two, with the front part of the train falling to the ground. \c\cOn 5 August 2002, a 16-year-old male employee of the park was struck and killed by the ride while it was in operation. \c\cOn 26 August 2006, a 22-year-old man died in an accident after he stood up in the ghost train car, fell out over the side, and broke his neck against the wall. \c\cOn 5 July 1994, 15 riders suffered injuries when one of the trains collided into the other parked at the station. Six of the 40 passengers that were on board the ride were taken to a nearby hospital while others were treated at the park. \c\cOn 24 July 2013, a 10-year-old girl was seriously injured when her foot got stuck on one of the boats. It was later reported by the police that once they rescued her, one of her feet was missing. The girl was taken to a nearby hospital and had her foot amputated. After the incident, many signs were put on the ride to ensure the safety of all guests. \c\cOn 16 April 2016, a 3-year-old boy was unconscious while visiting the park with his parents. Paramedics tried to revive him, but he was dead after arriving to the hospital. It was stated that the boy was not on a ride at the park and also had a health condition at the time of his death. \c\cOn 11 August 2016, a 9-year-old girl cut both her legs which were bleeding profusely after one of the mirrors shattered in the Martians Mirror Maze attraction. She was taken to a nearby hospital and received 20 stitches. \c\cOn 5 September 2004, a seven-year-old girl died after sustaining severe head injuries after falling to the ground while exiting the ride.
The insurgency in the Maghreb refers to the Islamist insurgency in the Maghreb and Sahel regions of North Africa that followed on from the Algerian Civil War. The Algerian militant group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) allied itself with al-Qaeda to eventually become al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The Algerian and other Maghreb governments fighting the militants have worked with the United States and the United Kingdom since 2007, when Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara began. While the 2011 Arab Spring affected support for the insurgency, it also presented military opportunities for the jihadists. In 2012, AQIM and Islamist allies captured the northern half of Mali, until being fought back less than a year later following a French-led foreign intervention, which was succeeded by the Sahel-wide Operation Barkhane. In Libya, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has been able to control some limited territory in the ongoing civil war since 2014, amid allegations of local collaboration between the rival AQIM and ISIL. \c\cWith the decline of the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA), the GSPC was left as the most active rebel group, with about 300 fighters in 2003. It continued an assassination campaign of police and army personnel in its area, and also managed to expand into the Sahara, where its southern division, led by Amari Saifi (nicknamed "Abderrezak el-Para", the "paratrooper"), kidnapped a number of German tourists in 2003, before being forced to flee to sparsely populated areas of Mali, and later Niger and Chad, where he was captured. \c\cSome believe that el-Para actually works for the Algerian government. By late 2003, the group's founder had been supplanted by the even more radical Nabil Sahraoui, who announced his open support for al-Qaeda, thus strengthening government ties between the U.S. and Algeria. He was reportedly killed shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud in 2004. \c\cThe GSPC has declared its intention to attack Algerian, French, and American targets. It has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. Department of State, and similarly classed as a terrorist organization by the European Union. \c\cThe conflict with the GSPC continued to result in a significant number of casualties in Algeria, with over 1,100 killed in clashes with Islamist rebels in 2002. In 2003, a total 1,162 were killed in clashes in Algeria, followed by 429 killed in 2004, 488 killed in 2005, and 323 killed in 2006. In early 2006, the head of the Algerian national police claimed that terrorism had nearly been eliminated in the country, but significant attacks continued, and 2007 would eventually mark a height of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in Algeria. \c\cIn order to improve recruiting and funding, the GSPC aligned itself with al-Qaeda, and on 11 September 2006, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri announced a union between the groups. The GSPC rebranded itself as al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in January 2007, signaling the broadened aspirations of the group. \c\cThe group now aimed to overthrow all North African governments deemed apostate, including those of Algeria, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. Operations were shifted into two broader "sectors", Northern Algeria and Tunisia allocated a "central emirate", and northern Mali, Niger, Mauritania and Libya a "Sahara emirate" led by Djamel Okacha. The strategic leadership of AQIM continued to be headquartered in the mountainous region of Kabylie east of the Algerian capital Algiers, headed by a 14-member Shura council leadership. \c\cAs the Algerian counterterrorism campaign became largely successful in pushing AQIM out of the country, the group established new bases in Sahel countries such as Niger, Mauritania, Chad and Mali. Attacks against government and military installations were frequently underreported by Western media. In 2007, the United States and United Kingdom launched the Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara in support of governments in the region. \c\cFrequent kidnappings of foreigners in 2008 led the Dakar Rally to be cancelled and permanently moved to South America. \c\cIn the earliest major attack as direct spillover of the Algerian conflict, the Mauritanian army base Lemgheity was attacked by the GSPC in June 2005, killing 17 soldiers (and nine jihadists), and wounding another 17. The attack in part led to a coup d\'état in October 2005 by Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who made a campaign against jihadists a major part of his rule. Attacks continued in Mauritania until it was largely successful in thwarting attacks since 2011 following a major military boost and political openings for Islamists. AQIM has however continued to remain active in the eastern border-regions with Mali, with active support systems for logistics and information. A lack of military resources, often due to turmoil and having little population in a very large country, caused Mauritania to rely on support from France, Morocco, and Algeria in order to defeat the AQIM. \c\cIn December 2006 and again in January 2007, Tunisian security forces engaged in clashes with a group linked to the GSPC that had established training camps in mountainous areas near the capital Tunis, killing more than a dozen people. According to French daily Le Parisien at least 60 people were killed in the clashes. The clashes were the most serious terrorist activity in Tunisia since the Ghriba synagogue bombing in 2002. \c\cStarting in 2012, AQIM along with Ansar al-Sharia and the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade active in the mountainous Jebel ech Chambi region outside Kasserine near the Algeria–Tunisia border have been targeted by the Tunisian Army in the Chaambi Operations. In 2014, Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade militants attacked two Tunisian military checkpoints, killing fourteen Tunisian soldiers and injuring twenty-five in what was the deadliest military skirmish in Tunisia since its independence in 1956. Since 2015, Tunisia has simultaneously been targeted by an ISIL terrorist campaign. In March 2016 over 50 militants were killed when ISIL attempted to seize Ben Guerdane near the Libya–Tunisia border. \c\cSince the Libyan Civil War in 2011, south-western Libya has offered sanctuaries to AQIM which has dispatched cells to be established in the region. On 11 September 2012, members of Ansar al-Sharia and AQIM were responsible for coordinated attacks against two United States government facilities in Benghazi, and Ansar al-Sharia was later involved in clashes in Benghazi in 2013. Drawing defectors from AQIM, the rival Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was later able to control some limited territory in the north in the renewed civil war from 2014. After initial official support from AQIM, allegations have continued of local collaboration between the otherwise rivalling groups. After being pushed out of Derna, the remaining ISIL stronghold of Sirte was captured in late 2016. Al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamists led by Ansar al-Sharia have at the same time continued to exert control in other places. \c\cIn 2012, AQIM and allied Islamist groups Ansar Dine and Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA) were able to capture the northern half of Mali after effectively overrunning the preceding Tuareg rebellion, which in turn had been sparked by former Tuareg fighters from the Libyan Civil War. In 2012 Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted in a coup d\'état over his handling of the conflict. After Ansar Dine attempted a push into the south of the country, Mali requested France to launch a military intervention in January 2013 which successfully pushed rebels out. The military intervention was followed by an ongoing Sahel-wide French-led military operation with around 4,000 French soldiers actively deployed. \c\cSmall pockets of armed Islamists have remained active in northern Mali, and attacks have continued against the UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA, which has become one of the UN's deadliest international missions. \c\cHaving cooperated and trained alongside AQIM in the Sahel since 2006, the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram began expanding into Chad and Niger in 2014 after successfully seizing territory in the insurgency in Nigeria. By then controlling a significant area around Lake Chad, a coalition of Western African countries launched an offensive against the group in January 2015. The group eventually departed its alliance with al-Qaeda, pledging allegiance to ISIL in March 2015. By the end of 2015 Boko Haram had been largely pushed to retreat into the Sambisa Forest in Nigeria, although attacks have continued including in Niger. \c\cAlgerian Civil War with the GIA is considered to have ended in February 2002, GSPC continues insurgency. \c\cApril 11, 2002 - Ghriba synagogue bombing killed 22 (14 German tourists, 5 Tunisians, and 2 French nationals and the suicide bomber). \c\cMay 5, 2002 - 15 government soldiers are killed in an ambush near Tizi Ouzou, in the Kabylie region of northern Algeria.

The Northern Chad offensive was initiated by the Chadian rebel group Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) on 11 April 2021. It began in the Tibesti Region in the north of the country following the 2021 Chadian presidential election. President Idriss Déby was killed during the offensive on 20 April. \c\cIn the 2021 Chadian presidential election, Idriss Déby, who seized power in the 1990 coup d\'état, was expected to extend his mandate of 30 years in power. The Independent National Election Commission (CENI) had indicated that Déby had taken a large lead with 30% of the votes cast still to be counted. Déby won all but one of the departments of the country. In not recognizing the results, the opposition had called to boycott the 11 April election with Yacine Abderaman Sakine of the Reform Party refusing to concede the victory to Déby. Preliminary results are expected on 25 April. Déby was seen in Europe and the United States as an ally in the fight against the Boko Haram insurgency and other terrorism in West and Central Africa. \c\cOn the day of the election, the Libyan-based group Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) launched an attack on a border post of the military of Chad. FACT is under the protection of Libyan military warlord Khalifa Haftar and often clashes with the Chadian military. \c\cAfter the 11 April border attack, the FACT forces entered the country on convoys and clashed with the army in several cities and towns and headed toward N\'Djamena, the capital of Chad. As a result of the growing instability, the United States and the United Kingdom withdrew diplomatic staff from the country. On 19 April, FACT claimed to have taken control of the former Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti prefecture. \c\cAs of 19 April 2021, clashes continued between FACT forces and elements of the Chadian Armed Forces. FACT forces claimed independence in the northern part of the Tibesti Region. At least 300 FACT fighters were reportedly killed in the clashes whilst at least five Chadian soldiers had also been killed during the confrontation, which increased political tension in the country. The army said on 19 April that they had "completely destroyed" FACT convoys heading towards the capital. An army spokesman said that the convoys were "decimated" in the northern province of Kanem. After the clashes, Gen. Azem Bermandoa Agouna of the Chadian Armed Forces claimed that the army had captured 150 FACT fighters and also reported 36 wounded Chadian soldiers. \c\cOn 19 April 2021, President Idriss Déby was killed on the frontline. His son Mahamat Déby Itno succeeded him as head of the Transitional Military Council of Chad (TMC). Rebels vowed to continue their offensive on the capital following Déby's death. \c\cThe following day, FACT rebels defended their campaign towards Chad's capital, N\'Djamena, and rejected the transitional military junta led by Déby's son as the legitimate government of Chad. Although stores and other facilities remained open, many civilians reportedly chose to stay home amidst rising fears of conflict. Opposition politicians asked Déby's son, Mahamat Déby Itno, for a quick civilian transition. Another rebel group, the Military Command Council for the Salvation of the Republic (CCMSR), also declared that it would support FACT in its offensive against the TMC. \c\cOn 21 April, a rebel base in northern Chad was allegedly bombed. Rebels claimed that airstrikes were used to try and target their leader, Mahamat Mahadi Ali, and accused France of supporting the raid. \c\cOn 24 April, a rebel spokesman said that FACT was "preparing to advance" towards N\'Djamena and that they "did not accept any military government". The spokesman further accused France of conducting airstrikes against the group, something which France denied. \c\cReactions to Déby's death included condemnation of the ongoing violence in Chad, in addition to condolences. The reactions came from the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations, as well as from representatives of several countries, including China, France, Israel, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Turkey and the United States. On 22 April 2021, France publicly defended the military takeover of the government by Déby's son, despite it being unconstitutional, saying that it was necessary under "exceptional circumstances."
The COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Bangladesh in March 2020. The first three known cases were reported on 8 March 2020 by the country's epidemiology institute, IEDCR. Since then, the pandemic has spread day by day over the whole nation and the number of affected people has been increasing. \c\cIn order to protect the population, the government declared "lockdown" throughout the nation from 23 March to 30 May and prepared some necessary steps to spread awareness to keep this syndrome away from them. Infections remained low until the end of March but saw a steep rise in April. \c\cIn the week ending on 11 April, new cases in Bangladesh grew by 1,155 percent, the highest in Asia, ahead of Indonesia, with 186 percent. \c\cOn 6 May, cases were confirmed in all districts. Rangamati was the last district to report confirmed cases of COVID-19. On 13 June, the number of cases in Bangladesh exceeded the number of cases in China, the country where the outbreak began. Bangladesh reached two grim milestones of 160,000 cases and 2,000 deaths on 5 July and overtook France in terms of the number of cases two days later. The number of recoveries in the country exceeded the number of active cases on 12 July. \c\cBangladesh is the third most affected country in South Asia, after India and Pakistan. \c\cMedical experts feared that not enough tests were being conducted. Newspaper reports and social media continued to report about additional deaths of patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Some of the deceased were treated at COVID-19 isolation centres at hospitals in the districts and others were denied treatment, though no tests were conducted to confirm contagion. For a long time, testing was centralised to only Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in the capital Dhaka, although patients with symptoms were reported all around the country. On 22 March, Bangladesh declared a 10-day shut down effective from 26 March to 4 April. This was later extended to 30 May. \c\cA series of hotline numbers, email address and the Facebook page of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) are provided for people to contact if they suspect COVID-19 infection or need more information. \c\cOn 31 December 2019, China reported to the WHO cases of pneumonia with unknown causes. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cBangladesh faces significant challenges in combating COVID-19 as it is a densely populated country and also houses a million stateless Rohingya refugees in sprawling refugee camps that are conducive to the spread of epidemics. It also has significant migrant populations living in Italy, a COVID-affected country. \c\cOn 22 January, the authorities at the Dhaka airport put the airports on alert by screening travellers from China. \c\cOn 1 February, a special flight from Bangladesh evacuated 312 Bangladeshi citizens stranded in Wuhan. \c\cThe evacuees were quarantined for 14 days at the Ashkona Hajj Camp in Dhaka and other locations. None of them tested positive for the coronavirus. \c\cOn 8 March, the first three coronavirus cases were confirmed. They included two men that recently returned from Italy and a female relative. On the same day, the government decided to scale down the grand ceremony planned for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's birth centenary on 17 March. \c\cOn 15 March 142 passengers returned from Italy, who were also taken to the Ashkona Hajj camp. After they complained about the unsanitary conditions there, many of them were allowed to go home with advice to self-isolate. Health experts expressed serious reservations about the action. \c\cOn 18 March, Bangladesh reported its first coronavirus death. The patient was aged over 70 and had other morbidities. By the end of March Bangladesh had reported 51 confirmed cases and five deaths.[citation needed]\c\cThe government imposed "general holiday" (i.e. general lock-down) came into effect on 26 March, it was announced on 23 March and initially stated to be in place until 4 April. \c\cThe "general holiday" (lockdown) due to end on 4 April was extended to April 11, then to April 14, then to April 25 and then again to May 5. \c\cBangladesh crossed the figure of 100 confirmed cases on 6 April and 1,000 confirmed cases on 14 April.[citation needed] On 20 April, the number of confirmed deaths crossed 100. \c\cThe "general holiday\' (lockdown) was extended to May 7, then to May 16 and finally to May 30, with the government announcing on May 27 there will be no further extension. On the topic of easing the lockdown measures, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said "Economic activities have to be resumed for the sake of the lives and livelihoods of people. Most countries of the world have already been compelled to relax shutdown because it is not possible to restrict people's source of income for an indefinite period. And it is not at all possible for a developing country like Bangladesh too."\c\cOn June 18, the number of confirmed cases crossed 100,000 (one lakh) people. \c\cOn July 18, the number of confirmed cases crossed 200,000 (two lakh) people. \c\cIt was widely argued in the national media to declare proclamation of emergency[citation needed] although the Sheikh Hasina government pragmatically handled the COVID-19 situation within the constitutional scheme of normal times. \c\cOn 23 March, when Bangladesh had 33 confirmed cases, the government declared a ten-day nationwide holiday for the period 26 March – 4 April, ordering all public and private offices to be closed, with the exception for emergency services. People have been asked to practice social distancing and stay at home. Public transport would be limited and advice was given to avoid them. The measure has been described as a "lockdown" by the media, albeit a "relaxed" one. The government asked the Army to ensure social distancing. ABC News Australia reported that 290 teams of soldiers were deployed across the country, that streets were empty in the capital Dhaka and the roadside shops were closed. It also said that thousands of people left Dhaka for their home villages. \c\cThe "general holiday" (lockdown) was extended several times throughout April and May, until officially ceasing on 30 May 2020. Ending the lockdown appears to have been primarily driven by concerns regarding its economic impact, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina saying "Economic activities have to be resumed for the sake of the lives and livelihoods of people. Most countries of the world have already been compelled to relax shutdown because it is not possible to restrict people's source of income for an indefinite period. And it is not at all possible for a developing country like Bangladesh too."\c\cOn 9 April, Bangladesh imposed a \'complete lockdown\' on the Cox's Bazar District where the majority of the Rohingya refugee camps are located. "No entry, no exit – until the situation improves", said the government directive. \c\cThe final set of restrictions on public movement were officially lifted on 1 September. These restrictions had included prohibiting movement outdoors from 10 PM to 5 AM (except in case of emergencies), the closure of all shops, bazaars and malls after 8 PM and the prohibition of meetings, rallies and mass gatherings (which had come into effect from 4 August). The Road Transport and Bridges Ministry had also announced on 29 August that the restrictions on buses, which had hitherto directed buses to run below seat capacity and charge higher fares to passengers, would end. A number of health experts expressed their concern at the news. Virologist Dr Nazrul Islam, member of the National Technical Advisory Committee for COVID-19 and former VC of BSMMU, said "the disease transmission rate should be under 5%, but till now the daily positive cases rate is still 15.97% and on Monday it was around 17%. So, it can be said that the time for lifting restrictions has not yet arrived." And Professor Muzaherul Huq, a former adviser of World Health Organization's South East Asia region, told The Daily Star newspaper that "lifting of restrictions from public transport was a risky move ... if the physical distancing is relaxed in public transport, transmission would definitely rise."\c\cOn 31 January, a special flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines with special quarantine, three physicians, a nurse, and required medical equipment on board flew to Wuhan, China to evacuate stranded Bangladeshi citizens. \c\cOn 1 February 312 Bangladeshi citizens (297 were adults and 15 children) stranded in Wuhan, China were evacuated and brought back to Bangladesh. Most of the Bangladeshis were students and PhD researchers at different universities in the Hubei province in China where their provincial government launched multiple screening tests before allowing them to get on board the plane. Majority of the evacuees were quarantined for 14 days at the Hajj Camp in Ashkona in Dhaka and some at the Combined Military Hospital before being released two weeks later. None of these returnees from Wuhan China were tested positive for coronavirus. \c\cOn 22 January, the authorities at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) in Dhaka reported that they had put the airports on alert to prevent the spread of coronavirus in Bangladesh by screening travelers from China, where the virus had at that time infected nearly 300 people and killed six people. The airport claimed to turn on its thermal scanner to scan passengers to detect any infection in passengers traveling from China. A.H.M. Touhid-ul Ahsan, director of the main Shahjalal International Airport, said doctors at the airport would look for fevers, coughs, breathing difficulties and sore throats. The country's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research were to be notified of any passengers with symptoms for further examination, he said. \c\cOn 2 February, the government of Bangladesh decided to suspend on-arrival visas for Chinese visitors. The Chittagong port also announced that as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus from the ships that bring goods from around the world, the port health officer would examine all sailors of the ships coming from the East Asian countries. \c\cOn 14 March, on-arrival visas were suspended for all countries, and flights from all European countries other than the United Kingdom were stopped. \c\cThis reportedly increased tourist traffic at the beaches in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar, counteracting the government measure. \c\cInternational flights began to resume from Dhaka airport on 16 June 2020, with only Qatar Airways and Biman Bangladesh Airlines initially permitted to fly. On 24 June, Emirates resumed flights to Dhaka, on a reduced capacity. \c\cOn 3 May, according to new guidelines, the total number of recoveries in Bangladesh crossed 1,000 marks by surging sharply. In the beginning of June, over 10,000 coronavirus patients recovered so far. Two weeks later, on 15 June, the first day of monsoon, Bangladesh reported over 15,000 recoveries, the highest jump in the total number of recoveries in the country, taking it to 34,027. The total number of recoveries crossed 40,000 marks on 18 June and 50,000 one week later. At the beginning of July, the number of patients who have recovered from the coronavirus disease crossed 60,000 marks. Three days later, the number of recoveries from the coronavirus disease crossed 70,000 marks. On 8 July, the number of recoveries crossed 80,000 marks before exceeding the number of active cases. The number of people who have recovered from the disease crossed 90,000 marks on 12 July and 100,000 two days later. As of 14 July, there are now over 100,000 patients who have recovered from the coronavirus disease. The number of recoveries in Bangladesh exceeded the number of recoveries in France on 7 July and the number of recoveries in China one day later. The country also reported more than 50,000 new recoveries from 16 June to 9 July. \c\cThe recovery rate in Bangladesh was very low until early May. The recovery rate in the country improved sharply to about 11% on 3 May and kept improving over time. The recovery rate improved sharply again to nearly 38% in the middle of June. As of 12 July, the recovery rate is over 50%, which means that more than half of all patients have recovered from the disease. The recovery rate in Bangladesh exceeded the recovery rate in France on 7 July. Five days later, the recovery rate exceeded 50%. \c\cIn March and April 2020, the COVID-19 transmission rate in Bangladesh was around 2, which meant that two people could be infected with the virus from one person. However, the transmission rate of COVID-19 in the country fell as time passed. As of 26 June, the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease in the country is 1.05, which is a very good sign. Model-based simulations suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number was below 1.0 and falling from December 2020 to February 2021. \c\cHealth Minister Zahid Malik said that the situation in Bangladesh improved as the growth rate of infections slowed down and the doubling period of infections got longer and that the minimum number of COVID-19 tests performed daily in the country was also improved to 15,000. He also said that, on 3 July, the maximum growth rate of infections in the country fell to 2.5% the day after the number of COVID-19 cases exceeded 150,000. As of 3 July, Bangladesh sees a growth rate of infections less than 2.5%. The health minister said that, until 10 July, the minimum doubling period of infections in the country was improved to 25 days. As of 10 July, the number of coronavirus cases in Bangladesh takes more than 25 days to double. \c\cMalik announced that Bangladesh started flattening the coronavirus curve on 23 June as thousands of tests were performed every day in the country to improve the situation and that the coronavirus curve flattened on the last eight days of June and the first six days of July. He also believed that excessive testing in Bangladesh caused the COVID-19 curve to flatten. Malik said that the curve flattened again after decreasing for six days. On 26 June, three days after the curve started flattening, a record of 18,498 samples was tested in the country, which was above the minimum number of tests performed every day. \c\cSome health experts believed that Bangladesh succeeded in flattening the curve, slowing down the growth rate of infections and extending the doubling period of infections. They also said that excessive testing in the country improved the situation, slowed down the growth rate of infections and extended the doubling period of infections. The coronavirus curve in Bangladesh stopped increasing on 23 June and started decreasing two weeks later. On 13 July, the curve flattened again. As of 13 July, the COVID-19 curve in the country is flattening for another time. On 27 June, which was four days after the curve stopped increasing, there were more than 700,000 samples tested in the country. \c\cSome people have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the coronavirus pandemic. According to Human Rights Watch, "Since mid-March 2020, the authorities have apparently arrested at least a dozen people, including a doctor, opposition activists, and students, for their comments about coronavirus, most of them under the draconian Digital Security Act."\c\cBut disinformation does not affect the whole of society equally, since women in this country are less likely to receive information about COVID-19 than men. The reasons that prevent women from being well informed about the pandemic are their difficulty in owning a mobile phone and accessing the Internet, as well as their low level of education. However, it is crucial that they have access to accurate and reliable information about the coronavirus, as they are the ones in charge of promoting hygiene in the household. \c\cOn 5 April 2021 a seven-day lockdown was announced by the Bangladeshi government, including all domestic travel suspended and shopping malls shut alongside a curfew between 6pm and 6am. This followed a record new 7, 087 new COVID-19 cases on 4 April, coinciding with a near-doubling of their testing rate from mid-March into the start of April. Some protests against this lockdown occurred in Dhaka, while the local media also criticised the lacklustre and inconsistent enforcement of lockdown rules throughout the country. Some schools continued to hold classes during the week. \c\cOn 6 April, merchant groups held protests in the capital, demanding an end to the lockdown, and the safe reopening of shops, by following hygiene guidelines. \c\cOn 7 April, public transport resumed in all metropolitan areas of the country, including Dhaka, after two days of closure. \c\cOn 9 April, markets and stores were officially reopened throughout the country, although many were unofficially open earlier in the week. The closures led to more crowded markets than before, and higher prices, as customers flocked to stores to buy needed goods before Ramadan. \c\cOn 12 April, the government declared that from 14 to 21 April, commercial banks will be closed, except for foreign exchange banks near port areas. Public transportation will again be closed, as well as government offices. However, emergency services, including garment factories and other industries, will remain open. \c\cThe Bangladesh Police are implementing movement passes, which must be issued from their web site to leave your home, including for jobs, grocery purchases or medical needs. If used for commuting, two passes must be issued to go and return. A photograph of the applicant must be uploaded, as well as identification papers, reason for travel, and dates and times. \c\cOn 14 April, it was reported that police checkpoints were checking those in vehicles for movement passes, but those on foot were allowed to pass. \c\cOn 17 April, markets were reopening in Barisal, sometimes only unofficially in alleyways. \c\cOn 28 April, the lockdown period will end, prioritizing livelihoods over what has been a mild illness in Bangladesh, with some of the lowest death rates in the world. The country will reopen in accordance with hygiene. \c\cBangladesh has consistently shown one of the lowest test rates per capita in the world and concerns that the level of testing have been insufficient to accurately understand the spread of infection have often been aired. \c\cThe number of daily tests reached heights of approximately 18,000 by the end of June, but then began to rapidly decline in July (with typical numbers in the range of 10,000 to 14,000 per day throughout July and August). A change in government policy was cited as the cause for the decline, following the introduction of a charge for tests (which had hitherto been free in government facilities) announced on June 29 and requirements for a doctor's referral for a test. \c\cThe number of samples tested in Bangladesh exceeded 100,000 on 7 May. Less than two weeks later, the number of samples tested in the country exceeded 200,000. At the end of May, there were over 300,000 samples tested. On 8 June, more than 400,000 samples were tested in Bangladesh. The number of samples tested exceeded 500,000 six days later. On 21 June, there were more than 600,000 samples tested. The number of samples tested exceeded 700,000 on 27 June and 800,000 five days later. On 9 July, the number of samples tested in the country exceeded 900,000. On 17 July 2020, the number of tests conducted to date crossed the threshold of one million samples. \c\cBangladesh has 1,169 ICU beds, amounting to 0.72 beds per 100,000 citizens. Of these 432 beds are in government hospitals and 737 in private hospitals. There are only 550 ventilators in the country. \c\cOn 21 March, the IEDCR announced that 150 ICU beds would be made available for COVID treatment in Dhaka and more would be provided in other parts of Bangladesh. By 8 April, it was reported that 112 ICU beds were available, of which 79 were in Dhaka, 26 in Mymensingh, 5 in Khulna and 2 in Sylhet. The government was in the process of procuring 380 ventilators. There were also 7,693 isolated beds around the country. \c\cOn 21 June, China invited Bangladesh to get priority access to COVID-19 vaccine once it is developed. On 26 June, the Chinese government announced that they might perform second-phase clinical trials of the vaccine in Bangladesh. \c\cThe Chinese government also believed that the coronavirus vaccine, if developed, might be given to Bangladesh by August as the priority. In the middle of 2020, Bangladesh started developing the coronavirus vaccine. \c\cIn July 2020, Sinovac Biotech was given approval by the Bangladesh Medical Research Council to begin a third-phase trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. The Bangladesh government later decided to cancel the trial of the vaccine. \c\cOn 5 November 2020, a tripartite agreement was signed between the government of Bangladesh, the Serum Institute of India, and Beximco Pharma of Bangladesh. Under the agreement Bangladesh ordered 30 million doses of Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine from Serum through Beximco for $4 per shot. On the other hand, Indian government has given 3.2 million doses to Bangladesh as a gift which were also produced by Serum. But Serum supplied only 7 million doses from the tripartite agreement in the first two months of the year. Bangladesh was supposed to receive 5 million doses per month  but not received shipments in March and April. As a result, rollout of vaccine  has been disrupted by supply shortfalls. Most people who have received the first dose are not getting the second dose on time. Not getting the second dose at the right time is likely to reduce the effectiveness of the vaccination program. In addition, several citizens of Bangladesh have expressed doubts about its effectiveness and  safety. Bangladesh is looking for alternative vaccine sources because India isn\'t supplying the vaccine according to the timeline of the deal. \c\cIn 28 April 2021 Govt. approves the proposal to local procution of Russian Sputnik V, Chinese Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccines. \c\cThe COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted household and individual level earnings in Bangladesh with around 13 percent of people have become unemployed, being women in informal employment more likely than men to see their working hours reduced; lower and middle-income classes have been experiencing a significant drop in income for the last few months.  Consequently, the disposable income of the country people is following a declining trend. Meanwhile, the national poverty is forecasted to increase by 25.13 percent, claimed by Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS). \c\cThe pandemic has taken a heavy toll on almost all sectors of the economy, inter alia, most notably, it has caused a reduction of exports by 16.93 percent, imports by 17 percent, and also a decline of average revenue for all small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 66 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Exceptionally, only remittance inflow has seen an 11 percent increase this year. \c\cEven though garment factories were allowed to continue operating under the country's lockdown, an estimated one million garment workers, or one-quarter of the workforce, were laid off due to declining orders for export. \c\cOn 5 April, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced a stimulus package amounting to some US$8bn. \c\cBangladesh has approximately 200,000 educational institutions across the country and over 40 million students. \c\cIn March, Bangladesh closed all of its educational institutions in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Initially on 17 March, when Bangladesh had 8 confirmed cases, the government announced all schools would be closed for the remainder of March. Dhaka University was also closed for the same period. The Education Ministry announced an extension of the closures to April 9. However, with the situation not improving Dhaka University announced on 9 April it would remain closed indefinitely. With educational intuitions still closed by the end of April, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced that they could remain closed until September 2020, unless the situation improves. On June 14, the ministry of education officially extended school closures to August 6. On 27 August a Ministry of Education confirmed schools would remain closed until 3 October. \c\cDhaka University began online classes in July 2020, as have many other universities and schools. Experts and students have voiced concerns about accessibility to online classes for many students in Bangladesh; with poorer students, particularly in rural areas, lacking the devices and internet connectivity to participate in their classes. Some have suggested online classes will only further the "educational divide" whereby the most disadvantaged students (who usually attend public universities on scholarships) will fall behind their peers due to lack of accessibility. \c\cStandardised school examinations have been impacted by the school closures. The HSC exams, which were scheduled to held in April 2020, were postponed indefinitely. By August 2020 with schools still closed, there was much uncertainty regarding when, and even if, the JSC exams, PEC exams (which are normally scheduled for November) and HSC exams will be held. On 24 August it was announced that the PEC exams will not be held, with assessments to be conducted by schools instead. Then on 27 August it was confirmed that the JSC would not be held either and a circular was issued extending the school closure until 3 October. \c\cSome education experts wanted all the educational institutions of Bangladesh closed until November.[citation needed] Others wanted all the educational institutions in the country to reopen by October.[citation needed] The education experts said that all of the educational institutions in Bangladesh will reopen only either if the maximum growth rate of infections is 2% or if the minimum doubling period of infections is 30 days. They also said that all of the educational institutions in the country will reopen only if the coronavirus curve flattens or decreases.[citation needed] According to some education experts, all the educational institutions will reopen only either if the maximum number of daily or new cases is 3,000 or if the minimum number of daily or new recoveries is 1,500.[citation needed] All the educational institutions will reopen only if the minimum recovery rate is 50%, according to other education experts.[citation needed]\c\cIn March, Bangladesh suspended all flights, both domestic and international, to manage the spread of the virus. Initially direct flights to the UK and China were exempted from the flight suspensions, but the UK was suspended in April too making China the sole exception. \c\cIn the beginning of June, domestic flights resumed on limited scale. International flights resumed from Dhaka airport on 16 June 2020, with only Qatar Airways and Biman Bangladesh Airlines initially permitted to fly. Flights to and from the UK resumed on 21 June. On 24 June, flights to and from the UAE became operational via Emirates. Flights to and from Saudi Arabia resumed on 3 July. Nearly two weeks later, flights to and from Turkey resumed. \c\cPresentation of a COVID-19 negative certificate became mandatory for all Bangladeshi nationals wishing to travel abroad from 23 July 2020. The government stipulated that all passengers must possess a document certifying a negative test result, which had been carried out within 72 hours prior to travel, regardless of destination and airline used. These tests had to have been carried out at one of 16 specific government-listed testing facilities. However, in an inter-ministry meeting on 30 July it was announced that the decision had been taken that the certificates will only be required for travelers whose destination country or chosen airline policy requires one. \c\cDomestic airline resumed operations from 1 June 2020, initially with very few passengers. The CAAB prescribed that all airlines have to keep at least 30 percent seats vacant on each flight to ensure social distancing by keeping a minimum gap of a seat between two passengers, if they are not from the same family, and that the front or the last row of seats on each flight must remain vacant for carrying any passenger who is suspected of carrying the coronavirus. Also crew are only to provide necessary in-flight services with no food or drink served in flights with an airtime of less than one and half hours. On 13 September 2020 the restrictions on passenger seating were lifted, with only the requirement to leave two rows vacant for suspected COVID positive passengers remaining. \c\cThe introduction of lock-down measures, economic declines and reduction in global mobility across the world has severely impacted Bangladeshi migrant workers. It is thought that around ten million Bangladeshis work overseas, especially across the middle east. Thousands of these workers have been forced to return to Bangladesh, largely because of job lay-offs. Kuwait for example has proposed a bill which would see 200,000 of the 350,000 Bangladeshi workers there compelled to leave the Gulf state. Most of these workers have struggled to find work in Bangladesh on their return, with 70 per cent unemployed according to an International Organization for Migration report published in August 2020. \c\cAt the time of the pandemic Bangladesh was housing over a million Rohingya refugees in refugee camps in Cox's Bazar. One in ten households in the camps were reported to have at least one individual above the age of five with a chronic illness or disability, increasing the risk of complications or death if they contract COVID-19. The high population density, poor sanitation facilities and limited access to healthcare in the camps are all conducive to the spread of viral illness such as COVID-19. \c\cOn 9 April, Bangladesh imposed a \'complete lockdown\' on the camps with "No entry, no exit – until the situation improves", said the government directive. As of 23 June 2020, 46 Rohingya refugees had tested positive for the virus and five deaths had been confirmed. As of 7 August 2020, the number of confirmed cases had risen to 78 and the number of deaths to six. \c\cA study by Save the Children and other carried out in May 2020 found that 40 per cent of Rohingya children in the camps expressed being scared of dying of the virus or losing loved ones to it. "Children tell us they\'re scared of dying. The fear of death or losing a loved one can be very distressing for a child, especially when many have already experienced intense trauma and loss, having been forced from their homes in Myanmar and stuck in a congested refugee camp for the past three years." said Onno van Manen, Country Director for Save the Children in Bangladesh. Save the Children announced they were to open a new isolation and treatment centre for COVID-19 patients with a capacity of up to 60 beds. \c\cThere are concerns that COVID-19 could be devastating for elderly Rohingya refugees, particularly as in June 2019 Amnesty International had reported that older Rohingya refugees in the camps in Bangladesh are often being left behind in the humanitarian response efforts. \c\cAs of 17 April 2020, news media outlets confirmed that there were 147 Bangladeshis who died from the coronavirus in the United States. \c\cOn 18 April 2020, during the general lockdown, a massive crowd of an estimated 100,000 people gathered in Sylhet to attend the funeral prayers of Islamic scholar Allama Maulana Zubayer Ahmed Ansari. Social distancing measures were not observed as crowds reportedly blocked nearly two kilometres of the Dhaka-Sylhet highway. It was not the only Mass gathering. Subsequently, massive public gatherings were observed at various political, social and national events. \c\cIn July 2020, several arrests were made after it emerged that Regent Hospital in Dhaka had issued thousands of fake COVID-19 negative certificates without conducting the testing. The hospitals had allegedly "carried out 10,500 coronavirus tests, out of which 4,200 were genuine and the rest, 6,300 test reports, were given without conducting tests" according to a RAB spokesperson. It was estimated that two to three crore Taka (approximately 230,000 to 350,00 USD) may have been made through these illegal activities. Following a nine-day manhunt, Regent Hospital Chairman Mohammad Shahed was arrested near the Indian border disguised in a burqa. Regent Hospitals had signed a deal with the DGHS in March to provide COVID-19 testing, despite Regent Hospital's licence having expired in 2014, which was reportedly known to the health services division of the health ministry. \c\cFear of the transmission of COVID-19, particularly in the early months of the outbreak, meant that many patients were turned away from hospitals (private and public), with some dying as a result. In April 2020 for example, Dhaka University student Suman Chakma died after being denied treatment for lung cancer at several hospitals in Dhaka who feared his symptoms could be COVID-19. The media reported on several more cases of patients lacking COVID-19 certificates being denied admission to multiple hospitals throughout April, May and June, including that of a five-year-old child hit by a vehicle who died en-route between several hospitals in Chattogram and even the additional secretary to the food ministry, Gautam Aich Sarker, died of a kidney condition after being turned away from several hospitals in Dhaka. In June 2020, 22 year old nurse Habiba Sultana died after being denied emergency treatment at the hospital she worked at, following a stroke. She had tested negative for COVID-19, but the document had been misplaced and so her admission was refused, she was finally admitted hours later when the police got involved, but by then she had passed. \c\cThe Government took a publicly strong stance against these incidences. In reference to the case of DU student Suman Chakma, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said of the doctors involved that "They don\'t deserve to work as doctor or do other jobs. I think they should be driven out of their jobs," and that "doctors have a duty to perform." The Health Ministry warned of strict action against hospitals that denied treatment, including the cancellation of licenses, if they violate the order. The DGHS stated that hospitals should inform them if they fail to admit any suspected COVID-19 patient requesting treatment and that "hospitals violating this order will face legal action". On 11 May the health ministry issued an order that all private hospitals should keep separate arrangements for suspected coronavirus patients and not to turn away any patients if they have treatment facilities. The same day, the ministry gave a similar directive to the public hospitals. On May 24, the ministry issued another order directing all the government and private hospitals with 50 or more beds to make separate arrangements for treating COVID-19 patients. However, despite these measures cases of patients being denied treatment on the grounds of suspected COVID-19 symptoms continued. 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cAustralian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March, and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March. Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020, and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks. Social distancing rules were imposed on 21 March, and state governments started to close "non-essential" services. "Non-essential services" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories. The number of new cases initially grew sharply, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22 March, and started falling at the beginning of April to under 20 cases per day by the end of the month. \c\cA second wave of infections emerged in Victoria during May and June, which was attributed to an outbreak at a Melbourne quarantine hotel. The second wave, though largely localised to Melbourne, was much more widespread and deadlier than the first; at its peak, the state had over 7,000 active cases. Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown which eventually lasted almost four months. The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October. \c\cAs of 26 April 2021[update], Australia has reported 29,695 cases, 25,486+ recoveries, and 910 deaths, with Victoria's second wave accounting for nearly 75 percent of cases and 90 percent of fatalities. No deaths from COVID-19 were recorded in Australia from 28 December 2020 until 13 April 2021, when one death occurred in Queensland. There has been one death linked to an adverse vaccination reaction. On 15 April 2021, a 48-year-old New South Wales woman died in John Hunter Hospital after developing thrombosis (blood clot) with thrombocytopenia (abnormally low levels of platelets) four days after being vaccinated on 8 April with the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine. By 23 April 2021 there had been 6 cases in Australia of blood clotting in people after they received Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccinations. Long-haul flying is still a greater risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) than COVID-19 vaccinations. \c\cThe stated goal of the National Cabinet is "suppression", as opposed to "elimination", meaning continually trying to drive community transmission to zero but expecting that new outbreaks may occur. This is in contrast to the mitigation strategies implemented by most other nations. Compared to other Western countries, notably the United States and European countries, Australia's handling has been praised for its effectiveness. Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; rapid recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce during March 2020; comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the US  and later on, the use of short intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks. Although Australia's efforts to develop a bluetooth-based contact tracing app were not particularly effective, QR code based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia's businesses. These apps, which are effectively required by State Governments, give government health departments the ability to reconstruct the presence of anyone visiting bars or restaurants, generally for 28 days after the visit. \c\cThe nationwide vaccination program began with the first doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine being administered in Sydney on Sunday 21 February 2021. \c\cA novel coronavirus that caused a respiratory illness was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019, which confirmed its concern on 12 January 2020. WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. \c\cThe case fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower than that of SARS, a related disease which emerged in 2002, but its transmission has been significantly greater, leading to a much greater total death toll. \c\cThe widespread reporting of the 2019-20 Australian bushfire season in major media and social media around the world caused a significant drop in the number of tourists coming to Australia, including those from China. The absence of tourist arrivals during this time could have played a significant role in sparing Australia from the spread of COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. This is in contrast to other major cities in Europe and North America, where the early spread of the virus continued undetected until late February 2020 or early March 2020. \c\cThe following chart represents changes in net number of cases on a daily basis and is based on the number of cases reported in the Federal Government's daily reports. \c\cOn 1 February 2020, Australia banned the entry of foreign nationals who had been in mainland China, and ordered its own returning citizens who had been in China to self-quarantine for 14 days. The country also began to assess the relative risk of reflected transmission through third countries, and to ask travelers arriving from higher-risk countries to monitor for symptoms. Australia subsequently imposed bans on Iran (1 March), South Korea (5 March), and Italy (11 March). From 16 March, all travellers arriving in or returning to Australia were required to self-isolate for 14 days. Failure to self-isolate could result in a fine of A$11,000 to A$50,000 and a possible prison sentence, depending on the state. Cruise ships were also barred from docking in the country for 30 days. \c\cOn 20 March, Australia closed its borders to all non-residents and non-Australian citizens. With limited exceptions, a ban was imposed on Australians travelling overseas. \c\cBy late March 2020, 62% of Australia's more than 3,000 coronavirus cases were among people who had returned from overseas. From then, Australians returning from overseas were subject to two weeks compulsory quarantine in hotels. The New South Wales quarantine program was helped by 150 Australian Defence Force personnel, including 30 who were stationed at hotels. In Victoria, three private security operators were contracted to provide the security, while the other states and territories used their police resources. The states and territories carried the costs of hotel quarantine. By 19 June, since the policy came into force 81,000 people had entered Australia. Of those, 63,000 had undergone hotel quarantine, while the rest, including flight crews, international businesspeople and defence members, fell under different rules. Hotel quarantine had cost $118 million as at 19 June. \c\cInterstate border closures began on 19 March, with Tasmania imposing a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all "non-essential" travellers to the state, including returning residents. On 24 March, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory closed their borders, with all interstate arrivals being required to self-isolate for 14 days. On 11 April, Queensland banned interstate arrivals, with only Queensland residents and those granted \'exemption\' being allowed entry. On 8 July, the Victorian and NSW governments, jointly closed their common border, following a large spike in cases in parts of Melbourne.[citation needed]\c\cWith the spike in coronavirus infections in Victoria linked to the hotel quarantine program, a judicial inquiry into the program in Victoria was called on 2 July; and all international arrivals into Melbourne were suspended. On 9 July, other state and territory leaders agreed to reduce flights and arrivals into Australia from 8,000 to 4,000 a week to ease the burden on the hotel quarantine system. States started to charge travellers for hotel quarantine. In mid September, the states agreed to increased the number of arrivals to 6,000 a week, to help in the repatriation of tens of thousands of Australians stranded overseas. By 15 December 2020, 39,000 Australians were registered with the government as stranded, with more unregistered (as the government advised registration only for those needing assistance to return). After repeated flight cancellations and without access to government-provided health care or welfare benefits, many families reported being forced to overstay visas, and burn down savings and incur debt to pay for accommodations. Having to pay thousands of dollars for return tickets and mandatory hotel quarantine, some chose to send one family member back in order to resume work and earn enough money to pay the way of the rest. Between 13 March and 15 July 2020, more than 357,000 people returned to Australia. As of 15 January 2021[update] over 37,000 Australians were stranded abroad. On 29 January 2021, the ability of Australians stuck overseas to return was further hampered when the UK banned direct flights from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the possible spread of the South African COVID-19 variant. Both Etihad and Emirates airlines are UAE based. \c\cAn overnight curfew was introduced in Victoria on 2 August 2020, extended on 13 September and suspended on 27 September. A Supreme Court judge has ruled the curfew was legal. \c\cOn 25 January 2021, Health Minister Greg Hunt suspended Australia's travel bubble with New Zealand for a period of 72 hours after New Zealand authorities confirmed a community transmission case in the country's Northland Region. On 28 January the suspension of the travel bubble was extended for 3 more days. \c\cOn 5 February 2021, National Cabinet decided to increase the number of international passenger arrivals to Australia as from mid-February. New South Wales will return to a weekly cap of 3,010 people and Queensland to 1,000. South Australia has increased by 40 people a week to 530, and Victoria by almost 200 to 1,310. Western Australia will remain at a reduced arrival cap. The total national weekly cap of 4,100 will increase to approximately 6,300. \c\cOn 11 February 2021, the airline Cathay Pacific decided that, excepting Sydney, from 20 February it would cease all flights to Australia until the end of the month. This was in response to the Hong Kong government's new COVID rules requiring Hong Kong based aircrew to quarantine for 14 days on return to HK. \c\cOn 24 February, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria suspended their travel bubble arrangements with New Zealand in response to a recent community outbreak in South Auckland. As a result, New Zealanders traveling to these states would have to enter quarantine. \c\cOn 2 March 2021, the general closure of Australia's international borders to travel was extended another 3 months to 17 June 2021. Australia's borders have now already been closed for 12 months. The border could reopen earlier if the closure was "no longer needed." Despite the border closure, between 25 March and 31 December 2020 over 105,000 exemptions were approved for people to leave Australia. \c\cBy April 2021, there were still about 40,000 Australians stranded overseas by the high cost of plane tickets and the cap on the number of people in the quarantine system, which was criticized for special treatment of sportspeople and celebrities. Australia was chastised by the UN Human Rights Committee, which requested a prompt return for the country's citizens; the government has given out $29 million to about 3900 stranded people as a last resort, and operated 28 repatriation flights. \c\cOn 13 March 2020, the National Cabinet, a form of national crisis cabinet akin to a war cabinet, was created following a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). This is the first time such a cabinet has been proclaimed since World War II, and the only time in Australian history that a crisis cabinet has included state and territory leaders. The cabinet consists of the premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories and meets weekly during the crisis. At its first meeting on 13 March, the National Cabinet announced that gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled from 15 March. Schools, universities, workplaces, public transport and airports were not included in this recommendation. Prime Minister Morrison also announced that he intended to attend a Rugby League match on 14 March; "I do still plan to go to the football on Saturday" but later decided against attending the match. \c\cOn 29 March, the Cabinet agreed to stricter limits to apply from midnight on 30 March: a limit on both indoor and outdoor gatherings of two people except weddings (5) funerals (10) and people of the same household or family; strong guidance to all Australians is to stay home unless for necessary shopping, health care, exercise, and work and study that can\'t be done remotely; public playgrounds, skate parks and outside gyms to be closed. It was left to individual states to enforce these guidelines. They also agreed to a moratorium on evictions for six months for both commercial and residential tenancies suffering financial distress. \c\cOn 2 April 2020, the Federal government announced the temporary provision of free childcare so that people could continue working, and to prevent closure of childcare centres. The Government paid half each centre's operating costs. The free childcare ended on 12 July, and the previous Child Care Subsidy was reintroduced. \c\cOn 18 March 2020, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, after a National Security Committee meeting the previous day. The Biosecurity Act 2015 specifies that the Governor-General may declare such an emergency exists if the Health Minister (currently Greg Hunt) is satisfied that "a listed human disease is posing a severe and immediate threat, or is causing harm, to human health on a nationally significant scale". This gives the minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and evacuations. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 was declared by the Governor-General, David Hurley, under Section 475 of the Act. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, made by the Health Minister on the same day, forbids international cruise ships from entering Australian ports before 15 April 2020. \c\cA social distancing rule of four square metres (43 sq ft) per person in any enclosed space was agreed by National Cabinet on 20 March, to be implemented through State and Territory laws. On 22 March 2020, the State governments of New South Wales and Victoria imposed a mandatory closure of non-essential services, while the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia imposed border closures. \c\cOn 22 March, Morrison announced a closure of places of social gathering, including registered and licensed clubs, licensed premises in hotels and bars, entertainment venues, including but not restricted to cinemas, casinos and nightclubs and places of worship. Cafes and restaurants could remain open, but were limited to only takeaway food. Similarly, enclosed spaces for funerals and things of that nature will have to follow the strict four-square-metre rule. These measures (labelled stage 1 in anticipation of possible future measures) were effective immediately at midday, 23 March. Morrison stated that he would like schools to remain open, but parents could keep children at home if they wished to. \c\cOn 25 March 2020, the Health Minister made a second determination under the Biosecurity Act 2015, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Overseas Travel Ban Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, which "forbids Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australian territory by air or sea as a passenger". On the same day, the Prime Minister announced a further set of restrictions, labelled stage 2 restrictions, effective midnight that night. These involved mainly smaller businesses, such as nail salons and tattoo parlours, while some, such as personal training sessions, were limited to 10 people. At the same time, other gatherings were restricted, such as weddings (5 people) and funerals (10 people). \c\cAt 12:00 am on Tuesday 31 March, restrictions were announced on indoor and outdoor gatherings, which were called stage 3 by the media, although the label "stage 3" was not part of the official announcement. The new rule limited gatherings to two people, although it did not apply to members of the same household. \c\cOn 14 April the Federal government announced the "COVIDSafe" digital contact tracing app. \c\cOn 25 April 2020, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements—Public Health Contact Information) Determination 2020, made under subsection 477(1) of the Act, was signed into law by the Health Minister. The purpose of the new legislation is "to make contact tracing faster and more effective by encouraging public acceptance and uptake of COVIDSafe", COVIDSafe being the new mobile app created for the purpose. The function of the app is to record contact between any two people who both have the app on their phones when they come within 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) of each other. The encrypted data would remain on the phone for 21 days of not encountering a person logged with confirmed COVID-19. \c\cOn 3 September 2020, the human biosecurity emergency period under the Biosecurity Act 2015 was extended until 17 December. \c\cOn 25 March, the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC) was established by the Prime Minister as a strategic advisory body for the national response to the pandemic. (On 27 July 2020, the Prime Minister renamed the organisation to the "National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board" (NCC).) The NCC's role includes providing advice on public-private partnerships and coordination to mitigate the social and economic impacts of the pandemic. \c\cOn 29 March, Prime Minister Morrison announced in a press conference following a National Cabinet meeting that public gatherings will be limited to two people, while also urging Australians over the age of 70, Australians with chronic illness over the age of 60 and Indigenous Australians over the age of 50 to stay home and self-isolate. Morrison also clarified that there were only four acceptable reasons for Australians to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes. \c\cAustralia's first human trials of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, Novavax's NVX-CoV2373, began in Melbourne by 26 May 2020. \c\cThe Australian government entered into agreements with Pfizer/BioNTech, University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax and the University of Queensland for the supply of vaccines. The University of Queensland vaccine was abandoned in December 2020 after trials revealed that, while it was safe, it triggered false positives on HIV tests. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer vaccine in January 2021. The Australian government ordered 10 million doses, with the first 80,000 to be delivered in February 2021, but production problems and the imposition of export controls by the European Union to deliveries to countries outside Europe made meeting the delivery schedule problematic. \c\cThis would also affect deliveries of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which was provisionally approved by the TGA in February, and received final approval in March. Orders were reduced from 3.8 million to 1.2 million doses of this vaccine, which is manufactured in Belgium, and arrival was pushed back to March 2021. CSL Limited began manufacturing 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Melbourne in November 2020. Deliveries were expected to commence in March. The AstraZeneca vaccine could be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures of 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F), whereas the Pfizer vaccine required storage at −70 °C (−94 °F). However, concerns were raised about the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The Australian and New Zealand Society for Immunology called for a pause in its rollout, as the efficacy of the vaccine reported by trials was insufficient to achieve the desired herd immunity effect. CSL management declined an invitation to appear before an Australian Senate inquiry. \c\cAlthough the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, said that Australia would be "at the front of the queue", and the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, claimed that Australia would be among the first countries to receive COVID-19 vaccines, 61 other countries had already commenced vaccinating their citizens by the end of January 2021, while the Australian vaccination rollout was not scheduled to commence for another month. \c\cOn 15 February 2021, 142,000 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Australia. The first doses are due be administered on 22 February. The world-wide distribution of the vaccine has been described as "... the largest logistics effort in the world since World War" by Dr Roberto Perez-Franco of the Deakin University's Centre for Supply Chain and Logistics. This was followed, on 28 February, by 300,000 doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, which arrived at Sydney airport. It was planned that most Australians will be immunised with this vaccine, the majority of which will be manufactured in Australia by CSL Limited.  On 5 March, Italy and the European Union blocked a shipment of 250,000 doses of the Oxford−AstraZeneca vaccine from Italy to Australia, citing low COVID-19 case numbers in Australia and the limited availability of vaccines in the EU. \c\cLocal manufacturing began in November 2020. On 16 February, the first vials of COVID-19 vaccine produced in Australia came off the production line at the CSL Behring plant in Broadmeadows, Melbourne. This is the active raw vaccine material. The vaccine vials are filled and packaged into doses by Seqirus, a CSL subsidiary in Parkville, Melbourne. Production of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Australia received its final approval from the TGA on 21 March. Understandably, many front line health care workers preferred the Pfizer vaccine over the AstraZeneca one. \c\cThe Australian government had also signed a deal with Novavax for 51 million doses of its vaccine, with supply originally slated for "mid-2021". As of April 2021, it had yet to be approved by the TGA. It is not manufactured in Australia, so like the other imported vaccines, its availability was uncertain. In trials it was reported to be 95.6 per cent effective against COVID-19, and an 86.3 per cent effective against the variant identified in the UK. \c\cIn a February 2021 pre-budget submission, the Australian Academy of Science renewed its call for the government to develop the capability to produce MRNA vaccine technology in Australia. The ability to mass-produce such vaccines onshore would insulate Australia against supply shocks, and cater for future pandemics and potential  biosecurity situations. The MRNA vaccines had proved to be more effective than those produced with conventional vaccine technology, and easier to reconfigure to cater for new virus variants. \c\cThe first public COVID-19 vaccination in Australia, with the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, took place on 21 February 2021 in Sydney. An 84-year-old aged care resident was the first Australian to receive the vaccine. Prime Minister Morrison and Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly also received vaccinations. \c\cThe first Australian to receive the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was a doctor in regional South Australia on 5 March 2021 at Murray Bridge Hospital. \c\cThe first death in Australia linked to an adverse vaccination reaction occurred on 15 April 2021. A diabetic 48-year-old New South Wales woman died in John Hunter Hospital after developing thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 4 days after being vaccinated on 8 April with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The TGA said it was "likely" her death was linked to the vaccination. There were 2 previous cases in Australia of blood clotting linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. By 23 April 2021, 3 more cases of blood clotting were reported that are believed to be linked to AstraZeneca vaccination. A 49-year-old Queensland man, an 80-year-old Victorian man and 35-year-old NSW woman all had suspected thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). The TGA said there was a "likely link" as all three had received the AstraZeneca vaccine. All were in a stable condition and recovering. \c\cVictoria's Chief Health officer, Professor Brett Sutton, after himself receiving an AstraZeneca vaccination, said: "You are more likely to get a clot, whatever age you are, on a long-haul flight to Europe or North America." Daniel Thomas, haematologist and researcher at the University of Adelaide agreed and said deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was "common". \c\cPremier Gladys Berejiklian formed a "war cabinet" to make decisions in relation to the pandemic. Members include herself, Treasurer Dominic Perrottet, Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard and Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott. \c\cOn 15 March, Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Education, Mark Scott ordered that, effective immediately, New South Wales schools introduce social distancing measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus. The order required schools to cancel all assemblies, excursions, travel, concerts, large inter-school sporting and arts events, and other events that would require students and staff to congregate in large numbers. Schools were to stay open. Four schools in the state have been shut for periods during the crisis due to confirmed cases within their school communities. \c\cOn 16 March, New South Wales Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard announced that he was using his powers, under Section 7 of the \'Public Health Act 2010\', to immediately and indefinitely cancel all public events with more than 500 attendees. The order is enforceable by NSW Police and violations of the order can carry a prison term of six months, an $11,000 fine, or both. \c\cChief Justice Bathurst, Chief Justice of New South Wales, and Chief Judge Price of the District Court of New South Wales ordered that effective 16 March 2020, new jury trials would be suspended to limit the spread of coronavirus. The order did not apply to already empanelled jury trials. Corrective Services New South Wales implemented screening mechanisms, early flu vaccination programs and stricter hygiene requirements for staff, visitors and inmates to slow the spread of the virus. \c\cThe University of Sydney cancelled all graduations, conferences, academic and student organised events. The University of New South Wales announced that it was cancelling all student and academic events until Easter, encourage staff to work from home and, where possible, shift all lectures, tutorials, demonstrations and labs to online learning. \c\cNew South Wales schools were directed by the State Department of Education Secretary, Mark Scott, to cancel all assemblies, excursions, travel, and some events and conferences, including arts and initiative events, as well as whole school sporting events and inter-school sporting events with three or more involved schools. \c\cEven though there was a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people, huge crowds flocked to the popular Bondi Beach and other beaches across Sydney on Friday 20 March. Health Minister Greg Hunt said that such behaviour was "unacceptable" while the New South Wales Labor's Shadow Treasurer, Walt Secord urged the government to completely close off the beach. New South Wales Police Minister David Elliott later stated in a televised interview that lifeguards were instructed to keep a head count of the people at the beach and if the number exceeded 500, the beach would be closed. On 21 March, crowds built up yet again which led Waverley Council to temporarily close Bondi, and the other beaches of Bronte and Tamarama. \c\cOn 22 March, a public health order was issued that declared Lord Howe Island a public risk area and directed restricted access. As of that date there were no known cases of COVID-19 on Lord Howe Island. \c\cOn 30 March, NSW Parliament passed the "COVID-19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement" law, which limited public gatherings to two people and directed, "that a person must not, without reasonable excuse, leave the person's place of residence." It listed 16 reasonable excuses and took effect from midnight on 31 March. \c\cAs of 15 May, some restrictions on public and private gatherings were eased. Private homes were allowed 5 visitors. Free standing cafes and restaurants, and those inside pubs and clubs, were allowed very limited sit-down dining, after being restricted to take-away only since 23 March. Bars and gaming areas remained closed. A maximum of 10 people were permitted in restaurants and cafes, while social distancing rules still had to be followed. Outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people were permitted. Up to 10 guests were permitted at weddings, and funerals could have up to 20 mourners indoors, 30 outdoors. Up to 10 people were allowed at indoor religious gatherings such as churches. \c\cFrom 13 June, private homes were allowed to have up to 20 guests visit, and groups of 20 were allowed to meet outside. Food courts were allowed to open, so long as the 4-square-metres-per-patron rule was kept, and no more than 50 patrons. Indoor gym classes were allowed 10 participants. Up to 100 persons were allowed inside gyms, so long as area requirements were adhered to. \c\cFrom 1 July, New South Wales eased restrictions further due to the limited community transmission of COVID-19, at that time. No set upper limit on patron numbers at indoor venues, but only one person per 4 square metres. Outdoor venues, with a maximum capacity of 40,000, were allowed up to 25 per cent of normal capacity. Events had to be ticketed, patrons seated and follow guidelines. Restriction on funerals eased, but the four-square-metre rule applied. Other existing restrictions, no more than 20 guests inside homes, 20 outside, remained in force. Restrictions were tightened again on 17 July. (See below)\c\cFrom 5 July, the Federal Government introduced restrictions on the number of passengers arriving at Sydney Airport. A maximum of 50 passengers were allowed per flight, and international arrivals were set at 450 per day. This was by request of the NSW Government to reduce pressure on hotel quarantine capacity. More than 32,000 travellers had quarantined in Sydney hotels by this date. \c\cOn 6 July, the Victorian and NSW State Governments, jointly announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July, following a large spike in cases in certain areas of Melbourne. \c\cAs of 12:01 a.m. on 17 July, after an increase in cases, new rules for pubs were introduced. Measures included, group bookings and persons at a table were limited to 10 (formerly 20), and a maximum of 300 people allowed inside any venue. COVID Safe Hygiene Marshalls to oversee the venues COVID-19 infection prevention were also required, and venue COVID-Safe registration was compulsory. Paper-based sign-ins are allowed, but a digital record of patrons contact details, for contact tracing, must be provided on request. Breaching the rules can result in a A$55,000 fine for the venue, plus another A$27,500 for each day the breach is continued. As of 24 July, the tightened venue restrictions were also applied to bars, cafes, clubs and restaurants. \c\cUntil 18 July, international travellers who had to undergo compulsory quarantine on arrival did not have to pay for their accommodation, at a cost of A$65 million to the NSW Government. Under new rules announced on 11 July, as of 12:01 a.m. on Saturday 18 July 2020, all new arrivals are being charged for their quarantine. The charge includes meals and room costs, for which one adult will pay A$3,000, additional adults A$1,000, children A$500, and no charge for children under 3 years. Those already quarantined will not have to pay, nor will those who purchased flights, and, had a confirmed international arrival date, before 11:59  p.m. on 12 July 2020 AEST. \c\cOn 20 July, the number of daily overseas arrivals allowed at Sydney Airport was reduced to 350 from the 450 limit set on July 5. \c\cOn 5 August, it was announced that as from 7 August all Victorians arriving in NSW would be required to quarantine, at their own expense, in hotels for 14 days. Air arrivals from Victoria were only  allowed at Sydney Airport. \c\cFrom 23 November, it became mandatory for many businesses to use electronic record systems to collect details of patrons for possible contact tracing. \c\cDuring the second week of December 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 in Avalon began.[citation needed] A stay at home advisory was issued on 17 December. \c\cOn 19 December 2020, a public health order was issued, locking down Sydney's Northern Beaches. Residents of the Northern Beaches LGA were required to stay at home from 5 pm on Saturday 19 December, until 11:59 pm on Wednesday 23 December unless they had a lawful reason to travel, including for: essential shopping; essential travel for work and to or from a school or educational institution; exercise; medical care, carer's responsibilities or compassionate needs. Entry to the area was similarly restricted. Public gatherings were limited to two persons. \c\cBy 20 December, there were 68 cases. This prompted restrictions on admission of Sydney residents or visitors to Sydney, to other states. These ranged from 14-day quarantines (ACT, NT, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria) to no entry without an exemption (Queensland). South Australia barred entry to anyone from the Northern Beaches, while Western Australia barred everyone coming from NSW. Measures to stem the spread of COVID-19 in Sydney were again tightened. No more than 10 people were allowed in homes in Greater Sydney, Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Illawarra-Shoalhaven. \c\cNew Year's Eve celebrations were restricted in Sydney city, around the harbour and suburbs. The midnight fireworks on Sydney Harbour, normally 20 minutes, were cut back to 7 minutes, with no fireworks at 9 pm. The harbour foreshores were closed to prevent crowds congregating. Only residents, guests,  and those with bookings at bars, hotels and restaurants, were allowed in foreshore areas under a pass system. Vantage points in North Sydney were also closed. \c\cFrom 1 January, hospitality venues and hairdressers were required to use the NSW Government QR code system for patron check-in. \c\cOn Saturday, 2 January 2021, it was announced that as of midnight that day, facemasks would become mandatory in many enclosed places in Greater Sydney. All public transport, shops, supermarkets, cinemas, theatres and places of worship are included. Hospitality workers also have to wear masks. Children under 12 years-of-age are exempt. An A$200 on the spot fine will be charged for non-compliance. Fines will be applied from 4 January (Monday). \c\cMaximum gym class sizes were reduced from 50 to 30, worship from 300 down to 100, weddings are limited to 100, or one per 4 square metres. Outdoor performances reduced from 1,000 to 500. Events which are "seated, ticketed and enclosed" were reduced back to 2,000 maximum. Night clubs are "not permitted". \c\cOn 21 February, the first public COVID-19 vaccinations in Australia, with the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, were administered in Sydney. Up to 6:00 pm on 23 February in NSW, 3,200 people were immunised across three state-run hospitals. \c\cAs of 24 February, there has been no transmission of COVID-19 in the community in NSW for 38 days. On 17 March restrictions will be "revisited". Also on 24 February, further restrictions eases were announced in NSW. From 12:01 am on 26 February (Friday):\c\cDancing and singing will be allowed at gatherings\c\cAt weddings, up to 30 people, including guests, can dance at one time. (currently, only the wedding party, a maximum of 20 people. The 300 person limit for wedding guests remains for now)\c\cUp to 50 people at their home (up from 30) Visitor number includes adults and children. \c\cUp to 50 people allowed in gym classes (4-square metre rule applies)\c\cUp to 30 singers allowed in choirs and religious congregations. Masks required, place of worship must adhere to the 4-square metre rule. \c\cOn 10 March, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews warned Victorians to expect "extreme measures" in the wake of the federal government updating the travel advice for Italy. These could include cancelling major sporting events, requiring entire economic sectors to work from home, and calling recently retired health professionals to return to work. \c\cA state of emergency was declared on 16 March, which was extended on 12 April, with existing directions remaining in place including staying at home, restrictions on particular activities, detention, restrictions on airports and cruise ships, aged care, hospitals and isolation for people diagnosed with COVID-19.[citation needed] It was extended further on 11 May,[citation needed] and again on 19 July to 16 August. \c\cOn 22 March, the school holiday was brought forward from 27 to 24 March. \c\cOn 14 April, Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced that Victoria would have the widest coronavirus testing in Australia, with anyone having COVID-19 symptoms able to get tested. The statement was issued that those who presented with fever or chills, in the absence of any other alternative diagnosis that explained the issue, or acute respiratory infection characterised by coughing, sore throat or shortness of breath should be tested for coronavirus. \c\cOn 20 June, the Victorian Government re-tightened restrictions on household gatherings following a spike in community transmitted cases over the previous week, reported to be mainly caused by family-to-family transmission in large household gatherings. From 22 June, households could once again only have five visitors; and most easing of restrictions that were to take place were postponed. \c\cOn 30 June, the Victorian Government re-enforced local lockdowns across 10 different Melbourne postcodes. Residents there would need to comply with the four acceptable reasons to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes. \c\cOn 2 July, the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced the "Judicial Inquiry into Hotel Quarantine Program". This followed some cases of coronavirus in Victoria being linked by DNA sequencing to a breach in hotel quarantine infection control. The Inquiry was to "... examine the operation of Victoria's hotel quarantine program for returning travellers." It was headed by retired judge Jennifer Coate, and was scheduled to deliver its report to the Governor by 25 September. The inquiry was delayed by lockdown restrictions. Andrews noted that "it is abundantly clear that what has gone on here is completely unacceptable and we need to know exactly what has happened." An interim report was published on 6 November, and the inquirys final report was published on 21 December. The Government response to the interim report was published in November. \c\cOn 4 July, the Victorian Government announced two more postcodes affected by the lockdown until 29 July 2020. Nine public housing towers housing 3,000 residents were also added, with the additional condition that residents could not leave the tower under any circumstances for five days, with the possibility of an extension to 14 days. The Victorian ombudsman later found the lockdown of the public housing towers breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 6 July, the Victorian and NSW state Governments announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July. \c\cOn 7 July, after recording 191 new cases, Premier Andrews announced that metropolitan Melbourne and the Shire of Mitchell would re-enter lockdown from 12 am on 9 July, for 6 weeks. \c\cOn 19 July, following a "concerning increase in coronavirus cases", Premier Andrews announced that "face coverings" were to be made mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne, and Mitchell Shire. This was not enforced until after 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday 22 July to allow the populace time to acquire a face covering. In addition, the state of emergency was extended until 16 August 2020. \c\cFrom 22 July, as the chance of coronavirus infection remained high in aged care and health care settings, visits were restricted to carers only, and with a limit of one hour per day. \c\cFrom 23 July, "face coverings" in metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire became mandatory whenever residents leave their homes. A fine of A$200 was imposed to those not complying, though medical and other exemptions were allowed, such as not being required for children under 12 years of age. \c\cOn 2 August, a state of disaster was declared and metropolitan Melbourne was moved to Stage 4 restrictions. A curfew across Melbourne from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. was imposed, a 5 km (3.1 mi) radius restriction as added, and other restrictions that had previously been applied only to selected postcodes were applied to the whole of metropolitan Melbourne. A permit system was introduced for any residents that still needed to travel to work outside of their 5 km radius. \c\cOn 6 September (Father's Day), the "Roadmap for Reopening" was announced; a series of four steps towards "COVID Normal" which would begin on 13 September. In the "First Step", which applied to metropolitan Victoria, several restrictions were eased including a reduction of the curfew, some loosening of rules around outdoor exercise and social interactions, the introduction of a "bubble" that allowed single people living alone to nominate one person to be allowed to visit them during the first two steps, and increased limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. At the same time, it was announced that regional Victoria would move to the "Second Step", which included a staged return of students to onsite learning as well as the reopening of outdoor public pools and further increases to limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. \c\cOn 18 October, regional Victoria was moved to "Step Three", which included the reopening of most businesses to the public, increased seating for hospitality, the allowance of visitors for all residents and the resumption of some indoor sports. At the same time, the 5 km limit in metropolitan Victoria was increased to 25 km (16 mi) and the two-hour time limit was removed, however the border between metropolitan and regional Victoria (often referred to as the "ring of steel") was strengthened with extra checkpoints added. \c\cOn 26 October, metropolitan restrictions were eased, with residents allowed to leave home for any reason, all retail businesses allowed to reopen, hospitality venues allowed to seat patrons, further relaxations on outdoor gatherings, and allowance of visitors to all residents, with some caveats. The 25 km restriction and "Ring of steel" remained in place, however. \c\c With a length of 112 days, Victoria's second lockdown was the longest continuous lockdown world-wide, as of October 2020. \c\cOn 8 November, metropolitan restrictions were brought into line with regional restrictions with travel now being allowed to and from anywhere in the state. Indoor recreation, community and entertainment venues were also reopened. Restrictions on accommodation were also loosened in an effort to encourage intrastate tourism. It was also announced that, subject to public health advice, Victoria would move to the "Last Step" on 22 November. \c\cOn 27 November, Victoria recorded its 28th consecutive day of 0 new cases and 0 deaths, and had 0 active cases, epidemiologically eliminating the virus. \c\cOn 30 November, the Victorian government announced that a new dedicated agency, "COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria" (CQV), had been created. The interim Commissioner of CQV is the Commissioner of Corrections, Emma Cassar. CQV is part of the government's response to the COVID-19 Hotel Quarantine Enquirys\' interim report. It will oversee all parts of the Victorian quarantine program: mandatory quarantine for people entering Australia, Health Hotels for positive and suspected cases, or close contacts, and Frontline Worker Accommodation. The CQV Commissioner will be supported by three Deputy State Controllers. Deputy Chief Health Officer Professor Ben Cowie will lead the CQVs\' health management. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Ross Guenther will provide expertise in enforcement. As of 15 January 2021[update] the third Controller is still to be appointed. \c\cOn 17 December, the Victorian ombudsman tabled a report in the Victorian Parliament in which she found 4 July lockdown of the public housing towers breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 30 December, Victoria's 61-day streak of zero community cases came to an end as three community cases were identified, linked to the New South Wales outbreak. As a precautionary measure for New Year's Eve the Victorian Government reduced household gatherings from 30 people to 15 and mandated masks within an indoor setting. The border to New South Wales closed at 11:59 pm on 31 December, with returning Victorian residents from "green zones" that returned before the deadline made to isolate until they received a negative test result. Those that returned afterwards would have to get tested and isolate for 14 days, aligning the restrictions with visitors from the Northern Beaches and Greater Sydney that had been enforced 11 days prior. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, a quarantine hotel worker at the Grand Hyatt Melbourne, a "resident support officer" involved in the Australian Open tennis quarantine program, was found to have COVID-19. From 11:59 pm Victoria immediately reintroduced some rules, tightened some, and put off imminent easing of some restrictions. The plan to, from 8 February (Monday), allow up to 75 per cent of office workers back into their workplaces was put on hold. Masks are mandatory inside, and only 15 persons are allowed at private events. The man visited at least 14 businesses from 29 January to 1 February, but was able to give contact tracers a detailed list of places and times. Anyone who was at those places at those times, must be tested, and isolate for 14 days. Testing site hours were extended from 4 February, opening at 8 am. More drive-through lanes were added, and additional testing sites opened. By 5 February, genomic sequencing confirmed that the Hyatt worker was infected with the more contagious "UK strain" of COVID-19. \c\cOn 12 February, it was announced that a five-day lockdown under Stage 4 restrictions would take effect beginning at 11:59 pm. AEDT, due to a cluster of 13 cases tied to a Holiday Inn quarantine hotel near Melbourne Airport, which have been assumed to be the UK variant. It was alleged by health officials to have been spread on a hotel floor due to a patient's use of an aerosol-generating nebuliser, which is normally banned under hotel quarantine. By 14 February the cluster had grown to 16, and by 16 February, the number of confirmed infections had increased to 19. By 19 February,  the Melbourne Holiday Inn outbreak had increased to 22, one person was admitted to intensive care, and about 3,515 contacts were quarantined. \c\cResidents may not leave their homes except for essential shopping, exercise, caregiving, essential work, or participating in a professional sporting event. Residents may only shop or exercise within five kilometres of their homes. Face masks are mandatory at all times out-of-home, all public gatherings are banned, and all schools are closed. As they account for the majority of UK variant cases, international arrivals into Victoria have also been suspended. All Australian states and territories have placed travel restrictions upon Victoria. Premier Andrews stated that these infections were "moving at a velocity that has not been seen anywhere in our country over the course of these last 12 months." Special dispensation was given to the 2021 Australian Open, which became crowdless effective 11:30 pm. AEDT on 12 February in the midst of the night's final match (play was temporarily suspended at that time to remove all spectators from the court). \c\cThe lockdown was lifted as anticipated at 11:59 pm on 17  February. Despite this, Victoria will not allow any incoming international flights "indefinitely". \c\cRemaining restrictions included:\c\cMasks mandatory inside,\c\cMasks outdoors when unable to keep social distance,\c\c5 person limit on home visits,\c\c20 person limit for outdoor gatherings. \c\cOn 29 January 2020, Queensland was the first to declare a public health emergency. The legislation was strengthened on 6 February by the Public Health (Declared Public Health Emergencies) Amendment Bill 2020. \c\cKey directions made under the Public Health Act 2005 include:\c\c2 April – A person must not leave their principal place of residence except for essential needs including work, food, medical and exercise, outdoor gatherings only up to 2 persons or with members of household, receiving only to 2 visitors at a residence, and no gatherings in non-residences. \c\c9 April – "Non-essential" business, activity or undertaking must not be operated. "Non-essential" businesses include cinemas, casinos, concerts, indoor sports, gyms, playgrounds, campgrounds, libraries. Restrictions also apply to restaurants (take away or delivery only), churches, hairdressers etc. However, most construction, mining, manufacturing and retail businesses continued to operate. \c\cRestricted entry into Queensland was introduced, with only Queensland residents and those considered an \'exempt person\' being allowed to enter Queensland by air, sea, rail or road from another state or territory. This was introduced in stages: Stage 1 started on 26 March 2020, with stages 2 and 3 involving tightening the restrictions. Stage 4, introduced on 11 April, was the most restrictive, every person crossing the border including Queensland residents required a permit. In addition, a person who had been in a declared COVID-19 hotspot in the previous 14 days had to self-quarantine for 14 days. \c\cClosures of areas within Queensland included:\c\cAll camping areas within Queensland national parks, state forests and recreation areas were closed on 26 March.[citation needed]\c\cClosure of high visitation National Parks including Fraser Island as well as all day use areas and visitor centres on 9 April. \c\cClosure of Queensland waters to cruise ships on 6 April. \c\cClosure of Surfers Paradise, Coolangatta and The Spit beaches on 8 April. \c\cAccess to the Torres Strait Islands has been restricted to prevent COVID-19 from reaching the region, which has to date remained free of cases. \c\cOn 1 February 2021, Queensland opened its border to all Australian states and territories except Western Australia. Since the border closures were implemented, 6,855,750 border passes were issued. \c\cOn 22 February, the first Queenslander received a COVID-19 vaccination at Gold Coast University Hospital. She was a nurse who works in that hospital's COVID-19 ward. \c\cOn 28 February 2021,  the "Check in Qld" QR code sign-in/contact tracing app was launched by the Minister for Health and Ambulance Services, Yvette D\'Ath.  It is based on the ACT "Check in CBR" app. Use of the app is not mandatory. \c\cOn 12 March, Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane went into lockdown after a doctor tested positive for COVID-19. This was the beginning of one cluster in Brisbane connected to that hospital. Queensland had gone 59 days without any locally acquired COVID-19 infections. \c\cOn 8 January 2021, a three-day lockdown was announced by Annastacia Palaszczuk to prevent spread of the more contagious UK strain of coronavirus that escaped from a Brisbane hotel quarantine. The lockdown applied to all of greater Brisbane including council areas of Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan City, Moreton Bay and Redland City from 6 pm that day. More than 2 million residents were affected. \c\cOn 29 March at 5 pm, Greater Brisbane went into yet another three-day lockdown. The step was taken when a second cluster of the UK strain of COVID-19 grew to seven people. Two of them were an un-vaccinated nurse from Princess Alexandra Hospital, and her sister. By 30 March another 8 locally acquired cases were reported, for a total of 10 new cases in the preceding 24 hours, and 2 separate clusters, both UK strain were identified. As of this date Queensland has 78 active cases in hospitals. On 31 March in Queensland 34,711 coronavirus tests and 7,596 vaccinations were conducted. \c\cOn 1 April, the "three-day" lockdown was lifted five hours early at midday. Though 10 new cases had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, there was only one case of community transmission, which was linked to the second cluster surrounding the infected nurse from the Princess Alexandra Hospital. This cluster now numbered 12, up from 7 on 29 March. \c\cSome restrictions introduced for the lockdown will be maintained temporarily:\c\call Queenslanders will have to carry a face-mask outside their home until 15 April,\c\cpatrons at food or beverage venues must stay seated, no dancing allowed,\c\c30 person limit at private gatherings at homes statewide,\c\cBusinesses and churches can open, but must have only one-person-per 2-square-metres of floor area,\c\cVisitors are not permitted for 2 weeks at: aged or disabled care facilities, hospitals and prisons. \c\cOn 15 March 2020, Premier Mark McGowan declared a state of emergency in Western Australia, along with a formal public health emergency. Schools were prevented from organising gatherings of over 500, including "...swimming and sports carnivals, interschool carnivals, performances, concerts, exhibitions, fetes and fairs."\c\cOn 24 March, the state borders were closed and all interstate arrivals were required to self-isolate for 14 days. \c\cOn 1 April, regional border restrictions were implemented across Western Australia restricting travel between regions to essential services only. People were given 48-hour warning to return to their home region. At the time the Perth Stadium became the COVID-19 incident response centre for WA. Within the Kimberley region, movement was further restricted to prevent travel between each of the four local government areas. \c\cOn 5 April, all state borders were closed, a strengthening of the previous border rules, all arrivals were quarantined in city hotels for 14 days. \c\cThe MV Artania departed Fremantle on 18 April following a standoff with State and Federal governments over responsibility for the care of passengers and crew. The vessel was sailing for Indonesia and the Philippines before heading back to Europe. \c\cOn 7 August, easing of internal WA restrictions set for 15 August were deferred to at least 29 August due to the Victorian outbreak. They were again further delayed to at least 24 October.[citation needed]\c\cOn 31 January 2021, a quarantine hotel security guard at the Four Points by Sheraton in Perth tested positive. A lockdown from 6 pm on 31 January to 6 pm on 5 February was declared for the Perth, Peel and South West regions. Schools within the lockdown area (which were anticipated to open the following day) remained closed and reopened the following week. Approximately 2 million people in WA were affected by the lockdown. \c\cIn response to the lockdown, health authorities in the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Victoria declared the affected areas to be COVID-19 hotspots. The states quickly enacted a variety of restrictions against travellers from WA who arrived since 25 January, ranging from, requiring COVID testing, 5 to 14 days of self or supervised quarantine, to Victoria forbidding entry without a permit. On 2 February New South Wales ordered more than 1,100 people who had visited affected areas in WA since 25 January into five days of lockdown, adhering to the same restrictions as in WA. New arrivals from WA had to have a COVID-19 test within 48 hours, or undergo 14 days of quarantine. \c\cThe lockdown was lifted on 5 February, but some rules such as mandatory mask wearing, and travel restrictions, were maintained in the Peel and Perth regions. The last lockdown specific restrictions were lifted at 12:01 am on 14 February. Premier McGowan said that since January 31 more than 102,000 COVID-19 tests had been done in WA. There were no new COVID-19 cases detected in WA overnight before the change, and only 5 active cases in WA, all in hotel quarantine. \c\cAlso on 5 February, Premier McGowan announced a A$43 million package to assist small businesses and charities in WA who suffered financially during the lockdown in the form of a A$500 offset on their electricity bill. Chief executive of The Australian Hotels Association (AHA) WA, Bradley Woods said: "We estimate over $100 million revenue and sales has been lost as a result of this shutdown ...". Plans to increase WA's weekly international flight arrival cap were postponed to the end of February. \c\cOn 23 April 2021, due to an asymptomatic returned traveller who tested positive after completing 14 days of hotel quarantine and subsequently went into the community, a lockdown from 12:01 am on 24 April to 12:01 am on 27 April was declared for the Perth and Peel regions. ANZAC Day commemorations inside the lockdown area (which were anticipated to go ahead with caps on ANZAC Day) were cancelled and people were encouraged to participate in driveway dawn services, as was the case in 2020. \c\cOn 15 March, a public health emergency was declared in South Australia. \c\cOn 22 March, a "major emergency" was declared, giving the police power to enforce self-isolation rules. \c\cOn 24 March, state borders were closed. People arriving in the state were required to sign a declaration that they would self-isolate for 14 days and provide an address to the police, with penalties for failure to comply. \c\cOn 27 March, a direction was made under the Emergency Management Act 2004 to prohibit gatherings of more than 10 people, and a limit of 1 person per four square metres. \c\cOn 16 November, "a number of significant restrictions" were reintroduced after an outbreak of coronavirus in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. \c\cOn 17 November, a six-day lockdown from midnight that day was announced. Afterwards there will be another eight days of "significant restrictions" according to Police Commissioner Grant Stevens. On 21 November, Premier Steven Marshall announced that the state's "circuit breaker" restrictions would be ending three days earlier on 21 November after authorities discovered that one of the positive cases at the Woodville Pizza Bar coronavirus hotspot had misled contact tracers by concealing the fact that he worked at the shop. As part of the easing of "circuit breaker restrictions", groups of 50 people will be allowed to attend private functions and funerals, ten people can attend private functions, and 100 people will be allowed to attend restaurants and pubs. \c\cOn 12 February 2021, the World Solar Challenge (SWC) for that year was cancelled by the SA Government. \c\cOn 5 March 2021, the first Australian received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. A doctor in regional South Australia, she was dosed at Murray Bridge Hospital. \c\cScotch Oakburn College in Tasmania closed as a preemptive decision in fear of rising SARS-CoV-2 cases. It was to be closed from 16 March until at least 30 March. \c\cOn 17 March, Tasmania declared a public health emergency. \c\cOn 19 March, all "non-essential" travellers to the state, including returning residents, were subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine. \c\cOn 12 April 2020, in response to an outbreak in Burnie, business restrictions were put in place for 14 days. It included the closure of most retail businesses except for those providing essential services, or those who can provide online services and home delivery. The North West Regional Hospital (NWRH) and North West Private Hospital (NWPH) were temporarily closed from Monday 13 April 2020, and staff, patients, and visitors since 27 March, were required to self-quarantine for 14 days. The self-quarantine affected up to 5,000 people. Additional testing was announced, and emergency medical teams from the Australian Defence Force were sent to Burnie to cover for hospital staff. \c\cOn 16 March 2020, the ACT government declared a public health emergency. All visits to the Alexander Maconochie prison were cancelled from 23 March, but there was "increased access to telephones" for prisoners to keep in touch with their families. \c\cOn 18 July 2020, it was announced a sitting of Federal Parliament, scheduled for the first 2 weeks of August, had been cancelled. Medical advice was that, due to increased transmission of COVID-19 in Victoria, and the upward trend in NSW as well, there was a "significant risk" if members were to return to Canberra from all over Australia. Prime Minister Morrison requested that the sitting be cancelled. Parliament returned in August with some Members and Senators participating via video links from remote locations. \c\cOn 9 September 2020 in Canberra, the "Check in CBR" sign-in/contact tracing app was introduced. \c\cOn 31 January 2021, Federal politicians flying in from Western Australia had to quarantine for five days when a sudden lockdown was declared in Perth and two adjoining regions. Parliament is scheduled to resume on 2 February. \c\cOn 17 February 2021, the Australian Capital Territorys\' public health emergency declaration was extended 90 days to 18 May 2021.  Every three months during the pandemic, the ACT government has lengthened the public health emergency. \c\cOn 22 February 2021, the first Canberran received a COVID-19 vaccination. She was a 22-year-old  registered nurse, and a member of a COVID-19 testing team. \c\cOn 24 March 2020, the Northern Territory (NT) government introduced strict border control, with anyone arriving from abroad or interstate being required to self-isolate for 14 days. The only exemption would be due to health and emergency services, defence and policing, flight crews and freight, and based on "compassionate grounds". NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said that the local police and government are likely to impose these measures until September. Anyone now arriving in NT will have to declare that they would isolate for 14 days and let the authorities know of their location during this period at the point of entry. Failure to comply with the new regulations could result in denying entry or a fine of A$62,800. Furthermore, all non-essential travel to the NT's 76 remote communities was banned. \c\cFrom midday on 1 May, some internal restrictions in NT were eased. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, after a quarantine hotel worker at the Grand Hyatt Melbourne, involved in the Australian Open tennis quarantine program, was found to have COVID-19, Victoria reintroduced some rules, and delayed the imminent easing of some restrictions. On 4 February 2021 the Northern Territory responded to the Melbourne situation by declaring ten suburbs in Melbourne to be hotspots. From 3:30 pm (Australian Central Standard Time–ACST), arrivals into NT from Melbourne, West Melbourne, Noble Park, Keysborough, Springvale, Brighton, Wheelers Hill, Clayton South, Heatherton or Moorabbin will be required to go into mandatory quarantine for 14 days. Those already in NT who have been in a any of the hotspots since 29 January will also have to self-isolate until their COVID-19 testing is negative. \c\cJervis Bay Territory has not had any confirmed cases. The territory's border with New South Wales was closed and residents were not allowed outside except for essential purposes. Various less stringent restrictions on internal activity and travel from other parts of Australia remained in place in November. \c\cNorfolk Island has not had any confirmed cases. As a precautionary measure, the government imposed a 32-day travel ban and declared a state of emergency. Administrator Eric Hutchinson stated that the measures were necessary due to the remote island's extremely limited health capacity. \c\cOn 18 March 2020, Administrator Natasha Griggs declared a state of emergency in the Australian Indian Ocean Territories, comprising Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. She limited passenger arrivals to local residents and essential staff, and imposed a self-isolation period of 14 days on any arrivals. \c\cOn 3 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia became the first central bank to cut interest rates in response to the outbreak. Official interest rates were cut by 0.25% to a record low of 0.5%. \c\cOn 12 March, the Liberal Party announced a planned A$17.6 billion stimulus package. The package consists of multiple parts: a one-off payment to pensioners, social security recipients, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders, payments of A$2,000–A$25,000 to affected small businesses, an increase to the threshold for the Instant Asset Write-off Program, tax concessions for investments, a small business 50% wage subsidy for 120,000 trainees and apprentices, and A$1 billion in subsidies for heavily affected industries. \c\cOn 17 March, the New South Wales government announced a A$2.3 billion stimulus package, including A$700 million for health services. A$450 million was allocated to waive payroll tax for 3 months. $250 million so state-owned buildings and public schools could employ more cleaners. A$750 million was allocated for capital works and public asset maintenance. \c\cOn 18 March, the Northern Territory government announced an economic stimulus package of A$60 million. \c\cOn 19 March, the Reserve Bank again cut interest rates by a further 0.25%, from 0.5% to 0.25%, the lowest in Australian history. \c\cIn March 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) began releasing a number of additional statistical products to assess the economic impacts on the outbreak on the Australian economy. Data on retail trade turnover indicated a 0.4% rise in turnover in February 2020. Negative effects on some areas of the retail sector (particularly tourism-dependent businesses) were offset by a rise in food retail turnover, with supermarkets showing a large rise in sales, mainly arising from panic buying. \c\cOn 22 March, the Federal government announced a second stimulus package of A$66 billion, increasing the amount of total financial package offered to A$89 billion. This included several new measures like an extra A$550 \'Coronavirus Supplement\' payment to those on income support, paid from 27 April to 24 September 2020, and relaxed eligibility criteria for individuals on JobSeeker Payment, granting A$100,000 to small and medium-sized businesses and A$715 million to Australian airports and airlines. It also allowed individuals affected by the outbreak to access up to A$10,000 of their superannuation during 2019–2020 and also being able to take an additional same amount for the next year. \c\cOn 30 March, the Australian Government announced a six-month, A$130 billion JobKeeper payment. The JobKeeper payment provides businesses with up to A$1,500 a fortnight per full-time or part-time employee, or casual employee that has worked for that business for over a year. To be eligible, a business with an annual revenue of under A$1 billion must have lost 30% turnover since 1 March, or 50% for businesses over A$1 billion. The entire payment made to businesses for an employee must then, by law, be paid to that employee in lieu of normal pay. This response came after the enormous job losses seen just a week prior when an estimated 1 million Australians lost their jobs. The program was backdated to 1 March with the aim of re-employing many people who had lost their jobs in the weeks before. In the first hour of the scheme, over 8,000 businesses registered to receive the payments. The program is one of the largest economic packages ever implemented in modern Australian history. JobKeeper ended on 28 March 2021. \c\cOn 11 April the South Australian state government announced its own A$350 million economic stimulus measures. \c\cIn late April the Federal government announced A$94.6 million of support was available for zoos, wildlife parks and aquariums forced to close by coronavirus restrictions. This was part of previously announced economic stimulus measures. \c\cThe 2020 Federal Budget, normally delivered in May, is delayed until 6 October because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cOn 22 May 2020, the Treasury and Australian Taxation Office announced there had been a miscalculation of A$60 billion in the planned cost of the JobKeeper program. Blaming 1,000 businesses for making "significant errors" on the application form, the Australian Government revealed it had overbudgeted the program, and that it was forecast to cost A$70 billion, not A$130 billion. The Treasury also announced that its original forecast of 6.5 million recipients was inaccurate, and closer to 3.5 million. Prime Minister Scott Morrison celebrated the saving, while the Opposition announced a parliamentary inquiry in an attempt to compel Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to explain the overestimation. \c\cIn July 2020, Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, in an interview with the US CNBC news channel, vowed that the government's budget deficit was expected to increase to A$85.8 billion Australian dollars in the financial year ended on 30 June and further widen to A$184.5 billion in the new fiscal year. \c\cOn 2 September the Australian economy went into recession for the first time in nearly thirty years. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) fell 7 per cent in the June quarter. In December, it was announced Australia had pulled out of recession after experiencing a 3.3% growth in GDP in the September quarter. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg stated the effects of the recession had lasting impacts and the recovery was far from over. Australia is set to avoid an economic depression as forecast earlier in 2020, though GDP is likely to have experienced a contraction from 2019 figures. \c\cThe 2020 Australian federal budget, delayed from May, is finally delivered on 6 October. \c\cOn 22 February 2021, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that the JobSeeker Payment base rate would be increased by A$50 a fortnight from April 2021. The payment will rise to A$614 a fortnight, with an estimated cost over forward estimates of A$9 billion. It is also intended to increase the threshold amount recipients can earn before their payment starts to be reduced. \c\cOn 26 February 2021 the Chief Executive of the Australian Airports Association, James Goodwin, said that Australian airports had been losing A$320 million every month during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said over the past 12 months, job losses amounted to 25 per cent of the airports workforce. \c\cOn 10 March 2021 the Federal Government announced steps worth A$1.2 billion to encourage Australians to holiday within Australia to assist ailing tourist destinations. Between April and July, up to 800,000 airfares to 13 regions normally favoured by international tourists will be halved for domestic travellers. \c\cOn 17 November 2020 the NSW Government announced in the state budget that all NSW residents over 18 years-of-age would be eligible to receive four A$25 vouchers through Service NSW to help stimulate the economy. Two vouchers are for dining, Monday to Thursday only, excluding public holidays. The other two are to be spent on entertainment, excluding on public holidays. Businesses need to be COVID-safe registered, and sign-up for the scheme. The vouchers cannot be used for gambling, alcohol, cigarettes, retail purchases or accommodation. The program was originally called "Out and About". \c\cResidents will need to have a Service NSW account to receive their vouchers. After trials in Sydney and regional areas, full rollout was scheduled for March. The trials began in Broken Hill, and The Rocks in Sydney on 11 February 2021. \c\cThe pandemic had dramatic effects on the Australian rate of unemployment. In July 2019 it was 5.1%, by July 2020 it peaked at 7.5%, during the pandemic, by the end of 2020 it had fallen to 6.6%. Figures for February to March 2021, released in April, showed unemployment had reduced to 5.8 per cent, 0.4 points higher than at the start to the pandemic. \c\cIn September 2020, a report from Ernst & Young stated that pandemic related border restrictions could result in a shortfall of 26,000 pickers over Australia's summer harvest season. Such work is typically reliant on seasonal staff from overseas. As a trial in early September 2020, 160 workers from Vanuatu were allowed into the Northern Territory (NT) to pick mangoes. They arrived on a specially chartered aircraft, and had to undergo the usual 14-day quarantine. It was estimated that the Vanuatuan workers saved A$100 million of fruit from the NT mango harvest being left to rot. The mango industry in the NT was valued at more than A$128 million in 2019, and produces more than half of Australia's mangoes. \c\cOn 30 September 2020, PM Scott Morrison announced that: " ... backpackers, Pacific Islanders and seasonal workers will be able to extend their visas to stay in Australia ..." and "... welfare recipients will be offered incentives to pick fruit."\c\cIn late October 2020, some farmers found that they had to plough their produce back into the ground because it could not be harvested, at a loss of A$150,000. \c\cThe "Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job" (RATTUAJ) program, scheduled to run from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021, offers A$6,000 for transport, moving expenses, accommodation and work clothing for welfare recipients willing to relocate to a regional area for a minimum of 6 weeks for short term agricultural jobs. Up to early December 2020, the relocation incentives for unemployed Australians appeared to be failing. After operating for a month, Federal Department of Employment figures showed only 148 people had taken up the offer. \c\cShortage of workers for harvesting can not only mean unpicked produce being left to rot or be ploughed back into fields, and farmers possibly not planting the next year, it creates an economic loss to those farmers, and can also noticeably increase prices for consumers. \c\cBefore the crisis, 600,000 Australians were employed in the arts, an industry which added around A$3.2 billion to export revenues. The rate of employment in the sector grew at a faster rate than the rest of the economy. According to government figures, "cultural and creative activity contributed to A$112 billion (6.4% of GDP) to Australia's economy in 2016–17". \c\cBeginning in the second week of March 2020, Australian institutions began announcing reduced services, and then complete closures. One of the first casualties was the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, with organisers announcing on 13 March 2020 that the 2020 festival had been cancelled entirely. Opera Australia announced it would close on 15 March. The national closure of all cultural institutions was mandated on 24 March, with subsequent restrictions on public gatherings. Consequently, many cultural events were also cancelled, including the Sydney Writers\' Festival. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, by the beginning of April, "Arts and Recreation services" was the sector of the national economy with the smallest proportion of its business still in operation – at 47%. A graph in Guardian Australia showing businesses by sector that had ceased trading between June 2019 and 30 March 2020 shows over 50% of arts and recreation services, the hardest hit of any sector (information media and telecommunications is next, at about 34%). Adrian Collette, CEO of the Australia Council for the Arts, the government's arts funding and advisory body, described the impact on the cultural and creative sectors as "catastrophic". \c\cThe Australian film industry has been severely impacted, with at least 60 shoots being halted and about 20,000 people out of work. On Monday 23 March, all productions funded by Screen Australia were postponed. As of 15 April 2020[update], after some improvement in COVID-19 statistics in Australia, Screen Australia continues to fund work and process applications, intending to use all of its 2019/20 budget. Film industry organisations such as Screen Producers Australia (SPA) and the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA) have been lobbying the government for a support package specific to the screen industry, and to expand the JobKeeper requirements so that those in the screen industry are better covered. Many in the film industry are employed by Special Purpose Vehicles – temporary companies that cease trading once production has finished – which cannot easily prove that their turnover has fallen by 30% or more. SPA said that the industry shutdown had cost more than A$500 million, with about A$20 million of lost export revenue. \c\cOne hundred and nineteen films and TV shows have been halted, with only a few shows (such as MasterChef Australia and Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell) continuing production through the pandemic. The TV soap Neighbours was the first English-language TV drama series in the world to announce that resumption of production would begin soon after 20 April 2020. \c\cLike other governments around the world, the Australian government has acknowledged the economic, cultural and social value of the arts industry. The Australia Council has redirected about A$5 million to "new programs designed to provide immediate relief to Australian artists, arts workers and arts organisations to support their livelihoods, practice and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic" (the "Resilience Fund"), and is also hosting weekly meetings to address the concerns of specific sections of the industry, such as Indigenous creatives and organisations, live performance and public gatherings, and various peak bodies. Several state governments have also provided relief packages. \c\cIn early April, the federal government announced a package of A$27 million in specific arts funding: A$7 million for the Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program, A$10 million for Regional Arts Australia's regional arts fund, and A$10 million for Support Act, a charity founded in 1997 that provides financial support and counselling to people in the music industry in Australia. However, the "JobKeeper" scheme specifically excluded "freelancers and casuals on short-term contracts, or who have worked for a series of employers in the last year", thus excluding a large proportion of arts and cultural sector professionals, who rely on short-term contracts. \c\cHowever, most of the arts sector's more than 193,000 workers were still unable to access the JobKeeper payments, despite being defined as sole traders, and an estimated A$330 million worth of paid performances cancelled. The Australia Institute recommended a A$750 million rescue package for the industry, while Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said that arts workers should utilise existing support measures. \c\cOn 4 May 2020, the company operating the Carriageworks multi-arts venue in Sydney declared it would be entering voluntary administration and closing, citing an "irreparable loss of income" due to government bans on events during the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent negative impact on the arts sector. Carriageworks was the first major arts venue in the country to collapse suddenly after the hit to income caused by the strict social distancing rules enforced by state and federal governments, but others feared the same fate, after being forced to shut their doors in late March. \c\cOn 13 May 2020, the Art Gallery of South Australia announced that it would reopen on 8 June. \c\cOn 24 June 2020, the federal government announced a $250 million rescue package for the arts, comprising grants and loans. The package includes $75m for a grants program for new festivals, concerts, tours and events; $90m in loans to help fund new productions; $50m to help film and television producers unable to access insurance due to the pandemic, to enable them to restart production; and $35 million in direct financial assistance for struggling Commonwealth-funded organisations, including theatre, dance, music and circus. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) welcomed the boost, but critics said that it was not nearly enough, especially with so many workers in the industry still ineligible for JobKeeper payments. \c\cAboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders have poorer health outcomes and a lower life expectancy than the non-Indigenous Australian population, particularly those living in remote areas, and along with overcrowded housing and many living in very remote communities, makes them one of the communities most vulnerable to the virus. The remote Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY lands) in South Australia, whose population has many comorbidities, high rates of tobacco use, overcrowded housing and overall poor hygiene, introduced restricted access to the lands in early March to protect their people, especially elders, from the virus. The Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said it was a sensible move, and that the federal government would work with them. (A later call to evacuate elders to Adelaide by the APY Art Centre Collective was not put into operation.)\c\cThe federal government set up a national Indigenous advisory group in early March, to create an emergency response plan for Aboriginal communities. The 43-page plan was published in March, and in late March, the Prime Minister that advised that Indigenous Australians over the age of 50 (along with everyone over 70 and those with a chronic illness over 60), should stay at home as much as possible. The Department of Health created a web page dedicated to advice for Indigenous people and remote communities, and the National Indigenous Australians Agency has one dedicated to the government's response to COVID-19. On 18 April the NIAA announced a government package of A$123 million of "targeted measures to support Indigenous businesses and communities to increase their responses to COVID-19", for the coming two financial years. \c\cThe Northern Territory developed a remote health pandemic plan, with NT Health setting up a number of remote clinics across the Territory. All non-essential travel to the 76 remote communities was banned, and a 14-day isolation period imposed for those residents wanting to return home from regional centres, and in May, health officials suggested that these controls should stay in place for the foreseeable future. In mid-March, a group of senior NT clinicians called for 16 measures to be implemented as soon as possible to help protect vulnerable communities. Other states and territories have provided advice on their health agency websites. \c\cA group of Barkindji families set up a tent town on the banks of the Darling River near Wilcannia in New South Wales, to escape the threat of the disease from overcrowded accommodation in the town. \c\cThe major sporting leagues (A-League, AFL, AFL Women's, and the National Rugby League) initially stated that their seasons would not be suspended but would continue behind closed doors, with some games being played under those conditions. However all the leagues were later suspended. \c\cInitially the 2020 Stawell Gift was postponed until later in the year, however in May it was cancelled entirely for 2020. \c\cThe AFL season was initially curtailed to a maximum of 17 games, with clubs expected to take at least a 10% revenue hit from coronavirus related issues. However, on 22 March, just before the end of round 1 of the 2020 season, AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan announced that the AFL season would be suspended until at least 31 May, citing the shutting of state borders as the primary cause for this decision. The AFL season restarted on 11 June, with the Grand Final being played on 24 October at the The Gabba in Brisbane, Queensland, the first Grand Final to be held outside Victoria. The 2020 AFL Women's season was cancelled midway through the finals series, with no premiership awarded to any team. \c\cThe 2020 NBL Finals began with game two, although it was stated that the competition would be immediately suspended if any participants were to be diagnosed. The best of five series was subsequently cancelled after the third game was played with the title awarded to Perth Wildcats. \c\cAll second-tier state basketball leagues were either postponed or cancelled. \c\cThe remaining two One Day Internationals between Australia and New Zealand were cancelled after the first match was played behind closed doors. Cricket Australia also cancelled the Australian women's cricket team's tour of South Africa due to the virus. \c\cThe first sporting event in Australia to be affected was the 2020 Australian Grand Prix, which was cancelled on 13 March after McLaren withdrew when a team member tested positive for COVID-19. This was also enforced on the support races which included the 2020 Melbourne 400, which was the second round of the 2020 Supercars Championship to be cancelled.[citation needed] The 2021 Australian Grand Prix was postponed from its original March date to November to allow for the easing of travel restrictions. \c\cFollowing the implementation of travel restrictions by New Zealand, the Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) announced that the New Zealand Warriors would be based in Australia for the foreseeable future. The 2020 season was suspended indefinitely on 23 March. Chairman of the ARLC Peter V\'landys requested a government bailout for the National Rugby League, a request that was struck down, and caused a considerable negative reaction. \c\cOn 22 April, the NRL announced that they planned for the season to restart on 28 May, with training beginning on 4 May, and has planned for 18 rounds (giving a 20-round season) and a State of Origin series, with the Grand Final rescheduled for 25 October. \c\cThe NRL season recommenced on 28 May with a round 3 game played in Brisbane between the Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta Eels. The match was played behind closed doors without any crowd, although the broadcasters (Channel 9 and Fox Sports) used fake crowd noise during the broadcast. The return match rated highly on TV as it was the first TV match of a team sport in Australia for 8 weeks. The Grand Final was played in front of a limited crowd on 25 October at ANZ Stadium. \c\cThe 2020 State of Origin series took place after the NRL season, with Game 3 holding a capacity crowd at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium. \c\cThe 2020 Super Rugby season was suspended following the conclusion of play on 15 March, due to the outbreak and the imposition of mandatory quarantine for international travellers to New Zealand. \c\cThe A-League initially announced a continuation of the league with the Wellington Phoenix being based in Australia; however, on 24 March, suspended the remaining matches indefinitely. On 17 July, the season resumed in a NSW-based hub, where the season finished with the Grand Final occurring at Bankwest Stadium on 30 August in front of a limited crowd. \c\cThe 2020 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race was cancelled on 19 December due to an outbreak in the Greater Sydney region. \c\cOn 3 January 2021, an anti-mask protest was held inside Westfield Bondi Junction in New South Wales. This was the first day that new mask wearing requirements, including venues like shopping centres, came into effect. On 23 January 2021 an anti-mask protest was stopped by NSW Police from entering the Westfield Parramatta shopping centre. Warning was given to the group to obey public health orders, and follow social distancing guidelines. One man was arrested when he did not comply with the police directive when the group dispersed after they were given a move-on direction. A protest group was also turned away from the Parramatta Westfield a week earlier. \c\cOn 12 February, there was an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne. Two were arrested. \c\cOn 20 February, anti-COVID-19 vaccine rallies were held in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. There were a few hundred people at each. The Federal Government COVID-19 vaccination program was scheduled to start on 22 February, but the first doses were administered on 21 February. \c\cDuring the 2021 Australian Open, an official referred to the COVID-19 vaccine as a sign of optimism, which was followed by booing by the fans present at the event. The Australian government criticized the reaction of the fans and called it "disgusting". \c\cThe pandemic has created shortages of some medications since it began, initially related to panic buying. The most commonly used antidepressant in Australia, sertraline, is one of many such as the brand Zoloft, that have been affected by a global shortage. Olmesartan and irbesartan, both blood pressure medications were short in Australia as were hormone replacement therapy (HRT) patches and carbimazole, a thyroid medication. As of February 2021 the contraceptive pill "Norimin" (norethisterone) was hard for pharmacists to acquire, supply had been intermittent for 6–12 months. Shortages of Norimin and Brevinor, both Pfizer products, were reported in August 2020 and first predicted to last until December 2020, the shortage was then expected by the TGA "... to be resolved in March or April 2021". In the case of sertraline a Serious Shortage Substitution Notice (SSSN) was issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). SSSNs were also issued in Australia for Prazosin (blood pressure), Metformin (diabetes), and Estradot (HRT), which in theory allows substitutions like issuing twice the number of 25 mg tablets in place of the prescribed 50 mg tablets, without a new prescription, but with the patients\' consent. Chris Moy, Vice President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) said medicine shortages in Australia were a "pre-existing problem" before COVID-19. \c\cMoy also said "A lot of our medications are made in China and India. Sovereign capability and protecting supply of our medications is something that should be seriously considered."\c\cThe TGA gave short-term approval for the import of some medicines that are "not on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) that are approved for import and supply in Australia because: there is a shortage of a medicine registered in Australia; and the medicine is needed in the interest of public health."\c\cOn 2 October 2020, Prime Minister Morrison announced that the Australian Government had formalised a deal allowing New Zealanders "one-way quarantine-free travel" into New South Wales and the Northern Territory from 16 October as part of initial steps to establish a "travel bubble" between the two countries. However, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ruled out extending reciprocal "quarantine-free travel" for Australians in order to contain the spread of COVID-19 into New Zealand. \c\cOn 17 October 2020, Stuff reported that 17 New Zealanders who had entered New South Wales traveled to Melbourne despite Victoria not being a party to the travel bubble arrangement with New Zealand. The Victorian Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the arrival of the group but stated that it did not have the authority to detain them. In response, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews threatened to close his state's borders unless the Australian Federal Government blocked travellers using the Trans-Tasman bubble from traveling to Victoria. The Federal Government has disagreed with the Victorian Government's stance. In addition, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced that her government would not prevent New Zealand passengers from travelling to Victoria. \c\cOn 11 December 2020, the Premier of Queensland Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that her state would open its borders to travelers from New Zealand from 1:00 am the following day (12 December), exempting them from quarantine restrictions. \c\cOn 14 December 2020, the New Zealand Prime Minister Ardern announced that the New Zealand Government had approved plans to establish a quarantine free travel bubble with Australia in the first quarter of 2021. Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt welcomed the move, describing it as the "first step" in normalising international travel and reiterated the Australian Government's support for measures to establish the travel bubble. \c\cOn 25 January 2021, the Federal government immediately suspended the ability of New Zealanders to travel to Australia that they had since 16 October 2020, without quarantining, for at least 72 hours. This followed the discovery of a NZ resident with the South African COVID-19 variant. The woman was not known to be infectious, having twice tested negative to COVID-19 before leaving quarantine, then visited many places in northern NZ, but she was then found to have the new strain. \c\cOn 19 April 2021, Australians were allowed quarantine-free travel to New Zealand for the first time in more than a year. To fly under the bubble's rules, passengers must have spent 14 days before departure in either Australia or New Zealand, however they are not required to spend the full 14 day period or more in the other country, i.e. a person has spent at least 14 days in Australia, flies to New Zealand and returns to Australia after 7 days. They must not be awaiting the results of a Covid test, nor have any Covid symptoms, amongst other criteria. 
On 28 April 2021, a fire at a hostel in Riga, Latvia, killed eight people and wounded nine others. \c\cShortly after 4:30 am the fire broke out in Japanese Style Centrum, an illegal hostel on the sixth floor of a block of flats in the Latvian capital Riga. The fire brigade were called at 4:43 am. The fire killed eight people - some of whom were foreign nationals - and injured another nine people. \c\cHostels in the Baltic state have been allowed to operate through the pandemic. The hostel was crowded and some guests who stayed there in late 2020 and early 2021 said the conditions inside were poor. In February 2021, officials who wanted to carry out a fire safety inspection were refused entry. The Mayor of Riga, Mārtiņš Staķis, said the unauthorised hostel will be closed down. A criminal investigation into the fire was opened on the day it occurred.
On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the arrests of 13 men suspected of orchestrating a domestic terror plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Governor of Michigan, and otherwise violently overthrow the state government. The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. \c\cPreceding the 2020 United States elections, law enforcement officials, members of Congress, and groups tracking extremism in the country have warned about the increasing threat potential from militia and far-right groups. The Anti-Defamation League identified Michigan as a state where the modern militia movement found its roots and where a number of militia groups remain active. However, Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the Wolverine Watchmen group, which the suspects were members of, "flew under the radar", adding, "This is simply not a big group that we\'d ever heard of."\c\cThe alleged plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer developed from June through September. Within the week preceding the Wolverine Watchmen arrests, there were at least three other state and federal arrest operations linked to the Boogaloo movement, of which the Wolverine Watchmen group's ideology adhered to. \c\cWhitmer, the main target of the plot, had seen her political profile elevated over the preceding months due to her early response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan, in which she enacted strict mitigation measures such as a lockdown of the state, which she was widely praised for. However, she also became a target of criticism from far-right groups, and her measures triggered protests in April and May, including one in which armed protesters stormed the Michigan State Capitol. President Donald Trump had offered his support for the protests, derisively calling Whitmer "that woman from Michigan" and tweeting on April 17: "LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"\c\cUltimately, on October 2, 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court made two rulings in response to the measures: a 4–3 ruling that declared a 1945 law allowing Whitmer to enact the measures was unconstitutional, and a unanimous ruling that declared a 1976 act did not give Whitmer the power to enact the measures without legislative approval. This put uncertainty over enforcement of the measures and forced the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services – and later, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration – to circumvent it by ordering similar measures, even after the alleged plot was made public. \c\cThe suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen. The group was co-founded by suspects Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison; the latter is considered the group's "commander". An NBC News investigation into the suspects\' social media profiles found links between their ideologies and those of the broader boogaloo movement. The Wolverine Watchmen group had been recruiting members on Facebook from November 2019 until June 2020, when Facebook began purging all boogaloo-related material. \c\cThe suspects named in the federal indictment, charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, were Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta. Five of the men were Michigan residents, while the sixth, Croft, was from Delaware. Adam Fox and Barry Croft were accused of being the ringleaders of the plot. The suspects charged with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership, were Wolverine Watchmen founders Musico and Morrison, along with Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar. At least four of the 13 suspects had attended prior rallies at the Michigan State Capitol. On October 15, a fourteenth suspect, Brian Higgins of Wisconsin, was charged at the state level with material support of an act of terrorism. Garbin pleaded guilty on January 27, 2021 and agreed to testify against his five alleged co-conspirators. \c\cJoseph M. Morrison is considered the leader of the Wolverine Watchmen. His home in Munith, which he shared with Musico, was allegedly used as a training site, according to Michigan Assistant Attorney General Gregory Townsend. Photographs of the home show a Confederate battle flag and a variation of the U.S. flag with alternating, vertical red and white stripes and a circle of stars surrounding the words "Liberty or Death". Morrison's neighbors told The Daily Beast that the home's residents were "disrespectful" and said large groups regularly gathered there on weekends, whereupon gunfire would be heard. His online alias was "Boogaloo Bunyan". Morrison had served in the U.S. Marine Corps since 2015, most recently with the 4th Marine Logistics Group in Battle Creek, Michigan, with the rank of lance corporal; he was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve on October 8, the same day as his arrest, for reasons unrelated to the criminal charges. \c\cAdam Fox, the alleged mastermind of the plot, was born Adam Waggoner but changed his last name to his mother's maiden name in 2014. He had been living in the basement of his former employer, a vacuum repair shop in Grand Rapids. Fox received permission for that living arrangement from the shop's owner who felt empathy towards Fox, as Fox was homeless and had dogs. The basement was allegedly used to hold one of the group's meetings. Fox posted a YouTube video in June, mentioning Whitmer's handling of the pandemic as one of his motives for the plot. According to his employer, Fox espoused anti-police and anti-government views, along with support for the boogaloo movement, and had recently become worried about the U.S. becoming a communist country and Democratic politicians taking away his guns. Fox had previously been a member of another militia group called the Michigan Home Guard, but he was kicked out due to "rage issues" and threatening other members on social media. \c\cTy Garbin was raised in Wyandotte but had been living in a manufactured home park in eastern Livingston County at the time of his arrest. His father is an Army veteran. Garbin was a licensed aircraft mechanic and had previously worked for SkyWest Airlines. He met Fox at a Second Amendment rally in Lansing. Garbin allegedly cased the governor's vacation home at night, texted about blowing up a bridge to slow police down, offered to paint his boat for "night fishing" as part of the kidnapping mission on the lake, and had the ability to manufacture guns. His lawyer mentioned he had no criminal record. \c\cBarry Croft regularly posted violent messages on his social media accounts. These accounts depicted him wearing a tricorne and a sweatshirt with an insignia associated with the Three Percenters militia group; he was later identified as the second-in-command of its Wisconsin branch. The FBI identified him as a national leader of the organization in January 2021. He expressed support for the Russia investigation origins counter-narrative and opposition to the country's current immigration policy, and he believed the investigations into President Trump constituted an "uprising". However, he also included Trump's name in a grievance-filled hit-list of politicians that he wanted to hang, which he posted on Facebook in late June. He was living in Bear, Delaware, at the time of his arrest. Croft was arrested multiple times from 1994 to 1996 for assault and burglary. He was convicted in 1997 for possessing a gun in the commission of a felony and spent three years in prison. In April 2019, Croft was pardoned for the conviction, as well as the prior assault and burglary charges, by Delaware Governor John Carney. According to recordings of the alleged plotters, Croft claimed he had been granted permission from God to commit murder. \c\cKaleb Franks had allegedly spent $4,000 on equipment during the planning, including a helmet and night-vision goggles. He also allegedly brought a rifle with a silencer to one of the training exercises. According to his LinkedIn profile, he studied clinical psychology at Washtenaw Community College and was employed as a peer recovery coach at an addiction treatment center in Waterford. He had previously battled an addiction to heroin but has been sober since 2013, according to his lawyer. He was convicted in 2011 for cocaine possession and in 2013 for second-degree home invasion. He served nine months in jail and two years under the jurisdiction of drug courts. \c\cDaniel Harris served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a rifleman from 2014 to June 2019, most recently at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Harris had been deployed to Japan and had reached the rank of corporal. He was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He worked as a security guard at two different companies after being discharged. In June, he attended a Black Lives Matter rally in his hometown of Lake Orion and was interviewed by a local newspaper, where he said he was "upset about the killing of George Floyd and police violence." The group allegedly met at his home on August 23 to discuss the plot. \c\cBrandon Caserta was depicted wearing a Hawaiian-style shirt associated with the boogaloo movement in a TikTok video; and on Facebook, he praised Kyle Rittenhouse, a civilian who shot three protesters, killing two, during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August. Caserta was also a COVID-19 denier and supported the QAnon conspiracy theory; however, in one video, he criticized President Trump and called him a tyrant. His belief system apparently became more extreme following Whitmer's implementation of the statewide lockdown. His social media activity originally consisted of posts about comedy shows and podcasts, motivational quotes, and selfies; but following the lockdown, he began "liking" posts about conspiracy theories regarding Bill Gates, as well as memes about hogtying police officers. \c\cPete Musico was active on YouTube, where he posted video blogs against taxes, gun control, and the so-called deep state. A video posted in 2019, entitled "Gretchen Whitmer Interview", depicted him railing against her policies around automobile ownership and promised he would interview Whitmer in person in a later video. Musico was also active on Gab, where he promoted the unfounded claim that there is an ongoing campaign to kill white people in South Africa. He also followed the accounts of Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs and InfoWars personality Owen Shroyer. On Twitter, he expressed support for Trump and conspiracy theories regarding Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the high presence of mercury in vaccines. Musico's attorney said he was eventually kicked out of the Wolverine Watchmen because he was too "soft" and wouldn\'t commit to violence. \c\cShawn Fix had allegedly hosted Wolverine Watchmen meetings at his home in Belleville to discuss the plot. The house's yard had Donald Trump presidential campaign signs and a Gadsden flag. He was working as a truck driver and had more than a dozen driving infractions from 2007 to 2018. Fix had been charged with assault and battery and aggravated assault in 2012, but the victim dropped the charges in 2013. \c\cEric Molitor had posted support of the boogaloo movement on his Facebook profile. He also spoke positively about Kyle Rittenhouse and the St. Louis gun-toting controversy, along with anti-government sentiment. He had worked for a company that provides respiratory and ballistic protection to the military and first responders. In January 2020, he gave the Wexford County Commission a proposal to make it a Second Amendment sanctuary county, which passed unanimously the next month. \c\cMichael and William Null, twin brothers, allegedly helped conduct surveillance on Whitmer's vacation home. They were also former members of another militia group called Michigan Liberty Militia. They were photographed at a protest held by Michigan United for Liberty, a right-wing group protesting against Whitmer's COVID-19 lockdown orders, at the Michigan State Capitol on April 30. William also attended another anti-lockdown rally in May, as well as Black Lives Matter rallies in Grand Rapids and Flint, according to Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf, though Leaf also said William vented about the movement. William was also photographed at a February 2017 protest against President Trump's Executive Order 13769, held by the Equality Caucus of Genesee County in Flint. He and members of the Michigan Liberty Militia were counter-protesting while wearing military fatigues, carrying firearms, and waving a Gadsden flag. William also allegedly made threats against the protesters on Facebook. \c\cPaul Bellar, who was arrested in Columbia, South Carolina, where he had moved from Milford over the summer after an eviction, was allegedly responsible for designing the tactical training exercises used by the Wolverine Watchmen, which included the use of firearms, medical treatment, and other tasks. Bellar's former neighbor in Milford said the pandemic caused Bellar to lose his job and called him a "very angry person" and said he threatened her with a gun after a run-in with him. According to Bellar's father, he trained for the U.S. Army at Fort Jackson for a year before being discharged in 2019 with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. \c\cBrian Higgins was a resident of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, when he was arrested on October 15. He is alleged to have provided his night-vision goggles and dashcam to help conduct surveillance on Whitmer's home. \c\cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that they became aware of group chats on social media in early 2020 threatening to conduct the violent overthrow of state governments and law enforcement. During the initial investigation of social media chats, the FBI said that they encountered Barry Croft and Adam Fox. In March 2020, local officers from an unidentified police department in Michigan reported to the FBI that the militia was seeking addresses of officers. The FBI then interviewed a militia member, who agreed to become a confidential source after they raised concerns that there were plans to kill police officers. On May 8, the FBI obtained a federal search warrant to review Croft's Facebook account. Agents found messages "plotting potential acts of violence", including a May 3 post referencing a male individual who "may be first" and was wanted "in custody"; the FBI claims this individual was South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. \c\cThe FBI subsequently began infiltrating the group online and in person with informants in June, according to a criminal complaint. Starting at that point, the FBI began compiling photographs, video footage, telephone calls, and encrypted messages made by the suspects and storing them as evidence on a USB flash drive. The content, said to consist of "hundreds of hours of undercover audio recordings and more than 13,000 pages of encrypted text messages", was released by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan on October 16. On March 30, Pete Musico, a co-founder of the Wolverine Watchmen, allegedly made a comment about placing Whitmer under citizen's arrest and numerous other statements on tape that prosecutors later said had indicated "a violent intent". \c\cIntentions by the group to obtain Whitmer's address reportedly went as far back as April 19, according to court records. On April 30, all members of the group attended an armed protest at the Michigan State Capitol, which prosecutors said was the beginning of opportunities to conduct surveillance. The plot was reportedly hatched in an official capacity on June 6, among a group of about a dozen individuals meeting in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb located northwest of Columbus. A confidential source at the meeting reported that the group primarily sought to establish a new, self-reliant society that adhered to the U.S. Bill of Rights. Participants reportedly discussed peaceful and violent actions of achieving this goal, with talks shifting to how state governments were allegedly violating the U.S. Constitution, how "tyrants" should be killed, and that those present should return home to recruit neighbors. \c\cAfter the Ohio meeting, Fox allegedly contacted the militia – already being investigated by the FBI – seeking assistance for the plot. On June 14, the militia held a field training exercise. That day, Fox contacted one confidential source in a recorded phone call, detailing the Ohio meeting, and he requested "200 men" to attack the State Capitol in order to take Whitmer and others as hostages and to hold a "trial" for the governor, accusing her of treason. During the call, Fox reportedly said to the source that the operation had to occur prior to the 2020 United States presidential election. \c\cDuring a Second Amendment event at the State Capitol on June 18, Fox was recorded by a confidential source attempting to recruit militia group leaders to unite in an effort to attack the State Capitol. Two days later on June 20, Fox invited individuals, including one confidential source, to where he was employed in Grand Rapids. According to the source, Fox collected cellphones to prevent recordings and led participants through a trapdoor from the main floor, though the source wore a concealed recording device unknown to those gathered. Audio from the meeting provided to the FBI contained discussions of an assault on the Capitol, how to counterattack first responders, and the use of Molotov cocktails to destroy law enforcement vehicles. It was concluded that the group would meet on the first weekend of July, where they would discuss plans and perform training exercises. \c\cIn a June 25 Facebook video captured by the FBI, Fox held a livestream criticizing the justice system, the Government of Michigan and the state's order closing gyms, calling Whitmer a "tyrant bitch" and stating to viewers, "I don\'t know, boys, we gotta do something. You guys link with me on our other location system, give me some ideas of what we can do". \c\cThe FBI alleges that training first occurred on June 28 in Munith, Michigan at a militia member's property, with Fox, his girlfriend, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Caserta, and a confidential source participating in the exercises. Participants were reportedly told to leave if they felt uncomfortable with attacking the government and participating in kidnapping. According to Musico's defense attorney, Fox started making comments about storming the State Capitol during this training session, but there was no agreement from the other members, and Musico expressed concern about the plan's tactical viability, saying, "It's a fishbowl." Court documents released on November 13 alleged that in addition to storming the State Capitol, there were plans of executing hostages and televising them over the course of a week, or locking people inside the building, while the Legislature was in session, and setting it on fire with the intention of leaving no survivors. \c\cAccording to Musico's attorney, from that day to October 1, there was no activity from the Wolverine Watchmen due to a fight between Fox and Musico and Musico's eventual departure from the group. However, the FBI's confidential source for the investigation said that participants met for weapons exercises in Cambria, Wisconsin, between July 10 and 12, with Croft, Garbin, and a militia member attempting to make an improvised explosive device (IED) on July 11, though the device was defective. Franks also brought a rifle equipped with a silencer, firing it at the time. \c\cAt a second meeting in Ohio held on July 18, audio collected by a confidential source revealed discussions of attacking a Michigan State Police station, though Garbin rejected plans of an assault on the Capitol building, instead suggesting to attack Whitmer's family vacation home on Birch Lake in Elk Rapids. In a July 14 call recorded by a source, Fox said he researched the governor's office, concluding that Whitmer would not be present there and was heard saying, "In all honesty right now ... I just wanna make the world glow, dude. I\'m not even fuckin\' kidding. I just wanna make it all glow dude. I don\'t fuckin\' care anymore, I\'m just so sick of it. That's what it's gonna take for us to take it back, we\'re just gonna have to everything's gonna have to be annihilated, man. We\'re gonna topple it all, dude. It's what great frickin\' conquerors, man, we\'re just gonna conquer every fuckin\' thing man." In a July 26 call with a confidential source, Fox said "Maybe we should just make a bunch of cupcakes and send them out", with the source interpreting this as Fox seeking to initiate a "widespread bombing campaign", according to the FBI. \c\cFox invited participants to his Grand Rapids location on July 27, where a confidential source provided recordings of discussions that shifted to kidnapping Whitmer when she was arriving at, or leaving, either her personal vacation home or the Michigan Governor's Summer Residence on Mackinac Island. According to the FBI, in sourced audio, Fox could be heard saying, "Snatch and grab, man. Grab the fuckin\' Governor. Just grab the bitch. Because at that point, we do that, dude -- it's over." Fox was also heard in the recording suggesting that the group hire a realtor to find Whitmer's exact residence, collecting information on the surrounding area and recruiting individuals skilled with information technology and demolitions. \c\cParticipants met in Munith a second time for training on August 9, and afterwards, they communicated via group calls and chats monitored by a confidential source. In these communications, Fox suggested researching the governor's residence in Lansing and destroying Whitmer's boat. Harris said in a chat, "Have one person go to her house. Knock on the door and when she answers it just cap her ... at this point. Fuck it. ... I mean ... fuck, catch her walking into the building and act like a passers-by and fixing  [sic] dome her then yourself." During further chats on August 18, participants concentrated on finding the Whitmer family's vacation home and planned on how to escape the area by boat. \c\cOn August 23, participants met at Harris\' home in Lake Orion, where a secret recording was captured of the group discussing surveillance of the vacation home and Franks shared that he spent nearly $4,000 on night vision goggles and a helmet. A source captured audio of an August 29 surveillance operation, where Fox drove by the Whitmer family's vacation home, took photographs, and discussed response times of police in the area, with Fox allegedly heard saying, "We ain\'t gonna let \'em burn our fuckin\' state down. I don\'t give a fuck if there's only 20 or 30 of us, dude, we\'ll go out there and use deadly force." The next day on August 30, the FBI said screen captures of the group chat showed Garbin suggesting the demolition of a bridge near the vacation home to slow and distract police. \c\cDue to recommendation of the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, the construction of a $1.1 million barrier and electric fence at the Michigan Governor's Mansion in Lansing was announced on September 4 after weeks of construction, with spokeswoman Tiffany Brown saying "perimeter security and other safety upgrades" were being performed. Regarding the security upgrades, The Detroit News wrote "Whitmer, a Democrat who was first elected in 2018, has been the subject of menacing messages at Capitol demonstrations against her past COVID-19 stay-at-home orders", with the newspaper also citing other threats against Whitmer. \c\cWhile driving in three vehicles–with an undercover FBI agent and confidential source present–from a group camp in Luther towards the vacation home on September 12 and early September 13, Croft allegedly suggested that the group attempt to kidnap Whitmer that night, though the idea was dismissed. According to the FBI, Croft and Fox, who were in the first vehicle, planned on detonating a bomb on a bridge of U.S. Route 31 in Elk Rapids, photographing the underside of the bridge, and deciding where to place explosives. The group in the first vehicle then drove to a boat launch across the lake from the vacation home, waiting for a second vehicle to conduct surveillance on the location. The third vehicle, which was also occupied by an undercover agent, was tasked with monitoring for any followers or suspicious activity in the area. On the way back to Garbin's property, the group discussed abandoning the kidnapping plan and instead destroying the vacation home entirely. \c\cAt a discussion recorded at Garbin's property on September 13, Fox said the plan would strictly be a kidnapping. An undercover agent told Fox that explosives for destroying the bridge leading to the lake would cost about $4,000. The group decided that a final training exercise would be conducted later in October, though Fox pushed for an earlier date the following day. On October 2, Fox told a confidential source that he purchased an 800,000-volt taser to be used for the kidnapping. That same month, he reportedly contacted Musico, who advocated for a nonviolent approach. Fox, Garbin, Harris, and Franks planned to meet with an undercover FBI agent to purchase explosives on October 7, though Caserta did not attend due to work obligations, while Croft returned to Delaware prior to the meeting. \c\cAll of the members involved were arrested on the night of October 7, and charges were filed against them the next day. Search warrants and arrests were executed all across Michigan. The arrests were reportedly part of a planned effort between federal and state authorities, launched after evidence was discovered indicating the suspects wanted to kidnap Whitmer before the 2020 election. At least seven FBI field offices, along with the operational divisions at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., were reportedly involved in coordinating the arrests. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. Several weapons and other items were seized, including at least 1,916 rounds of pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition; hundreds of firearms; extended magazines; various silencers; speedloaders; and bomb-making equipment. \c\cSix people (Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta) were charged in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan for conspiring to commit kidnapping. The federal charges carry an automatic sentence of life imprisonment if convictions are obtained. A federal judge said the federal government had probable cause in the cases against five of the defendants and declared they could move forward to trial, while also denying bond to four of them. \c\cDuring a court hearing on October 13, an FBI agent testified that the conspirators had considered leaving Whitmer in a boat in the middle of Lake Michigan and disabling its motor. He also testified that the group had discussed, during early stages of the planning, kidnapping Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also imposed strict lockdown orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted the FBI to notify members of Northam's security staff about the potential threat. \c\cOn October 26, federal prosecutors announced the FBI had found "explosive device components" and ghost guns and are considering adding federal terrorism charges after they are analyzed by experts. On October 28, an unsealed search warrant revealed that some of the defendants had discussed South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster as another possible target during the early stages of planning in March. The warrant also revealed that, in late June, Croft had posted on Facebook a hit-list of politicians that he said he wanted to hang. The list included the names of McMaster, President Trump, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton, New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, other Democratic and Republican elected officials, liberals, Muslims, and "all anti-Americans". \c\cOn October 30, Franks's attorney requested a judge to reconsider her decision to keep him imprisoned, saying he is diabetic and fears contracting COVID-19 in jail. \c\cOn December 16, all six federal defendants were indicted by a grand jury. \c\cOn January 1, 2021, Croft, who remains jailed in a Philadelphia federal prison, asked to be released while he awaited his court hearings, due to the constant delays in a prisoner transfer and the subsequently slow progress of the case against him. Federal prosecutors argued against releasing him, describing Croft as a "violent extremist" and saying such a decision would be "unreasonable". \c\cOn January 15, 2021, a judge ordered all six defendants to stand trial on March 23. The trial date was later postponed to October 12. \c\cOn January 27, 2021, Garbin pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit kidnapping. His sentencing is scheduled for July 8. As part of a plea bargain, he agreed to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for no additional charges being filed against him by prosecutors. \c\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged seven other men (Pete Musico, Joseph Morrison, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar) with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership. Two of the defendants were each set a bond of $10 million, with preliminary examinations scheduled for October 21. Musico's bond was later reduced to $100,000 after his attorney convinced the judge his role in the plot was overstated. \c\cOn October 20, Bellar was charged with state crimes and was extradited from his home state of South Carolina for a formal trial. \c\cOn November 10, Fix was released on a $250,000 bond. Three days later, bond was reduced for Morrison, Musico, and Bellar. Bellar was released on a $75,000 bond on November 13. \c\cOn October 15, Brian Higgins from Wisconsin was charged by Nessel with material support of an act of terrorism, which carries a 20-year sentence. On October 19, Higgins was released on bail, with one of the imposed restrictions being that he not try to make contact with the other 13 defendants. On November 18, his attorney announced his client's plans to challenge his extradition from Wisconsin to Michigan. The basis of the challenge was that the extradition paperwork was signed by Whitmer, the target of the alleged plot, thus creating a conflict of interest. On December 15, a judge in Columbia County, Wisconsin ruled there was enough probable cause for the transfer to occur. His extradition was delayed after his attorney filed an appeal on the ruling. \c\cOn December 4, twin brothers Michael and William Null were released on bond. \c\cOn December 18, a Jackson County judge denied a bond reduction request for Morrison, saying he could still pose a threat to the public. \c\cOn January 14, 2021, Molitor was released on bond. \c\cOn March 29, 2021, Morrison, Musico, and Bellar were bound over for trial after a three-day-long preliminary hearing. At the same hearing, threat of terrorism charges were dismissed against Morrison and Musico; Bellar did not face that charge. \c\cOn April 14, 2021, a judge lifted Michael and William Null's curfew and house arrest restrictions, but they were still required to wear GPS tethers. \c\cWhitmer spoke out during a livestream held after the thwarted plot was revealed by the FBI. She thanked the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, called the plotters "sick and depraved men", and cast blame on President Trump for refusing to explicitly condemn far-right groups and for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer later urged in a tweet that the suspects be called domestic terrorists and not members of any militia organization. In an October 11 interview with Face the Nation, she said security threats against her still existed and that extremists like the Wolverine Watchmen are "finding comfort and support in the rhetoric coming out of Republican leadership from the White House to our state House." Whitmer wrote about the plot in an opinion piece in The Atlantic on October 27, where she continued to blame Trump's rhetoric for causing divisiveness in the country. \c\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the plot "one of the largest cases in recent history" and labeled the case as "rather unprecedented" in nature. State Senator Mike Shirkey, Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also condemned the plot. Chatfield later criticized Whitmer for not warning state lawmakers in advance about the plotters\' original intent to storm the Michigan State Capitol building. Delaware Governor John Carney, who pardoned one of the suspects in 2019, called the federal charges "disturbing" and said, "This is also another warning sign about the growing threat of violence and radicalization in our politics." Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also been discussed by the alleged plotters as a potential target, declined to comment about the details of the plot but said he and his family felt safe with the protection of the Virginia State Police. \c\cIn an October 8 interview, President Trump criticized Whitmer for her rebuke of him in response to the kidnapping plot, saying he condemned all forms of "extreme violence" and calling for her to reopen her state. During that interview, Trump falsely claimed that Michigan's schools and churches were closed under Whitmer's orders. In response to Trump's remarks, Whitmer said it "tells you everything you need to know" about the difference between him and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Biden also reacted to Trump's remarks on October 16, saying the "failure to condemn these folks is stunning."\c\cTrump continued to attack Whitmer for her COVID-19 mitigation measures at a rally in Muskegon on October 17, which was matched with chants of "Lock her up!", to which he replied, "Lock \'em all up." Trump's daughter-in-law Lara, a campaign surrogate, later insisted he was merely "having fun" at the rally. In a subsequent interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Whitmer called Trump's rhetoric "incredibly disturbing" and said it is "inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism". She also countered Trump's claims at the rally that she should relax the statewide COVID-19 restrictions, saying Michigan hasn\'t had a stay-at-home order since spring. At an October 27 rally in Lansing, Trump downplayed the alleged plot and continued the verbal attacks on Whitmer, which were also met with chants of "Lock her up!". \c\cSince the kidnapping plot at one point involved an intended attack on police, state law enforcement agencies were put on high alert in response. \c\cDar Leaf, the elected sheriff of Barry County, Michigan, appeared to defend two of the suspects in an October 8 interview, saying that "a lot of people are angry with the governor, and they want her arrested. So are they trying to arrest or was it a kidnap attempt? Because you can still in Michigan if it's a felony, make a felony arrest." Citing the state's citizen's arrest statute, he continued, "It doesn\'t say if you are an elected office that you\'re exempt from that arrest. I have to look at it from that angle and I\'m hoping that's more what it is, in fact, these guys are innocent till proven guilty so I\'m not even sure if they had any part of it."\c\cThe interview went viral on the internet, along with the revelation that Leaf had shared the stage with one of the suspects at a May 18 anti-lockdown protest. Attorney General Nessel condemned the remarks as "dangerous", while a number of other Michigan sheriffs expressed their outrage as well. Law experts disagreed with the notion that the Wolverine Watchmen were simply planning to conduct a legal citizen's arrest on Whitmer, saying it was far-fetched. Leaf later clarified his comments, claiming he simply wanted a fair trial for the accused and did not agree with their alleged actions, which he called "horrible". His earlier comments and his ties with one of the suspects during the anti-lockdown protest have spurred calls for him to resign. On October 13, Leaf acknowledged the criticism but said he will not resign. \c\cDemocrats in the Michigan Legislature renewed calls for a ban on guns in the State Capitol building in response to news of the plot, following an unsuccessful September proposal drafted in response to armed anti-lockdown protesters storming the building in April. \c\cOn December 14, the day that Michigan's electors to the Electoral College were set to meet at the capital, authorities closed the Michigan State Capitol to the public and shuttered state legislators\' offices in the wake of the alleged plot, following "credible threats of violence". The building was left open only to those needed for the Electoral College. Earlier that day, State Representative Gary Eisen claimed there would be a "Hail Mary" effort regarding a plan to prevent electors from casting a vote. When asked if he can assure the public that it will be a safe day in Lansing, and that nobody would get hurt, Eisen replied, "No. I don\'t know. Because what we\'re doing today is uncharted." Shortly after the interview, Chatfield and Speaker-Elect Jason Wentworth released a statement disavowing any threat of violence or intimidation and announcing Eisen would be removed from his committee assignments for the rest of the term. \c\cOn January 11, 2021, Michigan banned the open carry of firearms on the State Capitol, citing the alleged plot and the storming of the United States Capitol. The ban was supported by both Democratic and Republican state lawmakers. On January 15, 2021, the Michigan National Guard was requested, and heavy fencing was put up around the State Capitol, in preparation for an armed protest two days later, on January 17. \c\cA spokesperson for Facebook, which had been used by the suspects in plotting Whitmer's kidnapping, said the company would be cooperating with the FBI's investigation. \c\cA scheduled October 13 campaign stop by Eric Trump at a Lyon Township gun store was moved to a banquet center in Novi after it was discovered one of the suspects had worked there for three weeks before being fired. \c\cThe Wolverine Watchmen group was reportedly an offshoot of the Michigan Militia. The day after the suspects were arrested, the Michigan Militia issued a statement disavowing the group. Other Michigan-based militia groups also distanced themselves from the plotters\' actions and intentions. The Michigan Home Guard, a militia that one of the suspects had once been a member of before being kicked out earlier this year, released a statement condemning the Wolverine Watchmen's actions. \c\cConspiracy theories about the alleged plot emerged on social media, falsely claiming the Wolverine Watchmen were anarchists affiliated with the antifa and Black Lives Matter movements. Some social media posts promoting the theories were flagged by Facebook as part of its anti-misinformation campaign, while PolitiFact rated the posts as "Mostly False".
On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the arrests of 13 men suspected of orchestrating a domestic terror plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Governor of Michigan, and otherwise violently overthrow the state government. The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. \c\cPreceding the 2020 United States elections, law enforcement officials, members of Congress, and groups tracking extremism in the country have warned about the increasing threat potential from militia and far-right groups. The Anti-Defamation League identified Michigan as a state where the modern militia movement found its roots and where a number of militia groups remain active. However, Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the Wolverine Watchmen group, which the suspects were members of, "flew under the radar", adding, "This is simply not a big group that we\'d ever heard of."\c\cThe alleged plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer developed from June through September. Within the week preceding the Wolverine Watchmen arrests, there were at least three other state and federal arrest operations linked to the Boogaloo movement, of which the Wolverine Watchmen group's ideology adhered to. \c\cWhitmer, the main target of the plot, had seen her political profile elevated over the preceding months due to her early response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan, in which she enacted strict mitigation measures such as a lockdown of the state, which she was widely praised for. However, she also became a target of criticism from far-right groups, and her measures triggered protests in April and May, including one in which armed protesters stormed the Michigan State Capitol. President Donald Trump had offered his support for the protests, derisively calling Whitmer "that woman from Michigan" and tweeting on April 17: "LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"\c\cUltimately, on October 2, 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court made two rulings in response to the measures: a 4–3 ruling that declared a 1945 law allowing Whitmer to enact the measures was unconstitutional, and a unanimous ruling that declared a 1976 act did not give Whitmer the power to enact the measures without legislative approval. This put uncertainty over enforcement of the measures and forced the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services – and later, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration – to circumvent it by ordering similar measures, even after the alleged plot was made public. \c\cThe suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen. The group was co-founded by suspects Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison; the latter is considered the group's "commander". An NBC News investigation into the suspects\' social media profiles found links between their ideologies and those of the broader boogaloo movement. The Wolverine Watchmen group had been recruiting members on Facebook from November 2019 until June 2020, when Facebook began purging all boogaloo-related material. \c\cThe suspects named in the federal indictment, charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, were Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta. Five of the men were Michigan residents, while the sixth, Croft, was from Delaware. Adam Fox and Barry Croft were accused of being the ringleaders of the plot. The suspects charged with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership, were Wolverine Watchmen founders Musico and Morrison, along with Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar. At least four of the 13 suspects had attended prior rallies at the Michigan State Capitol. On October 15, a fourteenth suspect, Brian Higgins of Wisconsin, was charged at the state level with material support of an act of terrorism. Garbin pleaded guilty on January 27, 2021 and agreed to testify against his five alleged co-conspirators. \c\cJoseph M. Morrison is considered the leader of the Wolverine Watchmen. His home in Munith, which he shared with Musico, was allegedly used as a training site, according to Michigan Assistant Attorney General Gregory Townsend. Photographs of the home show a Confederate battle flag and a variation of the U.S. flag with alternating, vertical red and white stripes and a circle of stars surrounding the words "Liberty or Death". Morrison's neighbors told The Daily Beast that the home's residents were "disrespectful" and said large groups regularly gathered there on weekends, whereupon gunfire would be heard. His online alias was "Boogaloo Bunyan". Morrison had served in the U.S. Marine Corps since 2015, most recently with the 4th Marine Logistics Group in Battle Creek, Michigan, with the rank of lance corporal; he was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve on October 8, the same day as his arrest, for reasons unrelated to the criminal charges. \c\cAdam Fox, the alleged mastermind of the plot, was born Adam Waggoner but changed his last name to his mother's maiden name in 2014. He had been living in the basement of his former employer, a vacuum repair shop in Grand Rapids. Fox received permission for that living arrangement from the shop's owner who felt empathy towards Fox, as Fox was homeless and had dogs. The basement was allegedly used to hold one of the group's meetings. Fox posted a YouTube video in June, mentioning Whitmer's handling of the pandemic as one of his motives for the plot. According to his employer, Fox espoused anti-police and anti-government views, along with support for the boogaloo movement, and had recently become worried about the U.S. becoming a communist country and Democratic politicians taking away his guns. Fox had previously been a member of another militia group called the Michigan Home Guard, but he was kicked out due to "rage issues" and threatening other members on social media. \c\cTy Garbin was raised in Wyandotte but had been living in a manufactured home park in eastern Livingston County at the time of his arrest. His father is an Army veteran. Garbin was a licensed aircraft mechanic and had previously worked for SkyWest Airlines. He met Fox at a Second Amendment rally in Lansing. Garbin allegedly cased the governor's vacation home at night, texted about blowing up a bridge to slow police down, offered to paint his boat for "night fishing" as part of the kidnapping mission on the lake, and had the ability to manufacture guns. His lawyer mentioned he had no criminal record. \c\cBarry Croft regularly posted violent messages on his social media accounts. These accounts depicted him wearing a tricorne and a sweatshirt with an insignia associated with the Three Percenters militia group; he was later identified as the second-in-command of its Wisconsin branch. The FBI identified him as a national leader of the organization in January 2021. He expressed support for the Russia investigation origins counter-narrative and opposition to the country's current immigration policy, and he believed the investigations into President Trump constituted an "uprising". However, he also included Trump's name in a grievance-filled hit-list of politicians that he wanted to hang, which he posted on Facebook in late June. He was living in Bear, Delaware, at the time of his arrest. Croft was arrested multiple times from 1994 to 1996 for assault and burglary. He was convicted in 1997 for possessing a gun in the commission of a felony and spent three years in prison. In April 2019, Croft was pardoned for the conviction, as well as the prior assault and burglary charges, by Delaware Governor John Carney. According to recordings of the alleged plotters, Croft claimed he had been granted permission from God to commit murder. \c\cKaleb Franks had allegedly spent $4,000 on equipment during the planning, including a helmet and night-vision goggles. He also allegedly brought a rifle with a silencer to one of the training exercises. According to his LinkedIn profile, he studied clinical psychology at Washtenaw Community College and was employed as a peer recovery coach at an addiction treatment center in Waterford. He had previously battled an addiction to heroin but has been sober since 2013, according to his lawyer. He was convicted in 2011 for cocaine possession and in 2013 for second-degree home invasion. He served nine months in jail and two years under the jurisdiction of drug courts. \c\cDaniel Harris served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a rifleman from 2014 to June 2019, most recently at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Harris had been deployed to Japan and had reached the rank of corporal. He was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He worked as a security guard at two different companies after being discharged. In June, he attended a Black Lives Matter rally in his hometown of Lake Orion and was interviewed by a local newspaper, where he said he was "upset about the killing of George Floyd and police violence." The group allegedly met at his home on August 23 to discuss the plot. \c\cBrandon Caserta was depicted wearing a Hawaiian-style shirt associated with the boogaloo movement in a TikTok video; and on Facebook, he praised Kyle Rittenhouse, a civilian who shot three protesters, killing two, during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August. Caserta was also a COVID-19 denier and supported the QAnon conspiracy theory; however, in one video, he criticized President Trump and called him a tyrant. His belief system apparently became more extreme following Whitmer's implementation of the statewide lockdown. His social media activity originally consisted of posts about comedy shows and podcasts, motivational quotes, and selfies; but following the lockdown, he began "liking" posts about conspiracy theories regarding Bill Gates, as well as memes about hogtying police officers. \c\cPete Musico was active on YouTube, where he posted video blogs against taxes, gun control, and the so-called deep state. A video posted in 2019, entitled "Gretchen Whitmer Interview", depicted him railing against her policies around automobile ownership and promised he would interview Whitmer in person in a later video. Musico was also active on Gab, where he promoted the unfounded claim that there is an ongoing campaign to kill white people in South Africa. He also followed the accounts of Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs and InfoWars personality Owen Shroyer. On Twitter, he expressed support for Trump and conspiracy theories regarding Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the high presence of mercury in vaccines. Musico's attorney said he was eventually kicked out of the Wolverine Watchmen because he was too "soft" and wouldn\'t commit to violence. \c\cShawn Fix had allegedly hosted Wolverine Watchmen meetings at his home in Belleville to discuss the plot. The house's yard had Donald Trump presidential campaign signs and a Gadsden flag. He was working as a truck driver and had more than a dozen driving infractions from 2007 to 2018. Fix had been charged with assault and battery and aggravated assault in 2012, but the victim dropped the charges in 2013. \c\cEric Molitor had posted support of the boogaloo movement on his Facebook profile. He also spoke positively about Kyle Rittenhouse and the St. Louis gun-toting controversy, along with anti-government sentiment. He had worked for a company that provides respiratory and ballistic protection to the military and first responders. In January 2020, he gave the Wexford County Commission a proposal to make it a Second Amendment sanctuary county, which passed unanimously the next month. \c\cMichael and William Null, twin brothers, allegedly helped conduct surveillance on Whitmer's vacation home. They were also former members of another militia group called Michigan Liberty Militia. They were photographed at a protest held by Michigan United for Liberty, a right-wing group protesting against Whitmer's COVID-19 lockdown orders, at the Michigan State Capitol on April 30. William also attended another anti-lockdown rally in May, as well as Black Lives Matter rallies in Grand Rapids and Flint, according to Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf, though Leaf also said William vented about the movement. William was also photographed at a February 2017 protest against President Trump's Executive Order 13769, held by the Equality Caucus of Genesee County in Flint. He and members of the Michigan Liberty Militia were counter-protesting while wearing military fatigues, carrying firearms, and waving a Gadsden flag. William also allegedly made threats against the protesters on Facebook. \c\cPaul Bellar, who was arrested in Columbia, South Carolina, where he had moved from Milford over the summer after an eviction, was allegedly responsible for designing the tactical training exercises used by the Wolverine Watchmen, which included the use of firearms, medical treatment, and other tasks. Bellar's former neighbor in Milford said the pandemic caused Bellar to lose his job and called him a "very angry person" and said he threatened her with a gun after a run-in with him. According to Bellar's father, he trained for the U.S. Army at Fort Jackson for a year before being discharged in 2019 with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. \c\cBrian Higgins was a resident of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, when he was arrested on October 15. He is alleged to have provided his night-vision goggles and dashcam to help conduct surveillance on Whitmer's home. \c\cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that they became aware of group chats on social media in early 2020 threatening to conduct the violent overthrow of state governments and law enforcement. During the initial investigation of social media chats, the FBI said that they encountered Barry Croft and Adam Fox. In March 2020, local officers from an unidentified police department in Michigan reported to the FBI that the militia was seeking addresses of officers. The FBI then interviewed a militia member, who agreed to become a confidential source after they raised concerns that there were plans to kill police officers. On May 8, the FBI obtained a federal search warrant to review Croft's Facebook account. Agents found messages "plotting potential acts of violence", including a May 3 post referencing a male individual who "may be first" and was wanted "in custody"; the FBI claims this individual was South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. \c\cThe FBI subsequently began infiltrating the group online and in person with informants in June, according to a criminal complaint. Starting at that point, the FBI began compiling photographs, video footage, telephone calls, and encrypted messages made by the suspects and storing them as evidence on a USB flash drive. The content, said to consist of "hundreds of hours of undercover audio recordings and more than 13,000 pages of encrypted text messages", was released by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan on October 16. On March 30, Pete Musico, a co-founder of the Wolverine Watchmen, allegedly made a comment about placing Whitmer under citizen's arrest and numerous other statements on tape that prosecutors later said had indicated "a violent intent". \c\cIntentions by the group to obtain Whitmer's address reportedly went as far back as April 19, according to court records. On April 30, all members of the group attended an armed protest at the Michigan State Capitol, which prosecutors said was the beginning of opportunities to conduct surveillance. The plot was reportedly hatched in an official capacity on June 6, among a group of about a dozen individuals meeting in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb located northwest of Columbus. A confidential source at the meeting reported that the group primarily sought to establish a new, self-reliant society that adhered to the U.S. Bill of Rights. Participants reportedly discussed peaceful and violent actions of achieving this goal, with talks shifting to how state governments were allegedly violating the U.S. Constitution, how "tyrants" should be killed, and that those present should return home to recruit neighbors. \c\cAfter the Ohio meeting, Fox allegedly contacted the militia – already being investigated by the FBI – seeking assistance for the plot. On June 14, the militia held a field training exercise. That day, Fox contacted one confidential source in a recorded phone call, detailing the Ohio meeting, and he requested "200 men" to attack the State Capitol in order to take Whitmer and others as hostages and to hold a "trial" for the governor, accusing her of treason. During the call, Fox reportedly said to the source that the operation had to occur prior to the 2020 United States presidential election. \c\cDuring a Second Amendment event at the State Capitol on June 18, Fox was recorded by a confidential source attempting to recruit militia group leaders to unite in an effort to attack the State Capitol. Two days later on June 20, Fox invited individuals, including one confidential source, to where he was employed in Grand Rapids. According to the source, Fox collected cellphones to prevent recordings and led participants through a trapdoor from the main floor, though the source wore a concealed recording device unknown to those gathered. Audio from the meeting provided to the FBI contained discussions of an assault on the Capitol, how to counterattack first responders, and the use of Molotov cocktails to destroy law enforcement vehicles. It was concluded that the group would meet on the first weekend of July, where they would discuss plans and perform training exercises. \c\cIn a June 25 Facebook video captured by the FBI, Fox held a livestream criticizing the justice system, the Government of Michigan and the state's order closing gyms, calling Whitmer a "tyrant bitch" and stating to viewers, "I don\'t know, boys, we gotta do something. You guys link with me on our other location system, give me some ideas of what we can do". \c\cThe FBI alleges that training first occurred on June 28 in Munith, Michigan at a militia member's property, with Fox, his girlfriend, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Caserta, and a confidential source participating in the exercises. Participants were reportedly told to leave if they felt uncomfortable with attacking the government and participating in kidnapping. According to Musico's defense attorney, Fox started making comments about storming the State Capitol during this training session, but there was no agreement from the other members, and Musico expressed concern about the plan's tactical viability, saying, "It's a fishbowl." Court documents released on November 13 alleged that in addition to storming the State Capitol, there were plans of executing hostages and televising them over the course of a week, or locking people inside the building, while the Legislature was in session, and setting it on fire with the intention of leaving no survivors. \c\cAccording to Musico's attorney, from that day to October 1, there was no activity from the Wolverine Watchmen due to a fight between Fox and Musico and Musico's eventual departure from the group. However, the FBI's confidential source for the investigation said that participants met for weapons exercises in Cambria, Wisconsin, between July 10 and 12, with Croft, Garbin, and a militia member attempting to make an improvised explosive device (IED) on July 11, though the device was defective. Franks also brought a rifle equipped with a silencer, firing it at the time. \c\cAt a second meeting in Ohio held on July 18, audio collected by a confidential source revealed discussions of attacking a Michigan State Police station, though Garbin rejected plans of an assault on the Capitol building, instead suggesting to attack Whitmer's family vacation home on Birch Lake in Elk Rapids. In a July 14 call recorded by a source, Fox said he researched the governor's office, concluding that Whitmer would not be present there and was heard saying, "In all honesty right now ... I just wanna make the world glow, dude. I\'m not even fuckin\' kidding. I just wanna make it all glow dude. I don\'t fuckin\' care anymore, I\'m just so sick of it. That's what it's gonna take for us to take it back, we\'re just gonna have to everything's gonna have to be annihilated, man. We\'re gonna topple it all, dude. It's what great frickin\' conquerors, man, we\'re just gonna conquer every fuckin\' thing man." In a July 26 call with a confidential source, Fox said "Maybe we should just make a bunch of cupcakes and send them out", with the source interpreting this as Fox seeking to initiate a "widespread bombing campaign", according to the FBI. \c\cFox invited participants to his Grand Rapids location on July 27, where a confidential source provided recordings of discussions that shifted to kidnapping Whitmer when she was arriving at, or leaving, either her personal vacation home or the Michigan Governor's Summer Residence on Mackinac Island. According to the FBI, in sourced audio, Fox could be heard saying, "Snatch and grab, man. Grab the fuckin\' Governor. Just grab the bitch. Because at that point, we do that, dude -- it's over." Fox was also heard in the recording suggesting that the group hire a realtor to find Whitmer's exact residence, collecting information on the surrounding area and recruiting individuals skilled with information technology and demolitions. \c\cParticipants met in Munith a second time for training on August 9, and afterwards, they communicated via group calls and chats monitored by a confidential source. In these communications, Fox suggested researching the governor's residence in Lansing and destroying Whitmer's boat. Harris said in a chat, "Have one person go to her house. Knock on the door and when she answers it just cap her ... at this point. Fuck it. ... I mean ... fuck, catch her walking into the building and act like a passers-by and fixing  [sic] dome her then yourself." During further chats on August 18, participants concentrated on finding the Whitmer family's vacation home and planned on how to escape the area by boat. \c\cOn August 23, participants met at Harris\' home in Lake Orion, where a secret recording was captured of the group discussing surveillance of the vacation home and Franks shared that he spent nearly $4,000 on night vision goggles and a helmet. A source captured audio of an August 29 surveillance operation, where Fox drove by the Whitmer family's vacation home, took photographs, and discussed response times of police in the area, with Fox allegedly heard saying, "We ain\'t gonna let \'em burn our fuckin\' state down. I don\'t give a fuck if there's only 20 or 30 of us, dude, we\'ll go out there and use deadly force." The next day on August 30, the FBI said screen captures of the group chat showed Garbin suggesting the demolition of a bridge near the vacation home to slow and distract police. \c\cDue to recommendation of the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, the construction of a $1.1 million barrier and electric fence at the Michigan Governor's Mansion in Lansing was announced on September 4 after weeks of construction, with spokeswoman Tiffany Brown saying "perimeter security and other safety upgrades" were being performed. Regarding the security upgrades, The Detroit News wrote "Whitmer, a Democrat who was first elected in 2018, has been the subject of menacing messages at Capitol demonstrations against her past COVID-19 stay-at-home orders", with the newspaper also citing other threats against Whitmer. \c\cWhile driving in three vehicles–with an undercover FBI agent and confidential source present–from a group camp in Luther towards the vacation home on September 12 and early September 13, Croft allegedly suggested that the group attempt to kidnap Whitmer that night, though the idea was dismissed. According to the FBI, Croft and Fox, who were in the first vehicle, planned on detonating a bomb on a bridge of U.S. Route 31 in Elk Rapids, photographing the underside of the bridge, and deciding where to place explosives. The group in the first vehicle then drove to a boat launch across the lake from the vacation home, waiting for a second vehicle to conduct surveillance on the location. The third vehicle, which was also occupied by an undercover agent, was tasked with monitoring for any followers or suspicious activity in the area. On the way back to Garbin's property, the group discussed abandoning the kidnapping plan and instead destroying the vacation home entirely. \c\cAt a discussion recorded at Garbin's property on September 13, Fox said the plan would strictly be a kidnapping. An undercover agent told Fox that explosives for destroying the bridge leading to the lake would cost about $4,000. The group decided that a final training exercise would be conducted later in October, though Fox pushed for an earlier date the following day. On October 2, Fox told a confidential source that he purchased an 800,000-volt taser to be used for the kidnapping. That same month, he reportedly contacted Musico, who advocated for a nonviolent approach. Fox, Garbin, Harris, and Franks planned to meet with an undercover FBI agent to purchase explosives on October 7, though Caserta did not attend due to work obligations, while Croft returned to Delaware prior to the meeting. \c\cAll of the members involved were arrested on the night of October 7, and charges were filed against them the next day. Search warrants and arrests were executed all across Michigan. The arrests were reportedly part of a planned effort between federal and state authorities, launched after evidence was discovered indicating the suspects wanted to kidnap Whitmer before the 2020 election. At least seven FBI field offices, along with the operational divisions at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., were reportedly involved in coordinating the arrests. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. Several weapons and other items were seized, including at least 1,916 rounds of pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition; hundreds of firearms; extended magazines; various silencers; speedloaders; and bomb-making equipment. \c\cSix people (Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta) were charged in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan for conspiring to commit kidnapping. The federal charges carry an automatic sentence of life imprisonment if convictions are obtained. A federal judge said the federal government had probable cause in the cases against five of the defendants and declared they could move forward to trial, while also denying bond to four of them. \c\cDuring a court hearing on October 13, an FBI agent testified that the conspirators had considered leaving Whitmer in a boat in the middle of Lake Michigan and disabling its motor. He also testified that the group had discussed, during early stages of the planning, kidnapping Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also imposed strict lockdown orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted the FBI to notify members of Northam's security staff about the potential threat. \c\cOn October 26, federal prosecutors announced the FBI had found "explosive device components" and ghost guns and are considering adding federal terrorism charges after they are analyzed by experts. On October 28, an unsealed search warrant revealed that some of the defendants had discussed South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster as another possible target during the early stages of planning in March. The warrant also revealed that, in late June, Croft had posted on Facebook a hit-list of politicians that he said he wanted to hang. The list included the names of McMaster, President Trump, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton, New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, other Democratic and Republican elected officials, liberals, Muslims, and "all anti-Americans". \c\cOn October 30, Franks's attorney requested a judge to reconsider her decision to keep him imprisoned, saying he is diabetic and fears contracting COVID-19 in jail. \c\cOn December 16, all six federal defendants were indicted by a grand jury. \c\cOn January 1, 2021, Croft, who remains jailed in a Philadelphia federal prison, asked to be released while he awaited his court hearings, due to the constant delays in a prisoner transfer and the subsequently slow progress of the case against him. Federal prosecutors argued against releasing him, describing Croft as a "violent extremist" and saying such a decision would be "unreasonable". \c\cOn January 15, 2021, a judge ordered all six defendants to stand trial on March 23. The trial date was later postponed to October 12. \c\cOn January 27, 2021, Garbin pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit kidnapping. His sentencing is scheduled for July 8. As part of a plea bargain, he agreed to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for no additional charges being filed against him by prosecutors. \c\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged seven other men (Pete Musico, Joseph Morrison, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar) with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership. Two of the defendants were each set a bond of $10 million, with preliminary examinations scheduled for October 21. Musico's bond was later reduced to $100,000 after his attorney convinced the judge his role in the plot was overstated. \c\cOn October 20, Bellar was charged with state crimes and was extradited from his home state of South Carolina for a formal trial. \c\cOn November 10, Fix was released on a $250,000 bond. Three days later, bond was reduced for Morrison, Musico, and Bellar. Bellar was released on a $75,000 bond on November 13. \c\cOn October 15, Brian Higgins from Wisconsin was charged by Nessel with material support of an act of terrorism, which carries a 20-year sentence. On October 19, Higgins was released on bail, with one of the imposed restrictions being that he not try to make contact with the other 13 defendants. On November 18, his attorney announced his client's plans to challenge his extradition from Wisconsin to Michigan. The basis of the challenge was that the extradition paperwork was signed by Whitmer, the target of the alleged plot, thus creating a conflict of interest. On December 15, a judge in Columbia County, Wisconsin ruled there was enough probable cause for the transfer to occur. His extradition was delayed after his attorney filed an appeal on the ruling. \c\cOn December 4, twin brothers Michael and William Null were released on bond. \c\cOn December 18, a Jackson County judge denied a bond reduction request for Morrison, saying he could still pose a threat to the public. \c\cOn January 14, 2021, Molitor was released on bond. \c\cOn March 29, 2021, Morrison, Musico, and Bellar were bound over for trial after a three-day-long preliminary hearing. At the same hearing, threat of terrorism charges were dismissed against Morrison and Musico; Bellar did not face that charge. \c\cOn April 14, 2021, a judge lifted Michael and William Null's curfew and house arrest restrictions, but they were still required to wear GPS tethers. \c\cWhitmer spoke out during a livestream held after the thwarted plot was revealed by the FBI. She thanked the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, called the plotters "sick and depraved men", and cast blame on President Trump for refusing to explicitly condemn far-right groups and for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer later urged in a tweet that the suspects be called domestic terrorists and not members of any militia organization. In an October 11 interview with Face the Nation, she said security threats against her still existed and that extremists like the Wolverine Watchmen are "finding comfort and support in the rhetoric coming out of Republican leadership from the White House to our state House." Whitmer wrote about the plot in an opinion piece in The Atlantic on October 27, where she continued to blame Trump's rhetoric for causing divisiveness in the country. \c\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the plot "one of the largest cases in recent history" and labeled the case as "rather unprecedented" in nature. State Senator Mike Shirkey, Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also condemned the plot. Chatfield later criticized Whitmer for not warning state lawmakers in advance about the plotters\' original intent to storm the Michigan State Capitol building. Delaware Governor John Carney, who pardoned one of the suspects in 2019, called the federal charges "disturbing" and said, "This is also another warning sign about the growing threat of violence and radicalization in our politics." Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also been discussed by the alleged plotters as a potential target, declined to comment about the details of the plot but said he and his family felt safe with the protection of the Virginia State Police. \c\cIn an October 8 interview, President Trump criticized Whitmer for her rebuke of him in response to the kidnapping plot, saying he condemned all forms of "extreme violence" and calling for her to reopen her state. During that interview, Trump falsely claimed that Michigan's schools and churches were closed under Whitmer's orders. In response to Trump's remarks, Whitmer said it "tells you everything you need to know" about the difference between him and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Biden also reacted to Trump's remarks on October 16, saying the "failure to condemn these folks is stunning."\c\cTrump continued to attack Whitmer for her COVID-19 mitigation measures at a rally in Muskegon on October 17, which was matched with chants of "Lock her up!", to which he replied, "Lock \'em all up." Trump's daughter-in-law Lara, a campaign surrogate, later insisted he was merely "having fun" at the rally. In a subsequent interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Whitmer called Trump's rhetoric "incredibly disturbing" and said it is "inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism". She also countered Trump's claims at the rally that she should relax the statewide COVID-19 restrictions, saying Michigan hasn\'t had a stay-at-home order since spring. At an October 27 rally in Lansing, Trump downplayed the alleged plot and continued the verbal attacks on Whitmer, which were also met with chants of "Lock her up!". \c\cSince the kidnapping plot at one point involved an intended attack on police, state law enforcement agencies were put on high alert in response. \c\cDar Leaf, the elected sheriff of Barry County, Michigan, appeared to defend two of the suspects in an October 8 interview, saying that "a lot of people are angry with the governor, and they want her arrested. So are they trying to arrest or was it a kidnap attempt? Because you can still in Michigan if it's a felony, make a felony arrest." Citing the state's citizen's arrest statute, he continued, "It doesn\'t say if you are an elected office that you\'re exempt from that arrest. I have to look at it from that angle and I\'m hoping that's more what it is, in fact, these guys are innocent till proven guilty so I\'m not even sure if they had any part of it."\c\cThe interview went viral on the internet, along with the revelation that Leaf had shared the stage with one of the suspects at a May 18 anti-lockdown protest. Attorney General Nessel condemned the remarks as "dangerous", while a number of other Michigan sheriffs expressed their outrage as well. Law experts disagreed with the notion that the Wolverine Watchmen were simply planning to conduct a legal citizen's arrest on Whitmer, saying it was far-fetched. Leaf later clarified his comments, claiming he simply wanted a fair trial for the accused and did not agree with their alleged actions, which he called "horrible". His earlier comments and his ties with one of the suspects during the anti-lockdown protest have spurred calls for him to resign. On October 13, Leaf acknowledged the criticism but said he will not resign. \c\cDemocrats in the Michigan Legislature renewed calls for a ban on guns in the State Capitol building in response to news of the plot, following an unsuccessful September proposal drafted in response to armed anti-lockdown protesters storming the building in April. \c\cOn December 14, the day that Michigan's electors to the Electoral College were set to meet at the capital, authorities closed the Michigan State Capitol to the public and shuttered state legislators\' offices in the wake of the alleged plot, following "credible threats of violence". The building was left open only to those needed for the Electoral College. Earlier that day, State Representative Gary Eisen claimed there would be a "Hail Mary" effort regarding a plan to prevent electors from casting a vote. When asked if he can assure the public that it will be a safe day in Lansing, and that nobody would get hurt, Eisen replied, "No. I don\'t know. Because what we\'re doing today is uncharted." Shortly after the interview, Chatfield and Speaker-Elect Jason Wentworth released a statement disavowing any threat of violence or intimidation and announcing Eisen would be removed from his committee assignments for the rest of the term. \c\cOn January 11, 2021, Michigan banned the open carry of firearms on the State Capitol, citing the alleged plot and the storming of the United States Capitol. The ban was supported by both Democratic and Republican state lawmakers. On January 15, 2021, the Michigan National Guard was requested, and heavy fencing was put up around the State Capitol, in preparation for an armed protest two days later, on January 17. \c\cA spokesperson for Facebook, which had been used by the suspects in plotting Whitmer's kidnapping, said the company would be cooperating with the FBI's investigation. \c\cA scheduled October 13 campaign stop by Eric Trump at a Lyon Township gun store was moved to a banquet center in Novi after it was discovered one of the suspects had worked there for three weeks before being fired. \c\cThe Wolverine Watchmen group was reportedly an offshoot of the Michigan Militia. The day after the suspects were arrested, the Michigan Militia issued a statement disavowing the group. Other Michigan-based militia groups also distanced themselves from the plotters\' actions and intentions. The Michigan Home Guard, a militia that one of the suspects had once been a member of before being kicked out earlier this year, released a statement condemning the Wolverine Watchmen's actions. \c\cConspiracy theories about the alleged plot emerged on social media, falsely claiming the Wolverine Watchmen were anarchists affiliated with the antifa and Black Lives Matter movements. Some social media posts promoting the theories were flagged by Facebook as part of its anti-misinformation campaign, while PolitiFact rated the posts as "Mostly False".
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 32.2 million confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 575,000 deaths, the most of any country, and the sixteenth-highest per capita worldwide. The U.S. has about one fifth of the world's cases and deaths. More Americans have died from COVID-19 than died during both World Wars and the Vietnam War combined. COVID-19 became the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. U.S. life expectancy dropped from 78.8 years in 2019 to 77.8 years in the first half of 2020. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. Meanwhile, Trump remained optimistic and underestimated the degree of the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. \c\cThe first known American deaths occurred in February. On March 6, 2020, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak. On March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency. In mid-March, the Trump administration started to purchase large quantities of medical equipment, and in late March, it invoked the Defense Production Act of 1950 to direct industries to produce medical equipment. By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories. By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, and by November in all inhabited U.S. territories. \c\cA second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states, leading to daily cases surpassing 60,000. A third rise in infections began around mid-October, leading to daily cases reaching over 100,000 by the end of the month. A fourth rise in infections began around late March 2021 amidst the rise of a more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, just as COVID-19 vaccines began to be administered in the country. \c\cState and local responses to the outbreak have included mask mandates, prohibition and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and school closures. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas. \c\cIn late November 2019, coronavirus infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. China publicly reported the cluster on December 31, 2019. On January 6, U.S. Health and Human Services offered to send China a team of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) health experts to help contain the outbreak, but China ignored the offer, which the CDC said contributed to the U.S. and other countries getting a late start in identifying the danger and taking early action. \c\cAfter China confirmed that the cluster of infections was caused by a novel infectious coronavirus on January 7, the CDC issued an official health advisory the following day. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on January 10 about the strong possibility of human-to-human transmission and urged precautions. On January 20, the WHO and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had indeed occurred. The CDC immediately activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to respond to the outbreak in China. Also, the first report of a COVID-19 case in the U.S. was reported. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) – its highest level of alarm – warning that "all countries should be prepared for containment." The same day, the CDC confirmed the first person-to-person case in America. The next day, the U.S. declared a public health emergency. Although by that date there were only seven known cases in the U.S., the HHS and CDC reported that there was a likelihood of further cases appearing in the country. \c\cThe Trump administration evacuated American nationals from Wuhan in late January; the evacuees were greeted by officials who did not wear protective gear because the Trump administration worried about "bad optics". On February 2, the U.S. enacted travel restrictions to and from China. On February 6, the earliest confirmed American death with COVID-19 (that of a 57-year-old woman) occurred in Santa Clara County, California. The CDC did not report its confirmation until April 21, by which point nine other COVID-19 deaths had occurred in Santa Clara County. The virus had been circulating undetected at least since early January and possibly as early as November. On February 25, the CDC warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak. However, large gatherings that occurred before then accelerated transmission. The next day after the CDC warning, "Patient Zero", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz then thought to be the first community acquired case, became ill in New York City. \c\cIn February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. \c\cBy March 11, the virus had spread to 110 countries, and the WHO officially declared a pandemic. The CDC had already warned that large numbers of people needing hospital care could overload the healthcare system, which would lead to otherwise preventable deaths. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from the coronavirus was 10 times higher than the common flu. \c\cBy March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded a thousand. On March 16, the White House advised against any gatherings of more than ten people. Since March 19, the United States Department of State has advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel. \c\cBy the middle of March, all fifty states were able to perform tests with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs. However, the number of available test kits remained limited, which meant the true number of people infected had to be estimated. As cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. Manpower from the military and volunteer armies were called up to help construct the emergency facilities. \c\cThroughout March and early April, several state, city, and county governments imposed "stay at home" quarantines on their populations to stem the spread of the virus. By March 27, the country had reported over 100,000 cases. On April 2, at President Trump's direction, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and CDC ordered additional preventive guidelines to the long-term care facility industry. On April 11, the U.S. death toll became the highest in the world when the number of deaths reached 20,000, surpassing that of Italy. On April 19, the CMS added new regulations requiring nursing homes to inform residents, their families and representatives, of COVID-19 cases in their facilities. On April 28, the total number of confirmed cases across the country surpassed one million. \c\cBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19. State economic reopenings and lack of widespread mask orders resulted in a sharp rise in cases across most of the continental U.S. outside of the Northeast. A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey. \c\cOn July 6, the United States Department of State announced U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization effective July 6, 2021. The U.S. passed five million COVID-19 cases by August 8. \c\cOn July 10, the CDC adopted the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), "the number of individuals who die of the disease among all infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)", as a new metric for disease severity, replacing the Symptomatic Case Fatality Ratio and the Symptomatic Case Hospitalization Ratio. Per the CDC, the IFR "takes into account both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and may therefore be a more directly measurable parameter for disease severity for COVID-19". \c\cIn July, U.S. PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to "shut it down now, and start over". In July and early August, requests multiplied, with a number of experts asking for lockdowns of "six to eight weeks" that they believed would restore the country by October 1, in time to reopen schools and have an in-person election. \c\cIn August, over 400,000 people attended the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, and from there, at least 300 people in more than 20 states were infected. The CDC followed up with a report on the associated 51 confirmed primary event-associated cases, 21 secondary cases, and five tertiary cases in the neighboring state of Minnesota, where one attendee died of COVID-19. \c\cOn September 22, the U.S. passed 200,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In early October, an unprecedented series of high-profile U.S. political figures and staffers announced they had tested positive for COVID-19. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for the coronavirus and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. \c\cUSA Today studied the aftermath of presidential election campaigning, recognizing that causation was impossible to determine. Among their findings, cases increased 35 percent compared to 14 percent for the state after a Trump rally in Beltrami County, Minnesota. One case was traced to a Joe Biden rally in Duluth. \c\cOn November 9, President-elect Biden's transition team announced his COVID-19 Advisory Board. On the same day, the total number of cases had surpassed ten million while the total had risen by over a million in the ten days prior, averaging 102,300 new cases per day. Pfizer also announced that its COVID-19 vaccine may be up to ninety percent effective. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. \c\cIn spite of recommendations by the government not to travel, more than two million people flew on airlines during the Thanksgiving period. On December 8, the U.S. passed fifteen million cases, with about one out of every 22 Americans having tested positive since the pandemic began. By December 12, TSA employees across U.S. airports had a 38 percent increase in COVID-19 infections. On December 14, the U.S. passed 300,000 deaths, representing an average of more than 961 deaths per day since the first known death on February 6. More than 50,000 deaths were reported in the past month, with an average of 2,403 daily deaths occurring in the past week. \c\cOn December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. On December 29, the U.S. reported the first case of this variant in Colorado. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to state, "Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected."\c\cOn January 1, 2021, the U.S. had twenty million cases, representing an increase of more than a million over the past week and ten million in less than two months. On January 6, the CDC announced that it had found at least 52 confirmed cases of the B.1.1.7 variant in California, Florida, Colorado, Georgia, and New York; and it also stressed that there could already be more cases in the country. In the following days, more cases of the variant were reported in other states, leading former CDC director Tom Frieden to express his concerns that the U.S. will soon face "close to a worst-case scenario". It was believed the B.1.1.7 variant had been present in the U.S. since October. \c\cOn January 19, the U.S. passed 400,000 deaths, just five weeks after the country passed 300,000 deaths. On January 22, the U.S. passed 25 million cases, with one of every 13 Americans testing positive for COVID-19. On January 25, the U.S. reported its first case of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant from Brazil (P.1) in Minnesota. Three days later, on January 28, the country reported its first two cases of a new, possibly vaccine-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variant from South Africa (B.1.351) in South Carolina. On February 22, the U.S. passed 500,000 deaths, just five weeks after the country passed 400,000 deaths. By March 5, more than 2,750 cases of COVID-19 variants were detected in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico. This number consisted of 2,672 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant, 68 cases of the B.1.351 variant, and 13 cases of the P.1 variant. \c\cIn the first prime time address of his presidency on March 11, Biden announced his plan to push states to make vaccines available to all adults by May 1, with the aim of making small gatherings possible by July 4. The circulation of COVID-19 variants in the U.S., in spite of ongoing vaccination efforts and reported decreases in overall infection numbers, have led to concerns by experts that the variants would fuel another surge in cases amidst the onset of spring break. The TSA reported more than 1.3 million screenings at airports on March 12, the highest number since nearly a year ago. On March 24, the U.S. passed thirty million cases, just as a number of states began to expand the eligibility age for COVID-19 vaccines. Experts began warning against public relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation measures as vaccines continue to be administered, with one, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, warning of a new rise in cases. \c\cBy March 27, more than 8,000 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant were reported across 51 jurisdictions. By April 1, the number increased to more than 11,000, with cases mostly being reported in Florida and Michigan. By April 7, the B.1.1.7 variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S. On April 12, the U.S. reported its first cases of a new "double mutant" SARS-CoV-2 variant from India (B.1.617) in California. By April 25, the country's seven-day average of new reported infections was reported to be decreasing, but concerns were raised about drops in vaccine demand in certain parts of the U.S., which were attributed to vaccine hesitancy. \c\cOn January 6, a week after the U.S. was informed about the outbreak in China, both the Health and Human Services department and the CDC offered to send a team of U.S. health experts to China. According to CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, the Chinese government refused to let them in, which contributed to the U.S. getting a late start in identifying the danger of their outbreak and containing it before it reached other countries. Secretary Alex Azar said China did notify the world much sooner than it had after their SARS outbreak in 2003, but it was unexplainably turning away CDC help for this new one. \c\cOn January 28, the CDC updated its China travel recommendations to level 3, its highest alert. Azar submitted names of U.S. experts to the WHO and said the U.S. would provide $105 million in funding, adding that he had requested another $136 million from Congress. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. The WHO team consisted of thirteen international researchers, including two Americans, and toured five cities in China with twelve local scientists to study the epidemic February 16–23. The final report was released on February 28. \c\cIn late January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On February 7, The State Department said it had facilitated the transportation of nearly eighteen tons of medical supplies to China, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100 million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. \c\cOn February 28, the State Department offered to help Iran fight its own outbreak, as Iran's cases and deaths were dramatically increasing. Iran said, however, that U.S. sanctions were hampering its battle with the disease, which the U.S. denied, saying that Iran had mishandled the crisis. \c\cTesting for SARS-CoV-2 can allow healthcare workers to identify infected people. It is also an important component of tracking the pandemic. There are various types of tests currently on the market; some identify whether or not a patient is currently infected, while others give information about previous exposure to the virus. \c\cA report published in January 2021 revealed that a Chinese firm, BGI Group, was attempting to distribute its COVID-19 testing kits to at least 11 states in the US. The U.S. intelligence and security officials raised warnings about the security risks involved in using these kits, as BGI was trying to use the patients\' DNA, via the gene-sequencing machines that were being pitched to the U.S. labs. However, federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as the United States Department of Health and Human Services were pushing the states to use the BGI testing kits, despite such warnings. Besides the 11 states, Nevada received the Chinese-made testing kits from Abu Dhabi's data and artificial intelligence firm, Group 42, in collaboration with BGI. Some of the testing supplies were used in Nevada, but states like Alabama, South Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Arkansas, California, Indiana, Kansas, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania didn\'t purchase the BGI kits. \c\cContact tracing is a tool to control transmission rates during the reopening process. Some states like Texas and Arizona opted to proceed with reopening without adequate contact tracing programs in place. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. Privacy concerns have prevented measures such as those imposed in South Korea where authorities used cellphone tracking and credit card details to locate and test thousands of nightclub patrons when new cases began emerging. Funding for contact tracing is thought to be insufficient, and even better-funded states have faced challenges getting in touch with contacts. Congress has allocated $631 million for state and local health surveillance programs, but the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that $3.6 billion will be needed. The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which "may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials". \c\cAs of July 1, only four states are using contact tracing apps as part of their state-level strategies to control transmission. The apps document digital encounters between smartphones, so the users will automatically be notified if someone they had contact with has tested positive. Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email and phone communications. \c\cIn the United States, remdesivir is indicated for use in adults and adolescents (aged twelve years and older with body weight at least 40 kilograms (88 lb)) for the treatment of COVID‐19 requiring hospitalization. In November 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). As of August 2020, there were more than 500 potential therapies for COVID‐19 disease in various stages of preclinical or clinical research. \c\cIn early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. Among those were chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have been successfully used to treat malaria for over fifty years. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. One of Didier's COVID-19 studies was later retracted by the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. \c\cOn March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which allowed certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. On June 15, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19. The FDA said the available evidence showed "no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery". On July 1, the FDA published a review of safety issues associated with the drugs, including fatal cardiac arrhythmias among other side effects. \c\cIn late July, President Trump continued to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. This contrasted with the position of the NIH, which stated the drug was "very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19". \c\cFrom early 2020, more than 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research. In preparation for large-scale production, Congress set aside more than $3.5 billion for this purpose as part of the CARES Act. On August 5, 2020, the United States agreed to pay Johnson and Johnson more than $1 billion to create 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. The deal gave the U.S. an option to order an additional 200 million doses. The doses were supposed to be provided for free to Americans if they are used in a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. \c\cBIO, a trade group including all makers of coronavirus vaccines except AstraZeneca, tried to persuade Secretary Azar to publish strict FDA guidelines that could help ensure the safety and public uptake of the vaccine. Politics impacted scientific practice, however, when chief of staff Mark Meadows blocked the FDA when it was realized that the timing of the provisions would make it impossible for a vaccine to be authorized before the November election. Ultimately, the guidelines emerged from the Office of Management and Budget and were published on the FDA website. \c\cOn November 20, 2020, the Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization for its vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was granted on December 11. On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020. \c\cStarting on December 14, 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered. The CDC and each state keep track of the number of vaccines administered. \c\cAfter taking office in January 2021, new president Joe Biden signed an executive order to increase production and distribution of vaccines, aiming to have a hundred million doses administered within his first 100 days in office. On February 13, 2021, the CDC published data showing that 50.6 million doses had been administered to 37 million people, 13 million fully vaccinated and the rest awaiting their second dose. \c\cIn an address on March 11, 2021, Biden announced that he would push for all states to make vaccination available universally to all adults no later than May 1 and announced other planned initiatives to enhance and widen distribution. \c\cThe first known case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was confirmed by the CDC on January 21, 2020. The next day, the owner of the medical supply company Prestige Ameritech wrote to HHS officials to say he could produce millions of N95 masks per month. In a follow-up letter on January 23, the business owner informed the government that "We are the last major domestic mask company," without success. \c\cOn February 5, Trump administration officials declined an offer for congressional coronavirus funding. Senator Chris Murphy recalled that the officials, including Secretary Azar, "didn\'t need emergency funding, that they would be able to handle it within existing appropriations." On February 7 Mike Pompeo announced the administration donated more than 35,000 pounds of "masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials" to China the same day the WHO warned about "the limited stock of PPE (personal protective equipment)". \c\cIn February, the Department of Commerce published guidance advising U.S. firms on compliance with Beijing's fast-track process for the sale of "critical medical products", which required the masks shipped overseas meet U.S. regulatory standards. According to Chinese customs disclosures, more than six hundred tons of face masks were shipped to China in February. \c\cIn early March, the country had about twelve million N95 masks and thirty million surgical masks in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), but the DHS estimated the stockpile had only 1.2 percent of the roughly 3.5 billion masks that would be needed if COVID-19 were to become a "full-blown" pandemic. A previous 2015 CDC study found that seven billion N95 respirators might be necessary to handle a "severe respiratory outbreak". \c\cAs of March, the SNS had more than 19,000 ventilators (16,660 immediately available and 2,425 in maintenance), all of which dated from previous administrations. Vessel manifests maintained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection showed a steady flow of the medical equipment needed to treat the coronavirus being shipped abroad as recently as March 17. Meanwhile, FEMA said the agency "has not actively encouraged or discouraged U.S. companies from exporting overseas" and asked USAID to send back its reserves of protective gear for use in the U.S. President Trump evoked the Defense Production Act to prohibit some medical exports. Some analysts warned that export restrictions could cause retaliation from countries that have medical supplies the United States needs to import. \c\cBy the end of March, states were in a bidding war against each other and the federal government for scarce medical supplies such as N95 masks, surgical masks, and ventilators. Meanwhile, as states scrambled to purchase supplies at inflated prices from third party distributors (some of which later turned out to be defective), hundreds of tons of medical-grade face masks were shipped by air freight to foreign buyers in China and other countries. \c\cMedical organizations such as the American Medical Association and American Nurses Association implored Trump to obtain medical supplies, because they were "urgently needed". That led President Trump to sign an order setting motion parts of the Defense Production Act, first used during the Korean War, to allow the federal government a wide range of powers, including telling industries on what to produce, allocating supplies, giving incentives to industries, and allowing companies to cooperate. Trump then ordered auto manufacturer General Motors to make ventilators. \c\cDuring this period, hospitals in the U.S. and other countries were reporting shortages of test kits, test swabs, masks, gowns, and gloves (collectively referred to as PPE.) The Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a report regarding their March 23–27 survey of 323 hospitals. The hospitals reported "severe shortages of testing supplies", "frequently waiting seven days or longer for test results", which extended the length of patient stays, and as a result, "strained bed availability, personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, and staffing". The hospitals also reported, "widespread shortages of PPE" and "changing and sometimes inconsistent guidance from federal, state and local authorities". At a press briefing following the release of the report President Trump called the report "wrong" and questioned the motives of the author. Later he called the report "another fake dossier". \c\cIn early April, there was a widespread shortage of PPE, including masks, gloves, gowns, and sanitizing products. The difficulties in acquiring PPE for local hospitals led to orders for gowns and other safety items being confiscated by FEMA and diverted to other locations, which meant that in some cases states had to compete for the same PPE. Prices skyrocketed across the board, with PPE costing up to 10x more than normally. The shortages led in one instance of a governor asking the New England Patriots of the NFL to use their private plane to fly approximately 1.2 million masks from China to Boston. At that time, Veterans Affairs (VA) employees said nurses were having to use surgical masks and face shields instead of more protective N95 masks. In May, Rick Bright, a federal immunologist and whistleblower, testified that the federal government had not taken proper action to acquire the needed supplies. \c\cAn unexpectedly high percentage of COVID-19 patients in the ICU required dialysis as a result of kidney failure, about twenty percent. In mid-April, employees at some hospitals in New York City reported not having enough dialysis machines, were running low on fluids to operate the machines, and reported a shortage of dialysis nurses as many were out sick with COVID-19 due to lack of sufficient PPE. \c\cOn May 14, a Trump administration official told reporters "we do anticipate having 300 million" N95 masks by autumn; however, at the end of September, there were only 87.6 million N95 masks in the government stockpile. \c\cSupply problems persisted in August 2020, when a survey reported 42 percent of nurses were experiencing widespread or intermittent shortages of personal protective equipment, with 60 percent using single-use equipment for five or more days. A September report by National Public Radio found some items were in short supply but others widely available, depending on the difficulty of manufacturing. The DPA was effective in producing ventilators but less so in producing N95s. As of September, the DPA had stimulated N95 production mainly by existing major manufacturers and less so by smaller companies. Additionally, the DPA's provision that exempts manufacturers from antitrust laws had not yet been used to encourage collaboration in N95 production. \c\cIn response to demand, a number of domestic businesses retooled and due to lack of federal coordination ended up producing a glut of hand sanitizer and face shields, some losing money due to oversupply or lack of distribution. Retooling and individual emergency supply making accounted for the production of at least 34.2 million pieces of PPE in the U.S., 14.5 million of which were face shields. The federal government used the Defense Production Act to get a small number of large manufacturers such as 3M and Honeywell to increase production of the more difficult to manufacture N95 masks, but supply was still falling hundreds of millions of units short of demand. NPR found the shortage could be resolved by providing government guarantees to small and medium-sized manufacturers so they could increase production of N95 masks without the risk of losing money or going out of business due to oversupply or drop in demand when the pandemic ends. Instead, President Trump has denied the PPE shortages exist, calling them "fake news" in April and in September saying "we\'ve opened up factories, we\'ve had tremendous success with face masks and with shields." Demand has also increased since the early weeks of the pandemic as various industries reopened, including medical and dental offices, construction, and trucking. The 2020 California wildfires also increased demand for N95 masks for agricultural and other outdoor workers, due to state regulations requiring protection during poor air quality conditions. \c\cUncontrolled community spread led some medical facilities to refuse new patients or start transferring patients out. In March and April, this happened in the Detroit, Michigan area and New York City area; Yakima, Washington in June; and in July it happened in Houston,\c\cthe Boise, Idaho area, Lake Charles and Lafayette, Louisiana,\c\cand at dozens of hospitals across Florida. By August, some hospitals in Mississippi were transferring patients out of state. \c\cArizona declared crisis standards of care in July 2020, allowing hospitals to legally provide treatment normally considered substandard to some patients in order to save others. \c\cIn January 2021, Southern California hospitals began to be overwhelmed with patients. Officials in Los Angeles County, where some ambulances had to wait up to eight hours to discharge patients at emergency rooms, ordered EMTs not to bring a patient to the hospital if that patient had little chance of survival. They also directed crews to take measures to conserve medical oxygen. \c\cThe federal government of the United States responded to the pandemic with various declarations of emergency, which resulted in travel and entry restrictions. They also imposed guidelines and recommendations regarding the closure of schools and public meeting places, lockdowns, and other restrictions intended to slow the progression of the virus, which state, territorial, tribal, and local governments have followed. \c\cEffective July 15, 2020, the default data centralization point for COVID-19 data in the U.S. is switching from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to Department of Health and Human Services. However, "hospitals may be relieved from reporting directly to the Federal Government if they receive a written release from the State stating the State will collect the data from the hospitals and take over Federal reporting."\c\cOn February 3, an unclassified Army briefing document on the coronavirus projected that in an unlikely "black swan" scenario, "between 80,000 and 150,000 could die." The theory correctly stated that asymptomatic people could "easily" transmit the virus, a belief that was presented as outside medical consensus at the time of the briefing. The briefing also stated that military forces could be tasked with providing logistics and medical support to civilians, including "provid[ing] PPE (N-95 Face Mask, Eye Protection, and Gloves) to evacuees, staff, and DoD personnel". \c\cIn mid-March, the government began having the military add its health care capacity to impacted areas. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), under the authority of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), leased private buildings nationwide. They included hotels, college dormitories, and larger open buildings, which were converted into temporary hospitals. The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City was quickly transformed into a 2,000-bed care facility on March 23, 2020. The Army also set up field hospitals in various affected cities. \c\cSome of these facilities had ICUs for COVID-19 patients, while others served non-coronavirus patients to allow established hospitals to concentrate on the pandemic. At the height of this effort, U.S. Northern Command had deployed nine thousand military medical personnel. \c\cOn March 18, in addition to the many popup hospitals nationwide, the Navy deployed two hospital ships, USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort, which were planned to accept non-coronavirus patients transferred from land-based hospitals, so those hospitals could concentrate on virus cases. On March 29, citing reduction in on-shore medical capabilities and the closure of facilities at the Port of Miami to new patients, the U.S. Coast Guard required ships carrying more than fifty people to prepare to care for sick people on board. \c\cOn April 6, the Army announced that basic training would be postponed for new recruits. Recruits already in training would continue what the Army is calling "social-distanced-enabled training". However, the military, in general, remained ready for any contingency in a COVID-19 environment. By April 9, nearly 2,000 service members had confirmed cases of COVID-19. \c\cIn April, the Army made plans to resume collective training. Social distancing of soldiers is in place during training, assemblies, and transport between locations. Temperatures of the soldiers are taken at identified intervals, and measures are taken to immediately remediate affected soldiers. \c\cOn June 26, 2020, the VA reported 20,509 cases of COVID-19 and 1,573 deaths among patients, plus more than two thousand cases and 38 deaths among its own employees. As of July 2020, additional Reserve personnel are on "prepare-to-deploy orders" to Texas and California. \c\cMany janitors and other cleaners throughout the United States reported that they were not given adequate time, resources or training to clean and to disinfect institutions for COVID-19. One pilot reported that less than ten minutes was allotted to clean entire airplanes between arrival and departure, which did not allow cleaners to disinfect the tray tables and bathrooms, for which the practice was to wipe down only those that "[look] dirty". Cleaning cloths and wipes were reused, and disinfecting agents, such as bleach, were not provided. Employees also complained that they were not informed if coworkers tested positive for the virus. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the federal agency that regulates workplace safety and health, investigated a small fraction of these complaints. Mary Kay Henry, president of Service Employees International Union, which represents 375,000 American custodians, explained that "reopenings happened across the country without much thoughtfulness for cleaning standards." She urged better government standards and a certification system. \c\cPolling showed a significant partisan divide regarding the outbreak. In February, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was "a real threat": 70% and 72%, respectively. By mid-March, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as "a real threat", while only 40% of Republicans agreed. In mid-March, various polls found Democrats were more likely than Republicans to believe "the worst was yet to come" (79–40%), to believe their lives would change in a major way due to the outbreak (56–26%), and to take certain precautions against the virus (83–53%). The CDC was the most trusted source of information about the outbreak (85%), followed by the WHO (77%), state and local government officials (70–71%), the news media (47%), and President Trump (46%). \c\cPolitical analysts anticipated that the pandemic would negatively affect Trump's chances of re-election. In March 2020, when social distancing practices began, the governors of many states experienced sharp gains in approval ratings. Trump's approval rating increased from 44 to 49 percent in Gallup polls, but it fell to 43% by mid-April. At that time, Pew Research polls indicated that 65% of Americans felt Trump was too slow in taking major steps to respond to the pandemic. \c\cOn April 16, Pew Research polls indicated that 32% of Americans worried state governments would take too long to re-allow public activities, while 66% feared the state restrictions would be lifted too quickly. An April 21 poll found a 44% approval rate for the president's handling of the pandemic, compared to 72% approval for state governors. A mid-April poll estimated that President Trump was a source of information on the pandemic for 28% of Americans, while state or local governments were a source for 50% of Americans. 60% of Americans felt Trump was not listening enough to health experts in dealing with the outbreak. \c\cA May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. A poll conducted May 20–21 found that 56% of the American public were "very" concerned about "false or misleading information being communicated about coronavirus", while 30% were "somewhat" concerned. 56% of Democrats said the top source of false or misleading information about the coronavirus was the Trump administration, while 54% of Republicans felt the media was the top source of false or misleading information. \c\cStudies using GPS location data and surveys found that Republicans engaged in less social distancing than Democrats during the pandemic. Controlling for relevant factors, Republican governors were slower to implement social distance policies than Democratic governors. There was a partisan divide over COVID vaccinations, with the counties that voted for Trump in greater shares having lower rates of vaccinations. \c\cStarting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least two hundred U.S. cities in response to the killing of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus due to the close proximity of protesters. Fauci said it could be a "perfect set-up for the spread of the virus", and that "masks can help, but it's masks plus physical separation." One study found an increase in cases, while the Associated Press reported that there is little evidence for such an assertion. \c\cOn January 6, 2021, supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol building to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's electoral victory. At least one activist participated in the riot despite a recent positive COVID-19 diagnosis, and few members of the crowd wore face coverings, with many coming from out of town. A group of maskless Republicans sheltering in place were recorded refusing masks offered by Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and as many as two hundred congressional staffers reportedly sheltered in various rooms inside the Capitol, further increasing the risk of transmission. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician of Congress, later reported that members of Congress may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 while sheltering in place. Four members of Congress have since tested positive due to the exposure. \c\cIn September 2020, Pew Research Center found that the global image of the United States had suffered in many foreign nations. In some nations, the United States\' favorability rating had reached a record low since Pew began collecting this data nearly twenty years ago. Across thirteen different nations, a median of fifteen percent of respondents rated the U.S. response to the pandemic positively. \c\cThe outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health. \c\cThe American cultural values of individualism and skepticism of government have created difficulties in getting the population to abide by public health directives. The prevalence of pandemic fatigue has resulted in further noncompliance. \c\cConspiracy theories and misinformation reached millions of Americans through social media and television commentary. As a result, many people believe falsehoods, for example, that wearing masks is dangerous, that a global syndicate planned the virus, or that COVID-19 is a hoax. Facebook announced that it had labeled or deleted 179 million user posts containing COVID-19 misinformation during the first three quarters of 2020. President Trump repeatedly broadcast misinformation to downplay the threat of the virus and to deflect criticism of the administration's response. Trump asserted he did this to "show calm," saying "I don\'t want to create a panic."\c\cThe pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, led a recession in the United States following the economic cycle peak in February 2020. The economy contracted 4.8 percent from January through March 2020, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April. The total healthcare costs of treating the epidemic could be anywhere from $34 billion to $251 billion according to analysis presented by The New York Times. A study by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson indicated that most economic impact due to consumer behavior changes was prior to mandated lockdowns. During the second quarter of 2020, the U.S. economy suffered its largest drop on record, with GDP falling at an annualized rate of 32.9 percent. As of June 2020, the U.S. economy was over ten percent smaller than it was in December 2019. \c\cIn September, Bain & Company reported on the tumultuous changes in consumer behavior before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Potentially permanently, they found acceleration towards e-commerce, online primary healthcare, livestreamed gym workouts, and moviegoing via subscription television. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. OpenTable estimated in May that 25 percent of American restaurants would close their doors permanently. \c\cThe economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has raised fears of a mass eviction crisis, with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating 30–40 million are at risk for eviction by the end of 2020. According to a report by Yelp, about sixty percent of U.S. businesses that have closed since the start of the pandemic will stay shut permanently. \c\cIn May, daily infection and death rates were still higher per capita in densely populated cities and suburbs, but were increasing faster in rural counties. Of the 25 counties with the highest per capita case rates in May, 20 had a meatpacking plant or prison where the virus was able to spread unchecked. By July, rural communities with populations less than 50,000 had some of the highest rates of new daily cases per capita. Factors contributing to the spread of COVID-19 in these communities are high rates of obesity,[dubious  – discuss] the relatively high numbers of elderly residents, immigrant laborers with shared living conditions and meat-processing plants. \c\cThe pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the disease itself and efforts to contain it, including political, cultural, and social implications. \c\cFrom the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. During the first year, an ad-hoc organization called Stop AAPI Hate received 3,795 reports of racism against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. \c\cDisproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations. Of four studies published in September 2020, three found clear disparities due to race and the fourth found slightly better survival rates for Hispanics and Blacks. As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. Additionally, a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2020 revealed that the effect of stress and weathering on minority groups decreases their stamina against COVID. \c\cFrom 2019 to the first half of 2020, in the United States the life expectancy of a white person decreased 0.8 years; a Hispanic person, 1.9 years; and a Black person, 2.7 years. The COVID Tracking Project published data revealing that people of color were contracting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites. An NPR analysis of April–September 2020 data from the COVID Tracking Project found that Black people's share of COVID-19 deaths across the United States was 1.5 times greater (in some states 2.5 times greater) than their share of the U.S. population. Similarly, Hispanics and Latinos were disproportionately infected in 45 states and had a disproportionate share of the deaths in 19 states. Native American and Alaskan Native cases and deaths were disproportionally high in at least 21 states and, in some, as much as five times more than average. White non-Hispanics died at a lower rate than their share of the population in 36 states and D.C. \c\cBy April 2020, closed schools affected more than 55 million students. \c\cThe pandemic prompted calls from voting rights groups and some Democratic Party leaders to expand mail-in voting, while Republican leaders generally opposed the change. Some states were unable to agree on changes, resulting in lawsuits. Responding to Democratic proposals for nationwide mail-in voting as part of a coronavirus relief law, President Trump said, "you\'d never have a Republican elected in this country again" despite evidence the change would not favor any particular group. Trump called mail-in voting "corrupt" and said voters should be required to show up in person, even though, as reporters pointed out, he had himself voted by mail in the last Florida primary. Though mail-in vote fraud is slightly higher than in-person voter fraud, both instances are rare, and mail-in voting can be made more secure by disallowing third parties to collect ballots and providing free drop-off locations or prepaid postage. \c\cHigh COVID-19 fatalities at the state and county level correlated with a drop in expressed support for the election of Republicans, including the reelection of President Trump, according to a study published in Science Advances that compared opinions in January–February 2020 with opinions in June 2020. \c\cThe United States has experienced pandemics and epidemics throughout its history, including the 1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemics. In the most recent pandemic prior to COVID-19, the 2009 swine flu pandemic took the lives of more than 12,000 Americans and hospitalized another 270,000 over the course of approximately a year. \c\cAccording to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. in 2020 was the "most prepared" nation.
{"On 30 April 2021, a car bombing in Puli Alam, Logar Province, Afghanistan killed at least 30 people. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, and the perpetrators remain unknown. 
{"On May 3, 2021, at least 30 civilians were killed and 20 more were wounded after militants stormed a village in Foutouri, Burkina Faso. 
The insurgency in the Maghreb refers to the Islamist insurgency in the Maghreb and Sahel regions of North Africa that followed on from the Algerian Civil War. The Algerian militant group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) allied itself with al-Qaeda to eventually become al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The Algerian and other Maghreb governments fighting the militants have worked with the United States and the United Kingdom since 2007, when Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara began. While the 2011 Arab Spring affected support for the insurgency, it also presented military opportunities for the jihadists. In 2012, AQIM and Islamist allies captured the northern half of Mali, until being fought back less than a year later following a French-led foreign intervention, which was succeeded by the Sahel-wide Operation Barkhane. In Libya, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has been able to control some limited territory in the ongoing civil war since 2014, amid allegations of local collaboration between the rival AQIM and ISIL. \c\cWith the decline of the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA), the GSPC was left as the most active rebel group, with about 300 fighters in 2003. It continued an assassination campaign of police and army personnel in its area, and also managed to expand into the Sahara, where its southern division, led by Amari Saifi (nicknamed "Abderrezak el-Para", the "paratrooper"), kidnapped a number of German tourists in 2003, before being forced to flee to sparsely populated areas of Mali, and later Niger and Chad, where he was captured. \c\cSome believe that el-Para actually works for the Algerian government. By late 2003, the group's founder had been supplanted by the even more radical Nabil Sahraoui, who announced his open support for al-Qaeda, thus strengthening government ties between the U.S. and Algeria. He was reportedly killed shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud in 2004. \c\cThe GSPC has declared its intention to attack Algerian, French, and American targets. It has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. Department of State, and similarly classed as a terrorist organization by the European Union. \c\cThe conflict with the GSPC continued to result in a significant number of casualties in Algeria, with over 1,100 killed in clashes with Islamist rebels in 2002. In 2003, a total 1,162 were killed in clashes in Algeria, followed by 429 killed in 2004, 488 killed in 2005, and 323 killed in 2006. In early 2006, the head of the Algerian national police claimed that terrorism had nearly been eliminated in the country, but significant attacks continued, and 2007 would eventually mark a height of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in Algeria. \c\cIn order to improve recruiting and funding, the GSPC aligned itself with al-Qaeda, and on 11 September 2006, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri announced a union between the groups. The GSPC rebranded itself as al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in January 2007, signaling the broadened aspirations of the group. \c\cThe group now aimed to overthrow all North African governments deemed apostate, including those of Algeria, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. Operations were shifted into two broader "sectors", Northern Algeria and Tunisia allocated a "central emirate", and northern Mali, Niger, Mauritania and Libya a "Sahara emirate" led by Djamel Okacha. The strategic leadership of AQIM continued to be headquartered in the mountainous region of Kabylie east of the Algerian capital Algiers, headed by a 14-member Shura council leadership. \c\cAs the Algerian counterterrorism campaign became largely successful in pushing AQIM out of the country, the group established new bases in Sahel countries such as Niger, Mauritania, Chad and Mali. Attacks against government and military installations were frequently underreported by Western media. In 2007, the United States and United Kingdom launched the Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara in support of governments in the region. \c\cFrequent kidnappings of foreigners in 2008 led the Dakar Rally to be cancelled and permanently moved to South America. \c\cIn the earliest major attack as direct spillover of the Algerian conflict, the Mauritanian army base Lemgheity was attacked by the GSPC in June 2005, killing 17 soldiers (and nine jihadists), and wounding another 17. The attack in part led to a coup d\'état in October 2005 by Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who made a campaign against jihadists a major part of his rule. Attacks continued in Mauritania until it was largely successful in thwarting attacks since 2011 following a major military boost and political openings for Islamists. AQIM has however continued to remain active in the eastern border-regions with Mali, with active support systems for logistics and information. A lack of military resources, often due to turmoil and having little population in a very large country, caused Mauritania to rely on support from France, Morocco, and Algeria in order to defeat the AQIM. \c\cIn December 2006 and again in January 2007, Tunisian security forces engaged in clashes with a group linked to the GSPC that had established training camps in mountainous areas near the capital Tunis, killing more than a dozen people. According to French daily Le Parisien at least 60 people were killed in the clashes. The clashes were the most serious terrorist activity in Tunisia since the Ghriba synagogue bombing in 2002. \c\cStarting in 2012, AQIM along with Ansar al-Sharia and the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade active in the mountainous Jebel ech Chambi region outside Kasserine near the Algeria–Tunisia border have been targeted by the Tunisian Army in the Chaambi Operations. In 2014, Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade militants attacked two Tunisian military checkpoints, killing fourteen Tunisian soldiers and injuring twenty-five in what was the deadliest military skirmish in Tunisia since its independence in 1956. Since 2015, Tunisia has simultaneously been targeted by an ISIL terrorist campaign. In March 2016 over 50 militants were killed when ISIL attempted to seize Ben Guerdane near the Libya–Tunisia border. \c\cSince the Libyan Civil War in 2011, south-western Libya has offered sanctuaries to AQIM which has dispatched cells to be established in the region. On 11 September 2012, members of Ansar al-Sharia and AQIM were responsible for coordinated attacks against two United States government facilities in Benghazi, and Ansar al-Sharia was later involved in clashes in Benghazi in 2013. Drawing defectors from AQIM, the rival Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was later able to control some limited territory in the north in the renewed civil war from 2014. After initial official support from AQIM, allegations have continued of local collaboration between the otherwise rivalling groups. After being pushed out of Derna, the remaining ISIL stronghold of Sirte was captured in late 2016. Al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamists led by Ansar al-Sharia have at the same time continued to exert control in other places. \c\cIn 2012, AQIM and allied Islamist groups Ansar Dine and Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA) were able to capture the northern half of Mali after effectively overrunning the preceding Tuareg rebellion, which in turn had been sparked by former Tuareg fighters from the Libyan Civil War. In 2012 Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted in a coup d\'état over his handling of the conflict. After Ansar Dine attempted a push into the south of the country, Mali requested France to launch a military intervention in January 2013 which successfully pushed rebels out. The military intervention was followed by an ongoing Sahel-wide French-led military operation with around 4,000 French soldiers actively deployed. \c\cSmall pockets of armed Islamists have remained active in northern Mali, and attacks have continued against the UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA, which has become one of the UN's deadliest international missions. \c\cHaving cooperated and trained alongside AQIM in the Sahel since 2006, the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram began expanding into Chad and Niger in 2014 after successfully seizing territory in the insurgency in Nigeria. By then controlling a significant area around Lake Chad, a coalition of Western African countries launched an offensive against the group in January 2015. The group eventually departed its alliance with al-Qaeda, pledging allegiance to ISIL in March 2015. By the end of 2015 Boko Haram had been largely pushed to retreat into the Sambisa Forest in Nigeria, although attacks have continued including in Niger. \c\cAlgerian Civil War with the GIA is considered to have ended in February 2002, GSPC continues insurgency. \c\cApril 11, 2002 - Ghriba synagogue bombing killed 22 (14 German tourists, 5 Tunisians, and 2 French nationals and the suicide bomber). \c\cMay 5, 2002 - 15 government soldiers are killed in an ambush near Tizi Ouzou, in the Kabylie region of northern Algeria.

The 2021 Hartlepool by-election was a by-election held in the UK parliamentary constituency of Hartlepool following the resignation of the sitting Member of Parliament (MP), Mike Hill. It was held on 6 May 2021 alongside elections to the Borough Council, Tees Valley Mayor, and Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner. The seat is part of the "red wall", a set of constituencies that historically supported the Labour Party but where the party is being challenged by increasing Conservative support. \c\cThis was the first by-election to the parliament elected in 2019. \c\cThe 21-month gap between the last by-election in Brecon and Radnorshire in August 2019 and the polling day of the by-election in Hartlepool was the longest since World War II. The 21-month gap was also attributed to the coronavirus pandemic. \c\cHartlepool, named after the town of the same name, has been held by the Labour Party since 1964. The seat includes the town of Hartlepool itself and the nearby villages of Hart, Elwick, Greatham, Newton Bewley and Dalton Piercy. \c\cIn the 2016 European Union membership referendum, the Hartlepool Council area, which covers the same area as the constituency, voted 69.6% to 30.4% to leave the European Union (EU). \c\cFormer MPs have included Royal Navy officer John Kerans and former cabinet minister Peter Mandelson. \c\cThe 2004 by-election saw a large swing to the Liberal Democrats, while the UK Independence Party came in a close second place at the 2015 general election. \c\cHill is due to face an employment tribunal later in the year following allegations of sexual harassment and victimisation. Hill was suspended from the Labour Party in September 2019 over allegations of sexual harassment, but reinstated in October 2019. In January 2020, Hill's request for anonymity was turned down in an upcoming employment tribunal related to the accusations. The alleged victim stated that she had also made a report to the Metropolitan Police at the time of the original accusations. On 16 March 2021, Hill announced his resignation with immediate effect. \c\cThere were sixteen candidates, the most for any UK Commons by-election since Haltemprice & Howden in 2008. The full list was published on 8 April 2021. \c\cNHS doctor and former MP Paul Williams was selected on 18 March as the Labour candidate. Williams represented the nearby constituency of Stockton South but lost his seat at the 2019 election. He had been standing for the position of Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner, to be elected in May 2021, but withdrew from that contest in order to stand in Hartlepool. \c\cOn 17 March, Reform UK leader Richard Tice, who contested the seat in 2019, told LBC that the party intended to stand a candidate. On 31 March, the party selected businessman John Prescott (no relation to the former deputy prime minister of the same name) as their candidate. He was the party's candidate for Stockton South in the 2019 election, under its previous name of the Brexit Party. \c\cThe Northern Independence Party (NIP) announced on 17 March that they would contest the by-election. Later that month, they selected as their candidate former Labour MP Thelma Walker, who represented the West Yorkshire constituency of Colne Valley, but lost her seat at the 2019 election. Due to the NIP not being registered with the Electoral Commission by the deadline on 8 April, Walker is listed on ballot as an Independent. \c\cOn 20 March, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) announced their intention to stand in the by-election. On 29 March, the SDP announced that its candidate would be David Bettney, a former regimental sergeant major in the Light Dragoons. On 22 March, Gemma Evans from the Women's Equality Party expressed her intention to stand. On 24 March, the North East Party announced that former Labour MP and founding party member Hilton Dawson would be their candidate for the by-election. \c\cOn 26 March, the Conservative Party selected farmer and Hambleton District Cllr Jill Mortimer as their candidate in the by-election. She was previously the Conservative candidate in Leeds East at the 2019 election. Incumbent Conservative Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen was reportedly unhappy with the choice of candidate due to her not being from the area, declining to endorse Mortimer at the time of her selection. \c\cOn 31 March, the Official Monster Raving Loony Party selected party treasurer Nick "The Incredible Flying Brick" Delves as their candidate. \c\cOn 2 April, local pub owner Adam Gaines announced his intention to stand as an independent candidate. \c\cOn 2 April, the Liberal Democrats selected schoolteacher Andy Hagon as their candidate. Hagon was the party's candidate for the constituency at both the 2017 and 2019 elections. \c\cOn 6 April, former journalist and local businesswoman Samantha Lee announced her intention to stand as an independent candidate lobbying for Hartlepool to be awarded freeport status. \c\cOn 7 April, Rachel Featherstone, a lecturer at Teesside University, was selected as the Green Party candidate. Featherstone was previously her party's candidate for Sunderland Central in 2015, 2017, and 2019, and was top of the Green Party list in North East England at the 2019 European election. \c\cOn 8 April, London-based businessman Ralph Ward-Jackson, descendant of West Hartlepool founder and 19th century Conservative MP for the The Hartlepools, Ralph Ward Jackson, declared that he had filed to run, citing the town's lack of a hospital and closure of the magistrates\' court. Ward-Jackson had previously been selected by the local Conservative Party to contest the seat at the 2019 general election, but withdrew to support the Brexit Party. \c\cLabour was criticised for the conduct of its selection process, which gave candidates one day to submit application papers. An unnamed Labour MP accused Labour's leadership of a "stitch-up", and alleged that the speed of Labour's selection had disadvantaged local party members. Labour leader Keir Starmer said that the local party had written to Labour headquarters to identify Paul Williams as their preferred choice. While Williams was a vocal advocate of a second referendum on EU membership, the constituency of Hartlepool supported Brexit by almost 70%, leading to criticism after he deleted his pro-EU tweets before his candidacy. \c\cDuring the by-election campaign, Williams apologised for a tweet he posted in 2011: "Do you have a favourite Tory MILF? Mind-blowing dinner table conversation". He was defended by Starmer, while Labour peer and former shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti called for him to be replaced "immediately". Williams\' campaign featured a pledge to return hospital services to the town, but was accused of hypocrisy after it emerged that he was a co-author of a clinical commissioning group report which recommended the closure of those services in 2013. \c\cEarly in the by-election campaign, Conservative candidate Jill Mortimer was criticised for being based in North Yorkshire. When asked if Hartlepool was somewhere she spent a lot of time, Mortimer replied: "It hasn\'t been up until now, but it will be". Later in the campaign, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner accused Mortimer of corruption. In a letter to Conservative Party Chairman Amanda Milling, Rayner requested the publication of a "full account" of Mortimer's time living in the Cayman Islands. Milling described Rayner's accusation as a "desperate attack" that was "factually wrong and entirely disingenuous". \c\cThe by-election attracted considerable political attention, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Conservative Party Chairman Amanda Milling campaigning in the town for the Conservatives, while Keir Starmer, members of his Shadow Cabinet, and the wider Labour frontbench campaigned in the town for Labour. Campaigning was suspended for the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. \c\cOn 22 April, it was reported that Independent candidate Chris Killick is a convicted sex offender. He filmed a 62-second clip of a naked woman in her hotel room while she was unconscious in 2015; she said she woke up to Killick not knowing who he was or how she arrived in the hotel, and said that she was drugged and raped. In 2020, Killick was given a 30-month community order and fined £2,000, and ordered to pay £5,000 in compensation to his victim. Killick did not mention his conviction on any election form or to those who signed his nomination papers, describing his candidacy as "an experiment to see how much publicity I can get. Not by speaking about the offence I committed, but by speaking about the stuff I really care about." In response, 1,400 people signed an online petition calling for the government to prohibit sex offenders from standing for public office. \c\c  Part of a MRP projection with other constituencies

The 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis is the ongoing state of heightened military tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and its allies and the United States of America and its allies in the Persian Gulf region. Starting in early May 2019, the U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to deter an alleged planned campaign by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. This followed a rise in political tensions between the two countries during the Trump administration, which included the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the imposition of new sanctions against Iran, and the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. In response, Iran designated the United States Central Command as a terrorist organization. \c\cSeveral merchant ships in the Persian Gulf were damaged in two incidents in May and June 2019. Western nations blamed Iran, while Iran denied involvement. In June 2019, Iran shot down an American RQ-4A surveillance drone flying over the Strait of Hormuz, sharply increasing tensions and nearly resulting in an armed confrontation. In July 2019, an Iranian oil tanker was seized by Britain in the Strait of Gibraltar on the grounds that it was shipping oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Iran later captured a British oil tanker and its crew members in the Persian Gulf. Both Iran and the UK later released the ships. Meanwhile, the U.S. created the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), which sought to increase "overall surveillance and security in key waterways in the Middle East", according to the United States Department of Defense. \c\cThe crisis escalated in late 2019 and early 2020 when alleged members of the Kata\'ib Hezbollah militia, part of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces, killed an American contractor in an attack on an Iraqi base hosting U.S. personnel. In retaliation, the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Kata\'ib Hezbollah's facilities in Iraq and Syria, killing 25 militiamen. Kata\'ib Hezbollah responded with an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, which prompted the U.S. to deploy hundreds of new troops to the Middle East and announce that it would preemptively target Iran's "proxies" in Iraq. Days later, the commander of IRGC's Quds Force Qasem Soleimani and PMF commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were both killed in a U.S. drone strike, resulting in Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei pledging to exact revenge on U.S. forces. The U.S. deployed nearly 4,000 troops in response to the tensions, and Israel heightened its security levels. On 5 January 2020, Iran ended its commitments to the nuclear deal, and the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory. \c\cThe U.S. and Iran nearly entered into an open conflict on 8 January 2020 when the IRGC launched ballistic missile attacks against two military bases in Iraq housing U.S. soldiers in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani, a rare direct Iran–U.S. confrontation and the closest to the brink of war between the two nations in decades. Upon initial assessments of no U.S. casualties, the Trump administration curtailed tensions by temporarily ruling out a direct military response but announcing new sanctions. It was later revealed that more than a hundred U.S. troops sustained injuries during the attacks. During the crisis, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down after departing from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport, and Western officials said the plane had been brought down by an Iranian SA-15 surface-to-air missile. On 11 January 2020, the Iranian military admitted in a statement that they had mistakenly shot down the plane due to human error. \c\cOn 8 May 2018, the United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal, reinstating sanctions against Iran. Iran's oil production hit a historic low as a result of these sanctions. According to the BBC in April 2019, United States sanctions against Iran "led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests". Iranian officials have accused the U.S. of waging hybrid warfare against the country. \c\cTensions between Iran and the U.S. escalated in May 2019, with the U.S. deploying more military assets to the Persian Gulf region after receiving intelligence reports of an alleged "campaign" by Iran and its "proxies" to threaten U.S. forces and Strait of Hormuz oil shipping. U.S. officials cited intelligence reports that included photographs of missiles on dhows and other small boats in the Persian Gulf, supposedly put there by Iranian paramilitary forces. The U.S. feared the missiles could be fired at its Navy. \c\cThe U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to deter what it regards as a planned campaign of belligerency by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the gulf and Iraq. PMF and Kata\'ib Hezbollah were targeted by U.S. airstrikes, claiming their proxy belligerent role on the orders of Iran. In June 2019, Iran shot down an American RQ-4A surveillance drone, sharply increasing tensions and nearly resulting in an armed confrontation. \c\cThe International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), formerly known as Operation Sentinel or the Sentinel Program, is a multinational maritime effort established by the U.S. to ensure gulf security following Iranian seizures of commercial tankers. \c\cFollowing Iran's shoot-down of a U.S. surveillance drone on 20 June 2019, the U.S. bolstered its efforts to establish a coalition to deter Iranian attacks in the Persian Gulf. On 19 July, U.S. Central Command acknowledged what it called Operation Sentinel which had the stated goal of de-escalating tensions and promoting maritime stability in international waters "throughout the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait (BAM) and the Gulf of Oman". Sentinel called for participating nations to provide escorts to their flagged commercial vessels in the region and for coordinating surveillance capabilities. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper later commented on the nature of the operation, stating "My view is... we would want to prevent the Iranians seizing or stopping a ship, certainly, for any arbitrary reason whatsoever". Some U.S. allies, particularly European allies, were reportedly reticent towards the Sentinel Program due to qualms associated with signing on to a U.S.-led naval effort that could potentially drag them into a confrontation with Iran; this was coupled with reports of a potential European-led naval security effort separate from the U.S. By September 2019, the U.S. had "rebranded" Operation Sentinel as the "International Maritime Security Construct", reportedly to attract more participation. \c\cIn early August 2019, the United Kingdom agreed to join the U.S. in its maritime program, abandoning the idea of a European-led naval protection force. On 21 August, Australia announced it would join the U.S.-led naval coalition, with plans to deploy a P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft to the Middle East for one month before the end of 2019, a frigate in January 2020 for six months, and Australian Defence Forces personnel to the IMSC headquarters in Bahrain. Australia ended its participation in the IMSC on 28 December 2020 after defense minister Linda Reynolds announced a shifting of naval resources to the Indo-Pacific. \c\cOn 16 September, IMSC members held a Main Planning Conference aboard RFA Cardigan Bay along with representatives from 25 additional countries where they reaffirmed commitments to the operation and discussed their efforts to enhance maritime security throughout key waterways in the region. Saudi Arabia joined the coalition on 18 September and the United Arab Emirates joined on 20 September. \c\cIn November 2019, Albania became the seventh nation to join the IMSC. Lithuania joined the coalition in March 2020. \c\c United Kingdom\c\c Bahrain (Headquarters)\c\c United States\c\c Saudi Arabia\c\c United Arab Emirates\c\c Albania\c\c Lithuania\c\c Estonia. \c\c Australia (2019–2020)\c\cOn 6 August 2019, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz reportedly said Israel would participate in the coalition, providing intelligence and other unspecified assistance. \c\cJapan announced on 18 October 2019 that it would not join the IMSC but would instead send its own separate naval assets to the region to guard merchant vessels "related to Japan" while still closely cooperating with the U.S. A senior Japanese official said the contingency would likely include warships and aircraft that will patrol the Gulf of Oman, the Northern Arabian Sea and other regional waters. In February 2020, as part of efforts by the Japanese government to protect the lanes that provide all the oil the Japanese economy depends on, a Japanese warship departed for the Gulf of Oman. \c\cKuwait and Qatar expressed the intention to join in November 2019. \c\cOn 5 May 2019, then-U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton announced that the U.S. was deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and four B-52 bombers to the Middle East to "send a clear and unmistakable message" to Iran following Israeli intelligence reports of an alleged Iranian plot to attack U.S. forces in the region. Bolton said, "The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack." The USS Abraham Lincoln was deployed to the Arabian Sea, outside the Persian Gulf. \c\cOn 7 May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a surprise midnight visit to Baghdad after canceling a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Pompeo told Iraqi President Barham Salih and Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi they had a responsibility to protect Americans in Iraq. On 8 May, an advisor to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran was confident the U.S. was both unwilling and unable to start a war with Iran. On the same day, Iran announced that it would reduce its commitment to the JCPOA nuclear deal which the U.S. had withdrawn from. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani set a 60-day deadline for the EU and world powers to rescue the current deal before it resumed higher uranium enrichment. The United States Air Forces Central Command announced that F-15C Eagle fighter jets were repositioned within the region to "defend U.S. forces and interests in the region". On 10 May, the U.S. deployed the Marine transport ship USS Arlington and a Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) battery to the Middle East. The Pentagon said the buildup was in response to "heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations". \c\cOn 12 May, four commercial ships, including two Saudi Aramco oil tankers, were damaged near the port of Fujairah in the Gulf of Oman. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) claimed the incident was a "sabotage attack", while a U.S. assessment reportedly blamed Iran or Iranian "proxy" elements for the attack. \c\cOn 13 May, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad said U.S. citizens should not travel to Iraq and for those who were already there to keep a low profile. On the same day, The New York Times reported that Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan had presented a military plan to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East if Iran attacked American forces or took steps toward developing nuclear weapons. U.S. president Donald Trump later discredited this, saying he would instead "send a hell of a lot more" than 120,000 troops if necessary. \c\cOn 14 May, both Iranian and U.S. officials said they were not seeking war, even as threats and counter-threats continued. Ayatollah Khamenei downplayed the escalation, saying in comments carried on state television that "no war is going to happen," while Mike Pompeo said while on a visit to Russia, "We fundamentally do not seek a war with Iran." On the same day, Houthi rebels—which have alleged ties to Iranian elements—in Yemen carried out multiple drone attacks on a Saudi oil pipeline deep in Saudi territory. The U.S. said it believed Iran sponsored the attack, though it was unclear if the attack was particularly related to the Iran–U.S. tensions or related to the Yemeni Civil War that began in 2015 and the U.S.-backed Saudi Arabian-led intervention there. On 15 May, the U.S. State Department announced that all non-emergency staff had been ordered to leave the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. \c\cOn 19 May, President Trump warned that in the event of a conflict, it would be "the official end of Iran". Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded that Trump's "genocidal taunts" would not "end Iran". On the same day, a rocket exploded inside the heavily fortified Green Zone sector of Baghdad, landing less than a mile from the U.S. Embassy. On 24 May, the U.S. deployed 1,500 additional troops to the Persian Gulf region as a "protective" measure against Iran. The deployment included reconnaissance aircraft, fighter jets and engineers; 600 of the troops were given extended deployments, meaning 900 would be fresh troops. U.S. Navy vice admiral and Director of the Joint Staff Michael Gilday said the U.S. had a high degree of confidence that Iran's Revolutionary Guard was responsible for the 12 May explosions on four tankers and that it was Iranian proxies in Iraq who fired rockets into Baghdad's Green Zone. \c\cOn 20 May, Trump said: "We have no indication that anything's happened or will happen" in Iran. However, on 25 May, Trump invoked a rarely used legal loophole to approve the sale of $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, declaring that ongoing tensions with Iran amounted to a national emergency. Weapons would also reportedly be sold to the UAE and Jordan. On 28 May, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran was abiding by the main terms of the JCPOA, although questions were raised on how many advanced centrifuges Iran was allowed to have, as that was only loosely defined in the 2015 deal. \c\cOn 1 June, President Hassan Rouhani suggested Iran would be willing to hold talks but asserted that it would not be pressured by sanctions and American military posturing. On 2 June, Mike Pompeo said the U.S. was ready for unconditional discussions with Iran on its nuclear program, but affirmed that it would not relent on pressuring Iran until it starts behaving like a "normal country". "We are prepared to engage in a conversation with no pre-conditions. We are ready to sit down," Pompeo said, while also saying Trump had always been willing to seek dialogue with Iranian leadership. Iran's foreign ministry responded stating, "The Islamic Republic of Iran does not pay attention to word-play and expression of hidden agenda in new forms. What matters is the change of U.S. general approach and actual behavior toward the Iranian nation," which it said needed "reform". The softening dialogue came amid U.S. military exercises in the Arabian Sea, which saw various aircraft "simulating strike operations"; Yahya Rahim Safavi, top military aide to Ayatollah Khamenei, said U.S. military vessels in the Persian Gulf were within range of Iranian missiles and warned that any clash between the two countries would push oil prices above $100 a barrel. \c\cOn 6 June, the Houthis in Yemen shot down an American MQ-9 Reaper (Predator B) drone. The U.S. military claimed the attack was performed with Iranian assistance. U.S. Central Command commander Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. warned that Iran and its "proxy" forces still posed an "imminent" threat to U.S. forces: "I think we\'re still in the period of what I would call tactical warning ... The threat is very real."\c\cAlso on 6 June, the UAE, supported by Norway and Saudi Arabia, told the United Nations Security Council 12 May attacks had the marks of a "sophisticated and coordinated operation", and were most likely performed by a "state actor". Video of the damage to the tankers Amjad, Al Marzoqah, A Michel and Andrea Victory was released to broadcasters. \c\cOn 13 June 2019 two oil tankers caught fire after allegedly being attacked by limpet mines or flying objects in another incident in the Gulf of Oman. As in the May incident, the U.S. blamed Iranian forces for the attacks. On 17 June, the U.S. announced the deployment of 1,000 more soldiers to the Middle East. \c\cTensions reached a new high when, on 20 June, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down a U.S. RQ-4A Global Hawk surveillance drone, saying the drone had violated Iranian airspace. IRGC commander Hossein Salami called the shoot-down a "clear message" to the U.S. while also warning that, though they were not seeking war, Iran was "completely ready" for it. U.S. Central Command later confirmed that the drone was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles but denied that it violated Iranian airspace, calling it an "unprovoked attack", and that it was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran and the U.S. provided conflicting GPS coordinates for the drone's location, making it unclear whether the drone was within Iran's 12-mile territorial boundary. The U.S. requested a 24 June closed-door United Nations Security Council meeting to address the regional tensions with Iran, according to diplomats. \c\cTrump ordered a retaliatory military strike on Iran on 20 June, but withdrew the order minutes before the operation began. Trump said he had decided to halt the operation after being told that as many as 150 Iranians would be killed, although some administration officials said Trump had been advised of the potential casualties before he ordered the operation to be prepared. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton reportedly objected to the reversal. \c\cOn 22 June, it was reported that Trump had approved cyber attacks that disabled IRGC computer systems used to control rocket and missile launches the night of the drone-downing. The cyber strikes were handled by U.S. Cyber Command in conjunction with U.S. Central Command. It represented the first offensive show of force since Cyber Command was elevated to a full combatant command in May 2018. Also on 22 June, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to U.S. industries that Iran was stepping up cyber attacks of critical industries—particularly oil, gas and other energy sectors—and government agencies, and has the potential to disrupt or destroy systems. \c\cOn 23 June, Iranian President Rouhani blamed the United States\' "interventionist military presence" for the high tensions. Iranian Major General Gholam Ali Rashid warned the U.S. of "uncontrollable" consequences should a conflict break out. Meanwhile, during a speech in Israel, U.S. security advisor John Bolton said Iran should not "mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness", emphasizing that future military options are not ruled out and that Trump had only stopped the strike from going forward "at this time". Mike Pompeo visited the Persian Gulf region for talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in a bid to build a coalition to combat perceived Iranian nuclear and "terror" ambitions. \c\cOn 24 June, the Trump administration announced new sanctions against Iranian government and IRGC leadership, including Supreme Leader Khamenei and his office. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions were to block "billions" in assets. On the same day, Trump told reporters he did not need congressional consent for an initial strike on Iran. On 25 June, Iran said the new sanctions prompted a "permanent closure" of their diplomatic ties, and the regime refused to negotiate with Washington until the sanctions were lifted. On 27 June, Javad Zarif tweeted that sanctions are not an "alternative to war; they ARE war" and argued that Trump's usage of the term "obliteration" against Iran is a reference to genocide, a war crime. He also said negotiations and threats are "mutually exclusive" and called the concept of only a short war with Iran an "illusion". \c\cIn classified briefings, Pompeo and other U.S. State Department and Pentagon officials reportedly advised members of the U.S. Congress on what they described as alarming ties between Iran and al-Qaeda—including giving the terrorist organization safe haven in the country. The New York Times reported that lawmakers were leery of assertions of Iranian links to al-Qaeda, notably due to concerns that the administration may be using specious assertions to build a case for military action against Iran based on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists—supposed links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda were used as partial justification to invade Iraq in 2003. On 27 June, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy sharply denied that Pentagon officials linked al-Qaeda to Iran during congressional meetings. "In these briefings, none of the officials mentioned al-Qa\'ida or the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force," Mulroy said, adding that he and the Defense Intelligence Agency instead "described the historical ties between Iran and the Taliban, and I explained that these ties are widely and publicly known and referenced in articles and books". \c\cFollowing the drone shoot-down, the U.S. continued unabated to deploy military assets to the region. By 28 June, the U.S. had deployed nearly a dozen F-22 Raptor fighter jets to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar—the first ever deployment of F-22s to the base—to "defend American forces and interests". \c\cOn 18 July, according to the Pentagon, USS Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone that had closed in within approximately 1,000 yards (910 m) of the ship in the Persian Gulf; U.S. forces jammed the drone, causing it to crash. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi denied any of the country's drones had been brought down. U.S. General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., commander of the U.S. Central Command, subsequently claimed that USS Boxer may have downed a second Iranian drone. \c\cOn 3 July, Gibraltar enacted "Sanctions Regulations 2019" after the March 2019 Sanctions Act, referring to the EU sanctions for Syria (EU No. 36/2012). It also specified the Panama-flagged Iranian tanker Grace 1 as a ship under those regulations. On 4 July, the ship was seized by British authorities while carrying out an off-port limited logistics stop near Gibraltar, on suspicion that the vessel was carrying oil to Syria in breach of the European Union sanctions. A force of 30 Royal Marines boarded the ship from a helicopter and speedboat, accompanied by Royal Gibraltar Police officers and HM Customs Gibraltar officers. Four of the ship's crew, including the captain and chief officer, were arrested but subsequently released on bail without charge. The Spanish Foreign Office lodged a complaint with its British counterpart. Iran demanded the ship's release and denied the vessel was violating sanctions, and an official of the IRGC issued a threat to seize a British ship in retaliation. Ayatollah Khamenei described the incident as a British act of "piracy" which has been given a "legal appearance". Britain offered to release the ship in exchange for an Iranian guarantee that it would not proceed to the Syrian port of Baniyas to deliver oil to the refinery there. On 11 July, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose foiled an Iranian attempt to capture the BP-owned British oil tanker British Heritage as it transited through the Strait of Hormuz. Three boats believed to be from the IRGC approached the tanker and tried to halt it, after which HMS Montrose, which had been shadowing the tanker, moved between the boats and the tanker and trained guns on the boats, warning them to back off. The Iranian boats then turned away. The Royal Navy subsequently deployed the destroyer HMS Duncan to the Persian Gulf to reinforce HMS Montrose. \c\cOn 14 July, a Panamanian-flagged oil tanker, MT Riah, which was operating in the UAE, disappeared from ship tracking maps near Iran after crossing the Strait of Hormuz. Adding to the mystery, no entity claimed ownership of the tanker. \c\cOn 20 July, the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero was seized in a raid by IRGC forces. Four small boats and a helicopter stopped the ship and Iranian commandos rappelled on board from the helicopter. The ship was taken to Bandar Abbas and its crew of 23 detained on board. On 4 September, Iran decided to free only seven crew members of the detained British tanker. A second British-owned and Liberian-flagged ship was also seized but later allowed to continue its journey. In a letter to the UN, Iran said the Stena Impero had collided with and damaged an Iranian vessel, and ignored warnings by Iranian authorities. \c\cThe ship's seizure sparked a diplomatic crisis between the United Kingdom and Iran. The British government condemned the seizure of the ship and demanded its release, warning of "serious consequences". Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi visited Iran to negotiate the release of Stena Impero at the request of the British government. Iran confirmed that it seized the ship as retaliation over the British seizure of Grace 1 in Gibraltar and hinted that it would be willing to release Stena Impero in exchange for the release of Grace 1. \c\cOn 31 July, the United States sanctioned the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, complicating the chances of a diplomatic resolution of the crisis. \c\cOn 4 August 2019, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized an Iraqi tanker for allegedly smuggling oil to other Arab countries. The seven crew members on board were detained, further heightening tensions in the Persian Gulf.[citation needed] Three days later, Britain joined the U.S.-led International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC)—then known as the "Sentinel Program"—to protect oil tankers in the gulf and surrounding seas. \c\cOn 15 August, Gibraltar released Grace 1 after receiving assurances the oil would not be sold to an EU-sanctioned entity, and after rejecting a request from the United States Department of Justice to allow them to seize the ship. The Iranian government later said it had issued no assurances that the oil would not be delivered to Syria and reasserted its intention to continue supplying oil to the Arab nation. On 16 August, the Department of Justice issued a warrant in Washington, D.C. to seize Grace 1, the cargo of oil, and $995,000 on the grounds that the profit from the ship's voyage was intended to enrich the IRGC, which the U.S. had previously designated a terrorist organization. On 18 August, Gibraltar announced that its Justice Ministry had rejected the U.S. warrant, as U.S. sanctions against Iran did not apply in the European Union, and the ship, renamed Adrian Darya 1 and registered under the Iranian flag, was expected to sail imminently from Gibraltar. \c\cAfter releasing the ship, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the tanker and its captain and inputted them in the blacklist. Some days later, Brian Hook, the U.S. Special Representative for Iran, sent emails to the Indian captain of the ship and offered some million dollars in U.S. cash to steer the Adrian Darya 1 to a country where it could be seized by U.S. forces; but he rejected these offers. \c\cOn 3 September, Iran announced that the oil tanker Adrian Darya 1 had delivered its cargo, defying U.S. threats. Satellite imagery had shown the tanker near Syria. On 9 September, Britain's foreign minister accused Iran of selling the oil that was carried in Adrian Darya 1 to Syria. Iran said the oil had been sold to a private company which is not an EU-sanctioned entity, so its assurance to Gibraltar had not been breached. \c\cOn 14 September, the 2019 Abqaiq–Khurais attack took place—a coordinated cruise missile and drone attack that targeted the state-owned Saudi Aramco oil processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais in eastern Saudi Arabia. The Houthi movement in Yemen claimed responsibility, tying it to events surrounding the Saudi Arabian intervention in the Yemeni Civil War. However, claims made by some U.S. officials that the attacks originated in Iran, despite Iran's denial, further escalated the current gulf crisis. \c\cOn 16 September, the IRGC seized another vessel near Iran's Greater Tunb island in the Persian Gulf. It was reported that the vessel was allegedly smuggling 250,000 litres of diesel fuel to the UAE. \c\cOn 23 September, the Iranian president criticized the IMSC, the new U.S.-led maritime coalition set to patrol the region's waterways, and asked the western powers to leave the security of the Persian Gulf to them. \c\cOn 27 September, the British oil tanker Stena Impero departed from Iranian waters after around two months in Iranian detention. The remainder of the ship's 23 crew members who were detained in Iran were released as well, with seven crew members already released on 4 September. On 28 September, Stena Impero, which was also able to transmit signals, docked at Port Rashid, Dubai. The same day, HMS Duncan returned to her homeport, Portsmouth naval base. \c\cOn 7 November 2019, International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) launched official operations in Bahrain to protect the shipping lanes near the troubled Iranian territorial waters. The coalition opened its command center in the kingdom, to ward off the perceived threat to the global oil supply amid the crisis. \c\cIn early December, the Pentagon considered sending reinforcements to the Middle East to deal with escalating tensions due to attacks against international shipping through the Persian Gulf, a missile strike against a Saudi oil facility, violent crackdown of protests in Iran, and heightened Iranian activities in the region. The number of people dead in Iranian demonstrations remained disputed, though Iran had not released any official estimates. U.S. special representative for Iran Brian Hook announced that his country was offering $15 million for information concerning the whereabouts of Abdulreza Shahlai, a senior Iranian commander accused of orchestrating numerous attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and a foiled attempt to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. \c\cOn 27 December, Iran, Russia, and China began a four-day naval exercise in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman. The exercise was launched from Chabahar Port near Pakistan, and included the Chinese Type 051 destroyer Xining. The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed it had deployed ships from the Baltic Fleet in its official newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda. According to Iranian government and military officials over its state news channel Press TV, the exercise was a response to U.S.–Saudi regional maneuvers and was meant to demonstrate that Iran was not isolated despite U.S. sanctions. In contrast, the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, Senior Colonel Wu Qian, claimed the exercise was a "normal military exchange" unconnected to the international tensions. \c\cAlso on 27 December, K-1 Air Base in Iraq's Kirkuk Governorate was attacked with Katyusha rockets, injuring several Iraqi Security Forces personnel, four U.S. soldiers, and killing a U.S. civilian military contractor. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the attacks, blaming Iranian-backed Shi\'ite Muslim militias. On 29 December, U.S. airstrikes targeted Kata\'ib Hizbollah facilities in Iraq and Syria killing 25 militants and injuring at least 55 others. The Department of Defense said the operation was in retaliation for repeated attacks on Iraqi military bases hosting Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) coalition forces, particularly the K-1 Air Base attack. About 5,000 U.S. troops were present in Iraq to deal with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant remnants and to assist the Iraqi military. Kata\'ib Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attacks. \c\cOn 31 December, Iran-backed militiamen under the Popular Mobilization Forces attacked the outer perimeter of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, prompting American diplomats to evacuate to safe rooms. The militiamen later withdrew. An additional 100 U.S. Marines were sent to reinforce the embassy. \c\cA major flashpoint in the crisis occurred on 3 January 2020, when President Donald Trump approved the targeted killing of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. Iraqi paramilitary leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and other IRGC and Iraqi paramilitary personnel were also killed in the drone attack. Shortly after the attack, the U.S. deployed an additional 3,000 ground troops to the Middle East, in addition to 14,000 already stationed there since May the previous year. President Trump defended the move, claiming in an interview with The Ingraham Angle on the Fox News Channel that General Soleimani was planning further attacks against four U.S. Embassies across the Middle East. This was later challenged by U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper in interviews on Face the Nation on CBS and State of the Union on CNN, who claimed that President Trump was not embellishing that there was an Iranian threat but that he had seen no evidence that U.S. embassies were to be targeted. As the funeral procession for Soleimani and al-Muhandis was ongoing in Baghdad, several rockets hit near the U.S. embassy and the Balad Air Base without any casualties. \c\cAmid international fears of a direct confrontation between the two nations, Trump warned Iran on 4 January against attacking U.S. assets or any Americans in the region. He threatened that in the event of an Iranian attack, the U.S. would target 52 Iranian sites, including cultural sites, which represented the 52 hostages taken by Iran in 1979, and would strike "very fast and very hard". The White House officially notified the U.S. Congress about the killing of Qassem Soleimani, in accordance with the 1973 War Powers Resolution, a day after the fact. Meanwhile, thousands of people in 70 cities across the U.S. participated in antiwar demonstrations against a new conflict in the Middle East. On the same day, the UK sent two warships, HMS Kent and HMS Defender, to the Persian Gulf to protect their ships and citizens. The Royal Navy was deployed to accompany British-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz. \c\cOn 5 January, Iran announced that it would not continue to abide by the limitations mentioned in the 2015 nuclear deal. An Iranian government statement on state television said "If the sanctions are lifted ... the Islamic Republic is ready to return to its obligations." Iran also demanded the Iraqi parliament to get rid of the American presence in their country. The Iraqi parliament passed a resolution to expel all foreign, particularly U.S., troops from Iraqi territory through a vote boycotted by Sunni and Kurdish representatives. The media initially reported that the U.S. would comply with the resolution after a draft letter from Brigadier General William H. Seely III addressed to the Iraqi Defense Ministry emerged claiming as such, but Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark A. Milley and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper soon clarified that the letter had been sent in error and the U.S. Armed Forces would not withdraw from Iraq. In response to the Iraqi parliament situation, Trump threatened to impose sanctions on Iraq "like they\'ve never seen before". On 10 January, Acting Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi placed a telephone call to Secretary of State Pompeo demanding that the U.S. send a delegation "to prepare a mechanism to carry out the parliament's resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq". Pompeo rejected Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi's requests. Shortly afterwards Iraq's highest-ranking Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, condemned the U.S.–Iran crisis. \c\cIn response to Iran's violations of the 2015 nuclear deal, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany threatened to activate the deal's dispute mechanism reenacting European Union and United Nations sanctions on Iran, a move supported by the U.S. State Department. In response, the Iranian Foreign Ministry threatened a "serious and strong response", and President Rouhani made a televised Cabinet address on Iranian state television directly threatening European troops while blaming U.S. escalation for the crisis. Soon afterwards, Rouhani claimed the country was enriching uranium at a higher rate per day than before the ratification of the deal, though experts questioned the logistical reality of that claim. \c\cMeanwhile, the legality of the Baghdad Airport strike was brought into question in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. Congress was not consulted before the attack and some congress members sought to restrict the president's ability to attack Iran. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the strike, and declared that Congress needed to be consulted in advance for any such military actions. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would introduce a resolution to limit Trump's ability to take actions against Iran. On 10 January, the House ratified the resolution by a vote of 224–194. The vote was mostly conducted among party lines, with eight Democrats opposing the resolution and three Republicans favoring it. Following the killing of Soleimani, a classified intelligence briefing to the U.S. Senate by CIA Director Gina Haspel was heavily scrutinized by many congressmembers and caused many legislators to question the Trump administration's rationale for the attacks. Shortly afterwards the U.S. State Department cancelled four further briefings on the crisis to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee without rescheduling them. Representative Eliot Engel, the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, invited Mike Pompeo to a 29 January hearing to testify on the crisis and threatened to issue a subpoena against him. \c\cOn 8 January 2020, Iraq's Al Asad Airbase, which hosts U.S.-led coalition troops, was attacked with ballistic missiles as a part of Iran's "Operation Martyr Soleimani", named for general Qasem Soleimani. It was also reported that the airbase in Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan was attacked as well. During the attack, the IRGC declared that "fierce revenge by the Revolutionary Guards had begun", indicating it was the official response to the killing of Soleimani. Although among the facilities struck were troop sleeping quarters, some analysts suggested the strike was deliberately designed to avoid causing any fatalities to dissuade an American response. While the U.S. initially assessed that none of its service members were injured or killed, the U.S. Department of Defense ultimately said that 110 service members had been diagnosed and treated for traumatic brain injuries from the attack. \c\cDuring his White House address hours after the attack, Trump ruled out a direct military response, urged rapprochement with Iran, demanded NATO be more involved in regional affairs, and demanded a new Iran nuclear deal be arranged. Trump, however, also announced new sanctions on Iran and affirmed his position that Iran could not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. On 9 January, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council announcing that the United States was willing to negotiate with Iran to prevent further escalation. Ayatollah Khamenei rejected the possibility of talks at any level between U.S. and Iranian officials unless the United States returned to the JCPOA; Iranian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Majid Takht-Ravanchi likewise rejected the option. Both ambassadors justified their countries\' military actions under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. On 14 January, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson encouraged the negotiation of a new nuclear deal between the Trump administration and the Iranian government, which President Trump expressed agreement with. \c\cOn 10 January, the Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions targeting Iran's metals industry and eight senior officials who were involved in the prior missile attacks. According to U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, the sanctions would affect "billions" in revenue. The U.S. also warned Iraq that it would freeze its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York if it continued to urge the withdrawal of American troops, which would prevent the Iraqi government from accessing oil revenues, damage the Iraqi economy, and devalue the Iraqi dinar. On 15 January, the United States and Iraq resumed joint military operations against the Islamic State after a ten-day suspension following the drone strike on Soleimani. \c\cHours after the ballistic missile attacks, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crashed just after taking off from Tehran International Airport, killing all 176 passengers and crew, including 82 Iranian and 63 Canadian citizens. An investigation was launched to decipher the reason for the crash. On 9 January, U.S. officials said they believe the aircraft had been shot down in error by an Iranian Tor missile, based on evidence from reconnaissance satellite imagery and radar data. Iranian officials initially denied the allegations but, on 11 January, admitted to accidentally shooting down the plane. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged deescalation and claimed that the United States\' escalation of the conflict was partially to blame for the accident, saying "If there was no escalation recently in the region, those Canadians would be right now home with their families. This is something that happens when you have conflict and the war. Innocents bear the brunt of it." The incident slightly worsened Canada–United States relations. The airline shoot-down also reignited anti-government protests within Iran that had previously become dormant during the massive public outcry against the death of Soleimani. Foreign ministers from the countries who lost citizens in the crash—Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan, and the United Kingdom—met at the Canadian High Commission in London and demanded that Iran provide compensation for families of the victims. \c\cOn 12 January, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah called for Iran's allies in the Axis of Resistance—including Iran, the Syrian Arab Republic, Hezbollah, the Popular Mobilization Forces, and the Houthi movement in Yemen—to intensify its military campaigns against the U.S. to expel U.S. forces from the Middle East. During a state visit by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar to Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei called for regional cooperation against the U.S. However, following discussions between Sheikh Tamim and President Rouhani, Tamim concluded that de-escalation and dialogue were the only means to resolve the regional crises. In response to the increased tensions, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and many U.S. states released advisories warning of Iranian cyberattacks, while the Texas Department of Information Resources said Iranian cyberattacks had reached a rate of 10,000 per minute. \c\cOn 17 January, Ayatollah Khamenei personally led Friday prayers in Tehran for the first time since February 2012, speaking at the Imam Khomeini Grand Mosque. During his televised sermon, Khamenei lamented the shootdown of the Ukrainian airliner, sought to present the image that the country was unified despite protests and the international crisis, and lashed out at the UK, France, and Germany, referring to them as "servants" of the "villainous" United States. Khamenei denounced the Trump administration as "clowns" and insisted that the "real punishment" for General Soleimani's assassination would be forcing American forces out of the Middle East. In response Trump, who was vacationing at Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, at the time, made posts on Twitter urging Iranian leadership to stop "killing" Iranian protesters and that it "should abandon terror and Make Iran Great Again!" One of the posts was written in both English and Persian. On the same day, the Asian Football Confederation banned Iran from hosting international football matches. On 18 January, the U.S. sanctioned Brigadier General Hassan Shahvarpour, an IRGC commander in Khuzestan Province, after security personnel fired into protesters without warning during anti-government demonstrations in Mahshahr County. \c\cOn 26 January, three rockets were fired on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, wounding at least one staff member present at the cafeteria at dinner time, with the nationality of the wounded still undisclosed, other sources reported three wounded. \c\cOn 9 February, during routine maritime patrols, U.S. forces aboard the USS Normandy (CG-60) interdicted and seized a cache of Iranian-made weapons aboard a dhow in the Arabian Sea that was purportedly en route to supply Houthi rebels in Yemen. According to the U.S., the shipment consisted of 358 weapons components, including 150 Dehlavieh anti-tank missiles, three Iranian-made SAMs, thermal imaging weapon scopes, and other components for manned and unmanned aerial and surface vessels, such as bomb boats and weaponized drones. \c\cOn 10 February, the Pentagon confirmed that more than a hundred U.S. service members were injured from the 8 January IRGC ballistic missile attacks, with 109 personnel diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. \c\cOn 13 February, the U.S. Senate voted 55–45 to constrain Trump's ability to wage war on Iran without congressional approval. The bipartisan vote for the Iran War Powers Resolution included eight Republican senators. Trump threatened to veto the resolution. On the same day, a rocket hit an Iraqi base in Kirkuk that housed U.S. forces. No casualties were reported. \c\cOn 11 March, Qasem Soleimani's birthday, 15 Katyusha rockets struck Camp Taji, Iraq, killing two U.S. soldiers and one British soldier from the Royal Army Medical Corps. The attack left 12 other American soldiers, contractors and OIR coalition personnel (including a Polish soldier) injured, five critically. On 13 March after midnight, after a previous retaliatory operation, the U.S. launched air raids against Kata\'ib Hezbollah facilities in Karbala and the Babylon area near the Karbala International Airport; the strikes reportedly killed at least three Iraqi soldiers, two policemen and one civilian. 11 Iraqi soldiers were wounded as well as five Popular Mobilization Forces fighters. \c\cOn 14 March, before 11:00 AM, another rocket attack struck Camp Taji; more than 24 107mm caliber rockets struck the coalition compound and the Iraqi Air defenses installation there, injuring three coalition soldiers and two Iraqi soldiers. Iraqi forces subsequently found seven Katyusha rocket launchers with 25 rockets armed but not launched nearby. \c\cOn 16 March, the U.S. announced it would pull out from three of its eight bases on Iraq, amid continued tensions with the Iraqi government and Iran. In the border crossing of al-Qaim, the U.S. handed over equipment to the Iraqi security forces to ensure border security with Syria, a significant move that effectively ended any significant U.S. presence along the Iraqi side of the border. The other two military bases later transferred to the Iraqis were the Qayyarah Airfield and the K-1 Air Base. CJTF-OIR said the base transfers and repositioning of forces were pre-planned in coordination with the Iraqi government in response to progress in the ongoing operation against ISIL and unrelated to the recent base attacks or the COVID-19 viral pandemic situation in the country. The coalition added it would relocate and consolidate personnel and equipment from several Iraqi bases throughout 2020. \c\cOn 17 March, two rockets struck the Besmaya Range Complex, south of Baghdad, where Spanish troops were stationed; no casualties were reported. \c\cThe gradual reduction of NATO and coalition presence in Iraq continued on 24 March when the Czech Republic withdrew troops citing security threats, the global COVID-19 pandemic, and a planned mission restructuring. 30 Czech soldiers participating in Operation Inherent Resolve and the NATO Training Mission in Iraq returned to Prague. \c\cOn 25 March, France announced it would withdraw its forces from training duties in Iraq, mostly trainers to local armed forces, largely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Iraq's military halted all training in early March to minimize the risk of the illness spreading among its forces, including from the OIR coalition. \c\cOn 3 April, the Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed forces Mohammad Bagheri said, "Iran will respond severely if the United States does anything to undermine security of Iran". \c\cOn 7 April, in Iraq, the coalition withdrew from the Abu Ghraib operating base, the al-Sqoor base inside Nineveh Operations Command, and the Al-Taqaddum Air Base, handing control to the Iraqi security forces. However, amidst the force consolidation, by 13 April the U.S. had also installed and activated Patriot air defense systems, an Army C-RAM system, and an AN/TWQ-1 Avenger at Al Asad Airbase and the base at Erbil (the two bases attacked by Iran in January), and at Camp Taji, after gradually moving the systems piece-by-piece into Iraq since January. CENTCOM commander Gen. Frank McKenzie said the Patriots and other systems were taken from another location where they were also needed, without saying where. U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley also added that hundreds of troops from the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, which deployed to Iraq in January as an Immediate Response Force following the embassy attack, would remain until "... the situation with the Shia militia groups and Iran ... 100 percent settled down". \c\cOn 14 April, an oil tanker named SC Taipei sailing under the flag of Hong Kong was seized and released the same day by armed men while anchored 3 nm off Iran's Ras Al Kuh coast. \c\cGulf tensions remained high in mid-April between Iranian and U.S. vessels. On 15 April, during U.S. Army AH-64E Apache deck landing qualifications with the Navy in the northern Persian Gulf, 11 NEDSA speed boats began circling six U.S. vessels partaking in the exercise, including coming within 10 yards of the U.S. Coast Guard's Island-class cutter Maui (WPB-1304) and within 50 yards of the USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB-3). According to the U.S. Navy, "The IRGCN vessels repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of the U.S. vessels at extremely close range and high speeds ... the U.S. crews issued multiple warnings via bridge-to-bridge radio, five short blasts from the ships\' horns and long range acoustic noise maker devices, but received no response." The incident lasted almost an hour, until the Iranian vessels departed, and occurred about two weeks after the U.S. moved a carrier strike group out of the region. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group had departed the Middle East earlier in the month after operating in the region with the Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group, a rare occurrence for the Navy which has not had multiple strike groups in the region for years. On 19 April, the IRGC acknowledged that an incident took place, but dismissed the U.S. version of events. \c\cOn 22 April, in response to the 15 April incident, U.S. president Trump tweeted that he instructed the U.S. Navy to "shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats" if they harassed U.S. ships. Senior Pentagon officials said the tweet reflected a lawful order that would be implemented, though it did not mark a change in the rules of engagement. \c\cPresident Trump vetoed a Senate resolution on 6 May that would have required him to seek congressional authorization before taking military action against Iran. \c\cOn 7 May, the United States removed four Patriot missile batteries, two jet fighter squadrons and dozens of military personnel from Saudi Arabia while considering a reduction in the U.S. Navy presence in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. decision may have been related to the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war as it affected the U.S. oil prices. \c\cOn 10 May, the Iranian frigate Jamaran accidentally launched a Noor anti-ship missile at its support vessel, the Konarak, while the latter was deploying practice targets for a naval exercise. It was later determined that 19 sailors were killed and 15 injured. Some observers concluded that the Iranian friendly fire incident typified the ongoing instability in the Persian Gulf. Fabian Hinz of the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies, an expert on Iran's military, said the incident "... really showed that the situation with Iran is still dangerous because accidents and miscalculations can happen". \c\cOn 12 June, the United Nations concluded that the cruise missiles that struck the Saudi Aramco oil complex in September 2019 likely came from Iran. \c\cMeanwhile, on 19 June, the board of the UN's atomic watchdog agency adopted a resolution calling for Iran to provide inspectors access to sites where the country is thought to have stored or used undeclared nuclear material. \c\cOn 24 June, the U.S. imposed sanctions on five Iranian tanker captains for their links to the export of Iranian gasoline and gasoline components to Venezuela. \c\cOn 29 June, Iran issued an arrest warrant for U.S. president Donald Trump and 35 other individuals on "murder and terrorism charges" for the January drone strike on General Qasem Soleimani and requested international assistance in detaining him. Responding to Iran's request to issue a red notice, Interpol issued a statement that it could not comply as its charter prohibits "intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character." U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook dismissed the warrant as "a propaganda stunt that no one takes seriously and makes the Iranians look foolish." Analysts and commentators identified the issuance of the warrant as symbolic rather than a genuine attempt to arrest Trump. \c\cAlso on 29 June, a report by Al Arabiya released photo evidence of a wooden dhow carrying hundreds of reportedly Iranian weapons and other material bearing Persian language that was intercepted on 17 April. The dhow was found off the coast of Mocha, Yemen. \c\cSpecial representative Brian Hook visited Israel and Saudi Arabia and stated "Israel and the U.S. 'see eye to eye\' on the need to extend the UN conventional arms embargo [against Iran], warning that its expiration would allow it to export more arms to its regional proxies." On 30 June, Chinese ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun said during a virtual UN Security Council meeting the Trump administration could not initiate a Security Council mechanism to nullify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal by re-invoking the arms embargo, saying "Having quit the JCPOA, the U.S. is no longer a participant and has no right to trigger the snapback" of sanctions. Notably, German ambassador Christoph Heusgen concurred with the Chinese stance, though echoed the U.S. concern about "the expiration of these limitations" on Iran's ability to purchase weapons. \c\cOn 1 July, a fire and explosion hit a centrifuge production plant at a nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran. No deaths or injuries were reported. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz denied Israeli involvement, saying "Not every incident that transpires in Iran necessarily has something to do with us."\c\c"All those systems are complex, they have very high safety constraints and I\'m not sure they always know how to maintain them," Gantz told Israel Radio. \c\cOn 6 July, NEDSA commander Admiral Alireza Tangsiri claimed Iran had built offshore missile facilities and underground speedboat and "missile cities" along its southern coast. \c\cAlso on 6 July, the Mossad spy agency reportedly said it recently foiled planned or attempted Iranian attacks on Israeli diplomatic missions in Europe and elsewhere. \c\cOn 7 July, the United Nations Human Rights Council, led by special rapporteur Agnès Callamard, concluded that the killing of General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020 by U.S. forces was "unlawful". Callamard said that based on U.S. evidence, the killing was "arbitrary" and "violated the UN charter." "No evidence has been provided that General Soleimani specifically was planning an imminent attack against U.S. interests, particularly in Iraq, for which immediate action was necessary and would have been justified," Callamard wrote. On 21 July, Ayatollah Khamenei threatened that Iran would eventually conduct a reciprocal strike against the U.S. as further vengeance for the killing of Soleimani. \c\cOn 8 July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hinted at Iranian-links in the 6 July assassination of prominent Iraqi counter-terrorism expert Hisham al-Hashimi, highlighting threats made against him by Iranian-linked groups. \c\cOn 16 July, CNN reported the U.S. had "several" intelligence indications that Iran had put portions of its air defense system on "high alert" in recent days, following unexplained explosions at key facilities tied to the country's military and nuclear programs. On 18 July, according to Iranian media, a large explosion was heard in Ahvaz; further reports linked the explosion to an oil pipeline, though this was not officially confirmed. \c\cOn 24 July, two U.S. F-15 fighter jets briefly intercepted a Mahan Air passenger aircraft flying near a U.S. coalition garrison in Syria while en route from Tehran to Beirut. According to Iranian media and government officials, the intercepting F-15 made "provocative" and "dangerous" maneuvers, causing the airliner's pilot to abruptly lower altitude to avoid collision, injuring several passengers on board, with at least two taken to the hospital upon emergency landing. According to the U.S., however, the F-15s followed proper international procedure and were conducting a standard visual inspection of the airliner after it appeared "to have deviated from" an established commercial air corridor. The intercepting F-15 flew within 1,000-1,500 meters of the aircraft and then departed after identification, a U.S. official added. Iran demanded an international investigation in response to the incident and foreign minister Javad Zarif condemned the intercept and the American "occupation" in Syria as "lawlessness upon lawlessness". \c\cOn 26 July, satellite imagery revealed the IRGC Navy (IRGCN) had towed a replica U.S. Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, first revealed in 2014, from a naval base in Bandar Abbas to the Strait of Hormuz a day prior in preparation for annual live-fire drills similar to the 2015 Great Prophet IX exercise. Iranian officials and state media had yet to publicly acknowledge the development. The actual USS Nimitz entered the region the week prior to replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Arabian Sea after the latter's seven-month deployment. A spokeswoman for the United States Fifth Fleet, headquartered in Bahrain, commented that the fleet remained vigilant and questioned the "... tactical value they would hope to gain by using such a mock-up in a training or exercise scenario." U.S. special representative Brian Hook demanded Iran "spend more time on diplomacy and less time on military stunts". On 28 July, the IRGCN released footage of the drills, dubbed Great Prophet 14 (Great Prophet XIV), which included the mock carrier being assailed by commandos and a range of weaponry including limpet mines, anti-ship cruise missiles, truck-launched ballistic missiles, fast-attack speedboats, glide bombs, and, notably, Shahed 181 and 191 drones reportedly reverse engineered from the American RQ-170 drone captured by Iran in 2011. Iranian media also claimed the exercise was observed by its Nour military satellite launched in April 2020. \c\cOn 31 July, Pléiades commercial satellite imagery revealed Iran's mock carrier had inadvertently capsized while being towed on its way back to port in Bandar Abbas, listing at about 90 degrees with the starboard side facing upwards and "nearly half of the flight deck submerged" in shallow water just outside the harbor entrance, posing a navigation hazard near the main approach channel. Though regional U.S. forces detected the launch of ballistic missiles during Great Prophet XIV, according to Forbes, the satellite imagery did not appear to show extensive ballistic missile damage and, in fact, revealed less overall damage to the vessel than in Great Prophet IX, leaving "the impression that the IRGCN wanted to keep the mock carrier in better condition so it could be reused more easily in future exercises."\c\cOn 2 August, the Iranian foreign ministry announced they would put a sanction on Richard Goldberg. citing Law of "confrontation with human-rights violations and USA adventuresome and terrorist measures in the region". \c\cOn 6 August, China confirmed its support for United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 and affirmed it would veto any council proposal to extend the international Iran nuclear arms embargo, stopping a U.S.-led effort to do so. On 9 August, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) asked the UN to extend the arms embargo on Iran while, on 13 August, Saudi ambassador to the UN Abdul Aziz al-Wasel called for an embargo extension, arguing that Iran "smuggles weapons to militias to disturb the peace in the Middle East". On 15 August, the UNSC voted to deny extending the international arms embargo on Iran. Of the 15-member body, 11 members abstained while Russia and China opposed extension. \c\cLate on 12 August, the U.S. accused Iran of briefly seizing Liberian-flagged oil tanker MT Wila in the Gulf of Oman, with U.S. Central Command releasing video of apparent armed Iranian naval forces fast-roping from a Sea King helicopter and boarding the vessel. According to Coalition Task Force Sentinel, the operational arm of the IMSC maritime coalition, along with statements from an unidentified U.S. official, the seizure took place in international waters off the coast of the UAE's Khor Fakkan and the tanker was held for five hours before being released. The Wila did not make any distress calls before, during, or after the seizure and it was not immediately clear what cargo it carried or why it was seized. By 13 August, Iranian officials and state media had not publicly acknowledged the incident. \c\cOn 13 August, the U.S. seized Iranian fuel cargo for the first time. \c\cOn 13 August, UAE and Israel establish full bilateral diplomatic relations. \c\cOn 14 August, Khamenei again threatened retaliation against the U.S. for the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani.

The U.S. has threatened to sanction anyone who has dealings with Grace 1 and also expressed disappointment with the United Kingdom for allowing the ship to be released. \c\cMullah Krekar, the former leader of the Iraq-based insurgent group Ansar al-Islam, said that in a war between the U.S. and Iran, should the crisis evolve into one, he would support Iran—it would be similar to supporting Hezbollah in a war against Israel. \c\cMuqtada al-Sadr, a Shia cleric and leader of Peace Companies, in response to the ongoing tensions posted on Twitter, "War between Iran and the U.S. will be an end of Iraq," and in another instance said, "Any party that would drag Iraq into the war and turn it into a scene for conflict will be an enemy to the Iraqi people," and further stated his view of excluding Iraq from a potential war between the U.S. and Iran saying, "I\'m against dragging Iraq into this war and making it a scene for the Iranian-U.S. conflict"\c\c In ISIL's weekly online newspaper al-Naba the group's stance on the tensions between the U.S. and Iran was published, the group said it equally opposes both sides and criticized al-Qaeda for its alleged reliance on Iran and stated had it not been for al-Qaeda's past orders not to attack Iran while ISIL was part of al-Qaeda it would have attacked Iran earlier, and that ISIL would carry out attacks against the U.S. and Iran equally, the article ended with a supplication asking God to incite a war between Iran and the U.S. so it could bring victory for ISIL. \c\c Gibraltar refused U.S. requests to hold an Iranian oil tanker stating it would contradict the law of the European Union. In a statement the government said, "The EU sanctions regime against Iran—which is applicable in Gibraltar—is much narrower than that applicable in the U.S.," adding "The Gibraltar Central Authority is unable seek an Order of the Supreme Court of Gibraltar to provide the restraining assistance required by the United States of America."\c\c On 21 September 2019, the Syrian National Coalition which represents the Syrian Opposition and Syrian Interim Government released a statement after the Abqaiq–Khurais attack saying: "The Syrian National Coalition once again warns of the dangers of the inaction towards Iran's actions in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen and the wars it manages in the region directly or indirectly as well as its latest aggression against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." Adding "The coalition reaffirms it will continue to stand by the leadership and people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in its fight against terrorism as it extends its thanks and appreciation for the Kingdom's efforts and positions in support of the rights of the Syrian people and their legitimate demands."\c\c On the 18th anniversary of the 11 September attacks, al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a video commemorating the attacks claimed America had empowered Iran and that the two work together, saying, "It is ironic that Shi\'a militias were fighting in Iraq against the self-proclaimed Caliph, [Islamic State leader] Ibrahim al-Badri, with American air and artillery cover, and under the leadership and planning of American advisors. From the battlefield ..." adding "The point is that Iran has an understanding with the Americans in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. It only differs with them on the returns of this arrangement. At times it signs accords with them; when it is unsuitable for them, it continues its policy of blackmail."\c\cReza Pahlavi, heir to the defunct Empire of Iran, who is exiled in the U.S. said that he supported pressure on Iran and supported the killing of Soleimani "as a breakthrough that is positive for the region". He also said that the Iranian government would collapse "within months" due to the protests.
The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on Saturday 26 April 1986, at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history both in terms of cost and casualties, and is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. The initial emergency response, together with later decontamination of the environment, ultimately involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion Soviet rubles—roughly US$68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation. \c\cThe accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor. The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to help create a safety procedure for maintaining reactor cooling water circulation until the back-up electrical generators could provide power. Three such tests had been conducted since 1982, but they had failed to provide a solution. On this fourth attempt, an unexpected 10-hour delay meant that an unprepared operating shift was on duty. During the planned decrease of reactor power in preparation for the electrical test, the power unexpectedly dropped to a near-zero level. The operators were able to only partially restore the specified test power, which put the reactor in an unstable condition. This risk was not made evident in the operating instructions, so the operators proceeded with the electrical test. Upon test completion, the operators triggered a reactor shutdown, but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction instead. \c\cA large amount of energy was suddenly released, and two explosions ruptured the reactor core and destroyed the reactor building. One was a highly destructive steam explosion from the vaporising superheated cooling water; the other explosion could have been another steam explosion or a small nuclear explosion, akin to a nuclear fizzle. This was immediately followed by an open-air reactor core fire that released considerable airborne radioactive contamination for about nine days that precipitated onto parts of the USSR and western Europe, especially Belarus, 16 km away, where around 70% landed, before being finally contained on 4 May 1986. The fire gradually released about the same amount of contamination as the initial explosion. As a result of rising ambient radiation levels off-site, a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident. About 49,000 people were evacuated from the area, primarily from Pripyat. The exclusion zone was later increased to 30 kilometres (19 mi) when a further 68,000 people were evacuated from the wider area. \c\cThe reactor explosion killed two of the reactor operating staff. A massive emergency operation to put out the fire, stabilize the reactor, and cleanup the ejected nuclear core began. In the disaster and immediate response, 134 station staff and firemen were hospitalized with acute radiation syndrome due to absorbing high doses of ionizing radiation. Of these 134 people, 28 died in the days to months afterward and approximately 14 suspected radiation-induced cancer deaths followed within the next 10 years. Significant cleanup operations were taken in the exclusion zone to deal with local fallout, and the exclusion zone was made permanent. \c\cAmong the wider population, an excess of 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were documented as of 2011[update]. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) has, at multiple times, reviewed all the published research on the incident and found that at present, fewer than 100 documented deaths are likely to be attributable to increased exposure to radiation. Determining the total eventual number of exposure related deaths is uncertain based on the linear no-threshold model, a contested statistical model, which has also been used in estimates of low level radon and air pollution exposure. Model predictions with the greatest confidence values of the eventual total death toll in the decades ahead from Chernobyl releases vary, from 4,000 fatalities when solely assessing the three most contaminated former Soviet states, to about 9,000 to 16,000 fatalities when assessing the total continent of Europe. \c\cTo reduce the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and protect it from weathering, the protective Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus was built by December 1986. It also provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site, which continued operating. Due to the continued deterioration of the sarcophagus, it was further enclosed in 2017 by the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement, a larger enclosure that allows the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris, while containing the radioactive hazard. Nuclear clean-up is scheduled for completion in 2065. \c\cIn power-generating operation, most of the heat generated in a nuclear reactor by its fuel rods is derived from nuclear fission, but a significant fraction (over 6%) is derived from the radioactive decay  of the accumulated fission products; a process known as decay heat. This decay heat continues for some time after the fission chain reaction has been stopped, such as following a reactor shutdown, either emergency or planned, and continued pumped circulation of coolant is essential to prevent core overheating, or in the worst case, core meltdown. The RBMK reactors like those at Chernobyl use water as a coolant, circulated by electrically driven pumps. The coolant flow rate is considerable. Reactor No. 4 had 1661 individual fuel channels, each requiring a coolant flow of 28,000 litres (7,400 US gal) per hour at full reactor power. \c\cTo guard against an electrical power failure to the pumps, each of Chernobyl's reactors had three backup diesel generators, but they took 60–75 seconds to attain full speed and generate the 5.5‐megawatt output required to run one main pump. This delay was considered a significant safety risk. It had been theorized that the rotational momentum of a steam turbine could be used to generate the required electrical power to cover this gap. The turbine's speed would run down as energy was taken from it, but analysis indicated that there might be sufficient energy to provide electrical power to run the coolant pumps for 45 seconds. This would not quite bridge the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators, but would alleviate the situation. \c\cThe turbine run-down energy capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally, and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully. An initial test carried out in 1982 indicated that the excitation voltage of the turbine-generator was insufficient; it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip. The electrical system was modified, and the test was repeated in 1984 but again proved unsuccessful. In 1985, the test was conducted a third time but also yielded negative results. The test procedure was to be run again in 1986, and was scheduled to take place during a controlled power-down of reactor No. 4, which was preparatory to a planned maintenance outage. \c\cA test procedure had been written, but the authors were not aware of the unusual RBMK-1000 reactor behaviour under the planned operating conditions. It was regarded as purely an electrical test of the generator, not a complex unit test, even though it involved critical unit systems. According to the regulations in place at the time, such a test did not require approval by either the chief design authority for the reactor (NIKIET), or the Soviet nuclear safety regulator. The test required disabling of some safety systems (in particular, the emergency core cooling system, a passive/active system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a loss-of-coolant accident), and approval from the Chernobyl site chief engineer had been obtained according to regulations. \c\cThe experimental procedure was intended to run as follows:\c\cPreparation for the test. \c\cThe test would take place during a scheduled reactor shutdown\c\cThe reactor power was to be reduced to between 700 MW and 800 MW. (It was not necessary to perform the test from full-power operation, as only the electrical generator was being tested.)\c\cThe steam-turbine generator was to be run at normal operating speed\c\cThe electrical test\c\cWhen the correct conditions were achieved, the steam supply to the turbine generator would be closed off\c\cThe turbine generator performance would then be monitored to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators automatically started and provided power. \c\cWhen the emergency generators supplied electrical power, the turbine generator would be allowed to continue free-wheeling down. \c\cThe normal planned shut down procedure of the reactor was then to be completed\c\cThe test was to be conducted during the day-shift of 25 April 1986 as part of a scheduled reactor shut down. The day shift crew had been instructed in advance on the reactor operating conditions to run the test and in addition, a special team of electrical engineers was present to conduct the one-minute test of the new voltage regulating system once the correct conditions had been reached. As planned, a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit began at 01:06 on 25 April, and the power level had reached 50% of its nominal 3,200 MW thermal level by the beginning of the day shift. \c\cThe day shift performed many unrelated maintenance tasks, and was scheduled to perform the test at 14:15 and preparations for the test were carried out, including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system. Meanwhile, another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and at 14:00 the Kiev electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of Chernobyl's output be postponed, as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand. The Chernobyl plant director[citation needed] agreed, and postponed the test. \c\cSoon, the day shift was replaced by the evening shift. Despite the delay, the emergency core cooling system was left disabled—it was disconnected by a manual isolating slide valve which in practice meant that two or three people spent the whole shift manually turning sailboat-helm sized valve wheels. The system would have no influence on the events that unfolded next. Allowing the reactor to run for 11 hours outside of the test without emergency protection was indicative of a general lack of safety culture. \c\cAt 23:04, the Kiev grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume. This delay had some serious consequences: the day shift had long since departed, the evening shift was also preparing to leave, and the night shift would not take over until midnight, well into the job. According to plan, the test should have been finished during the day shift, and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise shut-down plant. \c\cThe night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment. Anatoly Dyatlov, deputy chief-engineer of the entire Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, was present to supervise and direct the experiment; as he out-ranked all other supervisory personnel present, his orders and instructions overrode any objections of other senior personnel present during the test and its preparation. Serving under Dyatlov, Aleksandr Akimov was chief of the night shift, and Leonid Toptunov was the operator responsible for the reactor's operational regimen, including the movement of the control rods. Toptunov was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months. \c\cThe test plan called for a gradual decrease in reactor power to a thermal level of 700–1000 MW and an output of 720 MW was reached at 00:05 on 26 April. However, due to the reactor's production of a fission byproduct, xenon-135, which is a reaction-inhibiting neutron absorber, power continued to decrease in the absence of further operator action; a process known as reactor poisoning. In steady-state operation, this is avoided because xenon-135 is "burned off" as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine-135 by the absorption of neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction, becoming highly stable xenon-136. With the reactor power reduced, previously produced high quantities of iodine-135 were decaying into the neutron-absorbing xenon-135 faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off. \c\cWhen the reactor power had decreased to approximately 500 MW, the reactor power control was switched to a different mode in order to manually maintain the required power level. Around that moment, the power suddenly fell into an unintended near-shutdown state, with a power output of 30 MW thermal or less. The exact circumstances that caused the power fall are unknown because Akimov died in hospital on 10 May and Toptunov on 14 May; early reports attributed it to Toptunov's mistake, but it has also been suggested it was due to an equipment failure. \c\cThe reactor was now producing only 5% of the minimum initial power level prescribed for the test. This low reactivity inhibited the burn-off of xenon-135 within the reactor core and hindered the rise of reactor power. Control-room personnel had to raise power by disconnecting most of the reactor control rods from the automatic control rod regulation system and manually extracted the majority of rods to their upper limits in order to promote reactivity and counteract the effect of the poisoning. Several minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point at which the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilized at 160–200 MW (thermal). \c\cThe operation of the reactor at the low power level (and high poisoning level) was accompanied by unstable core temperatures and coolant flow, and possibly by instability of neutron flux, which triggered alarms. The control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the steam/water separator drums, and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water, as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser, and from the neutron power controller. Between 00:35 and 00:45, emergency alarm signals concerning thermal-hydraulic parameters were ignored, apparently to preserve the reactor power level.[dubious  – discuss]\c\cWhen a power level of 200 MW was reattained, preparation for the experiment continued, although the power level was much lower than the prescribed 700 MW. As part of the test plan, extra water pumps were activated at 01:05, increasing the water flow. The increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core (the coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers), which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water, reducing the safety margin. \c\cThe flow exceeded the allowed limit at 01:19, triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators. At the same time, the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators. Since water absorbs neutrons better than steam, the neutron flux decreased and reduced the reactor power. The crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure, and by removing more manual control rods to maintain power. \c\cThe combined effect of these various actions was an extremely unstable reactor configuration. Nearly all of the 211 control rods had been extracted manually, including all but 18 of the "fail-safe" manually operated rods of the minimum 28 that were supposed to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant. While the emergency scram system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually (through the "AZ-5" switch), the automated system that would ordinarily do the same had been mostly disabled to maintain the power level, and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed. \c\cUnlike other light-water reactor designs, the RBMK design at that time had a positive void coefficient of reactivity at low power levels. This meant that the formation of steam bubbles (voids) from boiling cooling water intensified the nuclear chain reaction owing to voids having lower neutron absorption than water. The consequent power increase then produced more voids which further intensified the chain reaction, and so on in a positive feedback. Given this characteristic, reactor No. 4 was now at risk of a runaway increase in its core power with nothing to restrain it. \c\cThe reduction of reactor coolant pumping and the reduction of neutron absorbing control rods now left little safety margin. The reactor was now very sensitive to the regenerative effect of steam voids on reactor power. \c\cAt 01:23:04, the test began. Four of the eight main circulating pumps (MCP) were active, versus six under regular operation. The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator. The diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were to have completely picked up the MCPs\' power needs by 01:23:43. In the interim, the power for the MCPs was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down. As the momentum of the turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps. The water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids in the coolant flowing up through the fuel pressure tubes. \c\cAt 01:23:40, as recorded by the SKALA centralized control system, a scram (emergency shutdown) of the reactor was initiated as the experiment was wrapping up. The scram was started when the AZ-5 button (also known as the EPS-5 button) of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed: this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them, including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier. \c\cThe mechanism would be used even to routinely shut down the reactor after the experiment for the planned maintenance and the scram likely preceded the sharp increase in power. However, the precise reason why the button was pressed when it was is not certain, as only the deceased Akimov and Toptunov partook in that decision, though the atmosphere in the control room was calm at that moment. Meanwhile, the RBMK designers claim that the button had to have been pressed only after the reactor already began to self-destruct. \c\cWhen the AZ-5 button was pressed, the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began. The control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at 0.4 metres per second (1.3 ft/s), so that the rods took 18 to 20 seconds to travel the full height of the core, about 7 metres (23 ft). A bigger problem was the design of the RBMK control rods, each of which had a graphite neutron moderator section attached to its end to boost reactor output by displacing water when the control rod section had been fully withdrawn from the reactor, i.e. when a control rod was at maximum extraction, a neutron-moderating graphite extension was centered in the core with 1.25 metres (4.1 ft) columns of water above and below it. \c\cConsequently, injecting a control rod downward into the reactor in a scram initially displaced (neutron-absorbing) water in the lower portion of the reactor with (neutron-moderating) graphite. Thus, an emergency scram initially increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core. This behaviour had been discovered when the initial insertion of control rods in another RBMK reactor at Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in 1983 induced a power spike. Procedural countermeasures were not implemented in response to Ignalina. The UKAEA investigative report INSAG-7 later stated, "Apparently, there was a widespread view that the conditions under which the positive scram effect would be important would never occur. However, they did appear in almost every detail in the course of the actions leading to the (Chernobyl) accident."\c\cA few seconds into the scram, a power spike did occur and the core overheated, causing some of the fuel rods to fracture, blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at one-third insertion, with the graphite water-displacers still in the lower part of the core. Within three seconds the reactor output rose above 530 MW. \c\cThe subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments; it has been reconstructed through mathematical simulation. Per the simulation, the power spike would have caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup, leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure. This caused the fuel cladding to fail, releasing the fuel elements into the coolant, and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located. \c\cAs the scram continued, the reactor output jumped to around 30,000 MW thermal, 10 times its normal operational output, the indicated last reading on the power meter on the control panel. Some estimate the power spike may have gone 10 times higher than that. It was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building, but a steam explosion, like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure, appears to have been the next event. There is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the reactor's exterior cooling structure that caused the explosion that destroyed the reactor casing, tearing off and blasting the upper plate called the upper biological shield, to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened, through the roof of the reactor building. This is believed to be the first explosion that many heard. \c\cThis explosion ruptured further fuel channels, as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber, and as a result, the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core. The total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the reactor's thermal power. \c\cA second, more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first; this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction. This explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator. The ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air, greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas. \c\cAccording to observers outside Unit 4, burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor. Some of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire. About 25% of the red-hot graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected. Parts of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building. As a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core. The air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire. \c\cAfter the larger explosion, a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage. One such survivor, Alexander Yuvchenko, recounts that once he stepped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall, he saw a "very beautiful" laser-like beam of blue light caused by the ionized-air glow that appeared to "flood up into infinity". \c\cThere were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion. One view was that the second explosion was caused by the combustion of hydrogen, which had been produced either by the overheated steam-zirconium reaction or by the reaction of red-hot graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Another hypothesis, by Konstantin Checherov, published in 1998, was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core. A third hypothesis was that the second explosion was another steam explosion. According to this version, the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop, causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam; this second explosion then caused the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building. \c\cContrary to safety regulations, bitumen, a combustible material, had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall. Ejected material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor No. 3, which was still operating. It was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor No. 3. Inside reactor No. 3, the chief of the night shift, Yuri Bagdasarov, wanted to shut down the reactor immediately, but chief engineer Nikolai Fomin would not allow this. The operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working. At 05:00, Bagdasarov made his own decision to shut down the reactor. \c\cShortly after the accident, at 01:45, firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires. First on the scene was a Chernobyl Power Station firefighter brigade under the command of Lieutenant Volodymyr Pravyk, who died on 9 May 1986 of acute radiation sickness. They were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were, and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire: "We didn\'t know it was the reactor. No one had told us."\c\cGrigorii Khmel, the driver of one of the fire engines, later described what happened:\c\cAnatoli Zakharov, a fireman stationed in Chernobyl since 1980, offered a different description in 2008: "I remember joking to the others, \'There must be an incredible amount of radiation here. We\'ll be lucky if we\'re all still alive in the morning.\'" He also stated: "Of course we knew! If we\'d followed regulations, we would never have gone near the reactor. But it was a moral obligation—our duty. We were like kamikaze."\c\cThe immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing Reactor No. 4 to protect No. 3 and keep its core cooling systems intact. The fires were extinguished by 5:00, but many firefighters received high doses of radiation. The fire inside reactor No. 4 continued to burn until 10 May 1986; it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out. \c\cIt was thought by some that the core fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping more than 5,000 tonnes (5,500 short tons) of sand, lead, clay, and neutron-absorbing boron onto the burning reactor. It is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core. Historians estimate that about 600 Soviet pilots risked dangerous levels of radiation to fly the thousands of flights needed to cover reactor No. 4 in this attempt to seal off radiation. \c\cFrom eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died (as reported on the CBC television series Witness), one described his experience of the radiation as "tasting like metal", and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face. (This is consistent to the description given by Louis Slotin, a Manhattan Project physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident.)\c\cThe explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products, radioactive isotopes such as caesium-137, iodine-131, strontium-90, and other radionuclides, into the air. The residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion. \c\cThe ionizing radiation levels in the worst-hit areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be 5.6 roentgens per second (R/s), equivalent to more than 20,000 roentgens per hour. A lethal dose is around 500 roentgens (~5 Gray (Gy) in modern radiation units) over five hours, so in some areas, unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute. However, a dosimeter capable of measuring up to 1,000 R/s was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building, and another one failed when turned on. All remaining dosimeters had limits of 0.001 R/s and therefore read "off scale". Thus, the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above 0.001 R/s (3.6 R/h), while the true levels were much higher in some areas. \c\cBecause of the inaccurate low readings, the reactor crew chief Aleksandr Akimov assumed that the reactor was intact. The evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored, and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by 04:30 were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective. Akimov stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning, sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor. None of them wore any protective gear. Most, including Akimov, died from radiation exposure within three weeks. \c\cThe nearby city of Pripyat was not immediately evacuated. The townspeople, in the early hours of the morning, at 01:23 local time, went about their usual business, completely oblivious to what had just happened. However, within a few hours of the explosion, dozens of people fell ill. Later, they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths, along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting.[better source needed] As the plant was run by authorities in Moscow, the government of Ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident. \c\cValentyna Shevchenko, then Chairwoman of the Presidium of Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR, recalls that Ukraine's acting Minister of Internal Affairs Vasyl Durdynets phoned her at work at 09:00 to report current affairs; only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but it was extinguished and everything was fine. When Shevchenko asked "How are the people?", he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about: "Some are celebrating a wedding, others are gardening, and others are fishing in the Pripyat River". \c\cShevchenko then spoke over the phone to Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, general secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine and de facto head of state, who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by Boris Shcherbina, the deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. \c\cA commission was established later in the day to investigate the accident. It was headed by Valery Legasov, First Deputy Director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, and included leading nuclear specialist Evgeny Velikhov, hydro-meteorologist Yuri Izrael, radiologist Leonid Ilyin, and others. They flew to Boryspil International Airport and arrived at the power plant in the evening of 26 April. By that time two people had already died and 52 were hospitalized. The delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure. In the early daylight hours of 27 April, approximately 36 hours after the initial blast, they ordered the evacuation of Pripyat. Initially it was decided to evacuate the population for three days; later this was made permanent. \c\cBy 11:00 on 27 April, buses had arrived in Pripyat to start the evacuation. The evacuation began at 14:00. A translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows:\c\cTo expedite the evacuation, residents were told to bring only what was necessary, and that they would remain evacuated for approximately three days. As a result, most personal belongings were left behind, and remain there today. By 15:00, 53,000 people were evacuated to various villages of the Kiev region. The next day, talks began for evacuating people from the 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) zone. Ten days after the accident, the evacuation area was expanded to 30 kilometres (19 mi). The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Exclusion Zone has remained ever since, although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded. \c\cThe surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in 135,000 long-term evacuees in total agreeing to be moved. The years between 1986 and 2000 saw the near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled persons from the most severely contaminated areas to approximately 350,000. \c\cEvacuation began one and a half days before the accident was publicly acknowledged by the Soviet Union. In the morning of 28 April, radiation levels set off alarms at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant in Sweden, over 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) from the Chernobyl Plant. Workers at Forsmark reported the case to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, which determined that the radiation had originated elsewhere. That day, the Swedish government contacted the Soviet government to inquire about whether there had been a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union. The Soviets initially denied it, and it was only after the Swedish government suggested they were about to file an official alert with the International Atomic Energy Agency, that the Soviet government admitted that an accident had taken place at Chernobyl. \c\cAt first, the Soviets only conceded that a minor accident had occurred, but once they began evacuating more than 100,000 people, the full scale of the situation was realized by the global community. At 21:02 the evening of 28 April, a 20-second announcement was read in the TV news programme Vremya: "There has been an accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. One of the nuclear reactors was damaged. The effects of the accident are being remedied. Assistance has been provided for any affected people. An investigative commission has been set up."\c\cThis was the entire announcement, and the first time the Soviet Union officially announced a nuclear accident. The Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) then discussed the Three Mile Island accident and other American nuclear accidents, which Serge Schmemann of The New York Times wrote was an example of the common Soviet tactic of whataboutism. The mention of a commission, however, indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident, and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music, which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy. \c\cAround the same time, ABC News released its report about the disaster. Shevchenko was the first of the Ukrainian state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on 28 April. There she spoke with members of medical staff and people, who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes. Shevchenko returned home near midnight, stopping at a radiological checkpoint in Vilcha, one of the first that were set up soon after the accident. \c\cThere was a notification from Moscow that there was no reason to postpone the 1 May International Workers\' Day celebrations in Kiev (including the annual parade), but on 30 April a meeting of the Political bureau of the Central Committee of the CPSU took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration. Scientists were reporting that the radiological background level in Kiev was normal. At the meeting, which was finished at 18:00, it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular three and a half to four hours to under two hours. Several buildings in Pripyat were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant. These included the Jupiter factory which closed in 1996 and the Azure Swimming Pool, used by the Chernobyl liquidators for recreation during the clean-up, which closed in 1998. \c\cTwo floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe; the third floor above them, below the reactor, served as a steam tunnel. The steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water. After the disaster, the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water, thus constituting a serious steam explosion risk. \c\cThe smoldering graphite, fuel and other material above, at more than 1,200 °C (2,190 °F), started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining, creating corium, a radioactive semi-liquid material comparable to lava. If this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water, it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor. It became necessary to drain the pool. \c\cThe bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates. The valves controlling it, however, were located in a flooded corridor. Volunteers in wetsuits and respirators (for protection against radioactive aerosols), and equipped with dosimeters, entered the knee-deep radioactive water and managed to open the valves. These were the engineers Alexei Ananenko and Valeri Bezpalov (who knew where the valves were), accompanied by the shift supervisor Boris Baranov. Upon succeeding, all risk of a further steam explosion was eliminated. All three men were awarded the Order For Courage by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in May 2018. \c\cResearch by Andrew Leatherbarrow, author of Chernobyl 01:23:40, determined that the frequently recounted story that suggests that all three men died just days after the incident is false. Alexei Ananenko continues to work in the nuclear energy industry, and rebuffs the growth of the Chernobyl media sensationalism surrounding him. While Valeri Bezpalov was found to still be alive by Leatherbarrow, Baranov had died of heart failure in 2005 at age 65. \c\cOnce the bubbler pool gates were opened by the Ananenko team, fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement. The operation was not completed until 8 May, after 20,000 tonnes (20,000 long tons; 22,000 short tons) of water were pumped out.[citation needed]\c\cWith the bubbler pool gone, a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion. To do so, the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor. To reduce the likelihood of this, it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor, which would also stabilize the foundations. Using oil well drilling equipment, the injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May. It was estimated that 25 tonnes of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at −100 °C (−148 °F). This idea was soon scrapped. \c\cAs an alternative, coal miners were deployed to excavate a tunnel below the reactor to make room for a cooling system. The final makeshift design for the cooling system was to incorporate a coiled formation of pipes cooled with water and covered on top with a thin thermally conductive graphite layer. The graphite layer as a natural refractory material would rapidly cool the suspected molten uranium oxide without it burning through. This graphite cooling plate layer was to be encapsulated between two concrete layers, each one meter thick for stabilisation. This system was designed by Leonid Bolshov, the director of the Institute for Nuclear Safety and Development formed in 1988. Bolshov's graphite-concrete "sandwich" would be similar in concept to later core catchers that are now part of many nuclear reactor designs. \c\cBolshov's graphite cooling plate, alongside the prior nitrogen injection proposal, were not used following the drop in aerial temperatures and indicative reports that the fuel melt had stopped. It was later determined that the fuel had passed through three storeys before coming to rest in one of a number of basement rooms. The precautionary underground channel with its active cooling was therefore deemed redundant, as the fuel was self-cooling. The excavation was then simply filled with concrete to strengthen the foundation below the reactor. \c\cIn the months after the explosion attention turned to removing the radioactive debris from the roof. While the worst of the radioactive debris had remained inside what was left of the reactor, it was estimated that there was approximately 100 tons of debris on that roof which had to be removed to enable the safe construction of the 'sarcophagus\'—a concrete structure that would entomb the reactor and reduce radioactive dust being released into the atmosphere. The initial plan was to use robots to clear the debris off the roof. The Soviets used approximately 60 remote-controlled robots, most of them built in the Soviet Union itself. Many failed due to the effect of high levels of radiation on their electronic controls; in 1987, Valery Legasov, first deputy director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow, said: "We learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything. Where there was very high radiation, the robot ceased to be a robot—the electronics quit working."\c\cConsequently, the most highly radioactive materials were shoveled by Chernobyl liquidators from the military wearing heavy protective gear (dubbed "bio-robots" by the military); these soldiers could only spend a maximum of 40–90 seconds working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris. Though the soldiers were only supposed to perform the role of the "bio-robot" a maximum of once, some soldiers reported having done this task five or six times.[citation needed] Only 10% of the debris cleared from the roof was performed by robots; the other 90% removed by approximately 5,000 men who absorbed, on average, an estimated dose of 25 rem (250 mSv) of radiation each. \c\cWith the extinguishing of the open air reactor fire, the next step was to prevent the spread of contamination. This could be due to wind action which could carry away loose contamination, and by birds which could land within the wreckage and then carry contamination elsewhere. In addition, rainwater could wash contamination away from the reactor area and into the sub-surface water table, where it could migrate outside the site area. Rainwater falling on the wreckage could also weaken the remaining reactor structure by accelerating corrosion of steelwork. A further challenge was to reduce the large amount of emitted gamma radiation, which was a hazard to the workforce operating the adjacent reactor No. 3.[citation needed]\c\cThe solution chosen was to enclose the wrecked reactor by the construction of a huge composite steel and concrete shelter, which became known as the "Sarcophagus". It had to be erected quickly and within the constraints of high levels of ambient gamma radiation. The design started on 20 May 1986, 24 days after the disaster, and construction was from June to late November. This major construction project was carried out under the very difficult circumstances of high levels of radiation both from the core remnants and the deposited radioactive contamination around it. The construction workers had to be protected from radiation, and techniques such as crane drivers working from lead-lined control cabins were employed. The construction work included erecting walls around the perimeter, clearing and surface concreting the surrounding ground to remove sources of radiation and to allow access for large construction machinery, constructing a thick radiation shielding wall to protect the workers in reactor No. 3, fabricating a high-rise buttress to strengthen weak parts of the old structure, constructing an overall roof, and provisioning a ventilation extract system to capture any airborne contamination arising within the shelter.[citation needed]\c\cDuring the construction of the sarcophagus, a scientific team, as part of an investigation dubbed "Complex Expedition", re-entered the reactor to locate and contain nuclear fuel to prevent another explosion. These scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core. Rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes. The scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust. \c\cIn December 1986, after six months of investigation, the team discovered with the help of a remote camera that an intensely radioactive mass more than two metres wide had formed in the basement of Unit Four. The mass was called "the elephant's foot" for its wrinkled appearance. It was composed of melted sand, concrete, and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor. The concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot, and was breached by now-solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite. It was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion. \c\cThe official contaminated zones saw a massive clean-up effort lasting seven months. The official reason for such early (and dangerous) decontamination efforts, rather than allowing time for natural decay, was that the land must be repopulated and brought back into cultivation. Indeed, within fifteen months 75% of the land was under cultivation, even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled. Defence forces must have done much of the work. Yet this land was of marginal agricultural value. According to historian David Marples, the administration had a psychological purpose for the clean-up: they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy, and even to restart the Chernobyl power station. \c\cAlthough a number of radioactive emergency vehicles were buried in trenches, many of the vehicles used by the liquidators, including the helicopters, still remained, as of 2018, parked in a field in the Chernobyl area. Scavengers have since removed many functioning, but highly radioactive, parts. Liquidators worked under deplorable conditions, poorly informed and with poor protection. Many, if not most of them, exceeded radiation safety limits. \c\cThe urban decontamination liquidators first washed buildings and roads with "Bourda", a sticky polymerizing fluid, designed to entrain radioactive dust and, when dry, could then be peeled off and compacted into configurations, akin to carpet rolls, in preparation for burial.[dubious  – discuss][better source needed]\c\cA unique "clean up" medal was given to the clean-up workers, known as "liquidators". \c\cTo investigate the causes of the accident the IAEA used the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG), which had been created by the IAEA in 1985. It produced two significant reports on Chernobyl; INSAG-1 in 1986, and a revised report, INSAG-7 in 1992. In summary, according to INSAG-1, the main cause of the accident was the operators\' actions, but according to INSAG-7, the main cause was the reactor's design. \c\cBoth IAEA reports identified an inadequate "safety culture" (INSAG-1 coined the term) at all managerial and operational levels as a major underlying factor of different aspects of the accident. This was stated to be inherent not only in operations but also during design, engineering, construction, manufacture and regulation. \c\cViews of the main causes were heavily lobbied by different groups, including the reactor's designers, power plant personnel, and the Soviet and Ukrainian governments. This was due to the uncertainty about the actual sequence of events and plant parameters. After INSAG-1 more information became available, and more powerful computing has allowed better forensic simulations. \c\cThe INSAG-7 conclusion of major factors contributory to the accident was:\c\cThe first Soviet official explanation of the accident was by means of presentations from leading Soviet scientists and engineers to a large number of representatives from IAEA member states and other international organisations at the first Post-Accident Review Meeting, held at the IAEA in Vienna between 25 and 29 August 1986. This explanation effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators. The IAEA INSAG-1 report followed shortly afterwards in September 1986, and on the whole also supported this view, based also on the information provided in discussions with the Soviet experts at the Vienna review meeting. In this view, the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations. For instance; "During preparation and testing of the turbine generator under run-down conditions using the auxiliary load, personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise."\c\cIt was stated that at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off, most notably the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), LAR (Local Automatic control system), and AZ (emergency power reduction system). Personnel had an insufficient understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor, and knowingly ignored regulations to expedite the electrical test completion. Several procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible, one of which was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the test. The main process computer, SKALA, was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power. Normally the computer would have started to insert all of the control rods. The computer would have also started the "Emergency Core Protection System" that introduces 24 control rods into the active zone within 2.5 seconds, which is still slow by 1986 standards. All control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators. \c\cIt was held that the designers of the reactor considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis, namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures. Thus the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff. \c\cOn the disconnection of safety systems, Valery Legasov said in 1987, "It was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight."\c\cIn this analysis the operators were blamed, but deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually. This view was reflected in numerous publications and artistic works on the theme of the Chernobyl accident that appeared immediately after the accident, and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications. \c\cThe trial took place from 7 to 30 July 1987 in a temporary courtroom set up in the House of Culture in the city of Chernobyl, Ukraine. Five plant employees (Anatoly S. Dyatlov, the former deputy chief engineer; Viktor P. Bryukhanov, the former plant director; Nikolai M. Fomin, the former chief engineer; Boris V. Rogozhin, the shift director of Reactor 4; and Aleksandr P. Kovalenko, the chief of Reactor 4); and Yuri A. Laushkin (Gosatomenergonadzor [USSR State Committee on Supervision of Safe Conduct of Work in Atomic Energy] inspector) were sentenced to ten, ten, ten, five, three, and two years respectively in labor camps.  The families of Aleksandr Akimov, Leonid Toptunov and Valery Perevozchenko had received official letters, but prosecution against the employees had been terminated at their deaths. \c\cAnatoly Dyatlov was found guilty "of criminal mismanagement of potentially explosive enterprises" and sentenced to ten years imprisonment—of which he would serve three—for the role that his oversight of the experiment played in the ensuing accident. \c\cIn 1991 a Commission of the USSR State Committee for the Supervision of Safety in Industry and Nuclear Power reassessed the causes and circumstances of the Chernobyl accident and came to new insights and conclusions. Based on that, INSAG published an additional report, INSAG-7, which reviewed "that part of the INSAG-1 report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident," and this included the text of the 1991 USSR State Commission report translated into English by the IAEA as Annex I. \c\cBy the time of this report, Ukraine had declassified a number of KGB documents from the period between 1971 and 1988 related to the Chernobyl plant. It mentioned, for example, previous reports of structural damage caused by negligence during construction of the plant (such as splitting of concrete layers) that were never acted upon. They documented more than 29 emergency situations in the plant during this period, eight of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel. \c\cIn the INSAG-7 report, most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous, being based on incorrect information obtained in August 1986, or less relevant. The INSAG-7 report also reflected the view of the 1991 USSR State Commission account which held that the operators\' actions in turning off the Emergency Core Cooling System, interfering with the settings on the protection equipment, and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude, although they may have been a breach of regulations. In fact, turning off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations.  Soviet authorities had identified a multitude of operator actions as regulation violations in the original 1986 report while no such regulations were in fact in place. \c\cThe primary design cause of the accident, as determined by INSAG-7, was a major deficiency in safety features, in particular the "positive scram" effect due to the control rods\' graphite tips that actually initially increased reactivity when control rods entered the core to reduce reactivity. There was also an overly positive void coefficient of the reactor, whereby steam-generated voids in the fuel cooling channels would increase reactivity because neutron absorption was reduced, resulting in more steam generation, and thereby more voids; a regenerative process. To avoid such conditions, it was necessary for the operators to track the value of the reactor operational reactivity margin (ORM) but this value was not readily available to the operators and they were not aware of the safety significance of ORM on void and power coefficients. \c\cHowever, regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity. Yet "post-accident studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the ORM is reflected in the Operating Procedures and design documentation for the RBMK-1000 is extremely contradictory", and furthermore, "ORM was not treated as an operational safety limit, violation of which could lead to an accident". \c\cEven in this revised analysis, the human factor remained identified as a major factor in causing the accident; particularly the operating crew's deviation from the test programme. "Most reprehensibly, unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot, although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test." This included operating the reactor at a lower power level than the prescribed 700 MW before starting the electrical test. The 1986 assertions of Soviet experts notwithstanding, regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level. \c\cINSAG-7 also said, "The poor quality of operating procedures and instructions, and their conflicting character, put a heavy burden on the operating crew, including the chief engineer. The accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture, not only at the Chernobyl plant, but throughout the Soviet design, operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time."\c\cIn summary, the major factors were:\c\cThe reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity. The void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant. Most other reactor designs have a negative coefficient, i.e. the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant, since as the steam voids increase, fewer neutrons are slowed down. Faster neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms, so the reactor produces less power (negative feedback effect). \c\cChernobyl's RBMK reactor, however, used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons, and the cooling water acted as a neutron absorber. Thus neutrons are moderated by the graphite even if steam bubbles form in the water. Furthermore, because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water, increasing the voids means that more moderated neutrons are able to split uranium atoms, increasing the reactor's power output. This was a positive feedback regenerative process which makes the RBMK design very unstable at low power levels, and prone to sudden energy surges to a dangerous level. Not only was this behaviour counter-intuitive, this property of the reactor under certain extreme conditions was unknown to the crew. \c\cThere was a significant flaw in the design of the control rods that were inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction rate by neutron absorption. In the RBMK design, the bottom tip of each control rod was made of graphite and was 1.3 metres (4.3 ft) shorter than necessary. Only the upper part of the rod was made of boron carbide, which absorbs neutrons and thereby slows the reaction. With this design, when a rod was inserted from the fully retracted position, the graphite tip displaced neutron-absorbing water, initially causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed and increasing reactivity. For the first few seconds of rod deployment, reactor core power was therefore increased, rather than reduced. This feature of control rod operation was counter-intuitive and not known to the reactor operators. \c\cOther deficiencies were noted in the RBMK-1000 reactor design, as were its non-compliance with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety. While INSAG-1 and INSAG-7 reports both identified operator error as an issue of concern, the INSAG-7 identified that there were numerous other issues that were contributing factors that led to the incident. These contributing factors include:\c\cThe plant was not designed to safety standards in effect and incorporated unsafe features\c\c"Inadequate safety analysis" was performed\c\cThere was "insufficient attention to independent safety review"\c\c"Operating procedures not founded satisfactorily in safety analysis"\c\cSafety information not adequately and effectively communicated between operators, and between operators and designers\c\cThe operators did not adequately understand safety aspects of the plant\c\cOperators did not sufficiently respect formal requirements of operational and test procedures\c\cThe regulatory regime was insufficient to effectively counter pressures for production\c\cThere was a "general lack of safety culture in nuclear matters at the national level as well as locally"\c\cThe force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released after the accident led Yuri V. Dubasov in 2009 to theorise that the second explosion could have been an extremely fast nuclear power transient resulting from core material melting in the absence of its water coolant and moderator. Dubasov argued that there was no delayed supercritical increase in power but a runaway prompt criticality which would have developed much faster. He felt the physics of this would be more similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon, and it produced the second explosion. \c\cHis evidence came from Cherepovets, Vologda Oblast, Russia, 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) northeast of Chernobyl, where physicists from the V.G. Khlopin Radium Institute measured anomalous high levels of xenon-135—a short half-life isotope—four days after the explosion. This meant that a nuclear event in the reactor may have ejected xenon to higher altitudes in the atmosphere than the later fire did, allowing widespread movement of xenon to remote locations. This was an alternative to the more accepted explanation of a positive-feedback power excursion where the reactor disassembled itself by steam explosion. \c\cThe more energetic second explosion, which produced the majority of the damage, was estimated by Dubasov in 2009 as equivalent to 40 billion joules of energy, the equivalent of about 10 tons of TNT. Both his 2009 and 2017 analyses argue that the nuclear fizzle event, whether producing the second or first explosion, consisted of a prompt chain reaction that was limited to a small portion of the reactor core, since self-disassembly occurs rapidly in fizzle events. \c\cDubasov's nuclear fizzle hypothesis was examined in 2017 by physicist Lars-Erik De Geer who put the hypothesized fizzle event as the more probable cause of the first explosion. \c\cDe Geer commented:\c\cAlthough it is difficult to compare releases between the Chernobyl accident and a deliberate air burst nuclear detonation, it has still been estimated that about four hundred times more radioactive material was released from Chernobyl than by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki together. However, the Chernobyl accident only released about one hundredth to one thousandth of the total amount of radioactivity released during nuclear weapons testing at the height of the Cold War; the wide estimate being due to the different abundances of isotopes released. At Chernobyl approximately 100,000 square kilometres (39,000 sq mi) of land was significantly contaminated with fallout, with the worst hit regions being in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Lower levels of contamination were detected over all of Europe except for the Iberian Peninsula. \c\cThe initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from Soviet sources, but from Sweden. On the morning of 28 April, workers at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant (approximately 1,100 km (680 mi) from the Chernobyl site) were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes. \c\cIt was Sweden's search for the source of radioactivity, after they had determined there was no leak at the Swedish plant, that at noon on 28 April, led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western Soviet Union. Hence the evacuation of Pripyat on 27 April 36 hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the Soviet Union. The rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in Finland, but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication. \c\cContamination from the Chernobyl accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions, much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the Alps, the Welsh mountains and the Scottish Highlands, where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall. The resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized, and localised water-flows contributed to large variations in radioactivity over small areas. Sweden and Norway also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front, bringing rain. There was also groundwater contamination. \c\cRain was deliberately seeded over 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) of the Belorussian SSR by the Soviet air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas. Heavy, black-coloured rain fell on the city of Gomel. Reports from Soviet and Western scientists indicate that Belarus received about 60% of the contamination that fell on the former Soviet Union. However, the 2006 TORCH report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. A large area in Russia south of Bryansk was also contaminated, as were parts of northwestern Ukraine. Studies in surrounding countries indicate that more than one million people could have been affected by radiation. \c\cRecently published data from a long-term monitoring program (The Korma Report II) shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in Belarus close to Gomel. Resettlement may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules. \c\cIn Western Europe, precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included banning the importation of certain foods. In France officials stated that the Chernobyl accident had no adverse effects.[incomplete short citation]\c\cThe Chernobyl release was characterised by the physical and chemical properties of the radio-isotopes in the core. Particularly dangerous were the highly radioactive fission products, those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain, such as some of the isotopes of iodine, caesium and strontium. Iodine-131 was and caesium-137 remains the two most responsible for the radiation exposure received by the general population. \c\cDetailed reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in 1989 and 1995, with the latter report updated in 2002. \c\cAt different times after the accident, different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose. The remaining quantity of any radioisotope, and therefore the activity of that isotope, after 7 decay half-lives have passed, is less than 1% of its initial magnitude, and it continues to reduce beyond 0.78% after 7 half-lives to 0.10% remaining after 10 half-lives have passed and so on. Some radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive, which is not accounted for here. The release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points, and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor. \c\cAll of the noble gases, including krypton and xenon, contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion. The atmospheric release of xenon-133, with a half-life of 5 days, is estimated at 5200 PBq. \c\c50 to 60% of all core radioiodine in the reactor, about 1760 PBq (1760×1015 becquerels), or about 0.4 kilograms (0.88 lb), was released, as a mixture of sublimed vapour, solid particles, and organic iodine compounds. Iodine-131 has a half-life of 8 days. \c\c20 to 40% of all core caesium-137 was released, 85 PBq in all. Caesium was released in aerosol form; caesium-137, along with isotopes of strontium, are the two primary elements preventing the Chernobyl exclusion zone being re-inhabited. 8.5×1016 Bq equals 24 kilograms of caesium-137. Cs-137 has a half-life of 30 years. \c\cTellurium-132, half-life 78 hours, an estimated 1150 PBq was released. \c\cAn early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was 3±1.5%; this was later revised to 3.5±0.5%. This corresponds to the atmospheric emission of 6 tonnes (5.9 long tons; 6.6 short tons) of fragmented fuel. \c\cTwo sizes of particles were released: small particles of 0.3 to 1.5 micrometres, each an individually unrecognizable small dust or smog sized particulate matter and larger settling dust sized particles that therefore were quicker to fall-out of the air, of 10 micrometres in diameter. These larger particles contained about 80% to 90% of the released high boiling point or non-volatile radioisotopes; zirconium-95, niobium-95, lanthanum-140, cerium-144 and the transuranic elements, including neptunium, plutonium and the minor actinides, embedded in a uranium oxide matrix. \c\cThe dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open. The exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope, requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis and whole body count exams, of which 16,000 were conducted in Ukraine by Soviet medical personnel in 1987. \c\cThe Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the Pripyat River, which feeds into the Dnieper reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in Europe, which at the time supplied water to Kiev's 2.4 million residents, and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred. The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident. \c\cIn the most affected areas of Ukraine, levels of radioactivity (particularly from radionuclides 131I, 137Cs and 90Sr) in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident. Guidelines for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to 3,700 Bq/L, allowing most water to be reported as safe. Officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom "in an insoluble phase" and would not dissolve for 800–1000 years.[better source needed]\c\cA year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the Chernobyl plant's cooling pond was within acceptable norms. Despite this, two months after the disaster the Kiev water supply was switched from the Dnieper to the Desna River.[better source needed] Meanwhile, massive silt traps were constructed, along with an enormous 30-metre (98 ft) deep underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the Pripyat River.[better source needed]\c\cGroundwater was not badly affected by the Chernobyl accident since radionuclides with short half-lives decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies, and longer-lived radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater. However, significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the 30 km (19 mi) exclusion zone around Chernobyl. Although there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites off-site (i.e. out of the 30 km (19 mi) exclusion zone), the IAEA Chernobyl Report argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of surface-deposited radioactivity. \c\cBio-accumulation of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations (both in western Europe and in the former Soviet Union) that in many cases were significantly[vague] above guideline maximum levels for consumption. Guideline maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately 1000 Bq/kg in the European Union. In the Kiev Reservoir in Ukraine, concentrations in fish were in the range of 3000 Bq/kg during the first few years after the accident. \c\cIn small "closed" lakes in Belarus and the Bryansk region of Russia, concentrations in a number of fish species varied from 100 to 60,000 Bq/kg during the period 1990–92. The contamination of fish caused short-term concern in parts of the UK and Germany and in the long term (years rather than months) in the affected areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia as well as in parts of Scandinavia. \c\cChernobyl's radiocaesium deposits were used to calibrate sedimentation samples from Lake Qattinah, Arabic: بحيرة قطينة in Syria. The 13755Cs provides a sharp, maximal, data point in radioactivity of the core sample at the 1986 depth, and acts as a date check on the depth of the 21082Pb in the core sample. \c\cAfter the disaster, four square kilometres (1.5 sq mi) of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned reddish-brown and died, earning the name of the "Red Forest". Some animals in the worst-hit areas also died or stopped reproducing. Most domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone, but horses left on an island in the Pripyat River 6 km (4 mi) from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of 150–200 Sv. Some cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage. The next generation appeared to be normal. \c\cOn farms in Narodychi Raion of Ukraine it is claimed that from 1986 to 1990 nearly 350 animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs, missing eyes, heads or ribs, or deformed skulls; in comparison, only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior.[better source needed]\c\cWith radiocaesium binding less with humic acid, peaty soils than the known binding "fixation" that occurs on kaolinite rich clay soils, many marshy areas of Ukraine had the highest soil to dairy-milk transfer coefficients, of soil activity in ~ 200 kBq/m2 to dairy milk activity in Bq/L, that had ever been reported, with the transfer, from initial land activity into milk activity, ranging from 0.3−2 to 20−2 times that which was on the soil, a variance depending on the natural acidicity-conditioning of the pasture. \c\cIn 1987, Soviet medical teams conducted some 16,000 whole-body count examinations on inhabitants in otherwise comparatively lightly contaminated regions with good prospects for recovery. This was to determine the effect of banning local food and using only food imports on the internal body burden of radionuclides in inhabitants. Concurrent agricultural countermeasures were used when cultivation did occur, to further reduce the soil to human transfer as much as possible. The expected highest body activity was in the first few years, where the unabated ingestion of local food, primarily milk consumption, resulted in the transfer of activity from soil to body; after the dissolution of the USSR, the now-reduced scale initiative to monitor the human body activity in these regions of Ukraine, recorded a small and gradual half-decadal-long rise, in internal committed dose, before returning to the previous trend of observing ever lower body counts each year. \c\cThis momentary rise is hypothesized to be due to the cessation of the Soviet food imports together with many villagers returning to older dairy food cultivation practices and large increases in wild berry and mushroom foraging, the latter of which have similar peaty soil to fruiting body, radiocaesium transfer coefficients. \c\cIn a 2007 paper, a robot sent into the reactor itself returned with samples of black, melanin-rich radiotrophic fungi that grow on the reactor's walls. \c\cOf the 440,350 wild boar killed in the 2010 hunting season in Germany, approximately one thousand were contaminated with levels of radiation above the permitted limit of 600 becquerels of caesium per kilogram, of dry weight, due to residual radioactivity from Chernobyl. While all animal meat contains a natural level of potassium-40 at a similar level of activity, with both wild and farm animals in Italy containing "415 ± 56 becquerels kg−1 dw" of that naturally occurring gamma emitter. \c\cThe caesium contamination issue has historically reached some uniquely isolated and high levels approaching 20,000 Becquerels of caesium per kilogram in some specific tests; however, it has not been observed in the wild boar population of Fukushima after the 2011 accident. Evidence exists to suggest that the wild German and Ukrainian boar population are in a unique location were they have subsisted on a diet high in plant or fungi sources that biomagnifies or concentrates radiocaesium, with the most well known food source the consumption of the outer shell or wall of the "deer-truffle" elaphomyces which, along with magnifying radiocaesium, also magnifies or concentrates natural soil concentrations of arsenic. \c\cIn 2015, long-term empirical data showed no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance. \c\cOn high ground, such as mountain ranges, there is increased precipitation due to adiabatic cooling. This resulted in localized concentrations of contaminants on distant areas; higher in Bq/m2 values to many lowland areas much closer to the source of the plume. This effect occurred on high ground in Norway and the UK. \c\cThe Norwegian Agricultural Authority reported that in 2009 a total of 18,000 livestock in Norway required uncontaminated feed for a period before slaughter, to ensure that their meat had an activity below the government permitted value of caesium per kilogram deemed suitable for human consumption. This contamination was due to residual radioactivity from Chernobyl in the mountain plants they graze on in the wild during the summer. 1,914 sheep required uncontaminated feed for a time before slaughter during 2012, with these sheep located in only 18 of Norway's municipalities, a decrease from the 35 municipalities in 2011 and the 117 municipalities affected during 1986. \c\cThe after-effects of Chernobyl on the mountain lamb industry in Norway were expected to be seen for a further 100 years, although the severity of the effects would decline over that period. Scientists report this is due to radioactive caesium-137 isotopes being taken up by fungi such as Cortinarius caperatus which is in turn eaten by sheep while grazing. \c\cThe United Kingdom restricted the movement of sheep from upland areas when radioactive caesium-137 fell across parts of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and northern England. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster in 1986, the movement of a total of 4,225,000 sheep was restricted across a total of 9,700 farms, to prevent contaminated meat entering the human food chain. The number of sheep and the number of farms affected has decreased since 1986. Northern Ireland was released from all restrictions in 2000, and by 2009, 369 farms containing around 190,000 sheep remained under the restrictions in Wales, Cumbria, and northern Scotland. The restrictions applying in Scotland were lifted in 2010, while those applying to Wales and Cumbria were lifted during 2012, meaning no farms in the UK remain restricted because of Chernobyl fallout. \c\cThe legislation used to control sheep movement and compensate farmers (farmers were latterly compensated per animal to cover additional costs in holding animals prior to radiation monitoring) was revoked during October and November 2012, by the relevant authorities in the UK. Had restrictions in the UK not occurred, a heavy consumer of lamb meat would likely have received a dose of 4.1 mSv over a lifetime. \c\cIn the accident's aftermath, 237 people suffered from acute radiation sickness, of whom 31 died within the first three months. In 2005, the Chernobyl Forum, composed of the International Atomic Energy Agency, other UN organizations, and the governments of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the Chernobyl accident. In September 1987, the I.A.E.A. held an Advisory Group Meeting at the Curie Institute in Paris on the medical handling of the skin lesions relating to the acute deaths. \c\cThe only known, causal deaths from the accident involved workers in the plant and firefighters. In reporter Grigori Medvedev's book on the accident, there were a number of fishermen on the reservoir a half-kilometer from the reactor to the east. Of these, two shore fishermen, Protosov and Pustavoit, are said to have sustained doses estimated at 400 roentgens, vomited, but survived. The vast majority of Pripyat residents slept through the distant sound of the explosion, including station engineer Breus, who only became aware at 6am, the beginning of his next work shift. He would later be taken to hospital and, while there, made the acquaintance of one teen who had ventured out alone by bicycle to watch the roof fires during the night, stopping for a time and viewing the scene at the "Bridge of Death" 51°23′42′′N 30°04′10′′E\ufeff / \ufeff51.3949°N 30.0695°E\ufeff / 51.3949; 30.0695\ufeff (Bridge of Death), however contrary to this sensationalist label, the youthful night biker was treated and released from hospital, remaining in touch with Breus as of 2019. \c\cWith the exception of plant employee Shashenock, injured by the blast and never fully regaining consciousness, all serious cases of ARS were treated by the world specialist Dr. Robert Peter Gale,\c\cwho documented a first of its kind treatment. In 2019, Gale would write a letter to correct the popularised, though egregious, portrayal of his patients as dangerous to visitors. All those who died were station operators and firefighters, over half of which from the continued wearing of dusty soaked uniforms, causing beta burns to cover large areas of skin. In the first few minutes to days, (largely due to Np-239, a 2.4-day half-life) the beta-to-gamma energy ratio is some 30:1, though while adding to the dose, no proximate deaths would be from the gamma fraction of exposure. Instead, owing to the large area of burned skin, bacterial infection was and remains the overarching concern to those afflicted with ARS, as a leading cause of death, quarantine from the outside environment is a part of the normal treatment protocol. Many of the surviving firefighters, continue to have skin that is atrophied, spider veined with underlying fibrosis due to experiencing extensive beta burns. \c\cThe eventual medical report states that 28 people died from acute radiation syndrome over the following days to months. In the years afterward, 15 people have died from thyroid cancer; it is roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by Chernobyl may reach a total of about 4,000 among the five million persons residing in the contaminated areas. The report projected cancer mortality "increases of less than one percent" (~0.3%) on a time span of 80 years, cautioning that this estimate was "speculative" since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the Chernobyl disaster. The report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs. The report says it represents the consensus view of the eight UN organizations. \c\cOf all 66,000 Belarusian emergency workers, by the mid-1990s their government reported that only 150 (roughly 0.2%) died. In contrast, in the much larger work force from Ukraine, numbered in the hundreds of thousands, some 5,722 casualties from a host of non-accident causes, were reported among Ukrainian clean-up workers up to the year 1995, by the National Committee for Radiation Protection of the Ukrainian Population. \c\cThe four most harmful radionuclides spread from Chernobyl were iodine-131, caesium-134, caesium-137 and strontium-90, with half-lives of 8.02 days, 2.07 years, 30.2 years and 28.8 years respectively. The iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes, because of its short half-life, but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems. Strontium, on the other hand, is the least volatile of the four and is of main concern in the areas near Chernobyl itself. Iodine tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands, leading, among other things, to increased incidence of thyroid cancers. The total ingested dose was largely from iodine and, unlike the other fission products, rapidly found its way from dairy farms to human ingestion. Similarly in dose reconstruction, for those evacuated at different times and from various towns, the inhalation dose was dominated by iodine (40%), along with airborne tellurium (20%) and oxides of rubidium (20%) both as equally secondary, appreciable contributors. \c\cLong term hazards such as caesium tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart, while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to bone-marrow and lymphocytes. Radiation is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing. In adult mammals cell division is slow, except in hair follicles, skin, bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract, which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness. \c\cBy the year 2000, the number of Ukrainians claiming to be radiation 'sufferers\' (poterpili) and receiving state benefits had jumped to 3.5 million, or 5% of the population. Many of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current Chernobyl plant workers. There was and remains a motivated \'push\' to achieve 'sufferer\' status as it gives access to state benefits and medical services that would otherwise not be made available. According to IAEA-affiliated scientific bodies, the apparent increases of ill health in this large group result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor health-care and nutrition; also, they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident, particularly a heightened overdiagnosis due to the Screening effect, has meant that many benign cases that would previously have gone unnoticed and untreated (especially of cancer) are now being registered. \c\cThe World Health Organization states, "children conceived before or after their father's exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies". This statistically insignificant increase was also seen by independent researchers analyzing the children of the Chernobyl liquidators. \c\cThe two primary individuals involved with the attempt to suggest that the mutation rate among animals was, and continues to be, higher in the Chernobyl zone, are the Anders Moller and Timothy Mousseau group. Apart from continuing to publish experimentally unrepeatable and discredited papers, Mousseau routinely gives talks at the Helen Caldicott organized symposiums for "Physicians for Social Responsibility", an anti-nuclear advocacy group devoted to bring about a "nuclear free planet". Moreover, in years past, Moller was previously caught and reprimanded for publishing papers that crossed the scientific "misconduct"/"fraud" line. The duo have more recently attempted to publish meta-analyses, in which the primary references they weigh-up, analyze and draw their conclusions from is their own prior papers along with the discredited book Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment. \c\cIn 1996, geneticist colleagues Ronald Chesser and Robert Baker published a paper on the thriving vole population within the exclusion zone, in which the central conclusion of their work was essentially that "The mutation rate in these animals is hundreds and probably thousands of times greater than normal". This claim occurred after they had done a comparison of the mitochondrial DNA of the "Chernobyl voles" with that of a control group of voles from outside the region. These alarming conclusions led the paper to appear on the front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. However, not long after publication, Chesser & Baker discovered a fundamental error in the interpretation of their data, and despite only the authors recognizing the error in which they had incorrectly classified the species of vole and therefore were comparing the genetics of two entirely different vole species to start with, the team made the decision to issue a retraction. \c\cFollowing the accident, journalists mistrusted many medical professionals (such as the spokesman from the UK National Radiological Protection Board), and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them. Throughout the European continent, due to this media-driven framing of the contamination, many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from Chernobyl, including an increased number of abortions in Denmark in the months following the accident. \c\cIn Greece, following the accident, many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation. Although it was determined that the effective dose to Greeks would not exceed one mSv (100 mrem), a dose much lower than that which it was determined would induce embryonic abnormalities or other non-stochastic effects, there was an observed 2,500 increase of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated, probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk. A slightly above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in Italy. \c\cWorldwide, an estimated excess of about 150,000 elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of fears of radiation from Chernobyl, according to Robert Baker and ultimately a 1987 article published by Linda E. Ketchum in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine which mentions but does not reference an IAEA source on the matter. \c\cThe available statistical data excludes the Soviet–Ukraine–Belarus abortion rates, as they are presently unavailable. From the available data, an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in Denmark occurred in the months following the accident, at a rate of about 400 cases. In Greece, there was an observed 2,500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated. In Italy, a "slightly" above the expected number of induced abortions occurred, approximately 100. \c\cNo evidence of changes in the prevalence of human deformities/birth congenital anomalies that might be associated with the accident are apparent in Belarus or Ukraine, the two republics that had the highest exposure to fallout. In Sweden and in Finland where no increase in abortion rates occurred, it was likewise determined that "no association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations [was found]." A similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined by assessing the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry. Findings were also mirrored in Austria. Larger "mainly western European" data sets, approaching a million births in the EUROCAT database, divided into "exposed" and control groups were assessed in 1999. As no Chernobyl impacts were detected, the researchers conclude "in retrospect, the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified". Despite studies from Germany and Turkey, the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects, in Greece, Denmark, Italy etc., due to the anxieties that were created. \c\cIn very high doses, it was known at the time that radiation could cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies, but unlike the dominant linear no-threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases, it was known, by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing, that the "Malformation of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose" below which, no rate increase is observed. This teratology (birth defects) issue was discussed by Frank Castronovo of the Harvard Medical School in 1999, publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the Chernobyl accident, inclusive of data from Kiev's two largest obstetrics hospitals. Castronovo concludes that "the lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects" is, together with dubious studies that show selection bias, the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that Chernobyl increased the background rate of birth defects. When the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this perception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations, no in-utero individuals would have been expected to have received a threshold dose. \c\cStudies of low statistical significance on some of the most contaminated and proximal regions of Ukraine and Belarus, tentatively argue with some 50 children who were irradiated by the accident in utero during weeks 8 to 25 of gestation had an increased rate of mental retardation, lower verbal IQ, and possibly other negative effects. These findings may be due to confounding factors or annual variations in random chance. \c\cThe Chernobyl liquidators, essentially an all-male civil defense emergency workforce, would go on to father normal children, without an increase in developmental anomalies or a statistically significant increase in the frequencies of germline mutations in their progeny. This normality is similarly seen in the children of the survivors of the Goiânia accident. \c\cA report by the International Atomic Energy Agency examines the environmental consequences of the accident. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident "equivalent on average to 21 additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation"; individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed, including 530,000 primarily male recovery workers (the Chernobyl liquidators) who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra 50 years of typical natural background radiation exposure each. \c\cEstimates of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously; disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify mortality—whether the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide, and whether the deaths are immediate, short term, or long term. In 1994, thirty-one deaths were directly attributed to the accident, all among the reactor staff and emergency workers. \c\cThe Chernobyl Forum predicts that the eventual death toll could reach 4,000 among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation (200,000 emergency workers, 116,000 evacuees and 270,000 residents of the most contaminated areas); this figure is a total causal death toll prediction, combining the deaths of approximately 50 emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome, 15 children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of 3,935 deaths from radiation-induced cancer and leukaemia. \c\cIn a peer-reviewed paper in the International Journal of Cancer in 2006, the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of Europe (but following a different conclusion methodology to the Chernobyl Forum study, which arrived at the total predicted death toll of 4,000 after cancer survival rates were factored in) they stated, without entering into a discussion on deaths, that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident:\c\cTwo anti-nuclear advocacy groups have publicized non-peer-reviewed estimates that include mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation. The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) calculated that, among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide, there will be an eventual 50,000 excess cancer cases, resulting in 25,000 excess cancer deaths, excluding thyroid cancer. However, these calculations are based on a simple linear no-threshold model multiplication and the misapplication of the collective dose, which the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) states "should not be done" as using the collective dose is "inappropriate to use in risk projections". \c\cAlong similar lines to the UCS approach, the 2006 TORCH report, commissioned by the European Greens political party, likewise simplistically calculates an eventual 30,000 to 60,000 excess cancer deaths in total, around the globe. \c\cYet the death rate from thyroid cancer has remained the same as prior to the technology. For these and other reasons, it is suggested that no reliable increase has been detected in the environs of Chernobyl, that cannot otherwise be explained as an artifact of the globally well documented Screening effect. \c\cIn 2004, the UN collaborative, Chernobyl Forum, revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the Chernobyl accident. This is due to the ingestion of contaminated dairy products, along with the inhalation of the short-lived, highly radioactive isotope, Iodine-131. In that publication, more than 4,000 cases of childhood thyroid cancer were reported. It is important to note that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia. It said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected population. The WHO's Radiation Program reported that the 4,000 cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths. \c\cAccording to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, up to the year 2005, an excess of more than 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer had been reported. That is, over the estimated pre-accident baseline thyroid cancer rate, more than 6,000 casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident, a number that is expected to increase. They concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure. \c\cWell-differentiated thyroid cancers are generally treatable, and when treated the five-year survival rate of thyroid cancer is 96%, and 92% after 30 years. the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation had reported 15 deaths from thyroid cancer in 2011. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities, or solid cancers—such as lung cancer—corroborating the assessments by the UN committee. UNSCEAR raised the possibility of long term genetic defects, pointing to a doubling of radiation-induced minisatellite mutations among children born in 1994. However, the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the Chernobyl accident is still high according to published studies. \c\cThe German affiliate of the anti-nuclear energy organization, the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War suggest that 10,000 people are affected by thyroid cancer as of 2006, and that 50,000 cases are expected in the future. \c\cFred Mettler, a radiation expert at the University of New Mexico, puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at perhaps 5,000, for a total of 9,000 Chernobyl-associated fatal cancers, saying "the number is small (representing a few percent) relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer, but the numbers are large in absolute terms". The same report outlined studies based on data found in the Russian Registry from 1991 to 1998 that suggested that "of 61,000 Russian workers exposed to an average dose of 107 mSv about [five percent] of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure". \c\cThe report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation. According to the IAEA the "designation of the affected population as "victims" rather than "survivors" has led them to perceive themselves as helpless, weak and lacking control over their future". The IAEA says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects. \c\cFred Mettler commented that 20 years later: "The population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding. A number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex. To reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years, although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise." In addition, disadvantaged children around Chernobyl suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the Chernobyl accident, but also to the poor state of post-Soviet health systems. \c\cThe United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), part of the Chernobyl Forum, have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects. UNSCEAR was set up as a collaboration between various United Nation bodies, including the World Health Organization, after the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to assess the long-term effects of radiation on human health. \c\cThe number of potential deaths arising from the Chernobyl disaster is heavily debated. The World Health Organization's prediction of 4,000 future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the Linear no-threshold model (LNT), which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose. Radiation epidemiologist Roy Shore contends that estimating health effects in a population from the LNT model "is not wise because of the uncertainties". \c\cAccording to the Union of Concerned Scientists the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide (including all contaminated areas) is approximately 27,000 based on the same LNT. \c\cAnother study critical of the Chernobyl Forum report was commissioned by Greenpeace, which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine the accident could have resulted in 10,000–200,000 additional deaths in the period between 1990 and 2004. The Scientific Secretary of the Chernobyl Forum criticized the report's reliance on non-peer-reviewed locally produced studies. Although most of the study's sources were from peer-reviewed journals, including many Western medical journals, the higher mortality estimates were from non-peer-reviewed sources, while Gregory Härtl (spokesman for the WHO) suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology. \c\cChernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment is a 2007 Russian publication that concludes that there were 985,000 premature deaths as a consequence of the radioactivity released. The results were criticized by M. I. Balonov from the Institute of Radiation Hygiene in St. Petersburg, who described them as biased, drawing from sources that were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base. Balanov expressed his opinion that "the authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the Russian-language publications, for example, to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions". \c\cAccording to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission member and Professor of Health Physics Kenneth Mossman, the "LNT philosophy is overly conservative, and low-level radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed." Yoshihisa Matsumoto, a radiation biologist at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which DNA repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage. Mossman suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a "prudent public health policy". \c\cAnother significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the Chernobyl accident. Since 1991, large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care, on socio-economic stability, and the manner in which statistical data is collected. Ronald Chesser, a radiation biologist at Texas Tech University, says that "the subsequent Soviet collapse, scarce funding, imprecise dosimetry, and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability". \c\cIt is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster. According to Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union spent 18 billion rubles (the equivalent of US$2.5 billion at that time, or $5.11 billion in today's dollars) on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself. In 2005, the total cost over 30 years for Belarus which includes the monthly payments to liquidators, was estimated at US$235 billion; about $305 billion in today's dollars given inflation rates. Gorbachev in April 2006 wrote "The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl 20 years ago this month, even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union."\c\cOngoing costs are well known; in their 2003–2005 report, The Chernobyl Forum stated that between five and seven percent of government spending in Ukraine is still related to Chernobyl, while in Belarus more than $13 billion is thought to have been spent between 1991 and 2003, with 22% of national budget having been Chernobyl-related in 1991, falling to six percent by 2002. In 2018, Ukraine spent five to seven percent of its national budget on recovery activities related to the Chernobyl disaster. Overall economic loss is estimated at $235 billion in Belarus. Much of the current cost relates to the payment of Chernobyl-related social benefits to some seven million people across the three countries. \c\cA significant economic impact at the time was the removal of 784,320 ha (1,938,100 acres) of agricultural land and 694,200 ha (1,715,000 acres) of forest from production. While much of this has been returned to use, agricultural production costs have risen due to the need for special cultivation techniques, fertilizers and additives. Politically, the accident gave great significance to the new Soviet policy of glasnost, and helped forge closer Soviet–US relations at the end of the Cold War, through bioscientific cooperation. The disaster also became a key factor in the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a major influence in shaping the new Eastern Europe.[additional citation(s) needed]\c\cBoth Ukraine and Belarus, in their first months of independence, lowered legal radiation thresholds from the Soviet Union's previous, elevated thresholds (from 35 rems per lifetime under the USSR to 7 rems per lifetime in Ukraine and 0.1 rems per year in Belarus). \c\cMany Ukrainians viewed the Chernobyl disaster as another attempt by Russians to destroy them, comparable to the Holodomor. \c\cFollowing the accident, questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate. All work on the unfinished reactors No. 5 and No. 6 was halted three years later. However, the trouble at the Chernobyl plant did not end with the disaster in reactor No. 4. The damaged reactor was sealed off and 200 cubic meters (260 cu yd) of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational buildings.[citation needed] The work was managed by Grigoriy Mihaylovich Naginskiy, the deputy chief engineer of Installation and Construction Directorate – 90. The Ukrainian government allowed the three remaining reactors to continue operating because of an energy shortage in the country.[citation needed]\c\cIn October 1991, a fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor No. 2; the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair, and it was taken offline. Reactor No. 1 was decommissioned in November 1996 as part of a deal between the Ukrainian government and international organizations such as the IAEA to end operations at the plant. On 15 December 2000, then-President Leonid Kuchma personally turned off reactor No. 3 in an official ceremony, shutting down the entire site. \c\cSoon after the accident, the reactor building was quickly encased by a mammoth concrete sarcophagus in a notable feat of construction under severe conditions. Crane operators worked blindly from inside lead-lined cabins taking instructions from distant radio observers, while gargantuan-sized pieces of concrete were moved to the site on custom-made vehicles. The purpose of the sarcophagus was to stop any further release of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, mitigate damage should the core go critical and explode, and provide safety for the continued operations of adjacent reactors one through three. \c\cThe concrete sarcophagus was never intended to last very long, with a lifespan of only 30 years. On 12 February 2013, a 600 m2 (6,500 sq ft) section of the roof of the turbine-building collapsed, adjacent to the sarcophagus, causing a new release of radioactivity and temporary evacuation of the area. At first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow, however the amount of snow was not exceptional, and the report of a Ukrainian fact-finding panel concluded that the collapse was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure. Experts warned the sarcophagus itself was on the verge of collapse. \c\cIn 1997, the international Chernobyl Shelter Fund was founded to design and build a more permanent cover for the unstable and short-lived sarcophagus. It received more than €810 million and was managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The new shelter was named the New Safe Confinement and construction began in 2010. It is a metal arch 105 metres (344 ft) high and spanning 257 metres (843 ft) built on rails adjacent to the reactor No. 4 building so that it could be slid over the top of the existing sarcophagus. The New Safe Confinement was completed in 2016 and slid into place over top the sarcophagus on 29 November. The huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks. Unlike the original sarcophagus, the New Safe Confinement is designed to allow the reactor to be safely dismantled using remotely operated equipment. \c\cUsed fuel from units 1–3 was stored in the units\' cooling ponds, and in an interim spent fuel storage facility pond, ISF-1, which now holds most of the spent fuel from units 1–3, allowing those reactors to be decommissioned under less restrictive conditions. Approximately 50 of the fuel assemblies from units 1 and 2 were damaged and required special handling. Moving fuel to ISF-1 was thus carried out in three stages: fuel from unit 3 was moved first, then all undamaged fuel from units 1 and 2, and finally the damaged fuel from units 1 and 2. Fuel transfers to ISF-1 were completed in June 2016. \c\cA need for larger, longer-term radioactive waste management at the Chernobyl site is to be fulfilled by a new facility designated ISF-2. This facility is to serve as dry storage for used fuel assemblies from units 1–3 and other operational wastes, as well as material from decommissioning units 1–3 (which will be the first RBMK units decommissioned anywhere). \c\cA contract was signed in 1999 with Areva NP (now Framatome) for construction of ISF-2. In 2003, after a significant part of the storage structures had been built, technical deficiencies in the design concept became apparent. In 2007, Areva withdrew and Holtec International was contracted for a new design and construction of ISF-2. The new design was approved in 2010, work started in 2011, and construction was completed in August 2017. \c\cISF-2 is the world's largest nuclear fuel storage facility, expected to hold more than 21,000 fuel assemblies for at least 100 years. The project includes a processing facility able to cut the RBMK fuel assemblies and to place the material in canisters, to be filled with inert gas and welded shut. The canisters are then to be transported to dry storage vaults, where the fuel containers will be enclosed for up to 100 years. Expected processing capacity is 2,500 fuel assemblies per year. \c\cAccording to official estimates, about 95% of the fuel in reactor No. 4 at the time of the accident (about 180 tonnes (180 long tons; 200 short tons)) remains inside the shelter, with a total radioactivity of nearly 18 million curies (670 PBq). The radioactive material consists of core fragments, dust, and lava-like "fuel containing materials" (FCM)—also called "corium"—that flowed through the wrecked reactor building before hardening into a ceramic form. \c\cThree different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building: black, brown, and a porous ceramic. The lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them. The porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly. It is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity. From 1997 to 2002, a series of published papers suggested that the self-irradiation of the lava would convert all 1,200 tonnes (1,200 long tons; 1,300 short tons) into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks. \c\cIt has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow, gradual process, rather than sudden and rapid. The same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only 10 kg (22 lb) per year; this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment. The paper also states that when the shelter is improved, the leaching rate of the lava will decrease. \c\cAn area originally extending 30 kilometres (19 mi) in all directions from the plant is officially called the "zone of alienation." The area has largely reverted to forest, and has been overrun by wildlife because of a lack of competition with humans for space and resources. \c\cSome sources have given estimates for when the site would be considered habitable again:\c\c320 years or less (Ukraine state authorities, c. 2011)\c\c20,000 years or more (Chernobyl director Ihor Gramotkin, c. 2016)\c\cTens of thousands of years (Greenpeace, March 2016)\c\c3,000 years (Christian Science Monitor, 2016)\c\cAs of 2016[update], 187 locals had returned and were living permanently in the zone. \c\cIn 2011, Ukraine opened up the sealed zone around the Chernobyl reactor to tourists who wish to learn more about the tragedy that occurred in 1986. Sergii Mirnyi, a radiation reconnaissance officer at the time of the accident, and now an academic at National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, has written about the psychological and physical effects on survivors and visitors, and worked as an advisor to Chernobyl tourism groups. \c\cDuring the dry seasons, a perennial concern is forests that have been contaminated by radioactive material catching on fire. The dry conditions and build-up of debris make the forests a ripe breeding ground for wildfires. Depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions, the fires could potentially spread the radioactive material further outwards from the exclusion zone in the smoke. In Belarus, the Bellesrad organization is tasked with overseeing the food cultivation and forestry management in the area. \c\cIn April 2020, forest fires spread through the exclusion zone reaching over 20,000 ha and caused an increase of radiation resulting from release of caesium-137 and strontium-90 from the ground and biomass at levels that were detectable by the monitoring network but did not pose any threat to human health. The average dose of radiation for residents of Kyiv as a result of the fires was estimated at 1 nSv. \c\cThe Chernobyl Trust Fund was created in 1991 by the United Nations to help victims of the Chernobyl accident. It is administered by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which also manages strategy formulation, resources mobilization, and advocacy efforts. Beginning 2002, under the United Nations Development Programme, the fund shifted its focus from emergency assistance to long-term development. \c\cThe Chernobyl Shelter Fund was established in 1997 at the Denver 23rd G8 summit to finance the Shelter Implementation Plan (SIP). The plan calls for transforming the site into an ecologically safe condition by means of stabilization of the sarcophagus followed by construction of a New Safe Confinement (NSC). While the original cost estimate for the SIP was US$768 million, the 2006 estimate was $1.2 billion. The SIP is being managed by a consortium of Bechtel, Battelle, and Électricité de France, and conceptual design for the NSC consists of a movable arch, constructed away from the shelter to avoid high radiation, to be slid over the sarcophagus. The NSC was moved into position in November 2016 and is expected to be completed in late-2017. \c\cIn 2003, the United Nations Development Programme launched the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP) for the recovery of the affected areas. The programme was initiated in February 2002 based on the recommendations in the report on Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident. The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the Government of Ukraine in mitigating long-term social, economic, and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: Kyivska, Zhytomyrska, Chernihivska and Rivnenska. \c\cMore than 18,000 Ukrainian children affected by the disaster have been treated at Cuba's Tarará resort town since 1990. 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first cases in Malaysia were confirmed among travellers from China in Johor via Singapore on 25 January. While the outbreak was initially limited to imported cases, several local clusters emerged in March 2021. The most notable was a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering in Kuala Lumpur, which cause a massive spike in local cases and imported cases in neighbouring countries. By the end of March, the total number of cases had risen from 30 to a staggering 2,000 active cases across every state and federal territory in the country. \c\cIn response to rising cases, the Malaysian Government led by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin imposed a nationwide lockdown known as Movement Control Order, which came into effect on 18 March 2020. By early May, these MCO lockdowns had led to a gradual decline in daily infections. In response, the Malaysian Government progressively relaxed lockdown restrictions in a staggered phase; beginning with the  "Conditional Movement Control Order" (CMCO) on 1 May, followed by the "Recovery Movement Control Order" (RMCO) on 10 June. The Malaysian government had planned to end RMCO at the end of August but because of the continuous detection of imported cases, measures were extended until the end of the year. \c\cA third wave of COVID-19 infections occurred as a result of the Sabah state election in September 2020 and a number of outbreaks at Top Glove facilities in late 2020. In response to a sharp rise in cases nationwide throughout late 2020 and early 2021, the Malaysian government reinstated CMCO and RMCO restrictions in most states. By January 2021, the crippling effect of COVID-19 on the country's healthcare system led to the reintroduction of MCO restrictions across the various Malaysian states and federal territories, which was extended to 18 February and then 4 March 2021. A nationwide state of emergency was also declared on 12 January 2021 by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to curb COVID-19 spread, hence suspending Parliament and State Legislative assemblies and granting the Muhyiddin government emergency powers until 1 August 2021. \c\cDue to a decline in new cases by early March, MCO restrictions were lifted in most states and federal territories. Since mid-April 2021, due to the increase in the number of daily infection cases in several states, MCO restrictions were reinstated in the states of Kelantan and Sabah by late April 2021 followed by most of Kedah and Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, parts of Johor, Terengganu, Perak, Penang and Pahang in early May 2021. \c\cAt over 440,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, over 37,000 active cases, and over 1,600 deaths, the country ranks third in the number of cases behind Indonesia, and the Philippines and fourth in the number of deaths in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar. \c\cThe Ministry of Health originally referred to this disease as the "2019 Novel Coronavirus". Some media referred this disease as the "Wuhan Coronavirus". During the onset of the outbreak, the Malaysian media called it the "radang paru-paru Wuhan" in Malay, meaning "Wuhan Pneunomia". Then some media changed the name to "radang paru-paru koronavirus baru" (new coronavirus pneumonia) in Malay. The Ministry of Health and most media now refer to the disease as "COVID-19", as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020. \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cUnlike the SARS outbreak of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cMalaysia reported its first three cases on 25 January 2020, all of whom were Chinese nationals who had visited the country. By 30 January, the number of cases had risen to eight. In response, the Ministry of Health published guidelines on the virus and established designated hospitals in all of Malaysia's states and federal territories to manage any positive cases. Local authorities also advised Malaysians traveling to China to stay away from animal farms and markets in that country. Following several earlier suspected cases involving Chinese nationals, the Sabah and Sarawak state governments suspended all direct flights with China. \c\cIn response to a surge of cases originating in South Korea, the Malaysian Government imposed a ban on visitors from South Korea on 26 February, including foreign nationals who had visited Daegu and Cheongdo. Malaysia experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases following a four-day Tablighi Jamaat event that was held at Kuala Lumpur's "Masjid Jamek Sri Petaling" between 27 February and 1 March 2020. By 20 March, 48% of the country's COVID-19 cases (3,347) had been linked to the Sri Petaling tabligh cluster. In response to the rise in cases nationally, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that Malaysia would enter into lockdown on 18 March 2020. On 17 March, Malaysia reported its first two deaths from the coronavirus: a 60-year-old priest from Emmanuel Baptist Church in Kuching, Sarawak and a 34-year-old participant of the Muslim religious gathering in Sri Petaling from Johor Bahru, Johor. \c\cOn 3 April, a spike in 217 new cases was reported, bringing the total number to 3,333. The Director-General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah attributed this spike to active detection in areas affected by Enhanced Movement Controlled Order, a stricter version of the MCO. In response to rising cases, the Government extended the movement control order until 28 April. \c\cOn 1 May, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that the country's lockdown would be eased on 4 May, allowing most businesses to reopen while maintaining a ban on mass gatherings. From 21 May, a spike of cases occurred among detainees at immigration detention centres in Bukit Jalil and Semenyih, Selangor, causing the number of cases to rise to a total of 7,819 cases by 31 May. On 22 May, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin entered into quarantine for 14 days after an official who attended a post-Cabinet briefing the previous day tested positive for COVID-19. \c\cOn 1 June, a total of 7,857 cases were reported while the total number of recovered and deaths stood at 6,404 and 115 respectively. On 6 June, Director-General Noor Hisham encouraged members of the public to wear face masks following advice from the World Health Organization that it helped to reduce infections. By 30 June, there were 164 active cases, with a total of 8,639 cases. The number of recovered had risen to 8,534 while the death toll stood at 121. \c\cOn 1 July, there were 144 active cases with a total of 8,640 cases. A total of 8,375 had recovered while the death toll stood at 121. On 20 July, Prime Minister Muhyiddin announced that the Malaysian Government would consider making face masks compulsory following the emergence of 13 clusters after the relaxation of lockdown restrictions on travel and businesses the previous month. By 31 July, there were 207 active cases with a total of 8,976 cases. The number of recovered had risen to 8,644 while the death toll had risen to 125. \c\cOn 1 August, there were 213 active cases with a total of 8,985 cases. A total of 8,647 have recovered while the death toll stayed at 125. By 31 August, there were 160 active cases with a total of 9,340 cases. A total of 9,054 had recovered while the death toll had risen to 127. \c\cAt least two regional outbreaks have occurred since July 2020. In late-July and August, several clusters emerged in Kedah and Sarawak. In September 2020, a major outbreak in Sabah initially detected in two prisons led to community spread within the state, a sharp increase to over 1,000 active cases, and the detection of infections throughout the country through returnees from Sabah following the 2020 Sabah state election. Malaysian authorities also attributed the surge of cases in Sabah to the entry of illegal immigrants from Indonesia. The country passed the 10,000 cases mark on 16 September 2020, and 11 deaths, primarily in Kedah and Sabah, were reported between the month ends of August and September. By 30 September, there were a total of 1,124 active cases with a total of 11,124 cases. A total of 9,967 had recovered while the death toll had risen to 136. \c\cIn 1 October, there were 1,334 active cases with a total of 11,484 cases. A total of 10,014 have recovered while the death toll had risen to 136. By 31 October, there were 10,051 active cases with a total of 31,548 cases. A total of 21,248 have recovered while the death toll had risen to 249. \c\cOn 18 November, the number of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia officially reached the 50,000 mark. The following day, the Director General Noor Hisham Abdullah announced that over 9,000 of the country's COVID-19 cases were detected through the MySejahtera contact tracing app launched on 20 April. By 30 November, there were a total of 10,578 active cases with a total of 54,759 cases. A total of 54,759 had recovered while the death toll had risen to 360. \c\cBy 4 December, the number of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia had reached the 70,000 mark. By 10 December, the total number of cases had reached the 80,000 mark while the death toll had risen to 402. By 18 December, the total number of cases had exceeded 90,000. On 23 December, the Malaysian Health Ministry confirmed that it had identified a new COVID-19 strain dubbed the “A701B” strain, which is more infectious than usual and similar to a strain found in South Africa, Australia, and the Netherlands. By 24 December, the total number of cases had exceeded 100,000. By 31 December, Malaysia had reported a total of 113,010 cases, 88,941 recoveries, and 471 deaths. \c\cBy 6 January 2021, the number of recovered had exceeded 100,000. On the same day, the Director General reported there were 252 active clusters in Malaysia. On 7 January, a record number of 3,027 new cases were reported, bringing the total number to 128,465. By 25 January 2021, Malaysia ranked 29th in a list of countries with the highest number of infections over a two week period published by Johns Hopkins University, with 48,625 new infections during that period. On 29 January, Malaysia exceed the 200,000 mark, with a total number of 203,933 reported cases. \c\cBy 11 February, the total number of recoveries had reached 202,269 while the total number of cases had reached 254,988. On 18 February, the death toll exceeded the 1,000 mark, reaching 1,005 deaths. By 28 February, the total number of cases had exceeded the 300,000 mark, reaching 300,752. In addition, the total number of recoveries had reached 273,417 while the death toll had reached 1,130. \c\cBy 11 March, the total number of recoveries had exceeded the 300,000 mark, reaching 300,620. By 31 March, the total number of cases had reached 345,500, the number of recoveries had reached 329,624, and the death toll 1,272. \c\cBy 28 April 2021, the total number of cases had exceeded the 400,000 mark, reaching 401,593. By 30 April, the total number of cases had reached 408,713, the number of recoveries had reached 377,980 while the death toll had climbed to 1,506. \c\cBy 9 May 2021, the total number of recoveries had met the 400,000 mark, reaching 401,934. \c\cBeginning from 15 March, Malaysia saw a significant jump in active cases. The Prime Minister of Malaysia held a live nationwide telecast on 16 March 2020 at 10:00 pm (UTC+8) to announce the decision of the federal government in implementing the Movement Control Order (MCO). Based on the live addressing that evening, six restrictions have been imposed:\c\cThe public is prohibited to mass gather or attend massive events including religious, sports, social and cultural activities. All worshiping locations and business premises should be closed except for supermarkets, public markets, grocery stores and convenience stores that sells everyday necessities. For Muslims, all religious activities in mosques including Friday prayers are adjourned in line with decision made on 15 March 2020 by the Special Muzakarah Committee Meeting of the National Fatwa Council. \c\cMalaysians returning from abroad are required to undergo health check and self-quarantine for 14 days. \c\cTourists and foreign visitors are restricted to enter the country. \c\cClosure of all kindergartens, government and private schools, including daily schools, boarding schools, international schools, tahfiz centres and other primary, secondary and pre-university institutions. \c\cClosure of all public and private higher education institution (IPTs) and skill training institutes. \c\cClosure of all government and private premises except for essential services (water, electricity, energy, telecommunications, postal, transportation, irrigation, oil, gas, fuel, lubricants, broadcasting, finance, banking, health, pharmacy, fire, prison, port, airport, safety, defence, cleaning, retail and food supply). \c\cThe order was originally to be in effect from 18 March to 31 March, but has been extended four times as additional two-week "phases" over the course of two months.:\c\cPhase 2, announced on 25 March, extends the MCO to 14 April, as new cases continued to climb. \c\cPhase 3, announced on 10 April, extends the MCO to 28 April, as the number of cases was projected by the WHO to peak in mid-April. \c\cPhase 4, announced on 23 April, extends the MCO to 12 May. On 1 May, the Malaysian Government announced that it will be relaxing Movement Control Order restrictions from 4 May as part of its plan to gradually restart the country's economy in three different phases, with public transportation services resuming on 4 May. As part of the fourth phase of the Movement Control Order, two family members will be allowed to buy food and other daily essentials. The easing of MCO drew criticisms from politicians and healthcare experts over concerns that it was too much too soon, and by 3 May, over 420,000 members of the public had signed a petition objecting to the conditional MCO and calling for the government to stay with the MCO. \c\cOn 10 May, the Conditional Movement Control Order was extended until 9 June, the fourth extension since 18 March. Unlike the others, this extension is scheduled to last about a month as Phase 1 of post-lockdown of the restrictions. \c\cOn 6 June, the Director-General confirmed that the movement control order would remain in force since Malaysia is still being monitored under the Prevention and Control of Infections Diseases Act 1988. On 7 June, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that the Conditional Movement Control Order would end on 9 June, with the country moving into the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) phase as in Phase 2 of post-lockdown for the rest of 2020. \c\cOn 28 August, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that the Recovery Movement Control Order would be extended until 12 February 2021 in view of the second wave of cases. In view of that, on 12 October, Senior Minister (Security Cluster) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the government has agreed to enforce Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya effective from 12.01am on 14 October to 27 October 2020. \c\cOn 3 October, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the Malaysian Government would not be re-imposing lockdown measures despite a spike in cases as the majority of cases were reported in detention centres and isolated districts. \c\cOn 20 October, employees in the private and public sectors, at the management and supervisory levels, in areas under the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) which are Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Selangor, Labuan and Sabah have been instructed to work from home starting Thursday, 22 October. \c\cOn 7 November, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the Malaysian Government would be reinstating its CMCO throughout peninsular Malaysia with the exception of Kelantan, Perlis, and Pahang between 9 November and 6 December 2020. In addition, CMCO measures for Sabah, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and Putraya, which were scheduled to end on 9 November, were extended until 6 December. \c\cOn 11 January, Prime Minister Muhyiddin re-imposed MCO restrictions  on mobility, economic activities, and public gatherings in the states of Malacca, Johor, Penang, Selangor, Sabah and the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Labuan between 13 and 26 January 2021 due to an ongoing surge of cases and deaths. \c\cOn 2 February, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob extended MCO restrictions in all states except Sarawak from 5 to 18 February 2021. \c\cOn 5 March, Selangor, Johor, Penang and Kuala Lumpur exited the Movement Control Order lockdown and entered the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO). \c\cOn 3 May, the Malaysian Government Movement Control Order restrictions in Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Sarawak, and Selangor in response to a spike in COVID-19 cases. Schools were closed and social and religious activities were banned. While some economic activities were allowed, eateries can only provide takeaway services. \c\cOn 25 October 2020, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Abdullah of Pahang rejected Prime Minister Muhyiddin's request for him to declare a state of emergency in response to a spike in COVID-19 cases throughout Malaysia. \c\cOn 16 December, Prime Minister Muhyiddin invoked a state of emergency to stop by-elections scheduled to be held in the Bugaya constituency of Sabah and the Gerik constituency in Perak scheduled for January 2021. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong Abdullah had assented to the request to impose the states of emergency within these two electorates in response to a third wave of infections, which had risen to a total of 86,000 cases and 422 deaths by 16 December. \c\cOn 12 January 2021, King Abdullah of Pahang declared a national state of emergency until at least 1 August 2021 to curb the spread of COVID-19 and in response to a political crisis involving Prime Minister Muhyiddin's Perikatan Nasional government. Under this state of emergency, parliament and elections were suspended while the Malaysian government was empowered to introduce laws without approval. \c\cImmediately after the spikes of the cases which related to the Sri Petaling Tabligh event, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that religious, social and sports mass gatherings must be cancelled or postponed until 30 April 2020. However, the end date for the ban on mass gathering events are subject to revision depending on the situation of the outbreak.

In a 18 April 2020 livestreamed video conference call with Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, President of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) (a major component party in the PN government), Adham would accuse PH of failing to prevent the spread of the Tabligh cluster despite the absence of a functional government during the period, while erroneously referring to the gathering as having taken place for longer, between 27 February and 3 March, and claiming to have attended a World Health Organization (WHO) conference call with "500 countries" (which Adham later clarified to refer to "500 participants from all around the world"). Responding to Adham's accusation, Dzulkefly would rebuke Adham's politicisation of the health crisis, claimed that preparations have been made since December 2019, and suggested that prior knowledge of the gathering would more likely be known to the Minister of Home Affairs of the previous PH government, Muhyiddin Yassin, who at the time of the political crisis spearheaded a defection of PPBM from PH and has subsequently been appointed as the current Prime Minister for the PN government. \c\cDespite the country having four manufacturers of face masks with higher quality and also expensive price, minimal support was given by the government to these manufacturers to sustain their operations. Most of the masks produced by Malaysia were exported to high-income developed countries with little being supplied to the country's own healthcare institutions whereas 90% of face masks for these sectors and Malaysian markets originated from Mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea, India and Thailand. With the countries local manufacturers struggling to fulfil the increasing overseas demands and with difficulties securing raw materials from China due to the outbreak, they were forced to seek materials from Europe which subsequently raised the price of masks. On 13 April, the Ministry of Health warned that supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) were running low with only 2 weeks of stocks left. \c\cDuring a televised interview on Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM)'s Bicara Naratif on 19 March 2020, Health Minister Adham Baba advised the public that drinking warm water will help prevent COVID-19 infection as the virus will be flushed down to the stomach and the digestive acids will kill any virus. His remarks went viral on social media, with many netizens questioning his claim. Dr. Nur Amalina Che Bakri had criticised Adham, stating that there is no research evidence that stomach acid can kill the virus. Similarly, Director-General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah disputes Adham's statement, commenting that the Health Ministry's approach for patient treatment and management is always based on evidence. The remedy is thought to have originated as a commonly circulated social media post, and has been widely debunked by health experts, including the WHO, which has stated that while staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection. \c\cOn 31 March, in a campaign to avoid domestic conflict during the Movement Control Order period, the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development released online posters advising women to dress up and wear make-up while working from home, refrain from sarcasm while asking for help with household chores, avoid nagging and attempt to inject humour by mimicking Doraemon's voice. The posters attracted widespread ridicule and were criticised for being sexist, stereotyping women and insinuating that women are responsible for domestic conflict. In response, the Ministry took down the posters and apologised in a statement for "tips that were inappropriate and touched on the sensitivities of certain groups". \c\cIn an 26 April 2020 report, Human Rights Watch criticised the Malaysian authorities for imprisoning people for violating the country's movement control order, putting their lives at a relatively greater risk of being infected by the virus. More than 15,000 people have already been arrested for going against the orders on 18 March 2020. \c\cOn 22 August 2020, the Ministry of Health issued a statement stating that Khairuddin Aman Razali, minister of plantation and commodity industries had been compounded RM1,000 on 7 August 2020 after they found him violating the quarantine rules. The Kuala Nerus Member of Parliament is said to have paid the fine and he has also apologized and even promised to contribute the minister's salary from May to August to the Covid-19 fund. This is after four days of Seputeh Member of Parliament, Teresa Kok raising the matter in the Dewan Rakyat. However, the Director General of Health Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah at the time told the media that Khairuddin's case is still being investigated by the police. After about two months of investigation, the situation changed again when Bukit Aman announced that the Attorney-General's Chambers had decided not to take action against the minister, saying Khairuddin had not been given form 14B to undergo his quarantine on July 7. \c\cOn 31 October 2020, Malaysiakini, a Malaysian online news portal, conducted an investigation to acquire answers from the Ministry of Health on what happened in the case, as the MOH had previously confirmed that Khairuddin had violated quarantine and imposed a compound on the offense. A question was put to Dr Noor Hisham, why the MOH issued a compound against Khairuddin and whether the compound would be canceled because the Attorney-General's Chambers found no offense committed. However, he declined to comment on the matter. "Under Act 342, the MOH has delegated enforcement powers to the police and the Attorney General. The case has been investigated by the police and the attorney general so I do not want further comment on the investigation," he said at a press conference in Putrajaya on that day. Noor Hisham refers to the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988. He also did not answer questions if the ministry was conducting an internal investigation into the failure to issue quarantine orders to Khairuddin upon his arrival. \c\cInfectious Disease Prevention and Control Regulations (Measures in Local Infected Areas) (No. 7) 2020, including allocating those returning from abroad for mandatory quarantine for 14 days. All returning residents must also undergo a Covid-19 swab test and then be sent to a quarantine center to perform a 14-day isolation period. Prior to 24 July 2020, those returning from overseas and being tested negatively still need to undergo quarantine but are allowed to do so at home. They are not allowed to leave the house for 14 days and must be re-tested on the 13th day before their quarantine bracelet can be removed. Khairuddin allegedly did not go through this process. From 24 July onwards, quarantine must be conducted at government-designated centers. The move was reintroduced after many residents violated the quarantine conditions at home. Khairuddin's case received public attention amid complaints of "two-degree treatment" between ordinary people and dignitaries (VIP). \c\cAccording to Human Rights Watch and the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, over 700 foreign migrant workers and refugees including Rohingya have been detained by Malaysian police during the coronavirus pandemic. In response to the arrests, the United Nations in Malaysia's Head of Communications and Advocacy, Ahmad Hafiz Osman, called for migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless individuals to have access to health services and services without any fear of repercussions. On 11 May, 83 human rights and civil society organisations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Article 19, and the International Committee of Jurists have called on Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin to address online hate speech and violent threats against Rohingya refugees in Malaysia. \c\cOn 5 June, National Security Council Sabah director Sharifah Sitti Saleha Habib Yussof confirmed that 5,300 Filipino "illegal immigrants" had been "stranded" at temporary detention centres in Sabah after the Philippines government refused to repatriate them due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. Between 1 January and 17 March 2020, the Malaysian Government had deported 3,347 illegal immigrants including 2,331 Filipinos, 816 Indonesians, and several Indian, Chinese, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi nationals prior to the implementation of the country's Movement Control Order on 18 March. Since the imposition of a Condition Movement Control Order in May, Sabah authorities have repatriated 322 Indonesian illegal immigrants. \c\cOn 21 June, Malaysian human rights NGO Aliran raised concerns about the living and working conditions of foreign migrant workers in Malaysia, many of whom had contracted COVID-19. Aliran also criticised "inflammatory" media coverage for fueling xenophobia and hostility against migrant workers. \c\cOn 25 June, the Kuala Lumpur City Hall curtailed refugees\' access to the city's wholesale market, only allowing them entry if they possessed valid permits and were accompanied by Malaysians. The City Hall's decision also barred entry by refugees carrying cards issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. This ruling was criticised by Yemen Refugee Union representative Dr Mohammed Al Radhi and Alliance of Chin Refugees coordinator James Bawi Thang Bik as discriminatory and inhumane towards refugees. \c\cOn 27 June, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin issued a statement that Malaysia could not take any more Rohingya refugees due to a struggling economy and dwindling resources. Malaysia does not recognise their refugee status and has turned away boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya refugees. Muhyiddin also urged the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to speed up the resettlement of Rohingya refugees in third party countries. \c\cIn early July 2020, an Al Jazeera documentary titled "Locked Up in Malaysia's Lockdown" alleged that illegal migrants and foreign workers had been mistreated by the Malaysian authorities and subject to racism during the country's lockdown. The Malaysian Government criticised the documentary as "misleading" and "inaccurate", with Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob demanding an apology from the news network. The Royal Malaysian Police have launched an investigation into the documentary while the Immigration Department of Malaysia have sought to question a Bangladeshi migrant interviewed in the documentary. In response, several civil society organisations including the Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ) issued a statement calling on the Malaysian Government to cease intimidatory measures against media and prevent incitement to discrimination, hostility, and violence against migrant workers. The Bangladeshi migrant, who was identified as Mohammad Rayhan Kaybir was subsequently deported to Bangladesh on 22 August. \c\cOn 13 August, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that foreigners entering Malaysia would have to pay quarantine charges and COVID-19 detection tests upon entering the country. \c\cIn January 2021, 50 former and current health workers urged Prime Minister Muhyiddin to give priority to immunising migrant workers and refugees, whom they described as the "silent epicentres of COVID-19 outbreaks."\c\cIn late February 2021, the Immigration Department was criticised by Amnesty International and Asylum Access for deporting 1,086 Myanmar nationals despite an interim ruling by the Kuala Lumpur High Court suspending the removal of some 1,200 people. The 1,086 Myanmar nationals were repatriated on three Myanmar Navy ships. This deportation came amidst human rights concerns following the 2021 Myanmar coup d\'état. \c\cSince the start of the country's vaccination program in 24 February 2021, concerns were raised on social media of government officials in lower positions and members of higher society flouting the government's planned vaccination timetable by entering priority queues for COVID-19 vaccines. The earliest allegation emerged on 25 February, when rumours from Serdang Hospital suggested that proposals were made to prioritise senior hospital administrators and influencers for vaccination; the Health Ministry dismissed the rumour, clarifying that the "influencers" referred to influential clinical department heads targeted to inspire front-line workers in respectable departments to seek inoculation. By March 1, further allegations were raised of senior district officials from Penang and approximately 200 state officials from the Kelantan State Executive Council seeking vaccine reservations ahead of health workers, which Kelantan State Exco for Local Government, Housing and Health Izani Husin denied. In response to the string of allegations, Khairy Jamaluddin reported that some ineligible officials were found to be on the priority list due to unclear guidelines and were subsequently removed, inviting whistleblowers to report further occurrences of line cutting. \c\cOn 16 April 2021, citing anonymous sources connected to the government, an Asia Sentinel article on Malaysia's failing response of its COVID-19 outbreak alleged that Sultan Abdullah, the current Yang di-Pertuan Agong, and his entourage that included Hishammuddin Hussein and Idris Haron, flew to the United Arab Emirates in January to be inoculated with Sinopharm's BBIBP-CorV vaccines, which has not been approved in Malaysia and would be illegal to use. The article would add that the Sultan was given 2,000 additional Sinopharm doses to take to Malaysia, where the vaccine was distributed among the Sultan's family by two physicians, Zulkarnain Ishmail and Hanafiah Harounrashid, as well as the Sultan's business partners and friends; the remainder of the vaccines were offered to Muhyiddin and the remaining ministers, but were declined as they waited to receive the Pfizer vaccines. Adham Baba denied the allegations, explaining an unapproved vaccine must first be assessed by the Health Ministry's National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency before its use is permitted, and accused the Asia Sentinel of slandering the country's image. Exacerbated by the slow pace of the vaccination program and a later deleted Instagram post by Raja Permaisuri Agong Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah suggesting she had received both her vaccine doses early, the Asia Sentinel publication led to condemnation of the government and royalty by Malaysian netizens; by 18 April, #KerajaanGagal (failed government) and #Agong emerged as top-trending Twitter hashtags in Malaysia. \c\cIn January 2021, 50 current and former senior healthcare officials submitted a letter to Prime Minister Muhyiddin criticising the failure of the Movement Control Orders and other health interventions to reduce the spread of infections, which had created a strain on intensive care units at hospitals. These officials advocated the immediate formation of a national COVID-19 taskforce, ramp up testing, reduce the strain on the healthcare system by requiring people to self-isolate at home, expedite approval of Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines, and to give priority to immunising migrant workers and refugees.
Attack involving shooting and explosion left at least 9 people dead including one teacher and 10 children and another ten were injured. The attack occurred on 11 May 2021  at a school in Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia.
The Troubles (Irish: Na Trioblóidí) were an ethno-nationalist period of conflict in Northern Ireland that lasted about 30 years from the late 1960s to the late 1990s. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it is sometimes described as an "irregular war" or "low-level war". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mostly took place in Northern Ireland, at times the violence spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England, and mainland Europe. \c\cThe conflict was primarily political and nationalistic, fuelled by historical events. It also had an ethnic or sectarian dimension, but despite the use of the terms Protestant and Catholic to refer to the two sides, it was not a religious conflict. A key issue was the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Unionists, who were mostly Ulster Protestants, wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom. Irish nationalists, who were mostly Irish Catholics, wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland. \c\cThe conflict began during a campaign by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to end discrimination against the Catholic/nationalist minority by the Protestant/unionist government of Northern Ireland and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The authorities attempted to suppress the protest campaign with police brutality; it was also met with violence from loyalists, who believed it was a republican front. Increasing tensions led to severe violence in August 1969 and the deployment of British troops, in what became the British Army's longest ever operation. "Peace walls" were built in some areas to keep the two communities apart. Some Catholics initially welcomed the British Army as a more neutral force than the RUC, but it soon came to be seen as hostile and biased, particularly after Bloody Sunday in 1972. \c\cThe main participants in the Troubles were republican paramilitaries such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA); loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA); British state security forces—the British Army and RUC; and political activists and politicians. The security forces of the Republic of Ireland played a smaller role. Republican paramilitaries carried out a guerrilla campaign against British security forces as well as a bombing campaign against infrastructural, commercial and political targets. Loyalists targeted republicans/nationalists and attacked the wider Catholic community in what they described as retaliation. At times, there were bouts of sectarian tit-for-tat violence, as well as feuds within and between paramilitary groups of the same stripe. The British security forces undertook both a policing and counter-insurgency role, primarily against republicans. There was extensive collusion between British security forces and loyalist paramilitaries. The Troubles also involved numerous riots, mass protests and acts of civil disobedience, and led to increased segregation and the creation of temporary no-go areas. \c\cMore than 3,500 people were killed in the conflict, of whom 52% were civilians, 32% were members of the British security forces and 16% were members of paramilitary groups. Republican paramilitaries were responsible for some 60% of the deaths, loyalists 30% and security forces 10%. There has been sporadic violence since the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, including ongoing punishment attacks and a campaign by dissident republicans to achieve a united Ireland. \c\c"The Troubles" refers to the three-decade conflict between nationalists (mainly self-identified as Irish or Roman Catholic) and unionists (mainly self-identified as British or Protestant). The word "troubles" has been used as a synonym for violent conflict for centuries. The term was used to describe the Irish revolutionary period in the early twentieth century. It was subsequently adopted to refer to the escalating violence in Northern Ireland after 1969. The violence was characterised by the armed campaigns of Irish republican and Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups and British state security forces (the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)). It thus became the focus for the longest major campaign in the history of the British Army. \c\cThe British government's position is that its forces were neutral in the conflict, trying to uphold law and order in Northern Ireland and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to democratic self-determination. Nationalists regarded the state forces as forces of occupation or partisan combatants in the conflict, while Unionists tended to support the locally recruited RUC. The British security forces focused on republican paramilitaries and activists, and the "Ballast" investigation by the Police Ombudsman confirmed that certain British officers colluded on several occasions with loyalist paramilitaries, were involved in murder, and furthermore obstructed the course of justice when claims of collusion and murder were investigated. \c\cThe Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a peace process that included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations, the complete decommissioning of the IRA's weapons, the reform of the police, and the withdrawal of the British Army from the streets and sensitive Irish border areas such as South Armagh and County Fermanagh, as agreed by the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the "Good Friday Agreement"). One part of the Agreement is that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom unless a majority of the Northern Irish electorate vote otherwise. It also established the Northern Ireland Executive, a devolved power-sharing government, which must consist of both unionist and nationalist parties. \c\cAlthough the number of active participants was relatively small, the Troubles affected many in Northern Ireland on a daily basis; their impact sometimes spread to England and the Republic of Ireland, and, occasionally, to parts of mainland Europe. \c\cPeace lines, which were built in Northern Ireland during the early years of the Troubles, remain in place. \c\cIn 1609, Scottish and English settlers, known as planters, were given land escheated from the native Irish in the Plantation of Ulster. Coupled with Protestant immigration to "unplanted" areas of Ulster, particularly Antrim and Down, this resulted in conflict between the native Catholics and the "planters", leading in turn to two bloody religious conflicts known as the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1653) and the Williamite war (1689–1691), both of which resulted in Protestant victories. \c\cAnglican dominance in Ireland was ensured by the passage of the Penal Laws that curtailed the religious, legal, and political rights of anyone (including both Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, such as Presbyterians) who did not conform to the state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland. As the Penal Laws started to be phased out in the latter part of the 18th century, there was more competition for land, as restrictions were lifted on the Irish Catholic ability to rent. With Roman Catholics allowed to buy land and enter trades from which they had formerly been banned, tensions arose resulting in the Protestant "Peep O\'Day Boys" and Catholic "Defenders". This created polarisation between the communities and a dramatic reduction in reformers among Protestants, many of whom had been growing more receptive to democratic reform. \c\cFollowing the foundation of the republican Society of the United Irishmen by Presbyterians, Catholics, and liberal Anglicans, and the resulting failed Irish Rebellion of 1798, sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants continued. The Orange Order (founded 1795), with its stated goal of upholding the Protestant faith and loyalty to the heirs of William of Orange, dates from this period and remains active to this day. \c\cWith the Acts of Union 1800 (which came into force on 1 January 1801), a new political framework was formed with the abolition of the Irish Parliament and incorporation of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The result was a closer tie between Anglicans and the formerly republican Presbyterians as part of a "loyal" Protestant community. Although Catholic emancipation was achieved in 1829, largely eliminating official discrimination against Roman Catholics (then around 75% of Ireland's population), Dissenters, and Jews, the Repeal Association's campaign to repeal the 1801 Union failed. \c\cIn the late 19th century, the Home Rule movement was created and served to define the divide between most nationalists (usually Catholics), who sought the restoration of an Irish Parliament, and most unionists (usually Protestants), who were afraid of being a minority under a Catholic-dominated Irish Parliament and who tended to support continuing union with Britain. \c\cUnionists and Home Rule advocates were the main political factions in late 19th- and early 20th-century Ireland. \c\cBy the second decade of the 20th century, Home Rule, or limited Irish self-government, was on the brink of being conceded due to the agitation of the Irish Parliamentary Party. \c\cIn response to the campaign for Home Rule which started in the 1870s, unionists, mostly Protestant and largely concentrated in Ulster, had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland, fearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1912, unionists led by Edward Carson signed the Ulster Covenant and pledged to resist Home Rule by force if necessary. To this end, they formed the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). \c\cIn response, nationalists led by Eoin MacNeill formed the Irish Volunteers in 1913, whose goal was to oppose the UVF and ensure enactment of the Third Home Rule Bill in the event of British or unionist recalcitrance. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and Ireland's involvement in the war, temporarily averted possible civil war in Ireland and delayed the resolution of the question of Irish independence. Home Rule, although passed in the British Parliament with Royal Assent, was suspended for the duration of the war. \c\cThe Irish Volunteers split, with a majority, known as the National Volunteers, supporting the war effort, and some of them joining Irish regiments of the New British Army. Many of those who stayed were radical nationalists, among them Irish Republican Brotherhood infiltrators. From these ranks came those who launched the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, led by Patrick Pearse and James Connolly. Two-and-a-half years after the executions of sixteen of the Rising's leaders, the separatist Sinn Féin party won the December 1918 general election in Ireland with 47% of the vote and a majority of seats, and set up the 1919 First Dáil (Irish Parliament) in Dublin. Their victory was aided by the threat of conscription for First World War service. The Irish War for Independence followed, leading to eventual independence in 1922 for the Irish Free State, which comprised 26 of the 32 Irish counties. In Ulster, particularly in the six counties which became Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin fared relatively poorly in the 1918 election, and unionists won a majority. \c\cThe Government of Ireland Act 1920 partitioned the island of Ireland into two separate jurisdictions, Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland, both devolved regions of the United Kingdom. This partition of Ireland was confirmed when the Parliament of Northern Ireland exercised its right in December 1922 under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 to opt out of the newly established Irish Free State. A part of the treaty signed in 1922 mandated that a boundary commission would sit to decide where the frontier of the northern state would be in relation to its southern neighbour. After the Irish Civil War of 1922–1923, this part of the treaty was given less priority by the new Dublin government led by W. T. Cosgrave, and was quietly dropped. As counties Fermanagh and Tyrone and border areas of Londonderry, Armagh, and Down were mainly nationalist, the Irish Boundary Commission could reduce Northern Ireland to four counties or less. \c\cNorthern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom, albeit under a separate system of government whereby it was given its own parliament and devolved government. While this arrangement met the desires of unionists to remain part of the United Kingdom, nationalists largely viewed the partition of Ireland as an illegal and arbitrary division of the island against the will of the majority of its people. They argued that the Northern Ireland state was neither legitimate nor democratic, but created with a deliberately gerrymandered unionist majority. Catholics initially composed about 35% of its population. A total of 557 people, mostly Catholics, were killed in political or sectarian violence from 1920 to 1922 in the six counties that would become Northern Ireland, both during and after the Irish War of Independence. The result was communal strife between Catholics and Protestants, with some historians describing this violence, especially that in Belfast, as a pogrom, although historian Peter Hart argues that the term is not appropriate given the reciprocity of violence in Northern Ireland. \c\cA marginalised remnant of the Irish Republican Army survived the Irish Civil War. This would come to have a major impact on Northern Ireland. Although the IRA was proscribed on both sides of the new Irish border, it remained ideologically committed to overthrowing both the Northern Ireland and the Free State governments by force of arms to unify Ireland. The government of Northern Ireland passed the Special Powers Act in 1922, giving sweeping powers to the government and police to intern suspects without trial and to administer corporal punishment such as flogging to re-establish or preserve law and order. The Act continued to be used against nationalists long after the violence of this period had come to an end. In 1920, in local elections held under proportional representation, nationalists had won control over many local governments, including the County Councils of Fermanagh and Tyrone, and the Londonderry Borough Council governing Derry City. In response, in 1922 the new unionist government re-drew the electoral boundaries to give its supporters a majority and abolished proportional representation in favour of first past the post voting. This resulted in unionist control of areas such as Derry City, Fermanagh, and Tyrone where they were actually a minority of voters. \c\cThe two sides\' positions became strictly defined following this period. From a unionist perspective, Northern Ireland's nationalists were inherently disloyal and determined to force unionists into a united Ireland. This threat was seen as justifying preferential treatment of unionists in housing, employment and other fields. The prevalence of larger families and thus the potential for a more rapid population growth among Catholics was seen as a threat. Unionist governments ignored Edward Carson's warning in 1921 that alienating Catholics would make Northern Ireland inherently unstable. After the early 1920s, there were occasional incidents of sectarian unrest in Northern Ireland. These included severe rioting in Belfast in the 1930s and 1950s, and the IRA's brief Northern Campaign in the 1940s and Border Campaign between 1956 and 1962, which did not enjoy broad popular support among nationalists. After the IRA called off its campaign in 1962, Northern Ireland became relatively stable for a brief period. \c\cThere is little agreement on the exact date of the start of the Troubles. Different writers have suggested different dates. These include the formation of the modern Ulster Volunteer Force in 1966, the civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968, the beginning of the \'Battle of the Bogside\' on 12 August 1969 or the deployment of British troops on 14 August 1969. \c\cIn March and April 1966, Irish nationalists/republicans held parades throughout Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. On 8 March, a group of Irish republicans dynamited Nelson's Pillar in Dublin. At the time, the IRA was weak and not engaged in armed action, but some unionists warned it was about to be revived to launch another campaign against Northern Ireland. In April 1966, loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant fundamentalist preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC). It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) to oust Terence O\'Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Although O\'Neill was a unionist, they viewed him as being too 'soft\' on the civil rights movement and opposed his policies. \c\cAt the same time, a loyalist group calling itself the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) emerged in the Shankill area of Belfast. It was led by Gusty Spence, a former British soldier. Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV. In April and May 1966 it petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools and businesses. A firebomb killed an elderly Protestant widow, Matilda Gould. On 21 May, the UVF issued a statement declaring "war" against the IRA and anyone helping it. The UVF fatally shot a Catholic civilian, John Scullion, as he walked home on 27 May. A month later it shot three Catholic civilians as they left a pub, killing Peter Ward, a Catholic from the Falls Road. Shortly after, the UVF was proscribed by the Northern Ireland government. \c\cIn the mid-1960s, a non-violent civil rights campaign began in Northern Ireland. It comprised groups such as the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), the Campaign for Social Justice, the Derry Citizens\' Action Committee and People's Democracy, whose stated goals were:\c\can end to job discrimination – it showed evidence that Catholics/nationalists were less likely to be given certain jobs, especially government jobs\c\can end to discrimination in housing allocation – it showed evidence that unionist-controlled local councils allocated housing to Protestants ahead of Catholics/nationalists\c\cone man, one vote – in Northern Ireland, only householders could vote in local elections, while in the rest of the United Kingdom all adults could vote\c\can end to gerrymandering of electoral boundaries – this meant that nationalists had less voting power than unionists, even where nationalists were a majority\c\creform of the police force (Royal Ulster Constabulary) – it was over 90% Protestant and criticised for sectarianism and police brutality\c\crepeal of the Special Powers Act – this allowed police to search without a warrant, arrest and imprison people without charge or trial, ban any assemblies or parades, and ban any publications; the Act was used almost exclusively against nationalists\c\cSome suspected and accused NICRA of being a republican front-group whose ultimate goal was to unite Ireland. Although republicans and some members of the IRA (then led by Cathal Goulding and pursuing a non-violent agenda) helped to create and drive the movement, they did not control it and were not a dominant faction within it. \c\cOn 20 June 1968, civil rights activists (including Austin Currie, a nationalist MP) protested against housing discrimination by squatting in a house in Caledon. The local council had allocated the house to an unmarried 19-year-old Protestant (Emily Beattie, the secretary of a local UUP politician) instead of either of two large Catholic families with children. RUC officers – one of whom was Beattie's brother – forcibly removed the activists. Two days before the protest, the two Catholic families who had been squatting in the house next door were removed by police. Currie had brought their grievance to the local council and to Stormont, but had been told to leave. The incident invigorated the civil rights movement. \c\cOn 24 August 1968, the civil rights movement held its first civil rights march, from Coalisland to Dungannon. Many more marches were held over the following year. Loyalists (especially members of the UPV) attacked some of the marches and held counter-demonstrations in a bid to get the marches banned. Because of the lack of police reaction to the attacks, nationalists saw the RUC, almost wholly Protestant, as backing the loyalists and allowing the attacks to occur. On 5 October 1968, a civil rights march in Derry was banned by the Northern Ireland government. When marchers defied the ban, RUC officers surrounded the marchers and beat them indiscriminately and without provocation. More than 100 people were injured, including a number of nationalist politicians. The incident was filmed by television news crews and shown around the world. It caused outrage among Catholics and nationalists, sparking two days of rioting in Derry between nationalists and the RUC. \c\cA few days later, a student civil rights group, People's Democracy, was formed in Belfast. In late November, O\'Neill promised the civil rights movement some concessions, but these were seen as too little by nationalists and too much by loyalists. On 1 January 1969, People's Democracy began a four-day march from Belfast to Derry, which was repeatedly harassed and attacked by loyalists. At Burntollet Bridge the marchers were attacked by about 200 loyalists, including some off-duty police officers, armed with iron bars, bricks and bottles in a planned ambush. When the march reached Derry City it was again attacked. The marchers claimed that police did nothing to protect them and that some officers helped the attackers. That night, RUC officers went on a rampage in the Bogside area of Derry, attacking Catholic homes, attacking and threatening residents, and hurling sectarian abuse. Residents then sealed off the Bogside with barricades to keep the police out, creating "Free Derry", which was briefly a no-go area for the security forces. \c\cIn March and April 1969, loyalists bombed water and electricity installations in Northern Ireland, blaming them on the dormant IRA and elements of the civil rights movement. Some attacks left much of Belfast without power and water. Loyalists hoped the bombings would force O\'Neill to resign and bring an end to any concessions to nationalists. There were six bombings between 30 March and 26 April. All were widely blamed on the IRA, and British soldiers were sent to guard installations. Unionist support for O\'Neill waned, and on 28 April he resigned as prime minister. \c\cOn 19 April there were clashes between NICRA marchers, the RUC and loyalists in the Bogside. RUC officers entered the house of Samuel Devenny (42), an uninvolved Catholic civilian, and beat him along with two of his teenage daughters and a family friend. One of the daughters was beaten unconscious as she lay recovering from surgery. Devenny suffered a heart attack and died on 17 July from his injuries. On 13 July, RUC officers beat a Catholic civilian, Francis McCloskey (67), during clashes in Dungiven. He died of his injuries the next day. \c\cOn 12 August, the loyalist Apprentice Boys of Derry were allowed to march along the edge of the Bogside. Taunts and missiles were exchanged between the loyalists and nationalist residents. After being bombarded with stones and petrol bombs from nationalists, the RUC, backed by loyalists, tried to storm the Bogside. The RUC used CS gas, armoured vehicles and water cannons, but were kept at bay by hundreds of nationalists. The continuous fighting, which became known as the Battle of the Bogside, lasted for three days. \c\cIn response to events in Derry, nationalists held protests at RUC bases in Belfast and elsewhere. Some of these led to clashes with the RUC and attacks on RUC bases. In Belfast, loyalists responded by invading nationalist districts, burning houses and businesses. There were gun battles between nationalists and the RUC, and between nationalists and loyalists. A group of about 30 IRA members was involved in the fighting in Belfast. The RUC deployed Shorland armoured cars mounted with heavy Browning machine guns. The Shorlands twice opened fire on a block of flats in a nationalist district, killing a nine-year-old boy, Patrick Rooney. RUC officers opened fire on rioters in Armagh, Dungannon and Coalisland. \c\cDuring the riots, on 13 August, Taoiseach Jack Lynch made a television address. He condemned the RUC and said that the Irish Government "can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse". He called for a United Nations peacekeeping force to be deployed and said that Irish Army field hospitals were being set up at the border in County Donegal near Derry. Lynch added that Irish re-unification would be the only permanent solution. Some interpreted the speech as a threat of military intervention. After the riots, Lynch ordered the Irish Army to plan for a possible humanitarian intervention in Northern Ireland. The plan, Exercise Armageddon, was rejected and remained classified for thirty years. \c\cOn 14–15 August, British troops were deployed in Derry and Belfast to restore order, but did not try to enter the Bogside, bringing a temporary end to the riots. Ten people had been killed, among them nine-year-old Patrick Rooney (the first child killed by police during the conflict), and 745 had been injured, including 154 who suffered gunshot wounds. 154 homes and other buildings were demolished and over 400 needed repairs, 83% of the buildings damaged were occupied by Catholics. Between July and September 1,505 Catholic and 315 Protestant families were forced to flee their homes. The Irish Army set up refugee camps in the Republic near the border. Nationalists initially welcomed the British Army, as they did not trust the RUC. \c\cOn 9 September, the Northern Ireland Joint Security Committee met at Stormont Castle and decided that\c\cOn 10 September the British Army started construction of the first "peace wall". It was the first of many such walls across Northern Ireland that still stand today. \c\cAfter the riots, the \'Hunt Committee\' was set up to examine the RUC. It published its report on 12 October, recommending that the RUC become an unarmed force and the B Specials be disbanded. That night, loyalists took to the streets of Belfast in protest at the report. During violence in the Shankill, UVF members shot dead RUC officer Victor Arbuckle. He was the first RUC officer to be killed during the Troubles. In October and December 1969, the UVF carried out a number of small bombings in the Republic of Ireland. \c\cDespite the British government's attempt to do "nothing that would suggest partiality to one section of the community" and the improvement of the relationship between the Army and the local population following the Army assistance with flood relief in August 1970, the Falls Curfew and a situation that was described at the time as "an inflamed sectarian one, which is being deliberately exploited by the IRA and other extremists" meant that relations between the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly deteriorated. \c\cFrom 1970 through 1972 an explosion of political violence occurred in Northern Ireland. The deadliest attack in the early 70s was the McGurk's Bar bombing by the UVF in 1971. The violence peaked in 1972, when nearly 500 people, just over half of them civilians, lost their lives, the worst year in the entire conflict. \c\cBy the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place in Derry, blocking access to what was known as Free Derry; 16 of these were impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles. Many of the nationalist or republican "no-go areas" were controlled by one of the two factions of the Irish Republican Army—the Provisional IRA and Official IRA. There are several reasons offered for why violence escalated in these years. \c\cUnionists claim the main reason was the formation of the Provisional IRA and Official IRA, particularly the former. These two groups were formed when the IRA split into the \'Provisional\' and \'Official\' factions. While the older IRA had embraced non-violent civil agitation, the new Provisional IRA was determined to wage "armed struggle" against British rule in Northern Ireland. The new IRA was willing to take on the role of "defenders of the Catholic community", rather than seeking working-class ecumenical unity across both communities. \c\cNationalists point to a number of events in these years to explain the upsurge in violence. One such incident was the Falls Curfew in July 1970, when 3,000 troops imposed a curfew on the nationalist Lower Falls area of Belfast, firing more than 1,500 rounds of ammunition in gun battles with the Official IRA, and killing four people. Another was the introduction of internment without trial in 1971 (of 350 initial detainees, none were Protestants). Moreover, due to poor intelligence, very few of those interned were actually republican activists at the time, but some internees became increasingly radicalised as a result of their experiences. \c\cA third event, Bloody Sunday, was the shooting dead of thirteen unarmed men by the British Army at a proscribed anti-internment rally in Derry on 30 January 1972 (a fourteenth man died of his injuries some months later) while fifteen other civilians were wounded. The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as "1 Para". \c\cThis was one of the most prominent events that occurred during the Troubles as it was recorded as the largest number of civilians killed in a single shooting incident. Bloody Sunday greatly increased the hostility of Catholics and Irish nationalists towards the British military and government while significantly elevating tensions. As a result, the Provisional IRA gained more support, especially through rising numbers of recruits in the local areas. \c\cFollowing the introduction of internment there were numerous gun battles between the British Army and both the Provisional and Official IRA. These included the Battle at Springmartin and the Battle of Lenadoon. Between 1971 and 1975, 1,981 people were interned; 1,874 were Catholic/republican, while 107 were Protestant/loyalist. There were widespread allegations of abuse and even torture of detainees, and in 1972, the "five techniques" used by the police and army for interrogation were ruled to be illegal following a British government inquiry. \c\cThe Provisional IRA, or "Provos", as they became known, sought to establish themselves as the defender of the nationalist community. The Official IRA (OIRA) began its own armed campaign in reaction to the ongoing violence. The Provisional IRA's offensive campaign began in early 1971 when the Army Council sanctioned attacks on the British Army. \c\cIn 1972, the Provisional IRA killed approximately 100 members of the security forces, wounded 500 others, and carried out approximately 1,300 bombings, mostly against commercial targets which they considered "the artificial economy".[further explanation needed] Their bombing campaign killed many civilians, notably on Bloody Friday on 21 July, when they set off 22 bombs in the centre of Belfast, killing five civilians, two British soldiers, a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) reservist, and an Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member. Ten days later, nine civilians were killed in a triple car bombing in Claudy. The IRA is accused of committing this bombing but no proof for that accusation is published yet. \c\cIn 1972 the Official IRA's campaign was largely counter-productive. The Aldershot bombing, an attack on the barracks of the Parachute Regiment in retaliation for Bloody Sunday, killed five female cleaners, a gardener and an army chaplain. The Official IRA killed three soldiers in Derry in April, but Joe McCann was killed by the Parachute Regiment in Belfast during the same month. The Official IRA called off its campaign in May 1972. \c\cBritish troop concentrations peaked at 20:1000 of the civilian population, the highest ratio found in the history of counterinsurgency warfare, higher than that achieved during the "Malayan Emergency"/"Anti-British National Liberation War", to which the conflict is frequently compared. Operation Motorman, the military operation for the surge, was the biggest military operation in Ireland since the Irish War of Independence. In total, almost 22,000 British forces were involved, In the days before 31 July, about 4,000 extra troops were brought into Northern Ireland. \c\cDespite a temporary ceasefire in 1972 and talks with British officials, the Provisionals were determined to continue their campaign until the achievement of a united Ireland. The UK government in London, believing the Northern Ireland administration incapable of containing the security situation, sought to take over the control of law and order there. As this was unacceptable to the Northern Ireland Government, the British government pushed through emergency legislation (the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972) which suspended the unionist-controlled Stormont parliament and government, and introduced "direct rule" from London. Direct rule was initially intended as a short-term measure; the medium-term strategy was to restore self-government to Northern Ireland on a basis that was acceptable to both unionists and nationalists. Agreement proved elusive, however, and the Troubles continued throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s within a context of political deadlock. The existence of "no-go areas" in Belfast and Derry was a challenge to the authority of the British government in Northern Ireland, and the British Army demolished the barricades and re-established control over the areas in Operation Motorman on 31 July 1972. \c\cIn June 1973, following the publication of a British White Paper and a referendum in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary body, the Northern Ireland Assembly, was established. Elections to this were held on 28 June. In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist parties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the Sunningdale Agreement, which was intended to produce a political settlement within Northern Ireland, but with a so-called "Irish dimension" involving the Republic. The agreement provided for "power-sharing" – the creation of an executive containing both unionists and nationalists—and a "Council of Ireland" – a body made up of ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic, designed to encourage cross-border co-operation. \c\cUnionists were split over Sunningdale, which was also opposed by the IRA, whose goal remained nothing short of an end to the existence of Northern Ireland as part of the UK. Many unionists opposed the concept of power-sharing, arguing that it was not feasible to share power with those (nationalists) who sought the destruction of the state. Perhaps more significant, however, was the unionist opposition to the "Irish dimension" and the Council of Ireland, which was perceived as being an all-Ireland parliament-in-waiting. Remarks by a young Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, Hugh Logue, to an audience at Trinity College Dublin that Sunningdale was the tool "by which the Unionists will be trundled off to a united Ireland" also damaged chances of significant unionist support for the agreement. In January 1974, Brian Faulkner was narrowly deposed as UUP leader and replaced by Harry West, although Faulkner retained his position as Chief Executive in the new government. A UK general election in February 1974 gave the anti-Sunningdale unionists the opportunity to test unionist opinion with the slogan "Dublin is only a Sunningdale away", and the result galvanised their support: they won 11 of the 12 seats, winning 58% of the vote with most of the rest going to nationalists and pro-Sunningdale unionists. \c\cUltimately, however, the Sunningdale Agreement was brought down by mass action on the part of loyalist paramilitaries (primarily the Ulster Defence Association, at that time over 20,000 strong[citation needed]) and workers, who formed the Ulster Workers\' Council. They organised a general strike, the Ulster Workers\' Council strike. This severely curtailed business in Northern Ireland and cut off essential services such as water and electricity. Nationalists argue that the British Government did not do enough to break this strike and uphold the Sunningdale initiative. There is evidence that the strike was further encouraged by MI5, a part of their campaign to \'disorientate\' British prime minister Harold Wilson's government. Faced with such opposition, the pro-Sunningdale unionists resigned from the power-sharing government and the new regime collapsed. Three days into the UWC strike, on 17 May 1974, two UVF teams from the Belfast and Mid-Ulster brigades detonated three no-warning car bombs in Dublin's city centre during the Friday evening rush hour, resulting in 26 deaths and close to 300 injuries. Ninety minutes later, a fourth car bomb exploded in Monaghan, killing seven additional people. Nobody has ever been convicted for these attacks, with the bombings being the greatest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles. \c\cHarold Wilson had secretly met with the IRA in 1971 while leader of the opposition; his government in late 1974 and early 1975 again met with the IRA to negotiate a ceasefire. During the meetings the parties discussed the possibility of British withdrawal from an independent Northern Ireland. The failure of Sunningdale led to the serious consideration in London until November 1975 of independence. Had the withdrawal occurred – which Wilson supported but others, including James Callaghan, opposed – the region would have become a separate dominion of the British Commonwealth. \c\cThe British negotiations with an illegal organisation angered the Irish government. It did not know their proceedings but feared that the British were considering abandoning Northern Ireland. Foreign Minister Garret FitzGerald discussed in a memorandum of June 1975 the possibilities of orderly withdrawal and independence, repartition of the island or a collapse of Northern Ireland into civil war and anarchy. The memorandum preferred a negotiated independence as the best of the three "worst case scenarios", but concluded that the Irish government could do little. \c\cThe Irish government had already failed to prevent the IRA from burning down the British Embassy in 1972. It believed that it could not enlarge the country's small army of 12,500 men without negative consequences. A civil war in Northern Ireland would cause many deaths there and severe consequences for the Republic, as the public would demand that it intervene to protect nationalists. FitzGerald warned Callaghan that the failure to intervene, despite Ireland's inability to do so, would "threaten democratic government in the Republic", which in turn jeopardised British and European security against Communist and other foreign nations. \c\cThe Irish government so dreaded the consequences of an independent Northern Ireland that FitzGerald refused to ask the British not to withdraw—as he feared that openly discussing the issue could permit the British to proceed—and other members of government opposed the Irish Cabinet even discussing what FitzGerald referred to as a "doomsday scenario". He wrote in 2006 that "Neither then nor since has public opinion in Ireland realised how close to disaster our whole island came during the last two years of Harold Wilson's premiership."\c\cMerlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, lifted the proscription against the UVF in April 1974. In December, one month after the Birmingham pub bombings which killed 21 people, the IRA declared a ceasefire; this would theoretically last throughout most of the following year. The ceasefire notwithstanding, sectarian killings actually escalated in 1975, along with internal feuding between rival paramilitary groups. This made 1975 one of the "bloodiest years of the conflict". \c\cOn 31 July 1975 at Buskhill, outside Newry, popular Irish cabaret band the Miami Showband was returning home to Dublin after a gig in Banbridge when it was ambushed by gunmen from the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade wearing British Army uniforms at a bogus military roadside checkpoint on the main A1 road. Three of the bandmembers, two Catholics and a Protestant, were shot dead, while two of the UVF men were killed when the bomb they had loaded onto the band's minibus detonated prematurely. The following January, eleven Protestant workers were gunned down in Kingsmill, South Armagh after having been ordered off their bus by an armed republican gang, which called itself the South Armagh Republican Action Force. One man survived despite being shot 18 times, leaving ten fatalities. These killings were reportedly in retaliation to a loyalist double shooting attack against the Reavey and O\'Dowd families the previous night. \c\cThe violence continued through the rest of the 1970s. This included a series of attacks in Southern England in 1974 and 1975 by Provisional IRA active service unit the Balcombe Street Gang. The British Government reinstated the ban against the UVF in October 1975, making it once more an illegal organisation. The Provisional IRA's December 1974 ceasefire officially ended in January 1976, although it carried out several attacks in 1975. It had lost the hope that it had felt in the early 1970s that it could force a rapid British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, and instead developed a strategy known as the "Long War", which involved a less intense but more sustained campaign of violence that could continue indefinitely. The Official IRA ceasefire of 1972, however, became permanent, and the "Official" movement eventually evolved into the Workers\' Party, which rejected violence completely. However, a splinter from the "Officials"—the Irish National Liberation Army—continued a campaign of violence in 1974. \c\cBy the late 1970s, war-weariness was visible in both communities. One sign of this was the formation of the Peace People, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976. The Peace People organised large demonstrations calling for an end to paramilitary violence. Their campaign lost momentum, however, after they appealed to the nationalist community to provide information on the IRA to security forces. \c\cThe decade ended with a double attack by the IRA against the British. On 27 August 1979, Lord Mountbatten while on holiday in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, was killed by a bomb planted on board his boat. Three other people were also killed: Lady Brabourne, the elderly mother of Mountbatten's son-in-law; and two teenagers, a grandson of Mountbatten and a local boatman. That same day, eighteen British soldiers, mostly members of the Parachute Regiment, were killed by two remote-controlled bombs in the Warrenpoint ambush at Narrow Water Castle, near Warrenpoint, County Down. It was the British Army's largest loss of life in a single incident in Operation Banner. \c\cSuccessive British Governments, having failed to achieve a political settlement, tried to "normalise" Northern Ireland. Aspects included the removal of internment without trial and the removal of political status for paramilitary prisoners. From 1972 onward, paramilitaries were tried in juryless Diplock courts to avoid intimidation of jurors. On conviction, they were to be treated as ordinary criminals. Resistance to this policy among republican prisoners led to more than 500 of them in the Maze prison initiating the "blanket" and "dirty" protests. Their protests culminated in hunger strikes in 1980 and 1981, aimed at the restoration of political status, as well as other concessions. \c\cIn the 1981 Irish hunger strike, ten republican prisoners (seven from the Provisional IRA and three from the INLA) died of starvation. The first hunger striker to die, Bobby Sands, was elected to Parliament on an Anti-H-Block ticket, as was his election agent Owen Carron following Sands\' death. The hunger strikes resonated among many nationalists; over 100,000 people attended Sands\' funeral mass in West Belfast and thousands attended those of the other hunger strikers. From an Irish republican perspective, the significance of these events was to demonstrate potential for a political and electoral strategy. \c\cIn the wake of the hunger strikes, Sinn Féin, which had become the Provisional IRA's political wing, began to contest elections for the first time in both Northern Ireland (as abstentionists) and in the Republic. In 1986, Sinn Féin recognised the legitimacy of the Irish Dáil, which caused a small group of members to break away and form Republican Sinn Féin. \c\cThe IRA's "Long War" was boosted by large donations of arms from Libya in the 1980s (see Provisional IRA arms importation) due to Muammar Gaddafi's anger at British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher's government for assisting the Reagan government's bombing of Tripoli, which had allegedly killed one of Gaddafi's children. Additionally, it received funding from supporters in the United States and elsewhere throughout the Irish diaspora. \c\cIn July 1982, the IRA bombed military ceremonies in London's Hyde Park and Regent's Park, killing four soldiers, seven bandsmen and seven horses. The INLA was highly active in the early and mid-1980s. In December 1982, it bombed a disco in Ballykelly, County Londonderry, frequented by off-duty British soldiers, killing 11 soldiers and six civilians. In December 1983, the IRA attacked Harrods using a car bomb, killing six people. One of the IRA's most high-profile actions in this period was the Brighton hotel bombing on 12 October 1984, when it set off a 100-pound bomb in the Grand Brighton Hotel in Brighton, where politicians including Thatcher, were staying for the Conservative Party conference. The bomb, which exploded in the early hours of the morning, killed five people, including Conservative MP Sir Anthony Berry, and injured 34 others. \c\cOn 28 February 1985 in Newry, nine RUC officers were killed in a mortar attack on the police station. It was planned by the IRA's South Armagh Brigade and an IRA unit in Newry. Nine shells were fired from a mark 10 mortar which was bolted onto the back of a hijacked Ford van in Crossmaglen. Eight shells overshot the station; the ninth hit a portable cabin which was being used as a canteen. It was the RUC's largest loss of life during the Troubles. On 8 May 1987, eight IRA members attacked an RUC station in Loughgall, County Armagh, using a bomb and guns. All were killed by the SAS – the most IRA members killed in a single incident in the Troubles. On 8 November 1987, in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, a Provisional IRA time bomb exploded during a Remembrance Sunday ceremony for UK Commonwealth war casualties. The bomb went off by a cenotaph which was at the heart of the parade. Eleven people (ten civilians and one serving member of the RUC) were killed and 63 were injured. Former school headmaster Ronnie Hill was seriously injured in the bombing and slipped into a coma two days later, remaining in this condition for more than a decade before his death in December 2000. The IRA eventually[when?] apologised for what it claimed had been a mistake and that its target had been the British soldiers parading to the memorial.[citation needed] The unit that carried out the bombing was disbanded.[when?] Loyalist paramilitaries responded to the bombing with revenge attacks on Catholics, mostly civilians. Another bomb had been planted at nearby Tullyhommon at a parallel Remembrance Day commemoration but failed to detonate. \c\cIn March 1988, three IRA volunteers who were planning a bombing were shot dead by the SAS at a Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue in Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory attached to the south of Spain. This became known as Operation Flavius. Their funeral at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast was attacked by Michael Stone, a UDA member who threw grenades as the coffin was lowered and shot at people who chased him. Stone killed three people, including IRA volunteer Kevin Brady. Stone was jailed for life the following year, but was freed 11 years later under the Good Friday Agreement. Two British Army corporals, David Howes and Derek Wood, drove into Brady's funeral in Andersonstown in a civilian car and clothes, with their guns in their car. They were kidnapped, taken away and shot dead by the IRA. This became known as the Corporals killings. \c\cIn September 1989, the IRA used a time bomb to attack the Royal Marine Depot, Deal in Kent, killing 11 bandsmen. \c\cTowards the end of the decade, the British Army tried to soften its public appearance to residents in communities such as Derry in order to improve relations between the local community and the military. Soldiers were told not to use the telescopic sights on their rifles to scan the streets, as civilians believed they were being aimed at. Soldiers were also encouraged to wear berets when manning checkpoints (and later other situations) rather than helmets, which were perceived as militaristic and hostile. The system of complaints was overhauled – if civilians believed they were being harassed or abused by soldiers in the streets or during searches and made a complaint, they would never find out what action (if any) was taken. The new regulations required an officer to visit the complainants house to inform them of the outcome of their complaint. \c\cIn the 1980s, loyalist paramilitary groups, including the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Resistance, imported arms and explosives from South Africa. The weapons obtained were divided between the UDA, the UVF and Ulster Resistance, although some of the weaponry (such as rocket-propelled grenades) were hardly used. In 1987, the Irish People's Liberation Organisation (IPLO), a breakaway faction of the INLA, engaged in a bloody feud against the INLA which weakened the INLA's presence in some areas. By 1992, the IPLO was destroyed by the Provisionals for its involvement in drug dealing thus ending the feud. \c\cStarting in the late 1980s, while the IRA continued its armed campaign, its political wing Sinn Féin, led since 1983 by Gerry Adams, sought a negotiated end to the conflict, although Adams accurately predicted that this would be a very long process. He predicted the war would last another 20 years. He conducted open talks with John Hume – the SDLP leader – and secret talks with government officials. Loyalists were also engaged in behind-the-scenes talks to end the violence, connecting with the British and Irish governments through Protestant clergy, in particular the Presbyterian minister, Reverend Roy Magee and Anglican Archbishop Robin Eames.[citation needed]\c\cThe IRA's South Armagh Brigade had made the countryside village of Crossmaglen their stronghold since the 1970s. The surrounding villages of Silverbridge, Cullyhanna, Cullaville, Forkhill, Jonesborough and Creggan were also IRA strongholds. In February 1978, a British Army Gazelle helicopter was shot down near Silverbridge, killing Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden-Lloyd. \c\cIn the 1990s, the IRA came up with a new plan to restrict British Army foot patrols near Crossmaglen. They developed two sniper teams to attack British Army and RUC patrols. They usually fired from an improvised armoured car using a .50 BMG calibre M82 sniper rifle. Signs were put up around South Armagh reading "Sniper at Work". The snipers killed a total of nine members of the security forces: seven soldiers and two constables. The last to be killed before the Good Friday Agreement, was a British soldier, bombardier Steven Restorick. \c\cThe IRA had developed the capacity to attack helicopters in South Armagh and elsewhere since the 1980s, including the 1990 shootdown of a Gazelle flying over the border between Tyrone and Monaghan; there were no fatalities in that incident. \c\cAnother incident involving British helicopters in South Armagh was the Battle of Newry Road in September 1993. Two other helicopters, a British Army Lynx and a Royal Air Force Puma were shot down by improvised mortar fire in 1994. The IRA set up checkpoints in South Armagh during this period, unchallenged by the security forces. \c\cOn 7 February 1991, the IRA attempted to assassinate prime minister John Major and his war cabinet by launching a mortar at 10 Downing Street while they were gathered there to discuss the Gulf War. The mortar bombing caused only four injuries, two to police officers, while the prime minister and the entire war cabinet were unharmed. \c\cAfter a prolonged period of background political manoeuvring, during which the Baltic Exchange and Bishopsgate bombings occurred in London, both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared ceasefires in 1994. \c\cThe year leading up to the ceasefires included a mass shooting in Castlerock, in which four people were killed. The IRA responded with the Shankill Road bombing in October 1993, which aimed to kill the UDA leadership, but instead killed eight Protestant civilian shoppers and a low-ranking UDA member, as well as one of the perpetrators, who was killed when the bomb detonated prematurely. The UDA responded with attacks in nationalist areas including a mass shooting in Greysteel, in which eight civilians were killed – six Catholics and two Protestants. \c\cOn 16 June 1994, just before the ceasefires, the Irish National Liberation Army killed three UVF members in a gun attack on the Shankill Road. In revenge, three days later, the UVF killed six civilians in a shooting at a pub in Loughinisland, County Down. The IRA, in the remaining month before its ceasefire, killed four senior loyalist paramilitaries, three from the UDA and one from the UVF. On 31 August 1994, the IRA declared a ceasefire. The loyalist paramilitaries, temporarily united in the "Combined Loyalist Military Command", reciprocated six weeks later. Although these ceasefires failed in the short run, they marked an effective end to large-scale political violence, as they paved the way for the final ceasefires. \c\cIn 1995, the United States appointed George J. Mitchell as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Mitchell was recognised as being more than a token envoy and as representing a President (Bill Clinton) with a deep interest in events. The British and Irish governments agreed that Mitchell would chair an international commission on disarmament of paramilitary groups. \c\cOn 9 February 1996, less than two years after the declaration of the ceasefire, the IRA revoked it with the Docklands bombing in the Canary Wharf area of London, killing two people, injuring 39 others, and causing £85 million in damage to the city's financial centre. Sinn Féin blamed the failure of the ceasefire on the British Government's refusal to begin all-party negotiations until the IRA decommissioned its weapons. \c\cThe attack was followed by several more, most notably the 1996 Manchester bombing, which destroyed a large area of the centre of the city on 15 June. It was the largest bomb attack in Britain since World War II. While the attack avoided any fatalities due to a telephone warning and the rapid response of the emergency services, over 200 people were injured in the attack, many of them outside the established cordon. The damage caused by the blast was estimated at £411 million. Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick, the last British soldier killed during the Troubles, was shot dead at a checkpoint on the Green Rd near Bessbrook on 12 February 1997 by the IRA's South Armagh sniper. \c\cThe IRA reinstated their ceasefire in July 1997, as negotiations for the document that became known as the Good Friday Agreement began without Sinn Féin. In September of the same year Sinn Féin signed the Mitchell Principles and were admitted to the talks. The UVF was the first paramilitary grouping to split as a result of their ceasefire, spawning the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) in 1996. In December 1997, the INLA assassinated LVF leader Billy Wright, leading to a series of revenge killings by loyalist groups. A group split from the Provisional IRA and formed the Real IRA (RIRA). \c\cIn August 1998, a Real IRA bomb in Omagh killed 29 civilians, the most by a single bomb during the Troubles. This bombing discredited "dissident republicans" and their campaigns in the eyes of many who had previously supported the Provisionals\' campaign. They became small groups with little influence, but still capable of violence. \c\cThe INLA also declared a ceasefire after the Belfast Agreement of 1998. Since then, most paramilitary violence has been directed at their "own" communities and at other factions within their organisations. The UDA, for example, has feuded with their fellow loyalists the UVF on two occasions since 2000. There have been internal struggles for power between "brigade commanders" and involvement in organised crime. \c\cProvisional IRA members have since been accused or convicted of involvement in the killings of Robert McCartney, Matthew Burns, James Curran, and Andrew Kearney, among others. \c\cAfter the ceasefires, talks began between the main political parties in Northern Ireland to establish political agreement. These talks led to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of "power-sharing". In 1999, an executive was formed consisting of the four main parties, including Sinn Féin. Other important changes included the reform of the RUC, renamed as the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which was required to recruit at least a 50% quota of Catholics for ten years, and the removal of Diplock courts under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007. \c\cA security normalisation process also began as part of the treaty, which comprised the progressive closing of redundant British Army barracks, border observation towers, and the withdrawal of all forces taking part in Operation Banner – including the resident battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment – that would be replaced by an infantry brigade, deployed in ten sites around Northern Ireland but with no operative role in the province. \c\cThe power-sharing Executive and Assembly were suspended in 2002, when unionists withdrew following "Stormontgate", a controversy over allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont. There were ongoing tensions about the Provisional IRA's failure to disarm fully and sufficiently quickly. IRA decommissioning has since been completed (in September 2005) to the satisfaction of most parties. \c\cA feature of Northern Ireland politics since the Agreement has been the eclipse in electoral terms of parties such as the SDLP and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), by rival parties such as Sinn Féin and the DUP. Similarly, although political violence is greatly reduced, sectarian animosity has not disappeared. Residential areas are more segregated between Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists than ever. Thus, progress towards restoring the power-sharing institutions was slow and tortuous. On 8 May 2007, devolved government returned to Northern Ireland. DUP leader Ian Paisley and Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness took office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively. \c\cThere were many incidents of collusion between the British state security forces (the British Army and RUC) and loyalist paramilitaries. This included soldiers and policemen taking part in loyalist attacks while off-duty, giving weapons and intelligence to loyalists, not taking action against them, and hindering police investigations. The De Silva Report found that, during the 1980s, 85% of the intelligence loyalists used to target people came from the security forces, who in turn also had double agents and informers within loyalist groups who organised attacks on the orders of, or with the knowledge of, their handlers. Of the 210 loyalists arrested by the Stevens Inquiries team, all but three were found to be state agents or informers. \c\cThe British Army's locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) was almost wholly Protestant. Despite recruits being vetted, some loyalist militants managed to enlist; mainly to obtain weapons, training and information. A 1973 British Government document (uncovered in 2004), Subversion in the UDR, suggested that 5–15% of UDR soldiers then were members of loyalist paramilitaries. The report said the UDR was the main source of weapons for those groups, although by 1973 UDR weapons losses had dropped significantly, partly due to stricter controls. In 1977, the Army investigated a UDR battalion based at Girdwood Barracks, Belfast. The investigation found that 70 soldiers had links to the UVF, that thirty soldiers had fraudulently diverted up to £47,000 to the UVF, and that UVF members socialized with soldiers in their mess. Following this, two were dismissed. The investigation was halted after a senior officer claimed it was harming morale. By 1990, at least 197 UDR soldiers had been convicted of loyalist terrorist offences and other serious crimes, including 19 convicted of murder. This was only a small fraction of those who served in it, but the proportion was higher than the regular British Army, the RUC and the civilian population. \c\cDuring the 1970s, the Glenanne gang—a secret alliance of loyalist militants, British soldiers and RUC officers—carried out a string of gun and bomb attacks against nationalists in an area of Northern Ireland known as the "murder triangle". It also carried out some attacks in the Republic, killing about 120 people in total, mostly uninvolved civilians. The Cassel Report investigated 76 murders attributed to the group and found evidence that soldiers and policemen were involved in 74 of those. One member, RUC officer John Weir, claimed his superiors knew of the collusion but allowed it to continue. The Cassel Report also said some senior officers knew of the crimes but did nothing to prevent, investigate or punish. Attacks attributed to the group include the Dublin and Monaghan bombings (1974), the Miami Showband killings (1975) and the Reavey and O\'Dowd killings (1976). \c\cThe Stevens Inquiries found that elements of the security forces had used loyalists as "proxies", who, via, double-agents and informers, had helped loyalist groups to kill targeted individuals, usually suspected republicans but civilians were also killed, intentionally and otherwise. The inquiries concluded this had intensified and prolonged the conflict. The British Army's Force Research Unit (FRU) was the main agency involved. Brian Nelson, the UDA's chief \'intelligence officer\', was a FRU agent. Through Nelson, FRU helped loyalists target people for assassination. FRU commanders say they helped loyalists target only suspected or known republican activists and prevented the killing of civilians. The Inquiries found evidence only two lives were saved and that Nelson/FRU was responsible for at least 30 murders and many other attacks – many on civilians. One victim was solicitor Pat Finucane. Nelson also supervised the shipping of weapons to loyalists in 1988. From 1992 to 1994, loyalists were responsible for more deaths than republicans, partly due to FRU. Members of the security forces tried to obstruct the Stevens investigation. \c\cA Police Ombudsman report from 2007 revealed that UVF members had been allowed to commit a string of terrorist offences, including murder, while working as informers for RUC Special Branch. It found that Special Branch had given informers immunity by ensuring they were not caught or convicted, and blocking weapons searches. Ombudsman Nuala O\'Loan concluded that this had led to "hundreds" of deaths and said senior British Government officials pressured her into halting her investigation. UVF member Robin Jackson has been linked to between 50 and 100 killings in Northern Ireland, although he was never convicted for any. It is alleged by many, including members of the security forces, that Jackson was an RUC agent. The Irish Government's Barron Report alleged that he also "had relationships with British Intelligence". In 2016, a new Ombudsman report concluded that there had been collusion between the police and the UVF in relation to the deaths of six Catholic men in the 1994 Loughinisland massacre, and that the investigation was undermined by the wish to protect informers, but found no evidence police had foreknowledge of the attack. \c\cThe Smithwick Tribunal concluded that a member of the Garda Síochána (the Republic of Ireland's police force) colluded with the IRA in the killing of two senior RUC officers in 1989. The two officers were ambushed by the IRA near Jonesborough, County Armagh when returning from a cross-border security conference in Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland. \c\cDuring the 1970s and 1980s, republican and loyalist paramilitaries abducted a number of individuals, many alleged to have been informers, who were then killed and secretly buried. Eighteen people—two women and sixteen men—including one British Army officer, were kidnapped and killed during the Troubles. They are referred to informally as "The Disappeared". All but one, Lisa Dorrian, were abducted and killed by republicans. Dorrian is believed to have been abducted by loyalists. The remains of all but four of "The Disappeared" have been recovered and turned over to their families. \c\cBritish government security forces, including the Military Reaction Force (MRF), carried out what have been described as "extrajudicial killings" of unarmed civilians. Their victims were often Catholic or suspected Catholic civilians unaffiliated with any paramilitaries, such as the Whiterock Road shooting of two unarmed Catholic civilians by British soldiers on 15 April 1972, and the Andersonstown shooting of seven unarmed Catholic civilians  on 12 May that same year. A member of the MRF stated in 1978 that the Army often attempted false flag sectarian attacks, thus provoking sectarian conflict and "taking the heat off the Army". A former member stated: "[W]e were not there to act like an army unit, we were there to act like a terror group."\c\cRepublicans allege that the security forces operated a shoot-to-kill policy rather than arresting IRA suspects. The security forces denied this and pointed out that six of the eight IRA men killed in the Loughgall ambush in 1987 were heavily armed. On the other hand, the shooting of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar by the Special Air Service ten months later appeared to confirm suspicions among republicans, and in the British and Irish media, of a tacit British shoot-to-kill policy of suspected IRA members. \c\cInter-communal tensions rise and violence often breaks out during the "marching season" when the Protestant Orange Order parades take place across Northern Ireland. The parades are held to commemorate William of Orange's victory in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, which secured the Protestant Ascendancy and British rule in Ireland. One particular flashpoint which has caused continuous annual strife is the Garvaghy Road area in Portadown, where an Orange parade from Drumcree Church passes through a mainly nationalist estate off the Garvaghy Road. This parade has now been banned indefinitely, following nationalist riots against the parade, and also loyalist counter-riots against its banning. \c\cIn 1995, 1996 and 1997, there were several weeks of prolonged rioting throughout Northern Ireland over the impasse at Drumcree. A number of people died in this violence, including a Catholic taxi driver, killed by the Loyalist Volunteer Force, and three (of four) nominally Catholic brothers (from a mixed-religion family) died when their house in Ballymoney was petrol-bombed. \c\cThe impact of the Troubles on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland has been compared to that of the Blitz on the people of London. The stress resulting from bomb attacks, street disturbances, security checkpoints, and the constant military presence had the strongest effect on children and young adults. There was also the fear that local paramilitaries instilled in their respective communities with the punishment beatings, "romperings", and the occasional tarring and feathering meted out to individuals for various purported infractions. \c\cIn addition to the violence and intimidation, there was chronic unemployment and a severe housing shortage. Many people were rendered homeless as a result of intimidation or having their houses burnt, and urban redevelopment played a role in the social upheaval. Belfast families faced being transferred to new, alien estates when older, decrepit districts such as Sailortown and the Pound Loney were being demolished. According to social worker and author Sarah Nelson, this new social problem of homelessness and disorientation contributed to the breakdown of the normal fabric of society, allowing for paramilitaries to exert a strong influence in certain districts. Vandalism was also a major problem. In the 1970s there were 10,000 vandalised empty houses in Belfast alone. Most of the vandals were aged between eight and thirteen. \c\cAccording to one historian of the conflict, the stress of the Troubles engendered a breakdown in the previously strict sexual morality of Northern Ireland, resulting in a "confused hedonism" in respect of personal life. In Derry, illegitimate births and alcoholism increased for women and the divorce rate rose. Teenage alcoholism was also a problem, partly as a result of the drinking clubs established in both loyalist and republican areas. In many cases, there was little parental supervision of children in some of the poorer districts. The Department of Health has looked at a report written in 2007 by Mike Tomlinson of Queen's University, which asserted that the legacy of the Troubles has played a substantial role in the current rate of suicide in Northern Ireland. \c\cFurther social issues arising from the Troubles include antisocial behavior and an aversion towards political participation. According to one historian, children raised during the Troubles were found to develop similar antisocial external behaviors as children similarly born in regions of conflict, notably those born and raised during World War II. Further studies into the impact of violence on the psychological development of children in Northern Ireland also found that those raised during the Troubles were more likely to be averse towards political participation, noting that while older generations still actively associated with their own social and political groups, younger generations became wary of such groups as social and political divisions continued to expand during the thirty years of the Troubles. \c\cAccording to the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), 3,532 people were killed as a result of the conflict between 1969 and 2001. Of these, 3,489 were killed up to 1998. According to the book Lost Lives (2006 edition), 3,720 people were killed as a result of the conflict, from 1966 to 2006. Of these, 3,635 were killed up to 1998. There are reports that 257 of the victims were children under the age of seventeen, representing 7.2% of all the total during this period. Other reports state that a total of 274 children under the age of eighteen were killed during the conflict. \c\cIn The Politics of Antagonism: Understanding Northern Ireland, Brendan O\'Leary and John McGarry point out that "nearly two per cent of the population of Northern Ireland have been killed or injured through political violence [...] If the equivalent ratio of victims to population had been produced in Great Britain in the same period some 100,000 people would have died, and if a similar level of political violence had taken place, the number of fatalities in the USA would have been over 500,000". Using this relative comparison to the US, analyst John M. Gates suggests that whatever one calls the conflict, it was "certainly not" a "low intensity conflict". \c\cIn 2010 it was estimated that 107,000 people in Northern Ireland suffered some physical injury as a result of the conflict. On the basis of data gathered by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, the Victims Commission estimated that the conflict resulted in 500,000 \'victims\' in Northern Ireland alone. It defines \'victims\' are those who are directly affected by \'bereavement\', \'physical injury\' or \'trauma\' as a result of the conflict. \c\cApproximately 60% of the dead were killed by republicans, 30% by loyalists and 10% by British security forces. \c\cAccording to Malcolm Sutton's Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland:\c\cOf those killed by British security forces:\c\c186 (~51.2%) were civilians\c\c146 (~40.2%) were members of republican paramilitaries\c\c18 (~5.0%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries\c\c13 (~3.6%) were fellow members of the British security forces\c\cOf those killed by republican paramilitaries:\c\c1080 (~52.5%) were members/former members of the British security forces\c\c721 (~35.1%) were civilians\c\c188 (~9.2%) were members of republican paramilitaries\c\c57 (~2.8%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries\c\c11 (~0.5%) were members of the Irish security forces\c\cOf those killed by loyalist paramilitaries:\c\c878 (~85.5%) were civilians\c\c94 (~9.2%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries\c\c41 (~4.0%) were members of republican paramilitaries\c\c14 (~1.4%) were members of the British security forces\c\cApproximately 52% of the dead were civilians, 32% were members or former members of the British security forces, 11% were members of republican paramilitaries, and 5% were members of loyalist paramilitaries. About 60% of the civilian casualties were Catholics, 30% of the civilians were Protestants, and the rest were from outside Northern Ireland. \c\cOf the civilian casualties, 48% were killed by loyalists, 39% were killed by republicans, and 10% were killed by the British security forces. Most of the Catholic civilians were killed by loyalists, and most of the Protestant civilians were killed by republicans. \c\cIt has been the subject of dispute whether some individuals were members of paramilitary organisations. Several casualties that were listed as civilians were later claimed by the IRA as their members. One Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and three Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) members killed during the conflict were also Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers at the time of their deaths. At least one civilian victim was an off-duty member of the Territorial Army. \c\cMost killings took place within Northern Ireland, especially in Belfast and County Armagh. Most of the killings in Belfast took place in the west and north of the city. Dublin, London and Birmingham were also affected, albeit to a lesser degree than Northern Ireland itself. Occasionally, the IRA attempted or carried out attacks on British targets in Gibraltar, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Clashes began on 6 May 2021 between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police over a planned Supreme Court of Israel decision regarding evictions of Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood of East Jerusalem. Coinciding with the holidays of Laylat al-Qadr and Jerusalem Day, the clashes have injured more than 300 people, mostly Palestinian civilians. The attacks drew international condemnation and resulted in a delay of the Supreme Court ruling by 30 days as Avichai Mandelblit, Attorney General of Israel, sought to reduce tensions. \c\cOn 9 May, Israeli police stormed the al-Aqsa Mosque, a major holy site to Muslims, ahead of a flag march by far-right Jewish nationalists that was later canceled. In response, on 10 and 11 May, Hamas and the Islamic Jihad fired 480 rockets into Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces, hitting homes and a school, killing two Israeli civilians and injuring at least 70 Israeli civilians. Israel responded with airstrikes into Gaza, and according to Gaza officials at least 30 Palestinians were killed, including ten children, and 203 more were wounded. According to the Israel Defense Forces, at least fifteen of those killed were members of Hamas, and many others were killed by Palestinian rockets. On 11 May, Israeli airstrikes caused a 13-story residential tower in Gaza to collapse. \c\cThe disputed land was bought by Jewish trusts from Arab landowners in the 1870s. In 1956 the Jordanian government, in cooperation with the United Nations\' organization for refugees, UNRWA, housed 28 Palestinian refugee families with tenancy rights in a compound on land that Jordan managed as Custodian of Enemy Property and which formerly belonged to these Jewish trusts. After the Six-Day War, the area fell under Israeli occupation. In 1972, the Israeli Custodian General registered the properties under the Jewish trusts, which in turn demanded that the Palestinian tenants there pay the trusts rent. Eviction orders began to occur in the 1990s. The Jewish trusts sold the homes to a right-wing settler organization, who have since made repeated attempts to evict the Palestinian residents. Under Israeli land and property laws, Israelis have the right to reclaim properties in East Jerusalem owned by Jews before the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, but no similar law exists that would allow Palestinians to claim their lost property inside Israel during the hostilities. The Sheikh Jarrah district houses the descendants of refugees expelled or displaced in 1948 in the Nakba. According to the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, this approach to property rights is unacceptable in international law, and some analysts argue that the precedent set by these measures to resume Jewish property rights in East Jerusalem would open the gate to Palestinians to claim entitlement to the restitution of their properties in West Jerusalem taken during the 1948 war. \c\cIn 2010, the Supreme Court of Israel rejected an appeal by Palestinian families who had resided in 57 housing units in the area of Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem, who had petitioned the court to have their ownership to the properties recognized. In 2021 Israel's Supreme Court was expected to deliver a ruling on whether to uphold the eviction of six Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood on 10 May 2021. \c\cItamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right Israeli politician, visited Sheikh Jarrah shortly before the clashes began, where he claimed that the houses belonged to Jews and told police to "open fire" on protesters. Agence France-Presse reported that Israeli settlers had been seen in Sheikh Jarrah openly carrying assault rifles and revolvers leading up to the clashes. Previous clashes had begun following the Israeli government's closure of the Damascus Gate, a popular place for Muslims to gather during Ramadan, and when the Israeli government imposed a 10,000-person limit on people praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque. \c\cPalestinian protesters were also frustrated with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's decision to postpone the 2021 Palestinian legislative election, believing he had done so to avoid political defeat for his party Fatah. \c\cPalestinians and Israeli settlers first clashed on 6 May in Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families were at risk of being evicted. Palestinian protesters had been holding nightly outdoor iftars. On May 6, Israeli settlers and Otzma Yehudit setup a table across the street from Palestinians. Social media videos showed both sides hurling rocks and chairs at each other. Israeli police intervened and arrested at least 7 people. \c\cFurther clashes followed at the al-Aqsa Mosque. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said 136 people were wounded across Jerusalem that evening, and the Israeli government said six police officers were also wounded. \c\cMore clashes occurred on 8 May, the date of the Islamic holy night of Laylat al-Qadr. Palestinian crowds threw stones, lit fires, and chanted "Strike Tel Aviv" and “In spirit and in blood, we will redeem al-Aqsa”, which The Times of Israel described as in support of Hamas. The Israel Police, wearing riot gear and some on horseback, used stun grenades and water cannons. At least 80 people were injured. \c\cOn the morning of 9 May, Israeli forces stormed the al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest site, injuring hundreds. Palestinians threw rocks, firecrackers, and heavy objects, while Israeli police fired stun grenades, tear gas, and rubber bullets at worshippers. The storming came ahead of a Jerusalem Day flag march by Jewish nationalists through the Old City. At least 215 Palestinians were injured, 153 of whom were hospitalised. Militants in Gaza fired rockets into Israel the following night. \c\cDuring the evening and night of 10 May, Arab rioters in Lod threw stones and firebombs at Jewish homes, a school, and a synagogue, later attacking a hospital. Shots were fired at the rioters, killing one and wounding two; a Jewish suspect in the shooting was arrested. \c\cWidespread protests and riots intensified across Israel, particularly in cities with a large Arab population. On 11 May, Mayor of Lod Yair Revivio urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to deploy Israeli Border Police in the city, saying that the city had "completely lost control" and describing it as "near civil war". \c\cThe city of Lod is in a state of emergency. \c\cHamas demanded Israel remove its forces from Al-Aqsa mosque by May 10, 6pm. Minutes after the deadline passed, Hamas fired more than 150 rockets into Israel from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that seven rockets were fired toward Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh and that one was intercepted. An anti-tank missile was also fired at an Israeli civilian vehicle, injuring the driver. \c\cIn response, Israel launched air strikes in the Gaza strip on the same day. According to health authorities in Gaza, 32 Palestinians were killed, ten of whom were children, and 103 more were wounded. A Hamas commander, identified as Mohammed Abdullah Fayyad, as well as two high-ranking Islamic Jihad commanders were also killed. Another Hamas member was killed on 11 May. It is disputed whether the victims died as a result of an Israeli airstrike or an errant Palestinian rocket. \c\cOn 11 May, Hamas and Islamic Jihad responded to the Israeli raids, launching hundreds of rockets at Ashdod and Ashkelon, killing two people and wounding more than 90 others. Hamas claimed that they fired their "largest ever barrage", firing 137 rockets in five minutes. A third Israeli woman from Rishon LeZion was also killed. \c\cThe 13-story residential Hanadi Tower in Gaza collapsed on 11 May after being hit by an Israeli airstrike. The IDF said the building contained offices used by Hamas, and said it gave "advance warning to civilians in the building and provided sufficient time for them to evacuate the site". Hamas and the Islamic Jihad responded by firing 130 rockets at Tel Aviv. \c\cAn Israeli state-owned oil pipeline was hit by a rocket on 11 May. \c\cOn 9 May 2021, the Israeli Supreme Court delayed the expected decision on evictions for 30 days, after an intervention from Attorney General of Israel Avichai Mandelblit. Israel Police also banned Jews from going to the al-Aqsa plaza for Jerusalem Day festivities. On 10 May, Israel closed the Kerem Shalom border crossing, including for humanitarian aid. Due to rocket fire on 11 May, the Israel Airports Authority briefly halted air travel. \c\cIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the actions of the Israeli police and said that Israel "shall not allow any radical element to undermine the calm". He also said "we firmly reject the pressure not to build in Jerusalem". Israeli officials asked the Biden administration not to intervene in the situation. \c\cOn 10 May 2021, President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, issued a statement that the "brutal storming and assault on worshipers in the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and its courtyards is a new challenge to the international community". \c\cA spokesman for the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine said that Israel "started the aggression on Jerusalem. If this aggression does not end, there is no point to diplomatic efforts to reach a cease-fire". Hamas gave an ultimatum to the Israel government, saying if they did not remove forces from the mosque by 2 a.m. on 11 May, then they would conduct another rocket strike. \c\cA large crowd of Israeli Jews gathered around a fire near the mosque on 10 May, chanting yimakh shemam. IfNotNow co-founder Simone Zimmerman criticized them as exhibiting "genocidal animus towards Palestinians — emboldened and unfiltered". \c\cNetanyahu convened an emergency security meeting on 11 May and schools in several parts of Israel were closed. \c\cOn 9 May, the Muslim Association of Britain organised protests in London, Manchester, Birmingham, and Bradford, in opposition to the potential evictions. \c\cOn 10 May, thousands of Jordanians protested outside the Israeli embassy in Amman. \c\cOn 10 May, thousands of Turks, Syrians, and Palestinians protested outside the Israeli consulate in Istanbul. \c\cOn 11 May, hundreds of South Africans held a pro-Palestinian protest in Cape Town. \c\cOn 11 May, hundreds of protesters held a pro-Palestinian protest in Brighton. \c\cPro-Israeli and pro-Palestine protesters in Manhattan clashed on 11 May. \c\cA pro-Palestinian demonstration was held on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C. on the afternoon of 11 May. \c\cThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and American Muslims for Palestine organised a pro-Palestinian protest outside the State Department in Washington, D.C. on 11 May. The protest was attended by Representatives Rashida Tlaib and André Carson. \c\cInstagram and Twitter users who had written in support of the Palestinians said their posts had been deleted or their accounts had been suspended. The companies apologized and blamed the situation on a technical glitch.

Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod on 11 May, marking the first time since 1966 that Israel had used emergency powers over an Arab community. Minister of Public Security Amir Ohana said he will implement the emergency orders. \c\cSeveral Palestinians reported receiving text messages from Israeli military intelligence reading "Hello! You have been identified to have partaken in acts of violence at Al-Aqsa Mosque. You will be held accountable". \c\cHamas demanded Israel remove its forces from Al-Aqsa mosque by May 10, 6pm. Minutes after the deadline passed, Hamas fired more than 150 rockets into Israel from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that seven rockets were fired toward Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh and that one was intercepted. An anti-tank missile was also fired at an Israeli civilian vehicle, injuring the driver. \c\cIn response, Israel launched air strikes in the Gaza strip on the same day. According to Gaza's Ministry of Health, forty-three Palestinians were killed during the strikes, and 290 more were wounded. Among the dead there were 13 children, three civilian women; and five farmers who were killed after their farm was bombed. A Hamas commander, identified as Mohammed Abdullah Fayyad, as well as two high-ranking Islamic Jihad commanders were also killed. Another Hamas member was killed on 11 May. It is disputed whether the victims died as a result of an Israeli airstrike or an errant Palestinian rocket. \c\cOn 11 May, Hamas and Islamic Jihad responded to the Israeli raids, launching hundreds of rockets at Ashdod and Ashkelon, killing two people and wounding more than 90 others. Hamas claimed that they fired their "largest ever barrage", firing 137 rockets in five minutes. A third Israeli woman from Rishon LeZion was also killed. \c\cThe 13-story residential Hanadi Tower in Gaza collapsed on 11 May after being hit by an Israeli airstrike. The IDF said the building contained offices used by Hamas, and said it gave "advance warning to civilians in the building and provided sufficient time for them to evacuate the site". Hamas and the Islamic Jihad responded by firing 130 rockets at Tel Aviv. \c\cAn Israeli state-owned oil pipeline was hit by a rocket on 11 May. \c\cOn 12 May, the Israeli Air Force destroyed dozens of police and security installations along the Gaza Strip; Hamas said its police headquarters were among the targets destroyed. Over 850 rockets were launched from Gaza into Israel on 12 May. \c\cOn 9 May 2021, the Israeli Supreme Court delayed the expected decision on evictions for 30 days, after an intervention from Attorney General of Israel Avichai Mandelblit. Israel Police also banned Jews from going to the al-Aqsa plaza for Jerusalem Day festivities. On 10 May, Israel closed the Kerem Shalom border crossing, including for humanitarian aid. Due to rocket fire on 11 May, the Israel Airports Authority briefly halted air travel. \c\cIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the actions of the Israeli police and said that Israel "shall not allow any radical element to undermine the calm". He also said "we firmly reject the pressure not to build in Jerusalem". Israeli officials asked the Biden administration not to intervene in the situation. \c\cOn 10 May 2021, President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, issued a statement that the "brutal storming and assault on worshipers in the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and its courtyards is a new challenge to the international community". \c\cA spokesman for the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine said that Israel "started the aggression on Jerusalem. If this aggression does not end, there is no point to diplomatic efforts to reach a cease-fire". Hamas gave an ultimatum to the Israel government, saying if they did not remove forces from the mosque by 2 a.m. on 11 May, then they would conduct another rocket strike. \c\cA large crowd of Israeli Jews gathered around a fire near the mosque on 10 May, chanting yimakh shemam. IfNotNow co-founder Simone Zimmerman criticized them as exhibiting "genocidal animus towards Palestinians — emboldened and unfiltered". \c\cNetanyahu convened an emergency security meeting on 11 May and schools in several parts of Israel were closed. \c\cOn 9 May, the Muslim Association of Britain organised protests in London, Manchester, Birmingham, and Bradford, in opposition to the potential evictions. \c\cOn 10 May, thousands of Jordanians protested outside the Israeli embassy in Amman. \c\cOn 10 May, thousands of Turks, Syrians, and Palestinians protested outside the Israeli consulate in Istanbul. Protesters gathered in Turkey despite the complete closure due to Covid-19, with Palestinian and Turkish flags in their hands, "Turkish army go to Gaza!" shouted slogans in the form. \c\cOn 11 May, hundreds of South Africans held a pro-Palestinian protest in Cape Town. \c\cOn 11 May, hundreds of protesters held a pro-Palestinian protest in Brighton. \c\cPro-Israeli and pro-Palestine protesters in Manhattan clashed on 11 May. \c\cA pro-Palestinian demonstration was held on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C. on the afternoon of 11 May. \c\cThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and American Muslims for Palestine organised a pro-Palestinian protest outside the State Department in Washington, D.C. on 11 May. The protest was attended by Representatives Rashida Tlaib and André Carson. \c\cInstagram and Twitter users who had written in support of the Palestinians said their posts had been deleted or their accounts had been suspended. The companies apologized and blamed the situation on a technical glitch. \c\cA video circulated on social media showing Israelis celebrating at the Western Wall, whilst a tree in the background, at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, was on fire. The Intercept described the video as "unsettling" and an example of "ultranationalist frenzy". Ayman Odeh, an MK for the Joint List said the video was "shocking". Journalist David Patrikarakos described the video as an example of "fake news", on the grounds that singing and dancing are a part of annual Jerusalem Day celebrations and that the fire was started by Palestinian protesters throwing firecrackers.
On 6 May 2021, protests by Palestinians began in Jerusalem over a planned decision by the Supreme Court of Israel regarding the eviction of Palestinian residents in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighbourhood of East Jerusalem. The protests quickly escalated into violent skirmishes with Israeli settlers. The following day, Israeli police forces stormed the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a major Islamic holy site, in response to violent Palestinian protests. Coinciding with the Islamic day of significance of Laylat al-Qadr and Israel's Jerusalem Day, the violence injured more than 300 people, most of whom were Palestinian civilians, and drew international condemnation. The Israeli Supreme Court ruling was then delayed for 30 days as Avichai Mandelblit, the Attorney General of Israel, sought to reduce tensions. \c\cThe raid by Israeli police occurred ahead of a planned flag march by far-right Jewish nationalists that was later cancelled. On 10 May, in response to the unrest in Jerusalem, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad began firing rockets into Israel, hitting multiple residences and a school. Israel responded to the rocket attacks with airstrikes inside the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. On 11 May, after evacuation warnings, Israeli airstrikes targeted a 13-story residential tower in Gaza that contained a Hamas office, causing it to collapse. \c\cSince 10 May, at least 69 Palestinians have been killed, including at least 17 children, and seven Israelis have been killed, including one child. According to the Israel Defense Forces, at least 15 of the Palestinian casualties were confirmed to be Hamas militants, and some other Palestinian civilian casualties were caused by errant rocket launches within Gaza. As of 12 May 2021[update], both Israel and the Palestinian National Authority reported at least 300 Palestinian injuries in Gaza and over 200 Israeli injuries. 
COVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines are series of stay-at-home orders and cordon sanitaire measures implemented by the government of the Philippines through its Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). \c\cThe strictest of these community quarantines is the "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ), which effectively is a total lockdown. \c\cGiven the rapidly increasing number of cases in Metro Manila, Albay 2nd district representative Joey Salceda proposed a week-long lockdown of the region to prevent the disease from spreading nationwide. Salceda specifically proposed the closure of the Philippine expressway network and public transportation accessing the region, in addition to the suspension of classes and work. President Duterte initially rejected the proposal claiming it would "hamper the flow of basic commodities". Secretary Duque, however, raised the possibility of a lockdown on certain cities or towns if cases of community-based transmissions are reported, but not an entire region. On March 12, President Duterte announced a partial lockdown covering Metro Manila, that began on March 15. \c\cAt one point during President Rodrigo Duterte's pronouncement about the Metro Manila "community quarantine," he said that "they are afraid to call it a lockdown, but it is a lockdown." This statement left many confused. His cabinet secretary, Karlo Nograles, later made it clear that the proper term is "community quarantine" and the President's comment means that the event "is like a lockdown". Nograles further said that the term "lockdown" can lead to different interpretations, while "community quarantine" is a technical term that medical authorities can give meaning, which does not create public fear. \c\cWhen the "community quarantine" was applied to Luzon, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo, said that the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) is equivalent to an "absolute lockdown or total lockdown." Secretary Eduardo Año of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) also said that "enhanced community quarantine" should be considered as a "total lockdown."\c\cIn addition, President Duterte advised local government units outside of the National Capital Region to implement a community quarantine in cases where, in a given level of local government, at least two COVID-19 cases are confirmed within a lower level of its jurisdiction; for example, a province-wide quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two COVID-19 cases confirmed within different cities or municipalities in the same province, while a city/municipality-wide quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two COVID-19 cases confirmed within different barangays in the same city or municipality. Local government units were also authorized to utilize their quick response funds upon declaration of a state of emergency. \c\cThe national government has given local government units under enhanced community quarantine in Visayas and Mindanao and relevant field offices of the Department of Health the power to lift or extend the lockdown period in their jurisdiction. The imposition of a "localized lockdown" involving measures at the barangay, sitio, and/or purok level instead of fully lifting ECQs has been proposed. \c\cOn April 6, the following localities were under enhanced community quarantine: all regions of Luzon, Western Visayas, Caraga Region, Zamboanga Peninsula, Samar, Biliran, Cebu, Negros Oriental, Camiguin, Bukidnon, Sultan Kudarat, Lanao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Cotabato, South Cotabato, Tawi-Tawi, and the municipality of Catarman in Northern Samar. \c\cOn April 24, it was clarified that local government units can no longer impose quarantine measures without the consent of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). Prior to that period, localities could impose such measures with coordination with the DILG. President Rodrigo Duterte issued Executive Order 112, extending enhanced community quarantine in select localities until May 15 and imposing a general community quarantine in the rest of the country, also overriding existing quarantine measures by local government units, starting May 1. \c\cThe four main levels of community quarantine measures are the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), the modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ), the general community quarantine (GCQ), and the modified general community quarantine (MGCQ). Although exact measures per level may vary over time due to the government revising its guidelines, the strictest of these measures is the ECQ and the most lenient being the MGCQ. \c\cLocalities under an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) are generally ordered to stay at home, with its residents restricted from traveling to other cities or barangays. Barangay governments can issue quarantine passes allowing residents to buy essential goods outside curfew hours and within the issuing barangays\' jurisdiction. The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act which was effective in 2020 also provides measures related to the ECQ, such as:\c\cLimitations on an all forms of transportation\c\cWork suspensions and the setting up of alternative working arrangements such as teleworking\c\cEnsuring the supply of food and medical products\c\cMeasures against profiteering and hoarding of essential goods\c\cProvision allowing a 30-day grace period for loan and rental payments during the quarantine period\c\cCancellation of mass gatherings\c\cClosure of non-essential businesses\c\c24/7 opening of essential businesses and utilities in 100% operational capacity\c\cWhen ECQ was reintroduced in March 2021 in the Greater Manila Area (or NCR Plus as designated by the IATF-EID); new set of measures were observed. \c\cAll households are required observe strict home quarantine. Movement outside the place of residence is limited to Authorized Persons Outside Residence (APORs), those accessing essential goods and services, and workers in establishments allowed to operate. People aged 18-years below and above 65, people with comorbidities, and pregnant women are barred from going out their homes except to either obtain essential goods and services or to report for work. \c\cMass gatherings (more than 10 persons outside and non-household members indoors) and face-to-face classes are not allowed in ECQ zones. Religious gatherings and dine-in services are not allowed. Shopping malls are allowed to operate for essential services. \c\cLimitations on mass transportation. \c\cEssential and priority constructions projects are allowed to resume in accordance with Department of Public Works and Highways guidelines\c\cIn addition to front-line services (health and other emergency services); full operations is allowed for certain operations including agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and delivery and courier services of essential goods. \c\cLimited operations for certain sectors. \c\cUnlike in 2020, ECQ measures as of 2021 had more lenient restrictions on transportation allowing for operations of public transportation at a limited capacity. However, with the ECQ period in March-April 2021 coinciding with the Holy Week and late release of guidelines of the Department of Transportation, this resulted in the virtual absence of public transportation in some areas. \c\cThe general community quarantine (GCQ), which was introduced on May 1, is generally less stringent than ECQ. Public transportation is allowed at a reduced capacity and select businesses are allowed to operate at 50 to 100 percent of their regular capacity depending on their industry. Shopping malls are also allowed to operate, although only select stalls and stores are allowed to open. \c\cA level under GCQ, is called a modified general community quarantine (MGCQ).[citation needed]\c\cSporting activities has been allowed in areas under GCQ since July 2020, although live spectators are not allowed for sports events. \c\cThere are types of quarantine or lockdown measures aside from the ECQ and GCQ. Additional measures have been imposed under an "extensive enhanced community quarantine" or "extreme enhanced community quarantine" (EECQ). An EECQ is generally stricter than an ECQ. Prior to the imposition of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon, a more lenient measure, which includes a stay-at-home order and a curfew, was imposed in Metro Manila and was officially called a "community quarantine". \c\cSeveral LGUs has used the term "hard lockdown," which is an area under disease monitoring and mass testing for the virus. In May 2020, additional terms were coined by the government to categorize the community quarantine according to its risk assessment and those new terms are "modified enhanced community quarantine," "modified general community quarantine" and "new normal."\c\cA "total lockdown" measure, distinct from an ECQ, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving their places of residence and mandate the closure of all public establishments. According to presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, this measure is considered as an option. \c\cA "special concern lockdown" can be applied to only a portion of a barangay with a high concentration or clustering of active cases of COVID-19. It can be a road, a compound, or a block. \c\cA classification of measures called "new normal", a level under MGCQ, was introduced sometime in June 2020, but has not yet been used. An area needs to be placed under MGCQ prior to the imposition of new normal measures. \c\cThe enhanced community quarantine in Luzon covers the island of Luzon and its outlying islands, or eight out of seventeen regions of the Philippines. An indefinite enhanced community quarantine, was imposed in Caraga, alternatively known as One Shield Caraga, started on April 7, and in the Davao Region which took effect on April 4. \c\cProvinces that imposed an enhanced community quarantine include Iloilo (March 21), Antique (March 22), Negros Occidental (March 30), Cebu (March 30), and Negros Oriental (April 3). \c\cThe independent cities of Bacolod (March 30), Iloilo City (March 21), and Cebu City (March 28) also imposed ECQ measures. \c\cEnhanced community quarantines (ECQs) were extended in Metro Manila, Central Luzon (excluding Aurora), and Calabarzon regions as well as in the provinces of Benguet, Pangasinan, Iloilo, Cebu, and the cities of Bacolod and Davao until May 15 as per President Rodrigo Duterte's Executive Order 112. All other areas were placed under general community quarantine (GCQ) unless otherwise approved by the IATF-EID. Albay and Zamboanga City were also included among local government units placed under ECQ. The IATF-EID allows local government units, the imposition or extension of ECQ at a municipal or barangay level with the concurrence of their respective regional IATF-EID. \c\cThe municipality of San Jose remained under ECQ while the rest of Occidental Mindoro downgraded to GCQ. Marinduque and Bacolod also remained under ECQ. \c\cRequest to extend ECQs in the following areas were rejected by the IATF-EID: the provinces of Camarines Sur, La Union, Mountain Province, Isabela, Lanao del Norte, and Lanao del Sur, and the cities of Marawi and Butuan. \c\cOn May 12, 2020, it was originally announced that community quarantine measures will be lifted in 41 provinces and 11 cities across the country due to their being low risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but were eventually upgraded to modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) after receiving petitions from LGUs starting May 16. \c\cOn May 15, 2020, the IATF-EID approved the appeal of Mayor Lani Mercado-Revilla placing the city of Bacoor in the province of Cavite under modified enhanced community quarantine. \c\cThe IATF-EID issued Resolution No. 37, overriding prior plans, placing Metro Manila, the cities of Angeles and Bacoor, as well as the provinces of Laguna, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Zambales under modified enhanced community quarantine, which is more lenient than an ECQ but stricter than a GCQ. Cebu City and Mandaue were placed under ECQ while the rest of the country was placed under GCQ. The measure became effective on May 16 with quarantine measures to be reassessed on May 31. \c\cThe IATF-EID issued Resolution No. 41 to override prevailing quarantine measures in the country starting June 1. Measures in Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Central Visayas regions transitioned to general community quarantine (GCQ). GCQ remained in Cagayan Valley, Pangasinan (except Dagupan), Zamboanga City and Davao City, while the rest of the country was placed under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ). However, Marc Brian Lim, the city mayor of Dagupan, suspended the implementation of GCQ measures in the city to MGCQ as directed by the IATF-EID. This followed Dagupan recording 14 additional COVID-19 cases on May 31, the day prior the city was supposed to transition to MGCQ. Lim appealed to the IATF-EID for the task force to allow his city to remain under GCQ. \c\cDue to the sudden increase number of community transmissions in the area, the IATF-EID recommended the reimposition of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) to Cebu City starting on June 16, the most stringent lockdown-measure tier with the neighboring Talisay being reimposed under the modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ). Meanwhile, GCQ was extended or reimposed in the areas of Metro Manila, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Occidental Mindoro, the rest of Central Visayas, Zamboanga City and Davao City. \c\cOn June 23, the IATF-EID temporarily removed the "new normal" classification which meant that all areas in the country will still be under varying levels of community quarantine after the June 16–30 measures. \c\cThe GCQ were either reimposed or extended to the provinces of Benguet, Cavite, Leyte (except Tacloban), Rizal, Southern Leyte, and several parts of Cebu. Only Cebu City remained under ECQ as the city confirms more cases. \c\cOn July 15, quarantine measures continued to ease as Cebu City shifted to MECQ. Metro Manila remains under GCQ for another two weeks. Other areas under GCQ includes the provinces of Agusan del Norte, Basilan, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, and Southern Leyte, as well as the cities of Butuan, Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, Ormoc, and Zamboanga. The rest of the country shifts to MGCQ. \c\cQuarantine measures for August 1 to 15 were decided on July 30 and was announced on July 31. Cebu City's MECQ has finally been downgraded to GCQ. Other places that are still under GCQ includes: the Metro Manila, the provinces of Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal, the cities of Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, Talisay, and Zamboanga, and the municipalities of Consolacion and Minglanilla in Cebu. The rest of the country are still under MGCQ. \c\cOn August 2, the IATF-EID responded to the appeal of 40 medical societies led by the Philippine College of Physicians to place Metro Manila under ECQ again due to rising COVID-19 cases. The meeting later decided to place Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal back under MECQ from August 4 to 18. \c\cThe provinces of Batangas, Nueva Ecija, and Quezon in Luzon and Iloilo City in the Visayas were placed under GCQ again on August 16. While the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu, and Talisay, and the municipalities of Minglanilla and Consolacion in the Cebu province remained under GCQ. Zamboanga City was placed under MGCQ. \c\cOn August 17, on the recommendation of the IATF-EID, President Duterte announced that Metro Manila and its neighboring provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal will be downgraded to GCQ starting August 19. His speech was broadcast from Davao City. \c\cOn August 21, Catbalogan was placed under ECQ, following Samar Governor Reynolds Michael Tan signed an executive order amid a spike of cases. Tuguegarao was placed under MECQ for ten days, from August 26 to September 4. \c\cOn August 31, President Duterte approved the recommendation of IATF-EID, to place Iligan under MECQ. The GCQ in Metro Manila, Batangas, and Bulacan was also extended, while the quarantine measures in Bacolod and Tacloban were upgraded to GCQ. The rest of the country were placed under MGCQ on September 1. \c\cLanao del Sur and the city of Bacolod were also placed under MECQ from September 8 to 30, due to the sudden rise of COVID-19 cases linked to local transmissions within these areas. \c\cThe cities of Koronadal and General Santos were also placed under GCQ from September 11 to 25 and September 13 to 27, respectively, while the province of South Cotabato was placed under GCQ from September 16 to 30. Iloilo City was placed under MECQ, from September 25 to 30, originally scheduled to end on October 9. \c\cOn September 28, President Duterte announced that the GCQ in Metro Manila, Bacolod, Batangas, Iloilo City, and Tacloban will be extended from October 1 to 31, while the MECQ in Iligan will be downgraded to GCQ. Lanao del Sur (including Marawi) on the other hand, will be placed under MECQ for the entirety of October. The rest of the country will remain under MGCQ. \c\cIlagan in Isabela was placed under MECQ from October 6 to 16, then to ECQ from October 16 to 30, amid rising cases in the city. Enrile in Cagayan was placed under MECQ from October 6 to 16. Northern Samar was placed under GCQ from October 20 until November 3. \c\cOn October 27, President Duterte announced in his televised address from Davao City, that the GCQ in Metro Manila, Bacolod, Batangas, Iloilo City, Tacloban, and Iligan will be extended until November 30, while Lanao del Sur will be placed under GCQ. The rest of the country will remain under MGCQ. \c\cDavao City was also placed under GCQ from November 20 until November 30, amid sudden rise of COVID-19 cases in the city. Laoag in Ilocos Norte was placed under MECQ from November 27 until December 11, due to spike in cases in the city. \c\cOn November 30, President Duterte announced that the quarantine measures in Metro Manila, Batangas, Davao City, Iligan, Iloilo City, Lanao del Sur, and Tacloban will remain as they are until December 31. Davao del Norte was upgraded to a GCQ due to its high positivity rate, while Bacolod was downgraded to a MGCQ. The rest of the country will remain under MGCQ. \c\cLaoag was downgraded to GCQ from December 12 until December 25. On December 14, the province of Isabela was placed under GCQ and will be under that quarantine measure until December 30. \c\cOn December 28, President Rodrigo Duterte has announced that the GCQ in Metro Manila, Batangas, Davao del Norte, Isabela, Lanao del Sur, Davao City, Iligan, Iloilo City and Tacloban will be extended until January 31, while Santiago will be upgraded to GCQ. The rest of the country will be placed under MGCQ. \c\cOn January 1, Isabela and Iloilo City has been downgraded to MGCQ. Laoag was placed under GCQ on January 11. Tuguegarao was placed under ECQ from January 20 until January 29, due to the spike of cases in the city. It was extended until February 3, as the cases were still rising. Passi was placed under ECQ from January 28 until February 11. \c\cOn January 29, it was announced that the following areas will be placed under GCQ: the Cordillera Administrative Region and Metro Manila, the provinces of Batangas, Davao del Norte, and Lanao del Sur, and the cities of Tacloban, Davao City, and Iligan for the whole month of February. The rest of the country will be under a more lenient MGCQ, unless otherwise stated. \c\cOn February 13, 4 barangays in Ubay, Bohol (Bood, Fatima, Poblacion, and Tapon) were placed under MECQ due to a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases. The MECQ took effect immediately and will stay in place until further notice. \c\cThere was a plan to place the entire country under MGCQ by March 2021, which was first proposed by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) to allow the reopening of industries closed under stricter quarantine measures. The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) supported this proposal and said that it would harmonize travel restrictions throughout the country. However, President Rodrigo Duterte issued a directive against the proposal but was open to ease the restrictions nationwide as soon as the national government starts its vaccination program. On February 27, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced that the GCQ in Metro Manila, Apayao, Baguio, Batangas, Davao City, Iligan, Kalinga, Lanao del Sur, Mountain Province, and Tacloban will still be in place for the entire month of March. \c\cOn March 21, in view of the grim rising of new COVID-19 cases, President Duterte approved the IATF-EID recommendation placing Metro Manila and its neighboring provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal under GCQ with additional restrictions from March 22 to April 4. These areas within the Greater Manila Area were collectively given the designation "NCR Plus" and the restrictions placed on the area was described essentially as a GCQ–MECQ hybrid. However, on March 29, the Greater Manila Area was placed under ECQ due to the increasing trend in the number of cases in the area. \c\cOn March 29, President Rodrigo Duterte announced community quarantine measures that would prevail from April 1 to 30 with most of the Philippines to be placed under MGCQ. Quirino and the city of Santiago in Isabela will placed under MECQ, while the Cordillera Administrative Region, Cagayan, the rest of Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, Batangas, Lanao del Sur and the cities of Tacloban, Iligan, Davao City will be under GCQ and the quarantine measures in the NCR Plus area were retained. The ECQ in NCR Plus was supposed to end on April 4, but was extended until April 11. From April 12 to 30, the Greater Manila Area was placed under MECQ. For the same period, Abra was also placed under MECQ, while Quezon was placed under GCQ. \c\cOn April 28, 2021, President Rodrigo Duterte announced that the MECQ in the Greater Manila Area will remain in place until May 14 while that of in Santiago, Quirino, and Abra will remain until May 31. The GCQ in the provinces of Apayao, Batangas, Benguet, Cagayan, Ifugao, Isabela, Kalinga, Lanao del Sur, Mountain Province, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quezon, and the cities of Baguio, Davao City, Iligan, and Tacloban will remain in place until May 31, while the rest of the country will remain under MGCQ. \c\cHowever, quarantine measures for Ifugao was raised to MECQ which will be active from May 1 to 14, and Palawan was placed under GCQ for the whole month.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cAustralian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March, and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March. Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020, and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks. Social distancing rules were imposed on 21 March, and state governments started to close "non-essential" services. "Non-essential services" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories. The number of new cases initially grew sharply, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22 March, and started falling at the beginning of April to under 20 cases per day by the end of the month. \c\cA second wave of infections emerged in Victoria during May and June, which was attributed to an outbreak at a Melbourne quarantine hotel. The second wave, though largely localised to Melbourne, was much more widespread and deadlier than the first; at its peak, the state had over 7,000 active cases. Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown which eventually lasted almost four months. The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020. \c\cAs of 12 May 2021[update], Australia has reported 29,947 cases, 25,486+ recoveries, and 910 deaths, with Victoria's second wave accounting for nearly 75 percent of cases and 90 percent of fatalities. No deaths from COVID-19 were recorded in Australia from 28 December 2020 until 13 April 2021, when one death occurred in Queensland. There has been one death linked to an adverse vaccination reaction. On 15 April 2021, a 48-year-old New South Wales woman died in John Hunter Hospital after developing thrombosis (blood clot) with thrombocytopenia (abnormally low levels of platelets) four days after being vaccinated on 8 April with the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine. By 6 May 2021 there had been 11 cases in Australia of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)  in people after they received Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccinations. Long-haul flying is still a greater risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) than COVID-19 vaccinations. \c\cThe stated goal of the National Cabinet is "suppression", as opposed to "elimination", meaning continually trying to drive community transmission to zero but expecting that new outbreaks may occur. This is in contrast to the mitigation strategies implemented by most other nations. Compared to other Western countries, notably the United States and European countries, Australia's handling has been praised for its effectiveness. Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; rapid recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce during March 2020; comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the US  and later on, the use of short intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks. Although Australia's efforts to develop a bluetooth-based contact tracing app were not particularly effective, QR code based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia's businesses. These apps, which are effectively required by State Governments, give government health departments the ability to reconstruct the presence of anyone visiting bars or restaurants, generally for 28 days after the visit. \c\cThe nationwide vaccination program began with the first doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine being administered in Sydney on Sunday 21 February 2021. \c\cA novel coronavirus that caused a respiratory illness was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019, which confirmed its concern on 12 January 2020. WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. \c\cThe case fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower than that of SARS, a related disease which emerged in 2002, but its transmission has been significantly greater, leading to a much greater total death toll. \c\cThe widespread reporting of the 2019-20 Australian bushfire season in major media and social media around the world caused a significant drop in the number of tourists coming to Australia, including those from China. The absence of tourist arrivals during this time could have played a significant role in sparing Australia from the spread of COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. This is in contrast to other major cities in Europe and North America, where the early spread of the virus continued undetected until late February 2020 or early March 2020. \c\cThe following chart represents changes in net number of cases on a daily basis and is based on the number of cases reported in the Federal Government's daily reports. \c\cOn 1 February 2020, Australia banned the entry of foreign nationals who had been in mainland China, and ordered its own returning citizens who had been in China to self-quarantine for 14 days. The country also began to assess the relative risk of reflected transmission through third countries, and to ask travelers arriving from higher-risk countries to monitor for symptoms. Australia subsequently imposed bans on Iran (1 March), South Korea (5 March), and Italy (11 March). From 16 March, all travellers arriving in or returning to Australia were required to self-isolate for 14 days. Failure to self-isolate could result in a fine of A$11,000 to A$50,000 and a possible prison sentence, depending on the state. Cruise ships were also barred from docking in the country for 30 days. \c\cOn 20 March, Australia closed its borders to all non-residents and non-Australian citizens. With limited exceptions, a ban was imposed on Australians travelling overseas. \c\cBy late March 2020, 62% of Australia's more than 3,000 coronavirus cases were among people who had returned from overseas. From then, Australians returning from overseas were subject to two weeks compulsory quarantine in hotels. The New South Wales quarantine program was helped by 150 Australian Defence Force personnel, including 30 who were stationed at hotels. In Victoria, three private security operators were contracted to provide the security, while the other states and territories used their police resources. The states and territories carried the costs of hotel quarantine. By 19 June, since the policy came into force 81,000 people had entered Australia. Of those, 63,000 had undergone hotel quarantine, while the rest, including flight crews, international businesspeople and defence members, fell under different rules. Hotel quarantine had cost $118 million as at 19 June. \c\cInterstate border closures began on 19 March, with Tasmania imposing a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all "non-essential" travellers to the state, including returning residents. On 24 March, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory closed their borders, with all interstate arrivals being required to self-isolate for 14 days. On 11 April, Queensland banned interstate arrivals, with only Queensland residents and those granted \'exemption\' being allowed entry. On 8 July, the Victorian and NSW governments, jointly closed their common border, following a large spike in cases in parts of Melbourne.[citation needed]\c\cWith the spike in coronavirus infections in Victoria linked to the hotel quarantine program, a judicial inquiry into the program in Victoria was called on 2 July; and all international arrivals into Melbourne were suspended. On 9 July, other state and territory leaders agreed to reduce flights and arrivals into Australia from 8,000 to 4,000 a week to ease the burden on the hotel quarantine system. States started to charge travellers for hotel quarantine. In mid September, the states agreed to increased the number of arrivals to 6,000 a week, to help in the repatriation of tens of thousands of Australians stranded overseas. By 15 December 2020, 39,000 Australians were registered with the government as stranded, with more unregistered (as the government advised registration only for those needing assistance to return). After repeated flight cancellations and without access to government-provided health care or welfare benefits, many families reported being forced to overstay visas, and burn down savings and incur debt to pay for accommodations. Having to pay thousands of dollars for return tickets and mandatory hotel quarantine, some chose to send one family member back in order to resume work and earn enough money to pay the way of the rest. Between 13 March and 15 July 2020, more than 357,000 people returned to Australia. As of 15 January 2021[update] over 37,000 Australians were stranded abroad. On 29 January 2021, the ability of Australians stuck overseas to return was further hampered when the UK banned direct flights from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the possible spread of the South African COVID-19 variant. Both Etihad and Emirates airlines are UAE based. \c\cAn overnight curfew was introduced in Victoria on 2 August 2020, extended on 13 September and suspended on 27 September. A Supreme Court judge has ruled the curfew was legal. \c\cOn 25 January 2021, Health Minister Greg Hunt suspended Australia's travel bubble with New Zealand for a period of 72 hours after New Zealand authorities confirmed a community transmission case in the country's Northland Region. On 28 January the suspension of the travel bubble was extended for 3 more days. \c\cOn 5 February 2021, National Cabinet decided to increase the number of international passenger arrivals to Australia as from mid-February. New South Wales will return to a weekly cap of 3,010 people and Queensland to 1,000. South Australia has increased by 40 people a week to 530, and Victoria by almost 200 to 1,310. Western Australia will remain at a reduced arrival cap. The total national weekly cap of 4,100 will increase to approximately 6,300. \c\cOn 11 February 2021, the airline Cathay Pacific decided that, excepting Sydney, from 20 February it would cease all flights to Australia until the end of the month. This was in response to the Hong Kong government's new COVID rules requiring Hong Kong based aircrew to quarantine for 14 days on return to HK. \c\cOn 24 February, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria suspended their travel bubble arrangements with New Zealand in response to a recent community outbreak in South Auckland. As a result, New Zealanders traveling to these states would have to enter quarantine. \c\cOn 2 March 2021, the general closure of Australia's international borders to travel was extended another 3 months to 17 June 2021. Australia's borders have now already been closed for 12 months. The border could reopen earlier if the closure was "no longer needed." Despite the border closure, between 25 March and 31 December 2020 over 105,000 exemptions were approved for people to leave Australia. \c\cBy April 2021, there were still about 40,000 Australians stranded overseas by the high cost of plane tickets and the cap on the number of people in the quarantine system, which was criticized for special treatment of sportspeople and celebrities. Australia was chastised by the UN Human Rights Committee, which requested a prompt return for the country's citizens; the government has given out A$29 million to about 3,900 stranded people as a last resort, and operated 28 repatriation flights. \c\cOn 23 April, Prime Minister Morrison announced that travellers to Australia from "high risk" countries, in particular India, were to be reduced by 30 percent. This decision was based on an increase in positive results for COVID-19 among travellers from India at the Howard Springs, Northern Territory quarantine facility. Travel to such countries was also to be limited. \c\cIn general, the border restrictions had had broad public support, though critics suggested safety could be improved by constructing more outdoor quarantine centres rather than relying on urban hotels, which had suffered 16 leaks to the surrounding communities as of April 2021, out of about half a million quarantined. The government does not have a ordered queue of returnees; outside of repatriation flights, the order in which people return is determined by commercial airlines, resulting in Australian citizens making up fewer than half of incoming travellers in February 2021. \c\cOn 27 April, due to the "record breaking" outbreak of COVID-19 in India, with 323,000 new infections that day after five days with new cases peaking above 350,000, and another 2,771 COVID deaths there, the Federal Government "paused" all incoming flights from India until at least 15 May. The pause includes repatriation flights into the Howard Springs quarantine facility near Darwin with more than 9,000 Australians in India at this date wanting to come to Australia. \c\cLate on 30 April, the Federal Government announced a ban on Australian citizens and permanent residents in India from entering Australia via any route. These measures came into effect on 3 May and would remain in force until 15 May. Breaches would be subject to punishment under the Biosecurity Act 2015, with penalties for breaches including up to five years’ jail, a fine of A$66,600, or both. Foreign Minister Marise Payne reported that 57% of positive cases in quarantine had come from India in April, compared with 10% in March. The move was branded as racist by some critics, and a potential breach of international human rights law. On 3 May 2021 the government announced that it would review this decision earlier than originally intended, possibly within the same week. There were about 9,000 Australian citizens in India, of whom 650 were considered vulnerable. \c\cOn 13 March 2020, the National Cabinet, a form of national crisis cabinet akin to a war cabinet, was created following a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). This is the first time such a cabinet has been proclaimed since World War II, and the only time in Australian history that a crisis cabinet has included state and territory leaders. The cabinet consists of the premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories and meets weekly during the crisis. At its first meeting on 13 March, the National Cabinet announced that gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled from 15 March. Schools, universities, workplaces, public transport and airports were not included in this recommendation. Prime Minister Morrison also announced that he intended to attend a Rugby League match on 14 March; "I do still plan to go to the football on Saturday" but later decided against attending the match. \c\cOn 29 March, the Cabinet agreed to stricter limits to apply from midnight on 30 March: a limit on both indoor and outdoor gatherings of two people except weddings (5) funerals (10) and people of the same household or family; strong guidance to all Australians is to stay home unless for necessary shopping, health care, exercise, and work and study that can\'t be done remotely; public playgrounds, skate parks and outside gyms to be closed. It was left to individual states to enforce these guidelines. They also agreed to a moratorium on evictions for six months for both commercial and residential tenancies suffering financial distress. \c\cOn 2 April 2020, the Federal government announced the temporary provision of free childcare so that people could continue working, and to prevent closure of childcare centres. The Government paid half each centre's operating costs. The free childcare ended on 12 July, and the previous Child Care Subsidy was reintroduced. \c\cOn 18 March 2020, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, after a National Security Committee meeting the previous day. The Biosecurity Act 2015 specifies that the Governor-General may declare such an emergency exists if the Health Minister (currently Greg Hunt) is satisfied that "a listed human disease is posing a severe and immediate threat, or is causing harm, to human health on a nationally significant scale". This gives the minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and evacuations. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 was declared by the Governor-General, David Hurley, under Section 475 of the Act. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, made by the Health Minister on the same day, forbids international cruise ships from entering Australian ports before 15 April 2020. \c\cA social distancing rule of four square metres (43 sq ft) per person in any enclosed space was agreed by National Cabinet on 20 March, to be implemented through State and Territory laws. On 22 March 2020, the State governments of New South Wales and Victoria imposed a mandatory closure of non-essential services, while the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia imposed border closures. \c\cOn 22 March, Morrison announced a closure of places of social gathering, including registered and licensed clubs, licensed premises in hotels and bars, entertainment venues, including but not restricted to cinemas, casinos and nightclubs and places of worship. Cafes and restaurants could remain open, but were limited to only takeaway food. Similarly, enclosed spaces for funerals and things of that nature will have to follow the strict four-square-metre rule. These measures (labelled stage 1 in anticipation of possible future measures) were effective immediately at midday, 23 March. Morrison stated that he would like schools to remain open, but parents could keep children at home if they wished to. \c\cOn 25 March 2020, the Health Minister made a second determination under the Biosecurity Act 2015, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Overseas Travel Ban Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, which "forbids Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australian territory by air or sea as a passenger". On the same day, the Prime Minister announced a further set of restrictions, labelled stage 2 restrictions, effective midnight that night. These involved mainly smaller businesses, such as nail salons and tattoo parlours, while some, such as personal training sessions, were limited to 10 people. At the same time, other gatherings were restricted, such as weddings (5 people) and funerals (10 people). \c\cAt 12:00 am on Tuesday 31 March, restrictions were announced on indoor and outdoor gatherings, which were called stage 3 by the media, although the label "stage 3" was not part of the official announcement. The new rule limited gatherings to two people, although it did not apply to members of the same household. \c\cOn 14 April the Federal government announced the "COVIDSafe" digital contact tracing app. \c\cOn 25 April 2020, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements—Public Health Contact Information) Determination 2020, made under subsection 477(1) of the Act, was signed into law by the Health Minister. The purpose of the new legislation is "to make contact tracing faster and more effective by encouraging public acceptance and uptake of COVIDSafe", COVIDSafe being the new mobile app created for the purpose. The function of the app is to record contact between any two people who both have the app on their phones when they come within 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) of each other. The encrypted data would remain on the phone for 21 days of not encountering a person logged with confirmed COVID-19. \c\cOn 3 September 2020, the human biosecurity emergency period under the Biosecurity Act 2015 was extended until 17 December. \c\cOn 25 March, the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC) was established by the Prime Minister as a strategic advisory body for the national response to the pandemic. (On 27 July 2020, the Prime Minister renamed the organisation to the "National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board" (NCC).) The NCC's role includes providing advice on public-private partnerships and coordination to mitigate the social and economic impacts of the pandemic. \c\cOn 29 March, Prime Minister Morrison announced in a press conference following a National Cabinet meeting that public gatherings will be limited to two people, while also urging Australians over the age of 70, Australians with chronic illness over the age of 60 and Indigenous Australians over the age of 50 to stay home and self-isolate. Morrison also clarified that there were only four acceptable reasons for Australians to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes. \c\cAustralia's first human trials of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, Novavax's NVX-CoV2373, began in Melbourne by 26 May 2020. \c\cThe Australian government entered into agreements with Pfizer/BioNTech, University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax and the University of Queensland for the supply of vaccines. The University of Queensland vaccine was abandoned in December 2020 after trials revealed that, while it was safe, it triggered false positives on HIV tests. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer vaccine in January 2021. The Australian government ordered 10 million doses, with the first 80,000 to be delivered in February 2021, but production problems and the imposition of export controls by the European Union (EU) onto deliveries to countries outside Europe made meeting the delivery schedule problematic. \c\cThis would also affect deliveries of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which was provisionally approved by the TGA in February, and received final approval in March. Orders were reduced from 3.8 million to 1.2 million doses of this vaccine, which is manufactured in Belgium, and arrival was pushed back to March 2021. CSL Limited began manufacturing 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Melbourne in November 2020. Deliveries were expected to commence in March. The AstraZeneca vaccine could be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures of 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F), whereas the Pfizer vaccine required storage at −70 °C (−94 °F). However, concerns were raised about the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The Australian and New Zealand Society for Immunology called for a pause in its rollout, as the efficacy of the vaccine reported by trials was insufficient to achieve the desired herd immunity effect. CSL management declined an invitation to appear before an Australian Senate inquiry. \c\cAlthough the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, said that Australia would be "at the front of the queue", and the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, claimed that Australia would be among the first countries to receive COVID-19 vaccines, 61 other countries had already commenced vaccinating their citizens by the end of January 2021, while the Australian vaccination rollout was not scheduled to commence for another month. \c\cOn 15 February 2021, 142,000 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Australia. The first doses are due be administered on 22 February. The world-wide distribution of the vaccine has been described as "... the largest logistics effort in the world since World War" by Dr Roberto Perez-Franco of the Deakin University's Centre for Supply Chain and Logistics. This was followed, on 28 February, by 300,000 doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, which arrived at Sydney airport. It was planned that most Australians will be immunised with this vaccine, the majority of which will be manufactured in Australia by CSL Limited.  On 5 March, Italy and the European Union blocked a shipment of 250,000 doses of the Oxford−AstraZeneca vaccine from Italy to Australia, citing low COVID-19 case numbers in Australia and the limited availability of vaccines in the EU. \c\cLocal manufacturing began in November 2020. On 16 February, the first vials of COVID-19 vaccine produced in Australia came off the production line at the CSL Behring plant in Broadmeadows, Melbourne. This is the active raw vaccine material. The vaccine vials are filled and packaged into doses by Seqirus, a CSL subsidiary in Parkville, Melbourne. Production of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Australia received its final approval from the TGA on 21 March. Understandably, many front line health care workers preferred the Pfizer vaccine over the AstraZeneca one. \c\cThe Australian government had also signed a deal with Novavax for 51 million doses of its vaccine, with supply originally slated for "mid-2021". As of April 2021, it had yet to be approved by the TGA. It is not manufactured in Australia, so like the other imported vaccines, its availability was uncertain. In trials it was reported to be 95.6 per cent effective against COVID-19, and an 86.3 per cent effective against the variant identified in the UK. \c\cIn a February 2021 pre-budget submission, the Australian Academy of Science renewed its call for the government to develop the capability to produce MRNA vaccine technology in Australia. The ability to mass-produce such vaccines onshore would insulate Australia against supply shocks, and cater for future pandemics and potential  biosecurity situations. The MRNA vaccines had proved to be more effective than those produced with conventional vaccine technology, and easier to reconfigure to cater for new virus variants. \c\cThe first public COVID-19 vaccination in Australia, with the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, took place on 21 February 2021 in Sydney. An 84-year-old aged care resident was the first Australian to receive the vaccine. Prime Minister Morrison and Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly also received vaccinations. \c\cThe first Australian to receive the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was a doctor in regional South Australia on 5 March 2021 at Murray Bridge Hospital. \c\cMore than 2 million COVID-19 vaccinations had been administered by 28 April 2021, but this was 3 million short of original plans. \c\cThe first death in Australia linked to an adverse vaccination reaction occurred on 15 April 2021. A diabetic 48-year-old New South Wales woman died in John Hunter Hospital after developing thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 4 days after being vaccinated on 8 April with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The TGA said it was "likely" her death was linked to the vaccination. There were 2 previous cases in Australia of blood clotting linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. By 23 April 2021, 3 more cases of blood clotting were reported that are believed to be linked to AstraZeneca vaccination. A 49-year-old Queensland man, an 80-year-old Victorian man and 35-year-old NSW woman all had suspected thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). The TGA said there was a "likely link" as all three had received the AstraZeneca vaccine. All were in a stable condition and recovering. \c\cAnother 5 cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) linked to AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination had been reported by 6 May, bringing the total in Australia to 11. \c\cThe Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) and the TGA met on 8 April 2021 to review concerns over the AstraZeneca vaccine.  Australia's Chief Medical Officer, Doctor Paul Kelly, reassured about the vaccine's safety, but it was being reviewed. ATAGI advised the Federal Government to use the AstraZeneca vaccine only for those over 50-years-of-age as they confirmed the rare side-effect of blood clotting could occur in younger people. \c\cVictoria's Chief Health officer, Professor Brett Sutton, after himself receiving an AstraZeneca vaccination in April, said: "You are more likely to get a clot, whatever age you are, on a long-haul flight to Europe or North America." Daniel Thomas, haematologist and researcher at the University of Adelaide agreed and said deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was "common". \c\cPremier Gladys Berejiklian formed a "war cabinet" to make decisions in relation to the pandemic. Members include herself, Treasurer Dominic Perrottet, Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard and Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott. \c\cOn 15 March, Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Education, Mark Scott ordered that, effective immediately, New South Wales schools introduce social distancing measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus. The order required schools to cancel all assemblies, excursions, travel, concerts, large inter-school sporting and arts events, and other events that would require students and staff to congregate in large numbers. Schools were to stay open. Four schools in the state have been shut for periods during the crisis due to confirmed cases within their school communities. \c\cOn 16 March, New South Wales Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard announced that he was using his powers, under Section 7 of the \'Public Health Act 2010\', to immediately and indefinitely cancel all public events with more than 500 attendees. The order is enforceable by NSW Police and violations of the order can carry a prison term of six months, an $11,000 fine, or both. \c\cChief Justice Bathurst, Chief Justice of New South Wales, and Chief Judge Price of the District Court of New South Wales ordered that effective 16 March 2020, new jury trials would be suspended to limit the spread of coronavirus. The order did not apply to already empanelled jury trials. Corrective Services New South Wales implemented screening mechanisms, early flu vaccination programs and stricter hygiene requirements for staff, visitors and inmates to slow the spread of the virus. \c\cThe University of Sydney cancelled all graduations, conferences, academic and student organised events. The University of New South Wales announced that it was cancelling all student and academic events until Easter, encourage staff to work from home and, where possible, shift all lectures, tutorials, demonstrations and labs to online learning. \c\cNew South Wales schools were directed by the State Department of Education Secretary, Mark Scott, to cancel all assemblies, excursions, travel, and some events and conferences, including arts and initiative events, as well as whole school sporting events and inter-school sporting events with three or more involved schools. \c\cEven though there was a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people, huge crowds flocked to the popular Bondi Beach and other beaches across Sydney on Friday 20 March. Health Minister Greg Hunt said that such behaviour was "unacceptable" while the New South Wales Labor's Shadow Treasurer, Walt Secord urged the government to completely close off the beach. New South Wales Police Minister David Elliott later stated in a televised interview that lifeguards were instructed to keep a head count of the people at the beach and if the number exceeded 500, the beach would be closed. On 21 March, crowds built up yet again which led Waverley Council to temporarily close Bondi, and the other beaches of Bronte and Tamarama. \c\cOn 22 March, a public health order was issued that declared Lord Howe Island a public risk area and directed restricted access. As of that date there were no known cases of COVID-19 on Lord Howe Island. \c\cOn 30 March, NSW Parliament passed the "COVID-19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement" law, which limited public gatherings to two people and directed, "that a person must not, without reasonable excuse, leave the person's place of residence." It listed 16 reasonable excuses and took effect from midnight on 31 March. \c\cAs of 15 May, some restrictions on public and private gatherings were eased. Private homes were allowed 5 visitors. Free standing cafes and restaurants, and those inside pubs and clubs, were allowed very limited sit-down dining, after being restricted to take-away only since 23 March. Bars and gaming areas remained closed. A maximum of 10 people were permitted in restaurants and cafes, while social distancing rules still had to be followed. Outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people were permitted. Up to 10 guests were permitted at weddings, and funerals could have up to 20 mourners indoors, 30 outdoors. Up to 10 people were allowed at indoor religious gatherings such as churches. \c\cFrom 13 June, private homes were allowed to have up to 20 guests visit, and groups of 20 were allowed to meet outside. Food courts were allowed to open, so long as the 4-square-metres-per-patron rule was kept, and no more than 50 patrons. Indoor gym classes were allowed 10 participants. Up to 100 persons were allowed inside gyms, so long as area requirements were adhered to. \c\cFrom 1 July, New South Wales eased restrictions further due to the limited community transmission of COVID-19, at that time. No set upper limit on patron numbers at indoor venues, but only one person per 4 square metres. Outdoor venues, with a maximum capacity of 40,000, were allowed up to 25 per cent of normal capacity. Events had to be ticketed, patrons seated and follow guidelines. Restriction on funerals eased, but the four-square-metre rule applied. Other existing restrictions, no more than 20 guests inside homes, 20 outside, remained in force. Restrictions were tightened again on 17 July. (See below)\c\cFrom 5 July, the Federal Government introduced restrictions on the number of passengers arriving at Sydney Airport. A maximum of 50 passengers were allowed per flight, and international arrivals were set at 450 per day. This was by request of the NSW Government to reduce pressure on hotel quarantine capacity. More than 32,000 travellers had quarantined in Sydney hotels by this date. \c\cOn 6 July, the Victorian and NSW State Governments, jointly announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July, following a large spike in cases in certain areas of Melbourne. \c\cAs of 12:01 a.m. on 17 July, after an increase in cases, new rules for pubs were introduced. Measures included, group bookings and persons at a table were limited to 10 (formerly 20), and a maximum of 300 people allowed inside any venue. COVID Safe Hygiene Marshalls to oversee the venues COVID-19 infection prevention were also required, and venue COVID-Safe registration was compulsory. Paper-based sign-ins are allowed, but a digital record of patrons contact details, for contact tracing, must be provided on request. Breaching the rules can result in a A$55,000 fine for the venue, plus another A$27,500 for each day the breach is continued. As of 24 July, the tightened venue restrictions were also applied to bars, cafes, clubs and restaurants. \c\cUntil 18 July, international travellers who had to undergo compulsory quarantine on arrival did not have to pay for their accommodation, at a cost of A$65 million to the NSW Government. Under new rules announced on 11 July, as of 12:01 a.m. on Saturday 18 July 2020, all new arrivals are being charged for their quarantine. The charge includes meals and room costs, for which one adult will pay A$3,000, additional adults A$1,000, children A$500, and no charge for children under 3 years. Those already quarantined will not have to pay, nor will those who purchased flights, and, had a confirmed international arrival date, before 11:59  p.m. on 12 July 2020 AEST. \c\cOn 20 July, the number of daily overseas arrivals allowed at Sydney Airport was reduced to 350 from the 450 limit set on July 5. \c\cOn 5 August, it was announced that as from 7 August all Victorians arriving in NSW would be required to quarantine, at their own expense, in hotels for 14 days. Air arrivals from Victoria were only  allowed at Sydney Airport. \c\cFrom 23 November, it became mandatory for many businesses to use electronic record systems to collect details of patrons for possible contact tracing. \c\cDuring the second week of December 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 in Avalon began.[citation needed] A stay at home advisory was issued on 17 December. \c\cOn 19 December 2020, a public health order was issued, locking down Sydney's Northern Beaches. Residents of the Northern Beaches LGA were required to stay at home from 5 pm on Saturday 19 December, until 11:59 pm on Wednesday 23 December unless they had a lawful reason to travel, including for: essential shopping; essential travel for work and to or from a school or educational institution; exercise; medical care, carer's responsibilities or compassionate needs. Entry to the area was similarly restricted. Public gatherings were limited to two persons. \c\cBy 20 December, there were 68 cases. This prompted restrictions on admission of Sydney residents or visitors to Sydney, to other states. These ranged from 14-day quarantines (ACT, NT, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria) to no entry without an exemption (Queensland). South Australia barred entry to anyone from the Northern Beaches, while Western Australia barred everyone coming from NSW. Measures to stem the spread of COVID-19 in Sydney were again tightened. No more than 10 people were allowed in homes in Greater Sydney, Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Illawarra-Shoalhaven. \c\cNew Year's Eve celebrations were restricted in Sydney city, around the harbour and suburbs. The midnight fireworks on Sydney Harbour, normally 20 minutes, were cut back to 7 minutes, with no fireworks at 9 pm. The harbour foreshores were closed to prevent crowds congregating. Only residents, guests,  and those with bookings at bars, hotels and restaurants, were allowed in foreshore areas under a pass system. Vantage points in North Sydney were also closed. \c\cFrom 1 January, hospitality venues and hairdressers were required to use the NSW Government QR code system for patron check-in. \c\cOn Saturday, 2 January 2021, it was announced that as of midnight that day, facemasks would become mandatory in many enclosed places in Greater Sydney. All public transport, shops, supermarkets, cinemas, theatres and places of worship were included. Hospitality workers also had to wear masks. Children under 12 years-of-age were exempt. An A$200 on the spot fine will be charged for non-compliance. Fines will be applied from 4 January (Monday). \c\cMaximum gym class sizes were reduced from 50 to 30, worship from 300 down to 100, weddings were limited to 100, or one per 4 square metres. Outdoor performances reduced from 1,000 to 500 patrons. Events which were "seated, ticketed and enclosed" were reduced back to 2,000 maximum. Night clubs were "not permitted". \c\cOn 21 February, the first public COVID-19 vaccinations in Australia, with the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, were administered in Sydney. Up to 6:00 pm on 23 February in NSW, 3,200 people were immunised across three state-run hospitals. \c\cAs of 24 February, there was no transmission of COVID-19 in the community in NSW for 38 days. On 17 March restrictions were to be "revisited". Also on 24 February, further restriction easing was announced in NSW. From 12:01 am on 26 February (Friday):\c\cDancing and singing was allowed at gatherings\c\cAt weddings, up to 30 people, including guests, could dance at one time. (previously, only the wedding party, a maximum of 20 people. The 300 person limit for wedding guests remained)\c\cUp to 50 people at their home (up from 30) Visitor number includes adults and children. \c\cUp to 50 people allowed in gym classes (4-square metre rule applies)\c\cUp to 30 singers allowed in choirs and religious congregations. Masks required, place of worship must adhere to the 4-square metre rule. \c\cOn 5 May in Sydney, a case of COVID-19 in a man in his 50s was detected with no known physical link to travel or border control/quarantine hotels or workers. His wife also tested positive to COVID-19. Genomic testing provided a link to an overseas (US) acquired infection at the Park Royal in Darling Harbour. The new cases are believed to have been infectious while visiting at least 20 locations in Sydney from 30 April to 4 March. Due to these community transmitted infections, COVID related restrictions in Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains and Wollongong were tightened, initially for 3 days, from 5 pm on 6 May (Friday), to 12:01 am on 9 May (Monday). \c\cMask-wearing was again made mandatory at indoor places, including:\c\cPublic transport\c\cSupermarkets\c\cOther indoor events\c\cHospitality staff at front of house had to be masked\c\cPatrons drinking had to be seated. \c\cNo singing or dancing at indoor venues, including,\c\cPlaces of worship and\c\cEntertainment venues. \c\cExemptions included weddings, and dancers or singers performing in shows. \c\cOnly 20 visitors allowed at private homes\c\cMaximum 2 visitors at aged care facilities\c\cOn 9 May, because the "missing link" in the two community transmitted infections that caused the restriction tightening on 5 May had not been located, most of the extra restrictions were extended another seven days until 12:01 am on 17 May. The main change is mask wearing is not required indoors by patrons of shops and hospitality venues, except for gaming areas where masks are still needed. On public transport and other indoor public venues masks remain mandatory. 13,768 COVID tests were undertaken in the 24 hours to 8:00 pm that day, but NSW recorded no locally acquired COVID-19 infections. \c\cOn 10 May, a mass vaccination hub opened at Sydney Olympic Park. The same day, registrations began for NSW residents aged 40 to 49 to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. \c\cOn 10 March, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews warned Victorians to expect "extreme measures" in the wake of the federal government updating the travel advice for Italy. These could include cancelling major sporting events, requiring entire economic sectors to work from home, and calling recently retired health professionals to return to work. \c\cA state of emergency was declared on 16 March, which was extended on 12 April, with existing directions remaining in place including staying at home, restrictions on particular activities, detention, restrictions on airports and cruise ships, aged care, hospitals and isolation for people diagnosed with COVID-19.[citation needed] It was extended further on 11 May,[citation needed] and again on 19 July to 16 August. \c\cOn 22 March, the school holiday was brought forward from 27 to 24 March. \c\cOn 14 April, Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced that Victoria would have the widest coronavirus testing in Australia, with anyone having COVID-19 symptoms able to get tested. The statement was issued that those who presented with fever or chills, in the absence of any other alternative diagnosis that explained the issue, or acute respiratory infection characterised by coughing, sore throat or shortness of breath should be tested for coronavirus. \c\cOn 20 June, the Victorian Government re-tightened restrictions on household gatherings following a spike in community transmitted cases over the previous week, reported to be mainly caused by family-to-family transmission in large household gatherings. From 22 June, households could once again only have five visitors; and most easing of restrictions that were to take place were postponed. \c\cOn 30 June, the Victorian Government re-enforced local lockdowns across 10 different Melbourne postcodes. Residents there would need to comply with the four acceptable reasons to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes. \c\cOn 2 July, the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced the "Judicial Inquiry into Hotel Quarantine Program". This followed some cases of coronavirus in Victoria being linked by DNA sequencing to a breach in hotel quarantine infection control. The Inquiry was to "... examine the operation of Victoria's hotel quarantine program for returning travellers." It was headed by retired judge Jennifer Coate, and was scheduled to deliver its report to the Governor by 25 September. The inquiry was delayed by lockdown restrictions. Andrews noted that "it is abundantly clear that what has gone on here is completely unacceptable and we need to know exactly what has happened." An interim report was published on 6 November, and the inquirys final report was published on 21 December. The Government response to the interim report was published in November. \c\cOn 4 July, the Victorian Government announced two more postcodes affected by the lockdown until 29 July 2020. Nine public housing towers housing 3,000 residents were also added, with the additional condition that residents could not leave the tower under any circumstances for five days, with the possibility of an extension to 14 days. The Victorian ombudsman later found the lockdown of the public housing towers breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 6 July, the Victorian and NSW state Governments announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July. \c\cOn 7 July, after recording 191 new cases, Premier Andrews announced that metropolitan Melbourne and the Shire of Mitchell would re-enter lockdown from 12 am on 9 July, for 6 weeks. \c\cOn 19 July, following a "concerning increase in coronavirus cases", Premier Andrews announced that "face coverings" were to be made mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne, and Mitchell Shire. This was not enforced until after 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday 22 July to allow the populace time to acquire a face covering. In addition, the state of emergency was extended until 16 August 2020. \c\cFrom 22 July, as the chance of coronavirus infection remained high in aged care and health care settings, visits were restricted to carers only, and with a limit of one hour per day. \c\cFrom 23 July, "face coverings" in metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire became mandatory whenever residents leave their homes. A fine of A$200 was imposed to those not complying, though medical and other exemptions were allowed, such as not being required for children under 12 years of age. \c\cOn 2 August, a state of disaster was declared and metropolitan Melbourne was moved to Stage 4 restrictions. A curfew across Melbourne from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. was imposed, a 5 km (3.1 mi) radius restriction as added, and other restrictions that had previously been applied only to selected postcodes were applied to the whole of metropolitan Melbourne. A permit system was introduced for any residents that still needed to travel to work outside of their 5 km radius. \c\cOn 6 September (Father's Day), the "Roadmap for Reopening" was announced; a series of four steps towards "COVID Normal" which would begin on 13 September. In the "First Step", which applied to metropolitan Victoria, several restrictions were eased including a reduction of the curfew, some loosening of rules around outdoor exercise and social interactions, the introduction of a "bubble" that allowed single people living alone to nominate one person to be allowed to visit them during the first two steps, and increased limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. At the same time, it was announced that regional Victoria would move to the "Second Step", which included a staged return of students to onsite learning as well as the reopening of outdoor public pools and further increases to limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. \c\cOn 18 October, regional Victoria was moved to "Step Three", which included the reopening of most businesses to the public, increased seating for hospitality, the allowance of visitors for all residents and the resumption of some indoor sports. At the same time, the 5 km limit in metropolitan Victoria was increased to 25 km (16 mi) and the two-hour time limit was removed, however the border between metropolitan and regional Victoria (often referred to as the "ring of steel") was strengthened with extra checkpoints added. \c\cOn 26 October, metropolitan restrictions were eased, with residents allowed to leave home for any reason, all retail businesses allowed to reopen, hospitality venues allowed to seat patrons, further relaxations on outdoor gatherings, and allowance of visitors to all residents, with some caveats. The 25 km restriction and "Ring of steel" remained in place, however. \c\c With a length of 112 days, Victoria's second lockdown was the longest continuous lockdown world-wide, as of October 2020. \c\cOn 8 November, metropolitan restrictions were brought into line with regional restrictions with travel now being allowed to and from anywhere in the state. Indoor recreation, community and entertainment venues were also reopened. Restrictions on accommodation were also loosened in an effort to encourage intrastate tourism. It was also announced that, subject to public health advice, Victoria would move to the "Last Step" on 22 November. \c\cOn 27 November, Victoria recorded its 28th consecutive day of 0 new cases and 0 deaths, and had 0 active cases, epidemiologically eliminating the virus. \c\cOn 30 November, the Victorian government announced that a new dedicated agency, "COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria" (CQV), had been created. The interim Commissioner of CQV is the Commissioner of Corrections, Emma Cassar. CQV is part of the government's response to the COVID-19 Hotel Quarantine Enquirys\' interim report. It will oversee all parts of the Victorian quarantine program: mandatory quarantine for people entering Australia, Health Hotels for positive and suspected cases, or close contacts, and Frontline Worker Accommodation. The CQV Commissioner will be supported by three Deputy State Controllers. Deputy Chief Health Officer Professor Ben Cowie will lead the CQVs\' health management. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Ross Guenther will provide expertise in enforcement. As of 15 January 2021[update] the third Controller was still to be appointed. On 5 May 2021, the CQV general manager of infection control, Matius Bush, was stood down by the Minister for Government Services Danny Pearson pending a conduct review. Bush breached infection controls twice by: refusing a COVID test at a quarantine hotel when requested by Defence personnel; and failing to sanitise or change his mask when returning to a quarantine hotel from a coffee shop. Reports about the breaches were leaked and published in The Australian newspaper. \c\cOn 17 December, the Victorian ombudsman tabled a report in the Victorian Parliament in which she found the 4 July lockdown of public housing towers In Melbourne breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 30 December, Victoria's 61-day streak of zero community cases came to an end as three community cases were identified, linked to the New South Wales outbreak. As a precautionary measure for New Year's Eve the Victorian Government reduced household gatherings from 30 people to 15 and mandated masks within an indoor setting. The border to New South Wales closed at 11:59 pm on 31 December, with returning Victorian residents from "green zones" that returned before the deadline made to isolate until they received a negative test result. Those that returned afterwards would have to get tested and isolate for 14 days, aligning the restrictions with visitors from the Northern Beaches and Greater Sydney that had been enforced 11 days prior. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, a quarantine hotel worker at the Grand Hyatt Melbourne, a "resident support officer" involved in the Australian Open tennis quarantine program, was found to have COVID-19. From 11:59 pm Victoria immediately reintroduced some rules, tightened some, and put off imminent easing of some restrictions. The plan to, from 8 February (Monday), allow up to 75 per cent of office workers back into their workplaces was put on hold. Masks are mandatory inside, and only 15 persons are allowed at private events. The man visited at least 14 businesses from 29 January to 1 February, but was able to give contact tracers a detailed list of places and times. Anyone who was at those places at those times, must be tested, and isolate for 14 days. Testing site hours were extended from 4 February, opening at 8 am. More drive-through lanes were added, and additional testing sites opened. By 5 February, genomic sequencing confirmed that the Hyatt worker was infected with the more contagious "UK strain" of COVID-19. \c\cOn 12 February, it was announced that a five-day lockdown under Stage 4 restrictions would take effect beginning at 11:59 pm. AEDT, due to a cluster of 13 cases tied to a Holiday Inn quarantine hotel near Melbourne Airport, which have been assumed to be the UK variant. It was alleged by health officials to have been spread on a hotel floor due to a patient's use of an aerosol-generating nebuliser, which is normally banned under hotel quarantine. By 14 February the cluster had grown to 16, and by 16 February, the number of confirmed infections had increased to 19. By 19 February,  the Melbourne Holiday Inn outbreak had increased to 22, one person was admitted to intensive care, and about 3,515 contacts were quarantined. \c\cResidents may not leave their homes except for essential shopping, exercise, caregiving, essential work, or participating in a professional sporting event. Residents may only shop or exercise within five kilometres of their homes. Face masks are mandatory at all times out-of-home, all public gatherings are banned, and all schools are closed. As they account for the majority of UK variant cases, international arrivals into Victoria have also been suspended. All Australian states and territories have placed travel restrictions upon Victoria. Premier Andrews stated that these infections were "moving at a velocity that has not been seen anywhere in our country over the course of these last 12 months." Special dispensation was given to the 2021 Australian Open, which became crowdless effective 11:30 pm. AEDT on 12 February in the midst of the night's final match (play was temporarily suspended at that time to remove all spectators from the court). \c\cThe lockdown was lifted as anticipated at 11:59 pm on 17  February. Despite this, Victoria will not allow any incoming international flights "indefinitely". \c\cRemaining restrictions included:\c\cMasks mandatory inside,\c\cMasks outdoors when unable to keep social distance,\c\c5 person limit on home visits,\c\c20 person limit for outdoor gatherings. \c\cAs of 9 May 2021 Victoria had no cases of community transmission for 72 days. \c\cOn 29 January 2020, Queensland was the first to declare a public health emergency. The legislation was strengthened on 6 February by the Public Health (Declared Public Health Emergencies) Amendment Bill 2020. \c\cKey directions made under the Public Health Act 2005 include:\c\c2 April – A person must not leave their principal place of residence except for essential needs including work, food, medical and exercise, outdoor gatherings only up to 2 persons or with members of household, receiving only to 2 visitors at a residence, and no gatherings in non-residences. \c\c9 April – "Non-essential" business, activity or undertaking must not be operated. "Non-essential" businesses include cinemas, casinos, concerts, indoor sports, gyms, playgrounds, campgrounds, libraries. Restrictions also apply to restaurants (take away or delivery only), churches, hairdressers etc. However, most construction, mining, manufacturing and retail businesses continued to operate. \c\cRestricted entry into Queensland was introduced, with only Queensland residents and those considered an \'exempt person\' being allowed to enter Queensland by air, sea, rail or road from another state or territory. This was introduced in stages: Stage 1 started on 26 March 2020, with stages 2 and 3 involving tightening the restrictions. Stage 4, introduced on 11 April, was the most restrictive, every person crossing the border including Queensland residents required a permit. In addition, a person who had been in a declared COVID-19 hotspot in the previous 14 days had to self-quarantine for 14 days. \c\cClosures of areas within Queensland included:\c\cAll camping areas within Queensland national parks, state forests and recreation areas were closed on 26 March.[citation needed]\c\cClosure of high visitation National Parks including Fraser Island as well as all day use areas and visitor centres on 9 April. \c\cClosure of Queensland waters to cruise ships on 6 April. \c\cClosure of Surfers Paradise, Coolangatta and The Spit beaches on 8 April. \c\cAccess to the Torres Strait Islands has been restricted to prevent COVID-19 from reaching the region, which has to date remained free of cases. \c\cOn 1 February 2021, Queensland opened its border to all Australian states and territories except Western Australia. Since the border closures were implemented, 6,855,750 border passes were issued. \c\cOn 22 February, the first Queenslander received a COVID-19 vaccination at Gold Coast University Hospital. She was a nurse who works in that hospital's COVID-19 ward. \c\cOn 28 February 2021,  the "Check in Qld" QR code sign-in/contact tracing app was launched by the Minister for Health and Ambulance Services, Yvette D\'Ath.  It is based on the ACT "Check in CBR" app. Use of the app is not mandatory. \c\cOn 12 March, Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane went into lockdown after a doctor tested positive for COVID-19. This was the beginning of one cluster in Brisbane connected to that hospital. Queensland had gone 59 days without any locally acquired COVID-19 infections. \c\cOn 8 January 2021, a three-day lockdown was announced by Annastacia Palaszczuk to prevent spread of the more contagious UK strain of coronavirus that escaped from a Brisbane hotel quarantine. The lockdown applied to all of greater Brisbane including council areas of Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan City, Moreton Bay and Redland City from 6 pm that day. More than 2 million residents were affected. \c\cOn 29 March at 5 pm, Greater Brisbane went into yet another three-day lockdown. The step was taken when a second cluster of the UK strain of COVID-19 grew to seven people. Two of them were an un-vaccinated nurse from Princess Alexandra Hospital, and her sister. By 30 March another 8 locally acquired cases were reported, for a total of 10 new cases in the preceding 24 hours, and 2 separate clusters, both UK strain were identified. As of this date Queensland has 78 active cases in hospitals. On 31 March in Queensland 34,711 coronavirus tests and 7,596 vaccinations were conducted. \c\cOn 1 April, the "three-day" lockdown was lifted five hours early at midday. Though 10 new cases had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, there was only one case of community transmission, which was linked to the second cluster surrounding the infected nurse from the Princess Alexandra Hospital. This cluster now numbered 12, up from 7 on 29 March. \c\cSome restrictions introduced for the lockdown will be maintained temporarily:\c\call Queenslanders will have to carry a face-mask outside their home until 15 April,\c\cpatrons at food or beverage venues must stay seated, no dancing allowed,\c\c30 person limit at private gatherings at homes statewide,\c\cBusinesses and churches can open, but must have only one-person-per 2-square-metres of floor area,\c\cVisitors are not permitted for 2 weeks at: aged or disabled care facilities, hospitals and prisons. \c\cOn 15 March 2020, Premier Mark McGowan declared a state of emergency in Western Australia, along with a formal public health emergency. Schools were prevented from organising gatherings of over 500, including "...swimming and sports carnivals, interschool carnivals, performances, concerts, exhibitions, fetes and fairs."\c\cOn 24 March, the state borders were closed and all interstate arrivals were required to self-isolate for 14 days. \c\cOn 1 April, regional border restrictions were implemented across Western Australia restricting travel between regions to essential services only. People were given 48-hour warning to return to their home region. At the time the Perth Stadium became the COVID-19 incident response centre for WA. Within the Kimberley region, movement was further restricted to prevent travel between each of the four local government areas. \c\cOn 5 April, all state borders were closed, a strengthening of the previous border rules, all arrivals were quarantined in city hotels for 14 days. \c\cThe MV Artania departed Fremantle on 18 April following a standoff with State and Federal governments over responsibility for the care of passengers and crew. The vessel was sailing for Indonesia and the Philippines before heading back to Europe. \c\cOn 7 August, easing of internal WA restrictions set for 15 August were deferred to at least 29 August due to the Victorian outbreak. They were again further delayed to at least 24 October.[citation needed]\c\cOn 31 January 2021, a quarantine hotel security guard at the Four Points by Sheraton in Perth tested positive. A lockdown from 6 pm on 31 January to 6 pm on 5 February was declared for the Perth, Peel and South West regions. Schools within the lockdown area (which were anticipated to open the following day) remained closed and reopened the following week. Approximately 2 million people in WA were affected by the lockdown. \c\cIn response to the lockdown, health authorities in the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Victoria declared the affected areas to be COVID-19 hotspots. The states quickly enacted a variety of restrictions against travellers from WA who arrived since 25 January, ranging from, requiring COVID testing, 5 to 14 days of self or supervised quarantine, to Victoria forbidding entry without a permit. On 2 February New South Wales ordered more than 1,100 people who had visited affected areas in WA since 25 January into five days of lockdown, adhering to the same restrictions as in WA. New arrivals from WA had to have a COVID-19 test within 48 hours, or undergo 14 days of quarantine. \c\cThe lockdown was lifted on 5 February, but some rules such as mandatory mask wearing, and travel restrictions, were maintained in the Peel and Perth regions. The last lockdown specific restrictions were lifted at 12:01 am on 14 February. Premier McGowan said that since January 31 more than 102,000 COVID-19 tests had been done in WA. There were no new COVID-19 cases detected in WA overnight before the change, and only 5 active cases in WA, all in hotel quarantine. \c\cAlso on 5 February, Premier McGowan announced a A$43 million package to assist small businesses and charities in WA who suffered financially during the lockdown in the form of a A$500 offset on their electricity bill. Chief executive of The Australian Hotels Association (AHA) WA, Bradley Woods said: "We estimate over $100 million revenue and sales has been lost as a result of this shutdown ...". Plans to increase WA's weekly international flight arrival cap were postponed to the end of February. \c\cOn 23 April 2021, due to an asymptomatic returned traveller who tested positive after completing 14 days of hotel quarantine and subsequently went into the community, a lockdown from 12:01 am on 24 April to 12:01 am on 27 April was declared for the Perth and Peel regions. The traveller was quarantined after he travelled to India to get married. ANZAC Day commemorations inside the lockdown area (which were anticipated to go ahead with caps on ANZAC Day) were cancelled and people were encouraged to participate in driveway dawn services, as was the case in 2020. In response to the lockdown, Air New Zealand canceled a flight between Auckland and Perth. The lockdown ended on 26 April, as originally scheduled, with no new case of community transmission. For the following four days some restrictions such as: mandatory face masks in public; some venue closures; and number restrictions for public and private gatherings, remained in force, but travel beyond the Perth and Peel areas was allowed. \c\cOn 1 May 2021, a guard at the Pan Pacific quarantine hotel in Perth, tested positive to COVID-19.  While likely to have been infectious the guard visited several locations in the community, raising the possibility of another lockdown in Western Australia. He had already received his first dose of COVID vaccine. 2 of his 7 housemates, both food delivery drivers, then tested positive. It is not known how the guard became infected, but they worked at the hotel on 24, 25 and 26 April, including on the same floor as two returned travellers who were COVID-19 positive. One result was that spectators were not allowed at the Western AFL Derby on 2 May at Optus Stadium. Prior to the guards infection, up to 45,000 people were to be allowed to attend. On Sunday 2 May, WA Premier McGowan also announced a number of new restrictions, including that nightclubs were to be closed immediately. Those and the casino gaming floor will remain shut until at least 12.01AM on 8 May (Saturday). Under the restrictions, masks remained mandatory indoors and outdoors in the Perth and Peel regions, unless people had a medical exemption, or were doing vigorous exercise outside. This included those who had been in Perth or Peel since April 17. As of 3 May another lockdown was still a possibility. \c\cOn 15 March, a public health emergency was declared in South Australia. \c\cOn 22 March, a "major emergency" was declared, giving the police power to enforce self-isolation rules. \c\cOn 24 March, state borders were closed. People arriving in the state were required to sign a declaration that they would self-isolate for 14 days and provide an address to the police, with penalties for failure to comply. \c\cOn 27 March, a direction was made under the Emergency Management Act 2004 to prohibit gatherings of more than 10 people, and a limit of 1 person per four square metres. \c\cOn 16 November, "a number of significant restrictions" were reintroduced after an outbreak of coronavirus in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. \c\cOn 17 November, a six-day lockdown from midnight that day was announced. Afterwards there will be another eight days of "significant restrictions" according to Police Commissioner Grant Stevens. On 21 November, Premier Steven Marshall announced that the state's "circuit breaker" restrictions would be ending three days earlier on 21 November after authorities discovered that one of the positive cases at the Woodville Pizza Bar coronavirus hotspot had misled contact tracers by concealing the fact that he worked at the shop. As part of the easing of "circuit breaker restrictions", groups of 50 people will be allowed to attend private functions and funerals, ten people can attend private functions, and 100 people will be allowed to attend restaurants and pubs. \c\cOn 12 February 2021, the World Solar Challenge (SWC) for that year was cancelled by the SA Government. \c\cOn 5 March 2021, the first Australian received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. A doctor in regional South Australia, she was dosed at Murray Bridge Hospital. \c\cScotch Oakburn College in Tasmania closed as a preemptive decision in fear of rising SARS-CoV-2 cases. It was to be closed from 16 March until at least 30 March. \c\cOn 17 March, Tasmania declared a public health emergency. \c\cOn 19 March, all "non-essential" travellers to the state, including returning residents, were subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine. \c\cOn 12 April 2020, in response to an outbreak in Burnie, business restrictions were put in place for 14 days. It included the closure of most retail businesses except for those providing essential services, or those who can provide online services and home delivery. The North West Regional Hospital (NWRH) and North West Private Hospital (NWPH) were temporarily closed from Monday 13 April 2020, and staff, patients, and visitors since 27 March, were required to self-quarantine for 14 days. The self-quarantine affected up to 5,000 people. Additional testing was announced, and emergency medical teams from the Australian Defence Force were sent to Burnie to cover for hospital staff. \c\cOn 16 March 2020, the ACT government declared a public health emergency. All visits to the Alexander Maconochie prison were cancelled from 23 March, but there was "increased access to telephones" for prisoners to keep in touch with their families. \c\cOn 18 July 2020, it was announced a sitting of Federal Parliament, scheduled for the first 2 weeks of August, had been cancelled. Medical advice was that, due to increased transmission of COVID-19 in Victoria, and the upward trend in NSW as well, there was a "significant risk" if members were to return to Canberra from all over Australia. Prime Minister Morrison requested that the sitting be cancelled. Parliament returned in August with some Members and Senators participating via video links from remote locations. \c\cOn 9 September 2020 in Canberra, the "Check in CBR" sign-in/contact tracing app was introduced. \c\cOn 31 January 2021, Federal politicians flying in from Western Australia had to quarantine for five days when a sudden lockdown was declared in Perth and two adjoining regions. Parliament is scheduled to resume on 2 February. \c\cOn 17 February 2021, the Australian Capital Territorys\' public health emergency declaration was extended 90 days to 18 May 2021.  Every three months during the pandemic, the ACT government has lengthened the public health emergency. \c\cOn 22 February 2021, the first Canberran received a COVID-19 vaccination. She was a 22-year-old  registered nurse, and a member of a COVID-19 testing team. \c\cOn 24 March 2020, the Northern Territory (NT) government introduced strict border control, with anyone arriving from abroad or interstate being required to self-isolate for 14 days. The only exemption would be due to health and emergency services, defence and policing, flight crews and freight, and based on "compassionate grounds". NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said that the local police and government are likely to impose these measures until September. Anyone now arriving in NT will have to declare that they would isolate for 14 days and let the authorities know of their location during this period at the point of entry. Failure to comply with the new regulations could result in denying entry or a fine of A$62,800. Furthermore, all non-essential travel to the NT's 76 remote communities was banned. \c\cFrom midday on 1 May, some internal restrictions in NT were eased. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, after a quarantine hotel worker at the Grand Hyatt Melbourne, involved in the Australian Open tennis quarantine program, was found to have COVID-19, Victoria reintroduced some rules, and delayed the imminent easing of some restrictions. On 4 February 2021 the Northern Territory responded to the Melbourne situation by declaring ten suburbs in Melbourne to be hotspots. From 3:30 pm (Australian Central Standard Time–ACST), arrivals into NT from Melbourne, West Melbourne, Noble Park, Keysborough, Springvale, Brighton, Wheelers Hill, Clayton South, Heatherton or Moorabbin will be required to go into mandatory quarantine for 14 days. Those already in NT who have been in a any of the hotspots since 29 January will also have to self-isolate until their COVID-19 testing is negative. \c\cJervis Bay Territory has not had any confirmed cases. The territory's border with New South Wales was closed and residents were not allowed outside except for essential purposes. Various less stringent restrictions on internal activity and travel from other parts of Australia remained in place in November. \c\cNorfolk Island has not had any confirmed cases. As a precautionary measure, the government imposed a 32-day travel ban and declared a state of emergency. Administrator Eric Hutchinson stated that the measures were necessary due to the remote island's extremely limited health capacity. \c\cOn 18 March 2020, Administrator Natasha Griggs declared a state of emergency in the Australian Indian Ocean Territories, comprising Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. She limited passenger arrivals to local residents and essential staff, and imposed a self-isolation period of 14 days on any arrivals. \c\cOn 3 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia became the first central bank to cut interest rates in response to the outbreak. Official interest rates were cut by 0.25% to a record low of 0.5%. \c\cOn 12 March, the Liberal Party announced a planned A$17.6 billion stimulus package. The package consists of multiple parts: a one-off payment to pensioners, social security recipients, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders, payments of A$2,000–A$25,000 to affected small businesses, an increase to the threshold for the Instant Asset Write-off Program, tax concessions for investments, a small business 50% wage subsidy for 120,000 trainees and apprentices, and A$1 billion in subsidies for heavily affected industries. \c\cOn 17 March, the New South Wales government announced a A$2.3 billion stimulus package, including A$700 million for health services. A$450 million was allocated to waive payroll tax for 3 months. $250 million so state-owned buildings and public schools could employ more cleaners. A$750 million was allocated for capital works and public asset maintenance. \c\cOn 18 March, the Northern Territory government announced an economic stimulus package of A$60 million. \c\cOn 19 March, the Reserve Bank again cut interest rates by a further 0.25%, from 0.5% to 0.25%, the lowest in Australian history. \c\cIn March 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) began releasing a number of additional statistical products to assess the economic impacts on the outbreak on the Australian economy. Data on retail trade turnover indicated a 0.4% rise in turnover in February 2020. Negative effects on some areas of the retail sector (particularly tourism-dependent businesses) were offset by a rise in food retail turnover, with supermarkets showing a large rise in sales, mainly arising from panic buying. \c\cOn 22 March, the Federal government announced a second stimulus package of A$66 billion, increasing the amount of total financial package offered to A$89 billion. This included several new measures like an extra A$550 \'Coronavirus Supplement\' payment to those on income support, paid from 27 April to 24 September 2020, and relaxed eligibility criteria for individuals on JobSeeker Payment, granting A$100,000 to small and medium-sized businesses and A$715 million to Australian airports and airlines. It also allowed individuals affected by the outbreak to access up to A$10,000 of their superannuation during 2019–2020 and also being able to take an additional same amount for the next year. \c\cOn 30 March, the Australian Government announced a six-month, A$130 billion JobKeeper payment. The JobKeeper payment provides businesses with up to A$1,500 a fortnight per full-time or part-time employee, or casual employee that has worked for that business for over a year. To be eligible, a business with an annual revenue of under A$1 billion must have lost 30% turnover since 1 March, or 50% for businesses over A$1 billion. The entire payment made to businesses for an employee must then, by law, be paid to that employee in lieu of normal pay. This response came after the enormous job losses seen just a week prior when an estimated 1 million Australians lost their jobs. The program was backdated to 1 March with the aim of re-employing many people who had lost their jobs in the weeks before. In the first hour of the scheme, over 8,000 businesses registered to receive the payments. The program is one of the largest economic packages ever implemented in modern Australian history. JobKeeper ended on 28 March 2021. \c\cOn 11 April the South Australian state government announced its own A$350 million economic stimulus measures. \c\cIn late April the Federal government announced A$94.6 million of support was available for zoos, wildlife parks and aquariums forced to close by coronavirus restrictions. This was part of previously announced economic stimulus measures. \c\cThe 2020 Federal Budget, normally delivered in May, is delayed until 6 October because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cOn 22 May 2020, the Treasury and Australian Taxation Office announced there had been a miscalculation of A$60 billion in the planned cost of the JobKeeper program. Blaming 1,000 businesses for making "significant errors" on the application form, the Australian Government revealed it had overbudgeted the program, and that it was forecast to cost A$70 billion, not A$130 billion. The Treasury also announced that its original forecast of 6.5 million recipients was inaccurate, and closer to 3.5 million. Prime Minister Scott Morrison celebrated the saving, while the Opposition announced a parliamentary inquiry in an attempt to compel Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to explain the overestimation. \c\cIn July 2020, Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, in an interview with the US CNBC news channel, vowed that the government's budget deficit was expected to increase to A$85.8 billion Australian dollars in the financial year ended on 30 June and further widen to A$184.5 billion in the new fiscal year. \c\cOn 2 September the Australian economy went into recession for the first time in nearly thirty years. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) fell 7 per cent in the June quarter. In December, it was announced Australia had pulled out of recession after experiencing a 3.3% growth in GDP in the September quarter. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg stated the effects of the recession had lasting impacts and the recovery was far from over. Australia is set to avoid an economic depression as forecast earlier in 2020, though GDP is likely to have experienced a contraction from 2019 figures. \c\cThe 2020 Australian federal budget, delayed from May, is finally delivered on 6 October. \c\cOn 22 February 2021, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that the JobSeeker Payment base rate would be increased by A$50 a fortnight from April 2021. The payment will rise to A$614 a fortnight, with an estimated cost over forward estimates of A$9 billion. It is also intended to increase the threshold amount recipients can earn before their payment starts to be reduced. \c\cOn 26 February 2021 the Chief Executive of the Australian Airports Association, James Goodwin, said that Australian airports had been losing A$320 million every month during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said over the past 12 months, job losses amounted to 25 per cent of the airports workforce. \c\cOn 10 March 2021 the Federal Government announced steps worth A$1.2 billion to encourage Australians to holiday within Australia to assist ailing tourist destinations. Between April and July, up to 800,000 airfares to 13 regions normally favoured by international tourists will be halved for domestic travellers. \c\cOn 17 November 2020 the NSW Government announced in the state budget that all NSW residents over 18 years-of-age would be eligible to receive four A$25 vouchers through Service NSW to help stimulate the economy. Two vouchers are for dining, Monday to Thursday only, excluding public holidays. The other two are to be spent on entertainment, excluding on public holidays. Businesses need to be COVID-safe registered, and sign-up for the scheme. The vouchers cannot be used for gambling, alcohol, cigarettes, retail purchases or accommodation. The program was originally called "Out and About". \c\cResidents will need to have a Service NSW account to receive their vouchers. After trials in Sydney and regional areas, full rollout was scheduled for March. The trials began in Broken Hill, and The Rocks in Sydney on 11 February 2021. \c\cThe pandemic had dramatic effects on the Australian rate of unemployment. In July 2019 it was 5.1%, by July 2020 it peaked at 7.5%, during the pandemic, by the end of 2020 it had fallen to 6.6%. Figures for February to March 2021, released in April, showed unemployment had reduced to 5.8 per cent, 0.4 points higher than at the start to the pandemic. \c\cIn September 2020, a report from Ernst & Young stated that pandemic related border restrictions could result in a shortfall of 26,000 pickers over Australia's summer harvest season. Such work is typically reliant on seasonal staff from overseas. As a trial in early September 2020, 160 workers from Vanuatu were allowed into the Northern Territory (NT) to pick mangoes. They arrived on a specially chartered aircraft, and had to undergo the usual 14-day quarantine. It was estimated that the Vanuatuan workers saved A$100 million of fruit from the NT mango harvest being left to rot. The mango industry in the NT was valued at more than A$128 million in 2019, and produces more than half of Australia's mangoes. \c\cOn 30 September 2020, PM Scott Morrison announced that: " ... backpackers, Pacific Islanders and seasonal workers will be able to extend their visas to stay in Australia ..." and "... welfare recipients will be offered incentives to pick fruit."\c\cIn late October 2020, some farmers found that they had to plough their produce back into the ground because it could not be harvested, at a loss of A$150,000. \c\cThe "Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job" (RATTUAJ) program, scheduled to run from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021, offers A$6,000 for transport, moving expenses, accommodation and work clothing for welfare recipients willing to relocate to a regional area for a minimum of 6 weeks for short term agricultural jobs. Up to early December 2020, the relocation incentives for unemployed Australians appeared to be failing. After operating for a month, Federal Department of Employment figures showed only 148 people had taken up the offer. \c\cShortage of workers for harvesting can not only mean unpicked produce being left to rot or be ploughed back into fields, and farmers possibly not planting the next year, it creates an economic loss to those farmers, and can also noticeably increase prices for consumers. \c\cBefore the crisis, 600,000 Australians were employed in the arts, an industry which added around A$3.2 billion to export revenues. The rate of employment in the sector grew at a faster rate than the rest of the economy. According to government figures, "cultural and creative activity contributed to A$112 billion (6.4% of GDP) to Australia's economy in 2016–17". \c\cBeginning in the second week of March 2020, Australian institutions began announcing reduced services, and then complete closures. One of the first casualties was the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, with organisers announcing on 13 March 2020 that the 2020 festival had been cancelled entirely. Opera Australia announced it would close on 15 March. The national closure of all cultural institutions was mandated on 24 March, with subsequent restrictions on public gatherings. Consequently, many cultural events were also cancelled, including the Sydney Writers\' Festival. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, by the beginning of April, "Arts and Recreation services" was the sector of the national economy with the smallest proportion of its business still in operation – at 47%. A graph in Guardian Australia showing businesses by sector that had ceased trading between June 2019 and 30 March 2020 shows over 50% of arts and recreation services, the hardest hit of any sector (information media and telecommunications is next, at about 34%). Adrian Collette, CEO of the Australia Council for the Arts, the government's arts funding and advisory body, described the impact on the cultural and creative sectors as "catastrophic". \c\cThe Australian film industry has been severely impacted, with at least 60 shoots being halted and about 20,000 people out of work. On Monday 23 March, all productions funded by Screen Australia were postponed. As of 15 April 2020[update], after some improvement in COVID-19 statistics in Australia, Screen Australia continues to fund work and process applications, intending to use all of its 2019/20 budget. Film industry organisations such as Screen Producers Australia (SPA) and the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA) have been lobbying the government for a support package specific to the screen industry, and to expand the JobKeeper requirements so that those in the screen industry are better covered. Many in the film industry are employed by Special Purpose Vehicles – temporary companies that cease trading once production has finished – which cannot easily prove that their turnover has fallen by 30% or more. SPA said that the industry shutdown had cost more than A$500 million, with about A$20 million of lost export revenue. \c\cOne hundred and nineteen films and TV shows have been halted, with only a few shows (such as MasterChef Australia and Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell) continuing production through the pandemic. The TV soap Neighbours was the first English-language TV drama series in the world to announce that resumption of production would begin soon after 20 April 2020. \c\cLike other governments around the world, the Australian government has acknowledged the economic, cultural and social value of the arts industry. The Australia Council has redirected about A$5 million to "new programs designed to provide immediate relief to Australian artists, arts workers and arts organisations to support their livelihoods, practice and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic" (the "Resilience Fund"), and is also hosting weekly meetings to address the concerns of specific sections of the industry, such as Indigenous creatives and organisations, live performance and public gatherings, and various peak bodies. Several state governments have also provided relief packages. \c\cIn early April, the federal government announced a package of A$27 million in specific arts funding: A$7 million for the Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program, A$10 million for Regional Arts Australia's regional arts fund, and A$10 million for Support Act, a charity founded in 1997 that provides financial support and counselling to people in the music industry in Australia. However, the "JobKeeper" scheme specifically excluded "freelancers and casuals on short-term contracts, or who have worked for a series of employers in the last year", thus excluding a large proportion of arts and cultural sector professionals, who rely on short-term contracts. \c\cHowever, most of the arts sector's more than 193,000 workers were still unable to access the JobKeeper payments, despite being defined as sole traders, and an estimated A$330 million worth of paid performances cancelled. The Australia Institute recommended a A$750 million rescue package for the industry, while Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said that arts workers should utilise existing support measures. \c\cOn 4 May 2020, the company operating the Carriageworks multi-arts venue in Sydney declared it would be entering voluntary administration and closing, citing an "irreparable loss of income" due to government bans on events during the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent negative impact on the arts sector. Carriageworks was the first major arts venue in the country to collapse suddenly after the hit to income caused by the strict social distancing rules enforced by state and federal governments, but others feared the same fate, after being forced to shut their doors in late March. \c\cOn 13 May 2020, the Art Gallery of South Australia announced that it would reopen on 8 June. \c\cOn 24 June 2020, the federal government announced a $250 million rescue package for the arts, comprising grants and loans. The package includes $75m for a grants program for new festivals, concerts, tours and events; $90m in loans to help fund new productions; $50m to help film and television producers unable to access insurance due to the pandemic, to enable them to restart production; and $35 million in direct financial assistance for struggling Commonwealth-funded organisations, including theatre, dance, music and circus. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) welcomed the boost, but critics said that it was not nearly enough, especially with so many workers in the industry still ineligible for JobKeeper payments. 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23 January 2020. Early cases were primarily imported until local transmission began to develop in February and March. By late-March and April, COVID-19 clusters were detected at multiple sleeping quarters, for which soon contributed to an overwhelming proportion of new cases in the country. \c\cOn 22 January 2020, a multi-ministerial committee was formed with then-Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong and Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong as the co-chairs and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat as advisors. Singapore also contributed US$500,000 to support the World Health Organization's (WHO) efforts against COVID-19. \c\cIn response to the growing number of new cases in early 2020, Singapore enacted the "COVID-19 Control Order", announcing on 3 April 2020 a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the "circuit breaker lockdown". Initially planned to be applied from 7 April to 4 May, the circuit breaker lockdown was extended to 1 June on 21 April following continued untraced transmission within the community. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 28 May announced the three-phased approach to resume activities safely with the gradual re-opening of economic activities in each phase; Phase 1 lasted for 17 days from 2 June and ended on 18 June, with Phase 2 lasting for 6 months and 8 days from 19 June to 27 December. Singapore is currently in Phase 3, which will be sustained throughout 2021 and beyond until herd immunity is achieved, with a mass vaccination programme under way following the approval and acquisition of the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Following a spike in community cases from late April to May 2021, Singapore temporarily reverted to Phase 2 on 8 May 2021, and then became Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) as a tightened measure from 16 May 2021. \c\cAs of 13 May 2021, 393 active cases remain out of a total of 61,453 confirmed cases, with 61,029 recoveries and 31 deaths. Singapore currently has the lowest case fatality rate in the world at 0.05%, which is significantly lower than the WHO's global case fatality rate of 4.34%. Singapore introduced what was considered one of the largest and best-organised epidemic control programs in the world, along with fellow neighboring countries such as South Korea and Vietnam. Various measures have been taken to mass test the population for the virus, such as isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps such as TraceTogether (both app and token) and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with. Such measures has helped avoid further lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020. \c\cOn 31 December 2019, health authorities in China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), after mounting evidence that the novel coronavirus had spread to 18 countries and completion of investigation in Wuhan. \c\cThroughout the outbreak, cases were traced to clusters that several cases had visited during a particular time period, with venues including religious institutions, workplaces, construction sites, a number of schools, private events, retail businesses, and a hospital. Imported cases also became a source of infection in March. From early April to late September, most new cases were at foreign worker dormitories and construction sites, while imported cases formed the bulk of new cases from early October; as of 13 May 2021, there are a total of 54,518 dormitory residents, 2,486 cases in the community, and 4,449 imported cases. 20 April 2020 saw the highest number of daily cases at 1,426, while 12 May saw 20,799 active cases – the highest since the outbreak began. The last date of any patient in ICU was 13 May 2021. 14 August 2020 was the first time since June that there were no reported community cases, while 1 October 2020 was the first time since April that the daily number of imported cases exceeded that of dormitory cases. 13 October was the first time in over six months that no dormitory cases were reported. \c\cInternationally, the case fatality ratio (CFR) for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS in 2003. The transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus powering the COVID-19 pandemic has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. However, Singapore's death rate has been one of the world's lowest, both in terms of CFR and per capita. This may be attributed to the fact that the bulk of the cases are restricted to the migrant workers living in dormitories away from the general population. These migrant workers tend to be younger, with an average age of 30 years and 2 months old when surveyed in 2015, and the healthcare system was never overwhelmed. The authorities also tested the entire dormitory population for COVID-19 infection, leading to many otherwise asymptomatic infections being picked up. A research by the European Commission suggests that the CFR for SARS-CoV-2 virus picks up in cases 50 years of age and above. The elderly in the general population in Singapore have been advised to stay at home as much as possible, while resident-facing staff in old folks homes are being housed on site or separately in hotels. \c\cOther factors contributing to Singapore's exceptionally low CFR include the country's use of extensive contact tracing and testing to identify cases, mandatory mask-wearing, hospitalisation of all high-risk patients, and comparatively narrow criteria for classifying COVID-19 deaths. \c\cPrevalence studies on the population have shown that 4 in 1600 in the community, or about 0.25%, have previously been infected with COVID-19, while at least 47% of migrant workers living in dormitories have tested positive by PCR or serological tests. \c\cNational authorities began reporting suspected cases on 4 January, however the first confirmed case was reported on 23 January, a tourist from Wuhan. Until 30 January, there were a total of 13 confirmed cases, all of whom were visitors to Singapore from China. The first case involving a Singaporean was confirmed on 31 January after returning from Wuhan. Contact tracing procedures were put in place to identify close contacts of the confirmed cases who were placed under 14-day quarantines in order to ring-fence the potential spread of the virus. \c\cThese imported cases eventually lead to clusters of local transmissions being formed. The first cluster was reported on 4 February at Yong Thai Hang, a shop that mainly serves Chinese tourists. It was identified as the locus of the infection where four women without recent history of travel to China contracted the virus. The shop was affected when a tour group from Guangxi, China visited it along with other locations such as the Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive, where another case occurred, while touring Singapore. The tour group had returned to China and the Chinese authorities had confirmed that two of the group was infected. Authorities then raised the nation's Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange after more cases with unclear origins surfaced on 7 February, with Prime Minister Lee expressing his worry about some cases with no known chain of transmission of the infection directly from Wuhan or indirectly via cases traced in Singapore. He suggested that it might become "futile to try to trace every contact". More clusters emerged at various locations, where there were large scale gatherings such as a business conference, Chinese New Year dinner gatherings and church-related activities. Two clusters were linked when several cases in each cluster was found to have infected each other through serological tests, the first such successful test in the world. \c\cIn March, as the number of cases began to rise exponentially around the world, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) began to encourage Singaporeans to return home. Various institutes of higher learning recalled their students currently on overseas internship or exchange, and the MFA began liaising with airlines to facilitate flights to key cities when necessary during this period, to cater to demand for return flights to Singapore. This led to an increase in number of imported cases, in which over 70% of cases from 16 to 19 March were Singaporeans and long-term pass holders returning from overseas. \c\cOn 7 April, circuit breaker (lockdown) measures were imposed on the general population. The bulk of cases began to shift from imported cases to migrant workers living in dormitories, resulting in the authorities imposing a mandatory quarantine of 20,000 migrant workers in two dormitories gazetted as isolation areas, namely the S11 Dormitory and Westlite Toh Guan. Following which, the number of cases in migrant worker dormitories began to soar as more clusters were detected in other migrant worker dormitories, reaching a single-daily high of 1,426 cases recorded amongst migrant workers on 20 April. On 21 April, MOM announced that all foreign workers in dormitories were to stop work until 4 May to curb the rising spread of the coronavirus among the groups that were hit the hardest. The number of daily cases amongst migrant workers living in dormitories gradually decreased but continued to remain in the hundreds until early August, with aggressive testing by the authorities. April also marked a shift in policy. The government stopped automatically admitting the infected in hospitals and instead created community care facilities for those who were at low risk, which allowed hospitals to focus only on those in higher risk categories. At the peak on 12 May, there were 19,667 patients in community care facilities. This allowed hospitals to reduce bed take up related to COVID-19 from more than a thousand to several hundred in a few weeks. 18 September saw the first time since the crisis spread to work dormitories that the daily dorm case number fell into single digits. \c\cFrom May onwards, the vast majority of cases were reported in dormitories, with community cases never rising above 24 cases, which was reported on 11 July. Nevertheless, while numbers in the dorms remained elevated in May, 20 April in fact represented the peak of daily cases reported among dormitory workers. By August, it was clear that the situation in dormitories was being brought under control, with new daily cases among dorm workers finally falling below 100 on 11 August. On 11 August, Ministry of Manpower announced that all dormitories had been declared cleared of COVID-19 (except for those blocks that were being used for quarantine facilities). By 1 October less than 300 people were being housed in community care facilities, down from the almost 20,000 from the May peak. However, it also became clear that controlling the disease was going to be extremely difficult. While total case numbers had continued to decline, unlinked community cases had begun to edge up and some dorms that had been cleared of infection were once again put on lockdown. A significant milestone was achieved on 13 October when it was announced that, for the first time since March, there were no local cases of infection. This was followed shortly by 16 October, when the number of active cases fell to less than 100 – the first time since 12 March, and by 25 November, when it was announced that there were no active clusters for the first time since the pandemic began. \c\cOn 24 December, Singapore has confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus variant found in the United Kingdom. \c\cOn 31 December 2020, 2 new clusters were formed out of the 5 community cases reported that day, all of whom were linked to the marine sector. Two additional clusters were formed on 17 and 19 January 2021; the first was from 2 community cases linked to a para-vet working with the Singapore Police Force's K-9 unit, with the second from 2 community cases linked to a worker at Golden Bridge Foods Manufacturing. Another cluster consisting of four community cases linked to an employee at BS Industrial & Construction Supply was formed on 20 January. 2 new clusters were identified on 21 April and 24 April; the first was a household cluster of 3 community cases linked to a 43-year-old Indian national and work pass holder who was possibly re-infected, while the second was a group of 4 community cases who were linked to a 39-year-old Indonesian sailor. On 29 April, a new household cluster was formed out of 7 community cases that were linked to a 38-year-old Singaporean ICA officer working at Changi Airport, with another cluster formed out of 8 community cases linked to a 46-year-old Filipino nurse working at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. \c\cAfter banning short term arrivals in March, imported cases fell dramatically. However, since the beginning of July, there was a steady trickle of imported cases as the government loosened arrival requirements, with the majority of cases arriving from India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. January 2021 saw a sharp spike in imported cases, of which foreign domestic workers formed the bulk due to the high demand for maids amidst the pandemic. \c\cOn 23 April 2021, Singapore banned all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from India, which was experiencing a second wave believed to be fueled by a strain with a double mutation. This was followed by a ban on all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka on 30 April, which was later extended to all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors worldwide on 4 May. In addition, it was announced that Singapore would temporarily revert to Phase 2 from 8 to 30 May. However, it was too late to stop the strain from entering Singapore; the government announced on 4 May that the variant had been found among locally-transmitted cases in the community. \c\cThe authorities took cautious measures as the economy began to reopen to more regular outside travellers in August. Travellers who did not quarantine in a dedicated facility would have to wear an electronic tag throughout the 14-day period. Singapore also implemented a Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) with Malaysia, allowing limited travel between the two countries. Later in the month, arrivals from certain countries had their 14-day quarantine reduced to 7 days; those arriving from Brunei and New Zealand who were tested negative upon arrival would be allowed in without any quarantine. On 30 September 2020, the Singapore government announced that the country will lift border restrictions for some visitors from Australia, excluding Victoria state, and Vietnam, beginning from 8 October 2020; restrictions for Victoria state and mainland China were lifted on 6 November. In October, Minister of Transport Ong Ye Kung suggested that Singapore would be looking to open travel bubbles with various countries such as those with similar risk profiles, but also for those countries from higher risk locations. One such travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong was to have started on 22 November, but had to be postponed to 2021 due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. \c\cIn order to stop the spread of COVID-19, the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 and its Control Order Regulations 2020 was brought into force. These rules banned gatherings and led some to be charged in court, fined or even jailed for offences related to these laws. A number of people who were on work passes have had their passes revoked and have also been permanently banned from working in Singapore. \c\cThe ongoing pandemic is likely to have a significant impact on the local economy. On 17 February 2020, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) downgraded Singapore's forecast GDP growth to between -0.5% and 1.5%. This is largely due to the fall in tourism and social distancing restrictions. On 26 March, MTI said it believed that the economy would contract by between 1% and 4% in 2020. This was after the economy shrank some 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same quarter in 2019. On 26 May, the Singapore economy contracted 0.7%YoY, which was better than the expected contraction of 2.2%. However, MTI said that it was revising down its expectation for the Singapore economy in 2020 to shrink by 4% to 7%. Economists were behind the curve in downgrading their numbers. The IMF for example, predicted in October 2019 that growth in 2020 would be 1%, but as a result of COVID-19, had changed their expectation in October 2020 to a contraction of 6%. Other institutions initially expected the economy to expand but had to revise their numbers. \c\cOn 2 April 2020, the rating's agency Moody's downgraded the Singapore banking sector from "stable" outlook to a "negative" outlook on the back of rising bad loans and deteriorating profitability as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was estimated by the economist Chua Hak Bin, the lockdown "circuit breaker" beginning on 7 April could impact the economy to the tune of S$10 billion. With the lockdown imposed on foreign workers, there were concerns that there could be delays in construction work of up to six months. Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat announced that some 3,800 companies had closed in April 2020, only slightly higher than the 3,700 reported on average for the same month in the past 5 years. Though he warned that this would likely rise in the coming months. Despite this only small increase in companies shutting down, the number of companies starting up had declined by about a third from the average April since 2015. \c\cOn 6 April 2020, it was announced in Parliament that Changi Airport Terminal 2 would be suspended from 1 May 2020 for 18 months due to the ongoing pandemic. Terminal 4 would later be suspended on 16 May indefinitely as well, with the aim to restart operations when travel demand returns. The suspension of Terminal 2 would also allow the ongoing expansion work which was announced in January 2020 to be completed up to a year ahead of schedule in 2023 instead of 2024. The airlines which were operating from these two terminals were largely consolidated into the remaining Terminals 1 and 3, with some airlines remained suspended until further notice. \c\cIn November 2020, the MTI announced Singapore's economy contracted 5.8% in the third quarter from the same period in 2019. It also expected the economy to shrink contract by between 6% and 6.5% in 2020, though in 2021 it expected an expansion of between 4% and 6% next year. \c\cData released by the Ministry of Manpower showed that total employment contracted by 57,000 in 2020, which was the biggest drop since SARS in 2003. Foreign workers were vulnerable to being let go during the crisis as support measures such as the Jobs Support Scheme were primarily targeted as subsidising the wages of local staff not all employees. There were some 22,200 fewer foreign employees (excluding domestic workers) between December 2019 and March 2020. Ministry of Manpower reported that unemployment in the first quarter of 2020 rose to 2.4 per cent from 2.3 per cent the quarter previously, the highest in a decade, while among Singaporeans it rose from 3.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent. \c\cAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, various companies like Resorts World Sentosa reduced a significant amount of its workforce. \c\cLocal firms had to take aggressive action to deal with effects of the pandemic. For example, on 10 September 2020, Singapore Airlines announced that it would cut around 4,300 positions across its group. On 15 September 2020, United Overseas Bank announced that it was limiting hiring. \c\cThe overall inflation dropped to 0.3% in February 2020 on a year-by-year basis. Core inflation, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road transport, dropped to -0.1%, the first time this decade that core inflation turned negative. This was also due to supply chains being disrupted due to COVID-19. \c\cOn 9 March 2020, the Straits Times Index fell 6.03% owing to the impact of COVID-19, made worse by the oil price war. The Index dropped again three days later by 3.8% after more measures are announced with the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic. \c\cThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) brought forward its twice year meeting from some time in April to 30 March 2020. The MAS has since decided to ease the Singapore dollar's appreciation rate to zero percent, as well as adjust the policy band downwards, the first such move since the Global Financial Crisis. This makes it the first time the MAS had taken these two measures together. Unusually, on 6 April, the central bank also announced that it would bring forward its disclosure of foreign exchange intervention to 9 April. It was previously scheduled to be published in June. In September, Citi argued that a downward re-centring for the MAS SGD NEER in October 2020 could still take place. \c\cAs one of the countries highly affected by the pandemic, tourism in Singapore has fallen, with the Singapore Tourism Board experiencing its largest drop in visitor arrivals from the previous year. Several countries have imposed travel restrictions on Singapore. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong encouraged Singaporeans to go on a local 'staycation\' to mitigate the fall in demand for tourism, but this was not possible during the circuit breaker from 7 April 2020 to 1 June 2020. Retail industry was also affected by the pandemic, though it has been steadily recovering since the transition to phase 3. \c\cOn 15 December 2020, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing announced a new initiative, Connect@Singapore. It is part of Singapore's efforts to re-open its borders in a controlled and safe manner and facilitates essential global business exchanges and support the revival of Singapore's air hub status and hospitality sector. \c\cOn 8 May, Britain will allow people in England to resume international travel from May 17 but is limiting the number of destinations open for quarantine-free holidays to just a handful of countries as it cautiously emerges from lockdown restrictions. Singapore is among a few countries which made the green list for travel in a system that will be reviewed every three weeks. \c\cOn 11 November 2020, a travel bubble was established between Hong Kong and Singapore to restart tourism without needing to quarantine at the other end, though anyone traveling between the two cities will have to undergo a compulsory COVID-19 test before they flew. It was hoped that having a quarantine-free travel would boost tourism and business between the two Asian hubs cities. The travel bubble was originally scheduled to start on 22 November 2020. However, the day before the launch, both cities announced that it would be deferred by two weeks until early December.  This was due to a sudden spike in new infections in Hong Kong. On 1 December, the launch date was deferred again to beyond December 2020. This showed the complexities involved in opening up, even between countries which had coronavirus infections under control. In March 2021, it was announced that Singapore was currently in talks with Australia and Taiwan about possible air travel bubbles between them, and that it had resumed discussions with Hong Kong after the latter city experienced a significant decline in its daily local COVID-19 cases. On 26 April, both Singapore and Hong Kong confirmed that the air travel bubble would officially re-launch on 26 May. After a spike in COVID-19 infections triggered fresh restrictions in Singapore, Singapore's government stated on 6 May that it would assess any potential changes to the travel bubble. Hong Kong's minister for commerce, Edward Yau Tang-wah, later announced on 12 May that the travel bubble would launch as scheduled. \c\cDue to the 2019 Hong Kong protests, many conferences and exhibitions were transferred to Singapore. However, as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, many events were postponed or cancelled. \c\c70 exhibitors of the Singapore Airshow 2020, including US aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and South Korea's Black Eagles decided to pull out over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. \c\cThe Global Grain Conference in Singapore was also cancelled. \c\cMediacorp postponed its Star Awards ceremony to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cThe Shangri-La Dialogue defence summit that was scheduled to take place between 5 and 7 June at the Shangri-La Hotel was cancelled. \c\cThe 2020 HSBC Women's World Championship, a women's golf tournament initially scheduled from 27 February to 1 March, was cancelled. \c\cThe 12th session of Pink Dot SG (which was scheduled to be held on 27 June at Hong Lim Park) was replaced by a livestreaming session. \c\cSinger Miriam Yeung postponed a concert that was initially scheduled on 8 February 2020. It was initially rescheduled to 30 January 2021 — amid the government's safe re-opening measures — and was eventually cancelled. More concerts followed suit, including K-pop concerts by Taeyeon, NCT Group, Got7 (initially scheduled on 22 February), Stage Club play, Welsh singer Novo Amor (postponed to July), 98 Degrees (initially scheduled on 20 February), and First Fleet (a Mandarin play initially from 14 to 23 February, rescheduled to March 2021). K-pop band Winner cancelled its concert, which was scheduled to be held on 8 February. Several Huayi events in Esplanade were cancelled due to travel restrictions. \c\cOn 12 June 2020, it was announced that the Singapore Grand Prix, due to be held on 20 September 2020, would be cancelled. Organisers of the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown announced on 5 November 2020 that the event would be streamed online and on television by Mediacorp, and fireworks would be set off at heartland locations rather than at Marina Bay. \c\cOn 7 December 2020, organisers of the annual World Economic Forum event announced that they have decided to hold its 2021 annual meeting in Singapore instead of its traditional home of Switzerland, which is battling a rising number of coronavirus infections. On 3 February 2021, the organizers said that the annual meeting is postponed again until 17–20 August due to pandemic-related challenges. \c\cOn 4 May 2021, the President's Office announced that the 13 May Istana Open House would be cancelled. \c\cThe retail industry has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, together with food industry. Foot traffic at shopping malls were dropped, with some shops choosing to shorten their opening hours or face massive closures like Esprit Holdings, Isetan Westgate, Liang Court, I12 Katong, H&M Tampines Mall, Topshop, Robinsons and Hotwind. Tenants are pushing landlords for rental rebates, citing significant drops in revenue. \c\cSeveral malls and landlords including Jewel Changi Airport and CapitaLand have implemented rental rebates. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has also implemented rent waivers and rebates for all stallholders in hawker centres operated by NEA or NEA-appointed operators. \c\cAccording to CapitaLand in February 2020, foot traffic at malls were almost back to normal, before being reduced in late-March to early-April 2020 due to social distancing restrictions and circuit breaker measures. Retail sales fell during the COVID-19 pandemic from March to June, citing circuit breaker as a reason. The April and May figure was the worst since records began in 1986. However, retail sales reinstated gradually in July, August and September but the process was interrupted by public places visited by cases in the community. Foot traffic will again resume back to normal fully once Singapore moves to Phase 3. \c\cIn response to the government's lockdown measures, Suntec City announced that it would waive rent for all tenants for the month of April, May and June. \c\cIn addition, the Great Singapore Sale was moved online, called e-GSS. \c\cPanic buying and price gouging of personal protective equipment (PPEs) such as masks began with the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Singapore on 23 January 2020. By 24 January, both N95 and surgical masks had run out at retail outlets. The Ministry of Health assured the public that there were sufficient N95 and surgical masks in the event of a surge in demand. This has prompted local retailers including NTUC FairPrice, Watsons and Guardian to originally impose limits, but had a surge in demand. Several companies and areas have voluntarily made masks compulsory, with masks made mandatory by the government on 14 April. In addition, mask wearing is expected to stay place until an effective treatment or vaccine is fully developed. \c\cThe shortage of masks and other PPEs has caused many retailers to engage in profiteering by price gouging and scalping. This included both local brick-and-mortar stores as well as retailers on ecommerce platforms. The government has applauded platforms Carousell and Qoo10 for threatening to suspend profiteers. The governmental price controller has also issued warnings to retailers who engage in price gouging and requested information from e-commerce platforms on potential profiteers. \c\cPanic buying and hoarding of essentials such as rice, instant noodles and toilet paper occurred with the raising of the DORSCON level from yellow to orange on 7 February 2020, with empty shelves at supermarkets within hours. Local supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice imposed limits on the amount of essentials each consumer can buy, with these limits initially set for paper products, rice products, instant noodle packets and vegetables. NTUC FairPrice and Dairy Farm Singapore announced that it would introduce specific hours for those members of the community who were more vulnerable such as Pioneer Generation members. Following the review, supermarkets are considered essential services, therefore there is no need to hoard items, it must be opened everyday. \c\cA second wave of panic buying and hoarding occurred on 17 March when Malaysia announced its lockdown from 18 March, sparked by fears of food shortages. The government has clarified that the flow of goods, cargo and food supplies between Singapore and Malaysia will continue, urging the public not to panic buy. They added that Singapore has diverse sources of essential goods and was not facing an immediate shortage of food or essentials. NTUC FairPrice has expanded its list of items that are limited per consumer to include eggs, vegetables and poultry. 10 days later, NTUC FairPrice expanded its list to include canned food, cooking oil and frozen meat, with reduced purchasing limits for paper products. \c\cIn order to deal with the massive increase in online shopping orders, RedMart on 2 April said that it would prioritise daily essentials such as milk powder, flour, eggs and rice while limiting orders to 35 items and reducing its range of goods to focus on the essentials. It also said that it would stop taking orders until 4 April to implement additional measures. \c\cAhead of tighter measures on 7 April, shoppers queued at shopping malls despite government requests for people to remain at home. \c\cEgg distributors were reporting in June that they now had an oversupply of eggs and were throwing away supplies or culling laying stock. \c\cEven when DORSCON was raised to Orange on 7 February, several religious events still took place. One of them was the Thaipusam procession, which took several precautions like temperature taking and the provision of hand sanitizers and masks to assure devotees. The event ended up attracting 11,500 people, the highest turnout since 2013. Another was the Lantern Festival event in Loyang, which attracted half the usual turnout to about 3,000 people. \c\cThe Catholic Church of Singapore announced that it was suspending masses indefinitely from noon of 15 February. They were set to resume on 14 March, but continue to be indefinitely suspended in light of the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic. \c\cThe Islamic Religious Council of Singapore has asked Muslims to take precautions to maintain personal hygiene while the Singapore Buddhist Federation advised temples to cancel activities. Some churches have opted to suspend services, live streaming them instead. Religious institutions have stepped up disinfection procedures. \c\cOn 12 March, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore announced the closure of all mosques for five days from 13 March for disinfection, coming after two people were infected from a gathering in Malaysia. Prayers were cancelled on 13 March, with activities stopped until 27 March. The closure of mosques is extended until further notice. \c\cHindu Temples and Sikh Temples also recorded a drop in the attendance. Hindu temples in Singapore have stepped up precautionary measures such as checking temperature of the visitors. Some Hindu temples have put measures to provide live streaming of puja for devotees. Some Sikh Temples had to suspend their langar services. However, five private temple were providing langar on a smaller scale. Most processions were also cancelled. \c\cWedding ceremonies were also adversely affected by COVID-19. During the circuit-breaker period, all wedding ceremonies were suspended. This only resumed in phase 1 in a very controlled manner with weddings only able to be done in person at the Registry of Marriages, or at home with no more than 10 persons present. This number was increased to 50 persons in phase 2, and 100 in phase 3; on 24 March, MOH announced that the limit would be further increased from 100 to 250 for solemnizations and receptions from 24 April onwards, with pre-event testing in place. \c\cTaxi and private hire vehicles were hit by the impact of COVID-19. A S$77 million package was provided to help them tide through this period, co-funded by the Government, taxi and private-hire companies. In addition, a S$2.7 million fund was set up by the Government and National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) for drivers who are not eligible. In view of the worsening coronavirus impact, the package will be enhanced from May 2020, extending until September 2020. This will cost an additional $95 million. On 6 April, directors of the ComfortDelGro Group (ComfortDelGro, SBS Transit and VICOM) announced its board of directors would take a voluntary 20 per cent cut in directors\' fees until the end of 2020. \c\cVarious banks have suggested that Singapore Airlines will have a loss in FY21, with OCBC credit analysts Ezien Hoo and Wong Hong Wei arguing that the airline will have to tap the markets for more funds and possibly even need state support. \c\cSingapore Airlines, SilkAir and Scoot have announced plans to slash their capacity. Singapore Airlines slashed nearly all of the capacity until August. The news resulted in STI crashing down by 164.63 (6.83%). Scoot will ground 47 out of the 49 planes they have in their fleet. It was reported on 27 March 2020, SIA received a rescue package of S$19 billion to get over the difficult period. Its major shareholder Temasek Holdings will underwrite the package which contains S$5.3 billion equity and S$9.7 billion convertible note. Singapore's biggest bank DBS will also lend it S$4 billion to help it get over the crisis and position itself for expansion. With the significant reduction in flights, Singapore Airlines agreed to provide some 300 staff to help with possible manpower shortages at hospitals in Singapore and provided some staff to deal with transport ambassadors. It was announced that the airline would consolidate all their Changi Airport operations from 1 May 2020 to Terminal 3. On 14 May 2020, Singapore Airlines announced a full year loss for Financial Year 2019/2020 of S$212 million, this was the first loss in its 48 years of operation. On 1 September 2020, Singapore Airlines have announced to reinstate several destinations that have opened up travel such as Bandar Seri Begawan, Auckland, Christchurch, Hanoi, Brisbane, Perth and Sydney. For airlines, regulations for social distancing are not applicable to save costs. Mask wearing continues to be mandatory and airlines will upgrade their apps to include contact tracing. Overnight flights will also be re-introduced which allows even quieter rides. On 25 June Jetstar Asia Airways announced that it was cutting up to 180 people, almost a quarter of the workforce in Singapore. At the same time they would allow the retirement of five of their A320 fleet, bringing the total down to 13. \c\cThe Land Transport Authority announced that all certificate of entitlement (COE) bidding for the month of April would be suspended. \c\cTransport services were gradually reduced in stages. Last train timings were brought forward to early, and transport frequencies were remained to allow safe distancing. Measures also involve imposition of queuing at station exit points. Cross-border bus services 160 and 170 were amended to serve only local sectors of its route, while Cross-border services 170X and 950 were suspended in lieu of Malaysia's Movement Control Order. All City Direct, Chinatown Direct, NightRider, NiteOwl and Express bus services were temporarily suspended in tranches from 8 April 2020 until 1 June 2020, with the exception of Express 89e which was reinstated on 24 April 2020 to better serve essential workers at the Changi Airfreight Centre, while Chinatown Direct, NightRider, NiteOwl bus services as well as bus services 188R, 401, 926 and 963R continue to be suspended until further notice owing to the lack of recreational demand. The bus frequency and train frequency will see more improvements from 20 April 2020. \c\cThe quarantine and testing of all foreign workers in dormitories has caused delays in the construction of various MRT projects, including the delay of the Thomson–East Coast line's Stage 2 opening to early 2021. The LTA has been yet to fully assess the length of delays on the other stages of the line and of other MRT projects. \c\cSeveral parties have engaged in scams related to the pandemic. For instance, scammers have pretended to be MOH officials engaging in contact tracing. The MOH and police clarified that no financial details or transfer of money will be requested during contact tracing. The police have also arrested scammers on e-commerce platform Carousell. On 4 April, SPF announced that they had arrested a man for suspected money-laundering offences in relation to a COVID-19 linked scam which saw an overseas pharmaceutical company defrauded to the tune of €6.636 million (S$10.3 million) over the purchase of surgical masks and hand sanitisers. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and SPF were investigating possible abuses of the COVID-19 Temporary Relief Fund (TRF), which is supposed to provide financial assistance to those eligible. There were cases of scammers impersonating the Chinese police force asking for many personal details. A total of 394 COVID-19-related scams occurred between January and April, with losses totalling S$1.4 million. There have also been false rumours of National Environment Agency and police officers actively checking residential units to ensure that people were complying with circuit breaker rules. \c\cThe Singapore Government invested more than one billion Singapore dollars to sign advanced purchase agreements and made early down payments on promising vaccine candidates, such as Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and CoronaVac. \c\cOn 14 December 2020, Singapore became the first Asian country to approve Pfizer-BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine. The first shipment of the vaccine arrived on 21 December. \c\cSingapore also received its first shipment of China's Sinovac vaccine, on 22 December. However, the vaccine has yet to be authorised for use by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). \c\cOn 30 December 2020, Singapore became the first country in Asia to start its COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The vaccine is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. Health workers, other frontline workers and seniors were the first inoculated with the vaccine jointly developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, Singapore also became the first country in Asia to approve Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, jointly developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and Moderna. \c\cOn 16 March, the Malaysian government announced a movement control order (MCO) that took effect on 18 March, preventing Malaysians from leaving the country. With approximately 300,000 Malaysians, or almost a tenth of Singapore's labour force working in Singapore, the MCO would have been expected to significantly affect Singapore's economy, including sectors providing essential services. \c\cThe MCO caused long queues at immigration checkpoints as Malaysian workers in Singapore scrambled to collect their belongings and return to Singapore, while Singaporeans returned home. Various firms across Singapore rushed to find temporary accommodation for their workers before the MCO took effect. The Singapore government advised workers to try to stay with relatives, friends, and colleagues, and seek housing in hotels, dormitories and rental flats if this was not possible. The government also provided $50 for each worker per day, up to 14 days to support employers finding accommodation. As of 17 March, the government announced that 10,000 Malaysian workers had been matched with temporary housing. Some workers could not immediately find accommodations and resorted to sleeping in public areas. In response, Ministry of Social and Family Development repurposed Jurong East Sports Hall into a temporary relief area for remaining Malaysian workers who were unable to find temporary accommodations immediately after the MCO took effect, while the Ministry of Manpower stepped up patrols to look out for such stranded workers. A number of residents also stepped up to offer their spare rooms to accommodate Malaysian workers at little to no cost. \c\cThe MCO resulted in suspension of all bus services between Johor Bahru and Singapore. While the KTMB Shuttle Tebrau train service continues to operate between the two checkpoints, only citizens returning to their respective countries are allowed to board. The lockdown also sparked fears of food shortages, triggering a second wave of panic buying and hoarding of essential items. On 26 April, Malaysia announced that Malaysians wanting to return to Malaysia will need to obtain permits from the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore. However, only 400 of such permits will be issued daily. \c\cSingapore began to restrict travellers from entering from 29 January in a progressive manner as a response to localised outbreaks. Travelers from Hubei were banned from entering Singapore on 29 January with all forms of visas held by Hubei residents being suspended immediately on the same day. Any traveller who had travelled to mainland China 14 days prior to 1 February was also banned from entering Singapore. Chinese passport holders were allowed entry on the condition they can prove they did not visit China recently. At the same time, on 1 February, all forms of visas for Chinese travellers were suspended immediately. When there was a large increase in the number of cases in Cheongdo and Daegu, South Korea, visitors arriving from these two areas were restricted from entering Singapore, as well, from 26 February. By March, visitors arriving from other territories or countries, such as, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Spain, and Germany were banned. Port calls for all cruise vessels were stopped from 13 March as well. \c\cOne of the earliest recorded travel advisory on travelling to or from Singapore issued by other countries was by United Kingdom on 24 January 2020, encouraging its subjects to self-isolate and quarantine. Other countries such as Britain, Indonesia, Indonesia soon began to issue their own travel advisories, with language generally advising their citizens to avoid unnecessary or non-essential travel to Singapore. By 20 March 2020, there were at least 14 countries with travel advisories against Singapore, either specifically or as part of a general travel restriction on their citizens. As the number countries with travel advisories rapidly expanded, the travel restrictions have been broadly categorised into:\c\cDeny entry - where countries would deny entry to travellers who have been in or transiting through Singapore in the last 14 days;\c\cAllow entry, subjected to self-isolation/quarantine - where countries would allow entry, but subject travellers to either 14-day self-isolation or quarantine regime;\c\cAllow entry upon medical screening clearance - where countries would allow unrestricted entry after clearing required medical screenings such as temperature checks and/or swab tests. \c\cFrom 17 March, Singapore required all visitors who had travelled 14 days prior to ASEAN countries, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to be served with a 14-day Stay Home Notice, with ASEAN travellers required to seek approval before entering Singapore. However, this requirement was waived for Singapore's sea and land crossings with Malaysia as it was deemed too disruptive to the 200,000 people who utilise the crossings on a daily basis. This exemption was short-lived as the Malaysian government would soon implement a movement control order that would take effect from 18 March, preventing Malaysians from leaving and most foreigners from entering the country. Singapore authorities and businesses quickly made arrangements to secure alternate living accommodations in Singapore for workers living in Malaysia. Both Singapore and Malaysia authorities quickly worked to ensure that the essential goods could still cross the two land checkpoints, with further fine-tuning of transportation arrangement being subsequently conducted as there were still confusion by some of the supplying companies in Malaysia. \c\cSingapore banned all short-term visitors arriving or transiting through Singapore from 23 March onwards, with only people in essential services like healthcare and transport allowed entry during this time. \c\cDue to the reduced number of flights, Singapore Changi Airport suspended operations at Terminals 2 and 4 in April and May 2020 respectively. The suspension of Terminal 2 would also bring forward the renovation plans that the airport has for it, while Terminal 4 would remain suspended indefinitely until the demand for flights picks up and airlines seek to relaunch flights. Malaysia would also shorten the operating hours of Sultan Iskandar Building at the Johor Causeway to 12 hours daily from 24 April, effectively limiting the Causeway's operating hours. The Second Link crossing would remain open round the clock. \c\cOn 28 June, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Muhyiddin Yassin agreed that their governments will work together to establish a Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) allowing residents from both nations who hold long-term immigration passes for business and work purposes in the other country to periodically return to their home countries for short-term home leave. \c\cOn 14 July, Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and his Malaysian counterpart Hishammuddin Hussein announced that cross-border travel and traffic between the two countries would resume on 10 August 2020 under two schemes: the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA). The RGL scheme will allow essential business and official travel between the two countries while the PCA scheme will allow Singaporean and Malaysian residents who hold long-term immigration business and work passes to enter for work purposes. \c\cCruises were restarted in November but did not have any other port of call other than Singapore. In early December, an 83-year-old man tested positive on board and the ship had to return to Singapore a day early. Subsequent retests of the sample and additional samples proved the original test to be a false positive. \c\cOn 30 January 2021, the Singaporean Government suspended "travel bubble" arrangements with Malaysia, Germany and South Korea in response to a spike in cases globally and the emergence of new variants. \c\cOn 23 March 2021, The Singaporean and Malaysian Foreign Ministers Balakrishnan and Hussein have confirmed that the two governments had plans to recognise each other's COVID-19 vaccine certificates with the goal of restoring cross-border travel in the near-future. \c\cAs the pandemic spread throughout the world, the Singapore government had organised several repatriation efforts to bring Singaporeans back from various overseas locations. Beginning with Wuhan, Hubei where the virus was first detected, a number of Singaporeans were trapped in Wuhan as the Chinese authorities had locked down the entire Hubei province, thus suspending air links between the city and Singapore. Liaising with counterparts in the Chinese government and its embassy in Beijing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore (MFA) managed to bring back 266 Singaporeans and family members on two separate Scoot flights on 30 January and 9 February. MFA and other governmental agencies subsequently brought back at least 1,000 Singaporeans, permanent residents, and family members stranded at other locations where there were similar lockdowns and suspension of flights: Cambodia, Egypt, Fiji, India, Iran, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, and the UK. Most of the evacuees were brought back on direct flights, whilst some in Fiji, Iran, Nepal, and Slovenia saw some assistance from other countries. All evacuees had to serve a 14-day Stay Home Notice or be quarantined at designated locations, such as hotels with cost borne by the government, government quarantine faculties, or at home. \c\cWith flights to Wuhan suspended due to the Hubei lockdown, Scoot had offered two one-way flights back to Wuhan for tourists stuck in Singapore. As the travel restrictions began to grow and accumulated into an ongoing ban on short-term visitors arriving or transiting through Singapore started from 23 March, Singapore has allowed visitors to transit through Singapore if they are being repatriated by various governments.  India had repatriated some of its citizens from Singapore in May 2020 on two separate flights. In the same flight which Singapore Airlines brought back Singaporeans from Cambodia on 12 April, it also carried Australians heading back to Australia with Singapore being a transit point. It was reported that Singapore and Bangladesh were in discussions to repatriate their respective citizens if necessary. \c\cBoth the Singapore government and private sector sent support packages to Indonesia, including test kits and personal protective equipment. The Singapore government sent swabs and other supplies to Malaysia in order to help with sample collection and testing. Temasek Foundation donated 30,000 test kits to India and this was affirmed and thanked by High Commissioner of India to Singapore, Jawed Ashraf. Indian low-cost airline SpiceJet operated flights carrying the test kits and other medical equipment from Singapore to both Bangalore and Chennai. \c\cIn December 2020, Singapore pledged US$5 million towards COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX), a WHO-led global initiative aimed at securing COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. Together with Switzerland, Singapore co-chairs “Friends of the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility”, which comprises the European Union and the following 14 nations: Australia, Canada, Iceland, Israel, Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Norway, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. \c\cOn 26 April 2021, the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) and Little India Shopkeepers Association (LISHA) initiated and launched a relief fund to raise money and support India in its fight against COVID-19. \c\cWith the impact of COVID-19 becoming greater, it was becoming clear to analysts that Singapore would need to respond with large scale government spending. As of 26 May, Singapore has unveiled four Budgets that will spend 19.2% of GDP to ensure the impact on the economy is softened and to help the economy recover back to the original state. Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has said that based on economic terms, the economic contraction will be the worst ever since Singapore's independence. The government announced on 4 June that they would be keeping Central Provident Fund contribution rates unchanged as they believed the Jobs Support Scheme would help reduce the burden on employers. \c\cIt was announced on 1 February that the Government will provide help for the transport and tourism sectors as part of the 2020 Budget, being the worst-hit industries by the impact of COVID-19. In the 2020 Budget delivered on 18 February, the Government has set aside S$6.4 billion in support funds, which are a S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package for household expenses, a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package for businesses and workers and an additional S$800 million for efforts including the healthcare sector. In addition, the Goods and Services Tax will not be raised by 9% in 2021 owing to the economic impact, with a S$6 billion Assurance Package should it be raised by 2025. \c\cLess than a month after the first budget support package was introduced, it was announced that the government was working a second stimulus package to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the economy. The package was delivered in a Ministerial Statement by DPM Heng Swee Keat on 26 March, known as the Resilience Budget. COVID-19 has hit the economy so hard that President Halimah had given her \'in-principle support\' to draw on past reserves for this second package, which will amount to S$17 billion. In addition to S$6.4 billion announced in the first package, the government is prepared to spend a further S$48.4 billion to support businesses, workers and families, amounting to around 11% of GDP. \c\cAmong the measures include increasing government co-funding of 25% of wages for all local workers, with those in food services getting 50% support and those in the tourism and aviation sector getting up to 75% support. Self-employed workers would receive S$1,000 per month. These measures would last for nine months. \c\cA $350 million aviation support package was introduced to fund the measures such as rebates on waiving off parking charges. \c\cIn spite of this large spending package, several private sector economists were still expecting the economy to contract in 2020. \c\cIt was announced on 5 April that Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat would propose a third round of support measures through a "Solidarity Budget" when Parliament returned on 6 April. A total of S$5.1 billion was allocated for the package, with S$4 billion to be drawn from past reserves. Due to the extended Circuit Breaker announced on 21 April, support measures from the "Solidarity Budget" were extended to May, costing another S$3.8 billion. \c\cOn 10 May, the Ministry of Finance announced that 32 companies had returned Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payouts worth S$35 million and had said they would not receive future payments related to JSS. Other companies that had previously received JSS monies, had said that while they retain what they had already received, they would also not receive further payments. \c\cOn 19 May, it was announced that Finance Minister Heng would propose a fourth round of support measures at a statement delivered to Parliament on 26 May at 3.30pm. On 25 May, President Halimah gave her in-principle approval for the Government to draw on the reserves for the package, the second time it was done for this crisis. The budget has since been named the "Fortitude Budget". It was announced that the government would draw an additional S$32 billion from past reserves, bringing the total used to S$52 billion. In addition, another S$13 billion will be set aside for contingencies due to the pandemic. Extending and enhancing the JSS, to include higher tiers of wage subsidies and lasting until August, would cost around S$2.9 billion, bringing the total cost to S$23.5 billion. To thank Singaporeans for working from home during the "circuit breaker", the government introduced a one off Solidarity Utilities Credit of S$100 for all households. Food and beverage (F&B) and retail companies would receive up to S$10,000 as part of efforts to digitally transform their businesses, as they are likely to be seriously affected by safe distancing rules after the circuit breaker is lifted. S$2 billion was committed to SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package was announced to create close some 100,000 opportunities for workers affected by the COVID-19 economic slowdown; involving around 40,000 jobs, 25,000 traineeships and 30,000 skills training opportunities. The public sector will create more jobs, with the majority coming from the early childhood and healthcare sectors. \c\cAfter announcing more draw downs of the reserves, Minister Heng warned that Singapore's financial position would be weaker going forward, but the government would do try to mitigate the negative effects. \c\cIn order to help financial institutions and FinTech companies tide over the virus, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) released a $125 million package to help financial institutions and FinTech companies to strengthen long-term capabilities. \c\cOn 14 April, the Infocomm Media Development Authority announced that they will launch Public Service Content worth S$8 million and fund 90% of the course fees for Self-Employed Persons under Talent Assistance (T-Assist) Programme. In order to reduce operating costs, the Film Exhibition and Distribution Licence Fees will be waived from 17 April. \c\cEvery Singaporean who would be aged 18 and above in 2020 would receive S$100 worth of SingapoRediscovers vouchers, which can be used for a variety activities to support the local tourism industry. They were planned to be usable between December 2020 and June 2021 and would be paid via SingPass. Additionally, Trip.com has a "Pay It Forward" campaign throughout this usable period, where people can use their vouchers to pay for tourism products for various beneficiary groups. When the vouchers were launched, there were some complaints from Singaporeans about the complex way the vouchers were to be redeemed. \c\cOn 30 April 2021, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) announced that the expiry date of the SingapoRediscovers vouchers will be extended to 31 December 2021, and that improvements to the redemption process will be rolled out. \c\cOn 18 February and 10 March, the WHO praised Singapore's efforts to contain COVID-19 infections through tracing and quarantining close contacts, testing every case of influenza-like illness and pneumonia, and Singapore's "all-government approach" in the containment of COVID-19. The Singapore Police Force, Singapore Armed Forces and Ministry of Health are coordinating to do aggressive contact tracing. While many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, The New York Times argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties. Despite effective handling of initial waves of infection, serious outbreaks in April have brought the situation in Singapore out of control; many analysts points to poor conditions at foreign workers dormitories as a major factor of the failure. \c\cIt was reported in February that healthcare workers faced mistreatment from the public. President Halimah Yacob urged Singaporeans to appreciate the work of healthcare workers. Grab announced that they will be launching GrabCare to transport healthcare workers to and from their work places. \c\cOn 12 April, CNA reported that some staff members of Lee Ah Mooi, a nursing home, were evicted by landlords. However, the authorities had also mentioned that landlords who evict tenants on Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notices would be penalised. \c\cOn 17 February, a leaked recording of a closed-door dialogue session on 10 February of Chan Chun Sing with business people from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) went viral in Singapore. In response, SCCCI said that the leak is "deeply disappointing" and a "betrayal of trust", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak. \c\cThe pandemic brought the living conditions at foreign worker dormitories to media attention. Dormitories were reported to be unsanitary and crowded, making preventive measures like social distancing difficult. Retired diplomat Tommy Koh criticised the living conditions, calling it "third world" and "a time bomb waiting to explode". Amnesty International called the situation a "recipe for disaster". Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo vowed to improve the living conditions of foreign workers after the quarantine was handled. \c\cOn 9 April, MOM said in a press release that it will improve quality of meals of foreign workers during quarantine and formed a task force to improve the living conditions of foreign workers. As of 25 April 25 dormitories have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some healthy workers are also progressively being moved to numerous empty premises such as SAF camps, HDB blocks, floating hotels and Changi Exhibition Centre. On 16 April, Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo said that there will be a "three-pronged strategy"; containing the spread, imposing lockdowns and separating workers in essential services.

General elections were supposed to be held in Ethiopia on 29 August 2020 to elect officials to the House of Peoples\' Representatives, but were delayed, supposedly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regional and municipal council elections were also planned to be held at the same time around the country. In May the sitting House of Representatives voted to postpone the election until 2021. In late December 2020, the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) stated that it would take place on 5 June 2021. \c\cThe Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, along with three out of the four member parties of the political coalition which had dominated Ethiopian politics since the overthrow of the Derg regime in 1991, namely Amhara Democratic Party (ADP), Oromo Democratic Party (ODP) and Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM), was dissolved on 1 December 2019. Most of its member parties were merged into the Prosperity Party, which inherited the EPRDF's role as the governing party. The last leader of the EPRDF, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, became the first leader of the new party.[citation needed]\c\cBekele Gerba and Jawar Mohammed were imprisoned following the crack down by the government following Hachalu Hundessa’s  assassination. 3-5 months after their arrest, the government accused them of terrorism, which they flat out rejected and rather claimed they are being jailed purely for political reasons. Both are members of the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC). \c\cThe upcoming election is overshadowed by a war and a myriad of massacres in various parts of the country. \c\cOromia Zone (Oromo: Godina Oromiyaa) is a zone in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. In early January, According Hassan Hadiya, a resident of Kemise, Conflict started between Oromo residents and Amhara Special Forces after Amhara Special Forces killing an individual at the entrances of the grand mosque in ataye, Oromia Zone of Amhara region.Another resident of kamise, Ahmed says The Amhara region Liyu Police are attacking civilians and ongoing a blazing movement. eyewitness evidences blame the Amhara regional special forces while the Amhara regional government accuse both OLF-Shene and TPLF as scape goat of the violence.Two Members of Ethiopian parliament accused Amhara liyu police for killing Oromo civilian in ataye, Oromia Zone by labelling them what he called ‘’bread name” refers to OLF. “Amhara Militia used OLF-Shane as a pretext to commit war crime on Oromo farmers in Wollo for the three major reasons the MP said on 11th Session of parliament of Ethiopia. The reasons are (1) their national identity (being an Oromo), (2) their religious identity (being Muslim) and (3)use the atrocity as a bargaining threat to fulfill all their demands in Oromia region” On the occasion of the attack of wallo Oromos in Oromia Zone of Amhara Region by Amhara region militia in March 2021, OPP and APP came with opposite statements, each blaming the other ethnic group for being the cause of the violence and killings.Borkena news website and Amhara region official claimed OLF involved ataye town\c\cMany news outlasts reported on the "massacre" but many responsible bodies, mainly the Federal army failed to stop the killing hundreds of people and the burning of many crops as shown latter in many satellite and civilian images/videos. \c\cThe statues quo has not changed, the Amhara special forces exert unrestricted mutiny and the situation remains dire for the helpless Oromos, as one local put it. "Oromo farmers in the area are surrounded by all sides by hostile Amhara's and they are cut off from the much larger Oromo community and forced to sleep with one eye open"\c\cMetekel is a district in north western Ethiopia where massacre of civilians has been happening regularly  in the past three years. The massacres  have been deemed to be as genocidal acts by some where formal investigation is being conducted in order to bring the perpetrators and their chain of command to trial. \c\cShashemene is a town south of Addis Ababa and was a scene of a massacre  where Orthodox Christians and Ethnic Amharas were targeted. The violence was triggred by the assassination of singer Hachalu Hundessa in Addis Ababa. An umbrella humanitarian organization, OTAGE, has engaged a legal firm, specialising in international crimes, to bring those responsible to justice. \c\cMai Kadra is a small town in north Western Ethiopia where a massacre  was perpetrated against the civilian population based on their Amhara ethnicity. The atrocities are alleged to have been perpetrated by militia linked to TPLF. \c\cThe Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the dominant component of the EPRDF, was the only constituent party that did not merge into the new Prosperity Party. In September 2020, Tigray Region held regional election that the government of Ethiopia deemed illegal. \c\cAttacks on 4 November 2020 by Tigray regional security forces on the headquarters of the Northern Command of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) belonging to the Government of Ethiopia led to armed conflict in the Tigray region. In late November and in December, the Tigray Region government was replaced by the Transitional Government of Tigray. TPLF was then dissolved by NEBE. \c\cThere have been various reports of atrocities committed against civilians since the breakout of the war.

The 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis is an ongoing violent escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since early May 2021. It is characterized by police violence, acts of mob violence between the Jews and Palestinians, as well as Hamas rocket attacks against Israel and Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip. Over 200 Palestinians and 12 people in Israel have so far died in the conflict. \c\cAmid rising tensions and an increase in communal violence, on 6 May 2021, Palestinian protests began in Jerusalem over an anticipated decision of the Supreme Court of Israel regarding the eviction of six Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah, a neighbourhood of occupied East Jerusalem. The area in question, effectively annexed by Israel, remains under international law a part of the Palestinian territories that Israel currently holds under belligerent occupation. The protests quickly escalated into violent confrontations between Jewish and Palestinian protesters. The following day, the compound of the al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam located on the Temple Mount, which is sacred in Judaism, was stormed by Israeli police using tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades against stone-throwing Palestinians. \c\cThe violence coincided with Qadr Night, observed by Muslims, and Jerusalem Day, an Israeli national holiday. The confrontations occurred ahead of a planned Jerusalem Day march by far-right Jewish nationalists that was later cancelled. More than 300 people were injured, mostly Palestinians, drawing international condemnation. The Supreme Court ruling was then delayed for 30 days as the attorney general of Israel, Avichai Mandelblit, sought to reduce tensions. \c\cOn 10 May, after Israel ignored their ultimatum that afternoon, two Palestinian militant groups, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, began firing rockets into Israel from the Gaza Strip, hitting multiple residences and a school. Israel began to launch airstrikes against Gaza, some 950 of which by May 16 had demolished, completely or partially, 18 buildings including four high-rise towers, 40 schools and 4 hospitals, and also struck the Al-Shasti refugee camp. \c\cAt least 213 Palestinians have been killed, including 61 children, in Gaza by Israeli airstrikes. Palestinian rocket fire has killed 12 in Israel, including one child. On 11 May, the Israel Defense Forces claimed that at least 15 of the Palestinian casualties were confirmed members of Hamas, and also claimed that some Palestinian civilian casualties were caused by errant rocket launches within the Gaza Strip. As of 12 May 2021[update], both Israel and the Palestinian National Authority reported injuries for at least 300 Palestinians and 200 Israelis. As of 17 May 2021, at least 38,000 Palestinians have been displaced. \c\cOn the night of 13 April, the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, an Israeli police squad raided the Haram al Sharif and, brushing aside mosque attendants, severed the loudspeaker cables used to broadcast the Al-Aqsa muezzin's ritual call to prayer so that the speech being delivered by President Reuven Rivlin below, at the Western Wall, for Memorial Day in Israel would not be disturbed. At the same time, they blocked off access to the Damascus Gate where Muslim worshippers congregate during the holiday. The barriers at the Damascus Gate were eventually removed some two weeks later in the wake of protests.  On 15 April, a TikTok video of a Palestinian teen slapping an ultra-orthodox Jewish man went viral, leading to several copycat incidents. The next day, tens of thousands of Palestinian worshippers were turned away from Al-Aqsa, on the first Friday of Ramadan when Israel imposed a 10,000-person limit on prayers at the mosque.  On the same day, a Rabbi was beaten in Jaffa causing two days of protests. On 22 April, the far-right Jewish supremacist group Lehava held a march through Jerusalem chanting "death to Arabs". On 23 April, after fringe military groups fired 36 rockets at southern Israel, the IDF launched missiles at Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. In the following days, a Palestinian boy and a 19-year-old Israeli settler were killed. On 6 May, the Israeli Police shot and killed 16 year-old Said Odeh during a raid of Nablus in the west bank as well as incendiary balloon attacks launched from Gaza set off 6 fires. \c\cItamar Ben-Gvir visited Sheikh Jarrah shortly before the clashes began, where he said that the houses belonged to Jews and told police to "open fire" on protesters. Agence France-Presse reported that Israeli settlers had been seen in Sheikh Jarrah openly carrying assault rifles and revolvers leading up to the clashes. A video was posted of Ben-Gvir, in a joking exchange with the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, Arieh King, mocking a Palestinian resident shot by Israeli police during a protest. \c\cThe long-running dispute over land in Sheikh Jarrah is considered a microcosm of the Israeli–Palestinian disputes over land since 1948. Israel's laws allow Jews to file claims over land in the West Bank and East Jerusalem which they have owned prior to 1948, but reject Palestinian claims over land in Israel which they owned. \c\cA Jewish trust bought the land in Sheikh Jarrah from Arab landowners in the 1870s in Ottoman Palestine. However, this is disputed by some Palestinians who have produced Ottoman-era land titles for part of the land. The land was taken and destroyed by the Jordanian government following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. In 1956, the Jordanian government, in cooperation with the United Nations\' organization for refugees, UNRWA, housed 28 Palestinian refugee families on land owned by Jewish trusts, and managed by the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property. After the Six-Day War the area fell under Israeli occupation. In 1972, the Israeli Custodian General registered the properties under the Jewish trusts, which in turn demanded that the tenants pay rent. Eviction orders began to occur in the 1990s.[better source needed] The Jewish trusts sold the homes to a right-wing settler organization, which has since made repeated attempts to evict the Palestinian residents. The Sheikh Jarrah district houses the descendants of refugees expelled or displaced from their homes in Jaffa and Haifa in the Nakba of 1948. According to the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, this approach to property rights is unacceptable in international law. Palestinians tenants consider that, since the land is outside Israel's recognized borders, Israeli courts have no jurisdiction there; Tareq Baconi says that displacing tenants in this context violates the Rome Statute. \c\cSettler groups have succeeded in evicting 43 Palestinians from the area in 2002, with three further families since then. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Israel rejected an appeal by Palestinian families who had resided in 57 housing units in the area of Sheikh Jarrah, who had petitioned the court to have their ownership to the properties recognized. An Israeli court had previously ruled that the Palestinians could remain on the properties under a legal status called "protected tenants" but must pay rent. The move to evict them came after they refused to pay rent and carried out illegal construction on the properties. In 2021 Israel's Supreme Court was expected to deliver a ruling on whether to uphold the eviction of six Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood on 10 May 2021, after a court ruled that 13 families, 58 people including 17 children: 6 families by 2 May, and a further 7 by 1 August.[clarification needed] On 9 May 2021, the Israeli Supreme Court delayed the expected decision on evictions for 30 days, after an intervention from Attorney General of Israel Avichai Mandelblit. \c\cThe 2021 Palestinian legislative election for the Palestinian Legislative Council, originally scheduled for 22 May 2021, was indefinitely postponed on 29 April 2021 by President Mahmoud Abbas. Some Palestinian voters believed he had done so to avoid political defeat for his party Fatah. Analysts say the postponement contributed towards the current crisis, and encouraged Hamas to resort to military confrontation rather than diplomatic tactics. Opinion pieces in NBC News, the Wall Street Journal and Foreign Policy argued that by taking responsibility for the rocket fire, Hamas had improved its standing among Palestinians wary of the delayed elections. \c\cIn Israel, four inconclusive elections and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's courting of some "openly extreme racist politicians" encouraged the far-right. The presence of right-wing Israeli politicians Itamar Ben-Gvir and Arieh King fanned the flames. \c\cPalestinian protests began on 6 May in Sheikh Jarrah, but clashes soon spread to Al-Aqsa mosque, Lod, other Arab localities in Israel and the West Bank. Between 10 and 14 May Israeli security inflicted injuries on approximately 1,000 Palestinian protestors in East Jerusalem. \c\cPalestinians and Israeli settlers first clashed on 6 May in Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families are at risk of being evicted. Palestinian protesters had been holding nightly outdoor iftars. On 6 May, Israeli settlers and Otzma Yehudit set up a table across the street from Palestinians. Social media videos showed both sides hurling rocks and chairs at each other. Israeli police intervened and arrested at least 7 people. Israeli police have since engaged in extensive spraying of Sheikh Jarrah's Palestinian homes, shops, restaurants, public spaces and cultural institutions with Skunk, a lasting stench used to contain protests. \c\cOn 7 May, large numbers of police were deployed on the Temple Mount as around 70,000 worshippers attended the final Friday prayers of Ramadan at Al-Aqsa Mosque. After the evening prayers, some Palestinian worshippers began throwing previously stockpiled rocks and other objects at Israeli police officers. Police officers fired stun grenades into the mosque compound, and into a field clinic. A mosque spokesman stated the clashes broke out after Israeli police attempted to evacuate the compound, where many Palestinians sleep over in Ramadan, adding that the evacuation was intended to allow access to Israelis. More than 300 Palestinians were wounded as Israeli police stormed the mosque compound. Palestinians threw rocks, firecrackers, and heavy objects, while Israeli police fired stun grenades, tear gas, and rubber bullets at worshippers. The storming came ahead of a Jerusalem Day flag march by Jewish nationalists through the Old City. At least 215 Palestinians were injured, 153 of whom were hospitalised. Militants in Gaza fired rockets into Israel the following night. \c\cMore clashes occurred on 8 May, the date of the Islamic holy night of Laylat al-Qadr. Palestinian crowds threw stones, lit fires, and chanted "Strike Tel Aviv" and “In spirit and in blood, we will redeem al-Aqsa”, which The Times of Israel described as in support of Hamas. The Israel Police, wearing riot gear and some on horseback, used stun grenades and water cannons. At least 80 people were injured. \c\cOn May 10, Israeli police stormed Al-Aqsa mosque for the second time, injuring 300 Palestinians and 21 Israeli police. According to the Red Crescent, 250 Palestinians were hospitalized for injuries and seven were in critical condition. \c\cAlso on 10 May, a video showing a tree burning near the Al-Aqsa mosque began to circulate on social media. Below in the Western plaza, a group of Jewish Israelis chanted, what Yair Wallach called, "genocidal songs of vengeance" while cheering the flames with words from a song from Judges 16:28 in which Samson cries out before he tears down the pillars in Gaza, "O God, that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes!"\c\cWitnesses differed as to whether the fire was caused by an Israeli police stun grenade or by fireworks thrown by Palestinian protesters. Although the fire happened just 10 meters away from Al-Aqsa, there was no damage to the mosque. \c\cAfter Friday prayers on 14 May, Palestinians protested in more than 200 locations in the West Bank. Protesters hurled stones and Israeli soldiers responded with live fire and tear gas. As a result, 11 Palestinians were killed in the clashes. A Palestinian man who attempted to stab a soldier was shot, but survived; no Israeli soldiers were wounded in the incident. More than 100 Palestinians were injured. There have been daily demonstrations since the escalation in Gaza. As of 16 May, a total of 13 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank. \c\cAccording to Al Arabiya, Fatah has backed a call for a general strike on 18 May in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Palestinians in Israel have been asked to take part. In an unusual display of unity,  the strike went ahead and "shops were shuttered across cities in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and in villages and towns inside Israel". \c\cDuring the evening and night of 10 May, Arab rioters in Lod threw stones and firebombs at Jewish homes, a school, and a synagogue, later attacking a hospital. Shots were fired at the rioters, killing one and wounding two; a Jewish suspect in the shooting was arrested. \c\cWidespread protests and riots intensified across Israel, particularly in cities with large Arab populations. In Lod, rocks were thrown at Jewish apartments and some Jewish residents were evacuated from their homes by the police. One man was critcally wounded after being struck in the head by a brick, and died six days later. In the nearby city of Ramle, Jewish rioters threw rocks at passing vehicles. On 11 May, Mayor of Lod Yair Revivio urged Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu to deploy Israel Border Police in the city, stating that the city had "completely lost control" and warning that the country was on the brink of "civil war". Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod on 11 May, marking the first time since 1966 that Israel has used emergency powers over an Arab community. Minister of Public Security Amir Ohana announced the implementation of emergency orders. \c\cUnrest continued on 12 May. In Acre, a Jewish man was attacked and seriously injured by an Arab mob armed with sticks and stones while driving his car. In Bat Yam, Jewish extremists attacked Arab stores and beat pedestrians. An Arab motorist was also beaten in the street, which was caught live by an Israeli news crew. \c\cAs of 13 May, communal violence including "riots, stabbings, arson, attempted home invasions and shootings" was reported from Beersheba, Rahat, Ramla, Lod, Nasiriyah, Tiberias, Jerusalem, Haifa and Acre. \c\cHamas delivered an ultimatum to Israel to remove all its police and military personnel from both the Haram al Sharif mosque site and Sheikh Jarrah by 10 May, 6pm. If it failed to do so, they announced that the combined militias of the Gaza Strip ("joint operations room”) would strike Israel. Minutes after the deadline passed, Hamas fired more than 150 rockets into Israel from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that seven rockets were fired toward Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh and that one was intercepted. An anti-tank missile was also fired at an Israeli civilian vehicle, injuring the driver. Israel launched air strikes in the Gaza strip on the same day. \c\cOn 11 May, the 13-story residential Hanadi Tower in Gaza collapsed after being hit by an Israeli airstrike. The tower housed a mix of residential apartments and commercial offices. IDF said the building contained offices used by Hamas, and said it gave "advance warning to civilians in the building and provided sufficient time for them to evacuate the site"; Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fired 137 rockets at Tel Aviv in five minutes. Hamas stated that they fired their "largest ever barrage". In addition, an Israeli state-owned oil pipeline was hit by a rocket. \c\cOn 12 May, the Israeli Air Force destroyed dozens of police and security installations along the Gaza Strip; Hamas said its police headquarters were among the targets destroyed. Over 850 rockets were launched from Gaza into Israel on 12 May. According to the IDF, at least 200 rockets launched by Hamas failed to reach Israel, and fell inside the Gaza Strip. \c\cOn 13 May, Israeli forces and militant groups in Gaza continued to exchange artillery fire and airstrikes. Hamas attempted to deploy suicide drones against Israeli targets, with an Israeli airforce F-16 engaging and shooting down one such drone. The Iron Dome intercepted many of the rockets fired at Israel. On 14 May, Israel Defense Forces\' ground and air troops claimed they had troops on the ground and in the air attacking the Gaza Strip, although this claim was later retracted and followed with an apology for misleading the press. That same day, the Israeli Air Force launched a massive bombardment of Hamas\' tunnel network as well as above-ground positions, reportedly inflicting heavy casualties. It was suspected that the reports of an Israeli ground invasion had been a deliberate ruse to lure Hamas operatives into the tunnels and prepared positions above ground to confront Israeli ground forces so that large numbers could then be killed by airstrikes. According to an Israeli official, the attacks killed hundreds of Hamas personnel, and in addition, 20 Hamas commanders were assassinated and most of its rocket production capabilities were destroyed. Also on 14 May, a Hamas drone was downed by Israeli air defense forces. In total 160 aircraft were used in the Israeli air force's operation. \c\cAs of 16 May, according to the IDF, over 2,000 rockets have been fired into Israel; approximately half were intercepted by Israeli missile defences, and 350 fell inside Gaza. \c\cThe United Nations says that more than 38,000 Palestinians are internally displaced, sheltering at 48 UNRWA schools in the enclave. \c\cOn 18 May, Egypt pledged $500 million in efforts to rebuild Gaza after the missile strikes. \c\cOn 15 May the IDF targeted the al-Jalaa building in Gaza, which housed Al Jazeera and Associated Press journalists, and a number of other offices and apartments. The building was hit by at least 4 missiles, approximately an hour after Israeli forces called the building's owner, warning of the attack and advising all occupants to evacuate. \c\cAn Israeli military spokesperson confirmed the Army struck the media building, saying it contained "Hamas military intelligence". The Associated Press, which had used the building for 15 years, said they had never seen Hamas in the building. On 16 May, Israel said they had shown the United States evidence that Hamas operated inside the building. The United States secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had not personally seen any evidence that Hamas was operating out of the tower, but a senior official at the United States Department of State later clarified that "any such information would be provided to others in the administration, not directly to the secretary of State," stating that Blinken was only referring to what he had seen personally. On 18 May, Blinken said "It's my understanding that we\'ve received some further information through intelligence channels, and it's not something I can comment on". \c\cThe attack was condemned by Committee to Protect Journalists. Reporters Without Borders called for a war crimes investigation by the International Criminal Court. Gary Pruitt, CEO of Associated Press, said the news agency was "shocked and horrified that the Israeli military would target and destroy the building housing AP’s bureau and other news organizations in Gaza." He added that "the world will know less about what is happening in Gaza because of what happened today."\c\cOn 13 May three rockets were fired from the al-Rashidiya Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon across the Israeli–Lebanese border, landing in the Mediterranean Sea. Hezbollah denied responsibility for the rocket launches and Lebanese Army troops were deployed to the refugee camp, finding several rockets there. \c\cOn the evening of 14 May, three rockets were fired from Syria, while two of them hit the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights but fell in uninhabited places. \c\cOn 17 May, six rockets were fired by Palestinian militants towards Israel but the rockets failed to cross the Lebanese-Israeli border. The Israeli military responded by firing artillery shells across to border in the direction of the rocket fire. No one was injured in the incident. \c\cAs of 18 May, according to the Gaza health ministry, 213 people have been killed in Gaza, including 61 children, and 1,442 others wounded. 12 deaths in Israel were reported, including one child, and one Indian woman living and working in Israel. \c\cA Hamas commander, identified as Mohammed Abdullah Fayyad, as well as three high-ranking Islamic Jihad commanders were also killed. Another Hamas member was killed on 11 May. The deaths of the five commanders were confirmed by official statements of both the groups. The deaths of other militants are suspected, but not however confirmed. It is disputed whether some of the first victims on 10 May died as a result of an Israeli airstrike or an errant Palestinian rocket. \c\cOn 11 May, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched hundreds of rockets at Ashdod and Ashkelon, killing two people and wounding more than 90 others. A third Israeli woman from Rishon LeZion was also killed, while two more civilians from Dahmash and a soldier died the next day. \c\cBassem Issa, a top Hamas commander, was killed. \c\cHamas has been accused by Israel of using medical facilities to cover its activities. The Ministry of Health is run by the Hamas government, and wounded soldiers are often treated in civilian hospitals. As of 17 May the Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have caused the following damage according to the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\c\c4 hospitals run by Gaza’s ministry of health, including the Indonesian and Beit Hanoun hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip. \c\c2 hospitals run by NGOs\c\c2 clinics, one run by Médecins Sans Frontières, and one, the Hala al-Shawa clinic, in disuse at the time. \c\c1 health centre\c\c1 Palestine Red Crescent Society facility. \c\cAccording to the PLO, the Israeli strike on the Rimal clinic shut down the only Covid-19 laboratory in the Strip, rendering further screening for the pandemic impossible. \c\cPersonnel killed\c\cDr Moein Ahmad al-Aloul (66), a leading Gaza neurologist, killed when his house in the Rimal quarter collapsed after an Israeli strike on shops on the building's ground level. His 5 children were also killed in the strike. \c\cDr Ayman Abu al-Auf, the Al-Shifa Hospital’s head of internal medicine and director of Gaza's Corona virus response, killed by falling rubble after a strike on al-Wehda Street. \c\cChina, Norway and Tunisia requested a public United Nations Security Council meeting for 14 May while the United States objected. The Council has met privately twice but has not been able to agree on a statement over United States objections. On 12 May, it was announced that Hady Amr, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Israeli-Palestinian Affairs and Press and Public Diplomacy, would be sent to the region "immediately". Truce efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations have so far offered no sign of progress. \c\cOn 13 May, Hamas made a proposal for a ceasefire, stating that it was prepared to halt attacks on a \'mutual basis\'. Netanyahu informed his cabinet that Israel had rejected the overture. \c\cUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire, "out of respect for the spirit of Eid", making reference to Eid al-Fitr, an Islamic festival which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. \c\cHady Amr arrived in Tel Aviv for discussions on how to achieve a "sustainable calm" ahead of a United Nations Security Council meeting on 16 May. \c\cOn 16 May, U.S. President Joe Biden held telephone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Mahmoud Abbas. \c\cFollowing the third United Nations Security Council emergency meeting in a week the United States used its veto power to block a statement drafted by China, Norway, and Tunisia and supported by the other 14 members of the council. The statement called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and condemned both Israel and Hamas for the violence. \c\cOn 9 May 2021, the Israeli Supreme Court delayed the expected decision on evictions for 30 days, after an intervention from Attorney General of Israel Avichai Mandelblit. Israel Police also banned Jews from going to the al-Aqsa plaza for Jerusalem Day festivities. On 10 May, Israel closed the Kerem Shalom border crossing, including for humanitarian aid. Due to rocket fire on 11 May, the Israel Airports Authority briefly halted air travel. \c\cIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the actions of the Israeli police and said that Israel "shall not allow any radical element to undermine the calm". He also said "we firmly reject the pressure not to build in Jerusalem". Israeli officials asked the Biden administration not to intervene in the situation. \c\cOn 10 May 2021, Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, issued a statement that the "brutal storming and assault on worshipers in the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and its courtyards is a new challenge to the international community". \c\cIsrael's Minister for Public Security Amir Ohana called for the release of the Israeli man arrested for the shooting of an Arab in Lod, arguing without providing evidence that the suspect was acting in self-defense and law-abiding citizens bearing arms assist the authorities. According to a Guardian report, the statement seemed to encourage mob violence. \c\cA spokesman for Palestinian Islamic Jihad said that Israel "started the aggression on Jerusalem. If this aggression does not end, there is no point to diplomatic efforts to reach a cease-fire". Hamas gave an ultimatum to the Israeli government, saying if they did not remove forces from the mosque by 2 a.m. on 11 May, then they would conduct another rocket strike. \c\cNetanyahu convened an emergency security meeting on 11 May, and schools in several parts of Israel were closed. 
Russia–United States relations (Russian: Российско-американские отношения) refers to the bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia, two of the world's most powerful nations. The United States and Russia maintain diplomatic and trade relations. The relationship was generally warm under the Russian President Boris Yeltsin (1991–99) until the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the spring of 1999, and has since deteriorated significantly. In 2014, relations greatly deteriorated further due to the crisis in Ukraine, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, differences regarding Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and from the end of 2016 over Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. elections and the 2020 elections. Mutual sanctions imposed in 2014 remain in place. \c\cLeaders of Russia and the United States from 1992\c\cOfficial contacts between the Russian Empire and the new United States of America began in 1776. Russia, while formally neutral during the American Revolution (1765–1783), favored the U.S. \c\cFully-fledged diplomatic ties were established in 1809. In 1863, during the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Russian Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets wintered in the American ports of New York and San Francisco, respectively. Some historians credit this visit as a major factor in deterring France and the UK  from entering the war on the Confederate side. For many years, a myth persisted that during the American Civil War, Russia supported the Union against the Confederacy. In fact, Russia was strictly neutral. The myth was invented by the American State Department to mislead the British about American potential strength. Russia operated a small fur-trade operations in Alaska, coupled with missionaries to the natives. By 1861, the project lost money, threatened to antagonize the Americans, and could not be defended from Britain.  In the Alaska Purchase of 1867 it was sold to the United States for $7.2 million, thereby creating a common sea border between the two countries that still exists today. In the late 19th century, American public opinion was shocked at the accurate reports of anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire (mostly within the Pale of Settlement). It was a factor as late in American opposition to going to war against Germany with Russia as an ally in 1917, until the czar Nicholas II was overthrown in February 1917 and the objection ended. The Treaty of Portsmouth (1905), brokered by American President Theodore Roosevelt ended the Russo-Japanese War. \c\cFrom 1820 until 1917, about 3.3 million immigrants arrived in the U.S. from the Russian Empire.  Most were Jews or Poles; only 100,000 were ethnic Russians. \c\cThe U.S. participated in the allied military intervention against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War since August 1918, operating in the Russian Far East. Following the Bolsheviks′ victory in the Civil War and the establishment of the Soviet Union (USSR) at the end of 1922, the U.S., while developing trade and economic ties, was the last major world power that continued to refuse to formally recognize the Soviet government. The United States and the USSR established diplomatic relations in November 1933. \c\cThe United States and the Soviet Union were among the four major Allies against the Axis powers during World War II. Following the onset of the Cold War in 1947, the North Atlantic Treaty was signed by the U.S., Canada, and several Western European nations, in Washington, D.C. on April 4, 1949, a treaty that established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) designed to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. \c\cThe first bilateral treaty between the U.S. and Soviet Russia/USSR was a consular convention signed in Moscow in June 1964. In 1975, the Helsinki Final Act was signed by a multitude of countries, including the USSR and the US, and, while not having a binding legal power of a treaty, it effectively signified the U.S.-led West′s recognition of the Soviet Union′s dominance in Eastern Europe and acceptance of the Soviet annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that had been effected in 1940. The Act came to play a role in subsequently ending the Cold War. \c\cIn the 1970s—1980s, the USSR and the U.S. signed a series of arms control treaties such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (1972), two Strategic Arms Limitation treaties (SALT), the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (1987); in July 1991 the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was concluded. \c\cIn the late 1980s, Eastern Europe nations took advantage of the relaxation of Soviet control under Mikhail Gorbachev and began to break away from communist rule. The relationship greatly improved in the final years of the USSR. \c\cOn December 3, 1989, Gorbachev and the U.S. president George H. W. Bush declared the Cold War over at the Malta Summit. \c\cWith Communism defunct, on December 25, 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved, and the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose association was formed by 12 of the 15 former Soviet constituent republics, leaving out the three Baltic states. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became Russia. It was now an independent state that inherited the USSR's UN Security Council permanent membership and became the successor state to the USSR. \c\cStrobe Talbott, who was Washington's chief expert on Russia, has argued that Clinton hit it off with Russian Boris Yeltsin, the president of Russia 1991-1999:\c\cRelations between Yeltsin and the administrations of George H. W. Bush (1989–1993) and Bill Clinton (1993–2000) started off well, but deteriorated after 1997.  Yeltsin and his foreign minister Andrey Kozyrev made a high priority Russia’s full membership into the family of democratic nations. They wanted to be a partner of the United States. At home they tried to create democratic institutions and a free-market capitalist system. In 1993, the sides signed the START II arms control treaty that was designed to ban the use of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs); the treaty was eventually ratified by both countries, yet it was never implemented and was formally abandoned in 2002, following the US′s withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. \c\cClinton and Yeltsin were personally friendly. Washington encouraged the rapid transition to a liberal capitalist system in Russia. Clinton provided rich talking points but provided less than $3 billion, and much was paid to American contractors. The Russians--aware of the Marshall Plan in the 1940s-- had counted on far larger sums.  Real anger was ignited by the rapid expansion of NATO membership in Eastern Europe. With the Cold War over, Russians felt NATO's original role was no longer needed. It feared its dramatic move eastward meant an escalation of NATO's historic role in containment of Russian goals. \c\cRussia stridently opposed the U.S.-led NATO military operation against Serbia and Montenegro over Kosovo that began in March 1999. In December 1999, while on a visit to China, president Yeltsin verbally assailed Clinton for criticizing Russia's tactics in Chechnya (at the start of the Second Chechen War) emphatically stating that Russia remained a nuclear power. \c\cIn 2001, in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, the new Russian president Vladimir Putin quickly announced strong support. Terrorism against Russia was already high on Putin's agenda and he found common ground by supporting the American/NATO invasion of Afghanistan to destroy the Taliban that had harbored the Al-Qaeda terrorists.  By 2002, however, the two countries were escalating their disagreements. Russia became more assertive in international affairs; George W. Bush took an increasingly unilateral course in foreign policy. \c\cIn 2002, the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in order to move forward with plans for a missile defense system. Putin called the decision a mistake. Russia strongly opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, though without exercising its veto in the United Nations Security Council. Russia has regarded the expansion of NATO into the old Eastern Bloc, and U.S. efforts to gain access to Central Asian oil and natural gas as a potentially hostile encroachment on Russia's sphere of influence. The Russian leadership blamed U.S. officials for encouraging anti-Russian revolts during the Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003 and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004. Putin saw intrusions into Russia's historic sphere of interest. \c\cIn March 2007, the U.S. announced plans to build an anti-ballistic missile defense installation in Poland along with a radar station in the Czech Republic.  Both nations were former Warsaw Pact members and both had repudiated Communism and Russian interference. U.S. officials said that the system was intended to protect the United States and Europe from possible nuclear missile attacks by Iran or North Korea. Russia, however, viewed the new system as a potential threat and, in response, tested a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile, the RS-24, which it claimed could defeat any defense system. Putin warned the U.S. that these new tensions could turn Europe into a powder keg. On June 3, 2007, Putin warned that if the United States built the missile defense system, Russia would consider targeting missiles at Poland and the Czech Republic. \c\cIn October 2007, Vladimir Putin visited Iran to discuss Russia's aid to Iran's nuclear power program and "insisted that the use of force was unacceptable." On October 17, Bush stated "if you\'re interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon," understood as a message to Putin. A week later, Putin compared U.S. plans to put up a missile defense system near Russia's border as analogous to when the Soviet Union deployed missiles in Cuba, prompting the Cuban Missile Crisis. \c\cIn February 2008, Vladimir Putin said Russia might have to retarget some of its missiles towards the missile defense system: "If it appears, we will be forced to respond appropriately – we will have to retarget part of our systems against those missiles." He also said that missiles might be redirected towards Ukraine if they went ahead with plans to build NATO bases within their territory, saying that "We will be compelled to aim our missiles at facilities that we consider a threat to our national security, and I am putting this plainly now so that the blame for this is not shifted later,"\c\cIn July 2008, Russia announced that if a U.S. anti-missile shield was deployed near the Russian border, it would have to react militarily. The statement from the Russian foreign ministry said, "If an American strategic anti-missile shield starts to be deployed near our borders, we will be forced to react not in a diplomatic fashion but with military-technical means." Later, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin said that "military-technical means" did not mean military action, but more likely a change in Russia's strategic posture, perhaps by redeploying its own missiles. \c\cOn August 14, 2008, the U.S. and Poland agreed to have 10 two-stage missile interceptors – made by Orbital Sciences Corporation – placed in Poland, as part of a missile shield to defend Europe and the U.S. from a possible missile attack by Iran. In return, the U.S. agreed to move a battery of MIM-104 Patriot missiles to Poland. The missile battery was to be staffed – at least temporarily – by U.S. Military personnel. The U.S. also pledged to defend Poland, a NATO member, quicker than NATO would in the event of an attack. Additionally, the Czech Republic recently agreed to allow the placement of a radar-tracking station in their country, despite public opinion polls showing that the majority of Czechs were against the plans and only 18% supported it. The radar-tracking station in the Czech Republic would also be part of the missile defense shield. After the agreement was announced, Russian officials said defences on Russia's borders would be increased and that they foresaw harm in bilateral relations with the United States. \c\cIn November 2008, a day after Obama was elected president, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in his first annual address to the Federal Assembly of Russia announced plans to deploy Iskander short-range missiles to Kaliningrad, near the border with Poland, if the United States went ahead with its European Ballistic Missile Defense System. \c\cIn August 2008, United States-Russia bilateral relations became further strained, when Russia and Georgia fought a five-day war over the Russian-backed self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. \c\cDespite U.S.–Russia relations becoming strained during the Bush administration, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev (president from May 2008 until May 2012, with Vladimir Putin as head of government) and U.S. president Barack Obama struck a warm tone at the 2009 G20 summit in London and released a joint statement that promised a "fresh start" in Russia–United States relations. The statement also called on Iran to abandon its nuclear program and to permit foreign inspectors into the country. \c\cIn March 2009, U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton and her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov symbolically pressed a "reset" button. The gag fell short as the Russian translation on the button was misspelt by the State Department and actually meant "overload" instead of "reset". After making a few jokes, they decided to press the button anyway. \c\cIn early July 2009, Obama visited Moscow where he had meetings with president Medvedev and prime minister Putin. Speaking at the New Economic School Obama told a large gathering, "America wants a strong, peaceful and prosperous Russia. This belief is rooted in our respect for the Russian people, and a shared history between our nations that goes beyond competition." Days after president Obama's visit to Moscow, U.S. vice president Joe Biden, noting that the U.S. was "vastly underestimat[ing] the hand that [it] h[e]ld", told a U.S. newspaper that Russia, with its population base shrinking and the economy "withering", would have to make accommodations to the West on a wide range of national-security issues. Biden's words, published shortly after his visit to Ukraine and Georgia, were interpreted by George Friedman of Stratfor as "reaffirm[ing] the U.S. commitment to the principle that Russia does not have the right to a sphere of influence in these countries or anywhere in the former Soviet Union"; Friedman pointed up a fundamental error in the analysis that underlay such thinking and predicted, "We suspect the Russians will squeeze back hard before they move off the stage of history". \c\cIn March 2010, the United States and Russia reached an agreement to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons. The new nuclear arms reduction treaty (called New START) was signed by President Obama and President Medvedev on April 8, 2010. The agreement cut the number of long-range nuclear weapons held by each side to about 1,500, down from the current 1,700 to 2,200 set by the Moscow Treaty of 2002. The New START replaced the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which expired in December 2009. \c\cOn a visit to Moscow in March 2011, U.S. vice president Joe Biden reiterated Washington's support for Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization; he also had a meeting with Russia's leading human rights and opposition leaders where he reportedly told the gathering at the U.S. ambassador's Spaso House residence that it would be better for Russia if Putin did not run for re-election in 2012. Through 2020, this was the only time Biden and Putin had met. After an official group meeting Biden characterized in his memoir as "argumentative," he and Putin met privately, with Biden saying "Mr. Prime Minister, I’m looking into your eyes," (a reference to a 2001 meeting between Putin and President Bush, who later said "I looked the man in the eye...I was able to get a sense of his soul"). Biden continued, "I don’t think you have a soul." Putin replied, "We understand each other." Biden was elected president in 2020. \c\cAt the start of the mass protests that began in Russia after the legislative election in early December 2011, prime minister Vladimir Putin accused the United States of interference and inciting unrest, specifically saying that secretary of state Hillary Clinton had sent "a signal" to "some actors in our country"; his comments were seen as indication of a breakdown in the Obama administration's effort to "reset" the relationship. \c\cBy 2012, it was clear that a genuine reset never happened and relations remained sour. Factors in the West included traditional mistrust and fear, an increasing drift away from democracy by Russia, and a demand in Eastern Europe for closer political, economic and military integration with the West. From Russia factors included a move away from democracy by Putin, expectations of regaining superpower status and the tactic of manipulating trade policies and encouraging divisions within NATO. \c\cIn mid-September 2013, the United States and Russia made a deal whereby Syria's chemical weapons would be placed under international control and eventually destroyed; president Obama welcomed the agreement that was shortly after enshrined in the UNSC Resolution 2118. The Obama administration was criticised for having used the chemical weapons deal as an ineffectual substitute for military action that Obama had promised in the event of use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government. In George Robertson's view, as well as many others\', the failure of Obama to follow through on his 2013 "red line" and take promised military action badly hurt his credibility and that of the United States with Putin and other world leaders. \c\cObama acknowledged Russia's role in securing the deal to limit Iran's nuclear program that was reached in July 2015, and personally thanked Putin for Russia's role in the relevant negotiations. \c\cIn May 2012, Russian general Nikolay Yegorovich Makarov said that there was a possibility of a preemptive strike on missile defense sites in Eastern Europe, to apply pressure to the United States regarding Russia's demands. In July 2012, two Tu-95 Bears were intercepted by NORAD fighters in the air defense zone off the U.S. coast of Alaska, where they may have been practicing the targeting of Fort Greely and Vandenberg Air Force Base. Later in August 2012, it was revealed that an Template:Sclass- had conducted a patrol within the Gulf of Mexico without being detected, raising alarms of the U.S. Navy's anti-submarine warfare capabilities. \c\cOn December 14, 2012, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Magnitsky Act, which "[imposed] U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia". On December 28, 2012, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill, widely seen as retaliatory, that banned any United States citizen from adopting children from Russia. \c\cOn February 12, 2013, hours before the 2013 State of the Union Address by U.S. president Obama, two Russian Tu-95 Bear strategic bombers, reportedly equipped with nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, circled the U.S. territory of Guam. Air Force F-15 jets based on Andersen Air Force Base were scrambled to intercept the aircraft. The Russian aircraft reportedly "were intercepted and left the area in a northbound direction."\c\cAt the end of 2013, Russia announced that a rearmament of the Kozelsk, Novosibirsk, Tagil Rocket divisions with advanced RS-24 Yars intercontinental ballistic missiles was going ahead. \c\cIn July 2014, the U.S. government formally accused Russia of having violated the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty by testing a prohibited medium-range ground-launched cruise missile (presumably R-500, a modification of Iskander) and threatened to retaliate accordingly. Concern in the U.S. was also caused by the test-firing in 2014 of the Russian RS-26 Rubezh Intercontinental Ballistic Missile capable of evading the existing anti-ballistic missile defenses. \c\cIn early June 2015, the U.S. State Department reported that Russia had failed to correct the violation of the I.N.F. Treaty; the U.S. government was said to have made no discernible headway in making Russia so much as acknowledge the compliance problem. \c\cEdward Snowden, a contractor for the United States government, copied and released hundreds of thousands of pages of secret U.S. government documents. He fled to Hong Kong, and then to Russia where in July 2013 he was granted political asylum. He was wanted on a criminal warrant by U.S. prosecutors for theft of government property and espionage. \c\cThe granting of asylum further aggravated relations between the two countries and led to the cancellation of a meeting between Obama and Putin that was scheduled for early September 2013 in Moscow. Snowden remains in Russia as of November 2020. \c\cFollowing the collapse of the Viktor Yanukovych government in Ukraine in February 2014, Russia annexed Crimea on the basis of a controversial referendum held on March 16, 2014. The U.S. had submitted a UN Security Council resolution declaring the referendum illegal; it was vetoed by Russia on March 15 with China abstaining and the other 13 Security Council members voting for the resolution. In 2016, in a court in Moscow, former top Ukrainian officials of the Yanukovich administration testified that the collapse of the government was, in their opinion, a coup d\'état organized and sponsored by the U.S. government. Russian newspaper Kommersant alleges George Friedman (chairman of Stratfor) had agreed this was the "most blatant coup in history\', which George Friedman says was taken out of context. \c\cU.S. secretary of state John Kerry in early March 2014 answering the press questions about Russia's moves in Crimea said, "This is an act of aggression that is completely trumped up in terms of its pretext. It's really 19th century behavior in the 21st century, and there is no way, to start with, that if Russia persists in this, that the G8 countries are going to assemble in Sochi. That's a starter." On March 24, 2014, the U.S. and its allies in the G8 political forum suspended Russia's membership thereof. The decision was dismissed by Russia as inconsequential. \c\cAt the end of March 2014, U.S. president Obama ruled out any Western military intervention in Ukraine and admitted that Russia's annexation of Crimea would be hard to reverse; however, he dismissed Russia as a "regional power" that did not pose a major security threat to the U.S. In January 2016, when asked for his opinion of Obama's statement, Putin said, "I think that speculations about other countries, an attempt to speak disrespectfully about other countries is an attempt to prove one's exceptionalism by contrast. In my view, that is a misguided position." In November 2016, the president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said this of the statement of Obama: "We have a lot to learn about the depths of Russia, we are very ignorant about it at the moment. I would like to have discussions on a level footing with Russia. Russia is not, as President Obama said, \'a regional power\'. This was a big error in assessment."\c\cAs unrest spread into eastern Ukraine in the spring of 2014, relations between the U.S. and Russia further worsened. The U.S. government imposed punitive sanctions for Russia's activity in Ukraine. After one bout of sanctions announced by President Obama in July 2014 targeting Russia's major energy, financial and defence companies, Russia said the sanctions would seriously harm the bilateral ties relegating them to the 1980s Cold War era. \c\cFrom March 2014 to 2016, six rounds of sanctions were imposed by the US, as well as by the EU, and some other countries allied to the U.S. The first three rounds targeted individuals close to Putin by freezing their assets and denying leave to enter. Russia responded by banning import of certain food products as well as by banning entry for certain government officials from the countries that imposed sanctions against Russia. \c\cThe end of 2014 saw the passage by the US of the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014, aimed at depriving certain Russian state firms of Western financing and technology while also providing $350 million in arms and military equipment to Ukraine, and the imposition by the US president's executive order of yet another round of sanctions. \c\cDue to the situation concerning Ukraine, relations between Russia and the U.S. that denounced Russia's actions were in 2014 said to be at their worst since the end of the Cold War. \c\cAs vice president, Joe Biden urged the Ukrainian government to reduce the nation's reliance on imports of Russian natural gas, and to eliminate pro-Russia middlemen such as Dmitry Firtash from the country's natural gas industry. \c\cShortly after the start of the Syrian Civil War in the spring of 2011, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Syria's government and urged president Bashar al-Assad to resign; meanwhile, Russia, a long-standing ally of Syria, continued and increased its support for the Syrian government against rebels backed up by the U.S. and its regional allies. \c\cOn September 30, 2015, Russia began the air campaign in Syria on the side of the Syrian government headed by president Bashar al-Assad of Syria. According to Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov's statement made in mid-October 2015, Russia had invited the U.S. to join the Baghdad-based information center set up by Iran, Iraq, Syria and Russia to coordinate their military efforts, but received what he called an "unconstructive" response; Putin's proposal that the U.S. receive a high-level Russian delegation and that a U.S. delegation arrive in Moscow to discuss co-operation in Syria was likewise declined by the U.S. \c\cIn early October 2015, U.S. president Obama called the way Russia was conducting its military campaign in Syria a "recipe for disaster"; top U.S. military officials ruled out military cooperation with Russia in Syria. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and other senior U.S. officials said Russia's campaign was primarily aimed at propping up Assad, whom U.S. president Barack Obama had repeatedly called upon to leave power. \c\cThree weeks into the Russian campaign in Syria, on October 20, 2015, Russian president Vladimir Putin met Bashar Assad in Moscow to discuss their joint military campaign and a future political settlement in Syria, according to the Kremlin report of the event. The meeting provoked a sharp condemnation from the White House. \c\cWhile one of the original aims of the Russian leadership may have been normalisation of the relationship with the U.S. and the West at large, the resultant situation in Syria was said in October 2015 to be a proxy war between Russia and the U.S. The two rounds of the Syria peace talks held in Vienna in October and November 2015, with Iran participating for the first time, highlighted yet again the deep disagreement over the Syrian settlement between the U.S. and Russia, primarily on the issue of Bashar Assad's political future. The talks in Vienna were followed by a bilateral meeting of Obama and Putin on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Turkey, during which a certain consensus between the two leaders on Syria was reported to have been reached. \c\cBilateral negotiations over Syria were unilaterally suspended by the U.S on October 3, 2016, which was presented as the U.S. government's reaction to a re-newed offensive on Aleppo by Syrian and Russian troops. On the same day Putin signed a decree that suspended the 2000 Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement with the U.S. (the relevant law was signed on October 31, 2016), citing the failure by the U.S. to comply with the provisions thereof as well as the U.S.\' unfriendly actions that posed a "threat to strategic stability." In mid-October 2016, Russia's U.N. ambassador Vitaly Churkin, referring to the international situation during the 1973 Arab–Israeli War, said that tensions with the U.S. are "probably the worst since 1973". After two rounds of fruitless talks on Syria in Lausanne and London, the foreign ministers of the U.S. and the UK said that additional sanctions against both Russia and Syria were imminent unless Russia and the "Assad regime" stopped their air campaign in Aleppo. \c\cThe U.S. presidential election campaign of 2016 saw the U.S. security officials accuse the Russian government of being behind massive cyber-hackings and leaks that aimed at influencing the election and discrediting the U.S. political system. The allegations were dismissed by Putin who said the idea that Russia was favouring Donald Trump was a myth created by the Hillary Clinton campaign. The background of tense relationship between Putin and Hillary Clinton was highlighted by U.S. press during the election campaign. Trump had been widely seen as a pro-Russia candidate, with the FBI investigating alleged connections between Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort as well as Carter Page and pro-Russian interests. \c\cIn mid-November 2016, shortly after the election of Trump as the U.S. president, the Kremlin accused president Barack Obama's administration of trying to damage the U.S.\' relationship with Russia to a degree that would render normalization thereof impossible for Trump's incoming administration. \c\cIn his address to the Russian parliament delivered on December 1, 2016, Russian president Putin said this of U.S.—Russia relations: "We are prepared to cooperate with the new American administration. It's important to normalize and begin to develop bilateral relations on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. Mutual efforts by Russia and the United States in solving global and regional problems are in the interest of the entire world."\c\cIn early December 2016, the White House said that President Obama had ordered the intelligence agencies to review evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign; Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary, denied the review to be led by Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper was meant to be "an effort to challenge the outcome of the election". Simultaneously, the U.S. press published reports, with reference to senior administration officials, that U.S. intelligence agencies, specifically the CIA, had concluded with "high confidence" that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton's chances and promote Donald Trump. President-elect Donald Trump rejected the CIA assessment that Russia was behind the hackers\' efforts to sway the campaign in his favour as "ridiculous". \c\cIn mid-December 2016, Hillary Clinton suggested that Putin had a personal grudge against her due to her criticism of the 2011 Russian legislative election and his opinion that she was responsible for fomenting the anti-Putin protests in Russia that began in December 2011. She partially attributed her loss in the 2016 election to Russian meddling organized by Putin. \c\cAlso in mid-December, President Obama publicly pledged to retaliate for Russian cyberattacks during the U.S. presidential election in order to "send a clear message to Russia" as both a punishment and a deterrent,; however, the press reported that his actionable options were limited, with many of those having been rejected as either ineffective or too risky; The New York Times, citing a catalogue of U.S.-engineered coups in foreign countries, opined, "There is not much new in tampering with elections, except for the technical sophistication of the tools. For all the outrage voiced by Democrats and Republicans in the past week about the Russian action — with the notable exception of Mr. Trump, who has dismissed the intelligence findings as politically motivated — it is worth remembering that trying to manipulate elections is a well-honed American art form."\c\cThe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 signed into law by president Obama on December 23, 2016, was criticised by the Russian foreign ministry as yet another attempt to "create problems for the incoming Trump administration and complicate its relations on the international stage, as well as to force it to adopt an anti-Russia policy."\c\cAt the end of 2016, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump praised Putin for not expelling U.S. diplomats in response to Washington's expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats as well as other punitive measures taken by the Obama administration in retaliation for what U.S. officials had characterized as interference in the U.S. presidential election. \c\cOn January 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), in an assessment of “Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections”, asserted that Russian leadership favored presidential candidate Trump over Clinton, and that Putin personally ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Clinton's chances and "undermine public faith in the US democratic process". \c\cA week after the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2017, the U.S. president Donald Trump had a 50-minute telephone conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin that was hailed by both governments as a step towards improvement of relations between the U.S. and Russia; the presidents agreed to arrange a face-to-face meeting for a later date. \c\cIn early March 2017, the U.S. military for the first time publicly accused Russia of having deployed a land-based cruise missile (SSC-8) that they said violated the "spirit and intent" of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and posed a threat to NATO. \c\cOn March 25, 2017, the U.S. imposed new sanctions against eight Russian companies in connection with the Iran, North Korea, Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA).[citation needed]\c\cThe cruise-missile strikes on the Syrian Shayrat Airbase, conducted by the U.S. on April 7, 2017 as a response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, were condemned by Russia as an "act of aggression" that was based on a "trumped-up pretext", which substantially impaired Russia–United States relations. Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said the attack had placed the U.S. on the cusp of warfare with Russia. Both Donald Trump in April and the Russian government in May characterised the relationship between the countries as frozen and lacking any progress; in early June, Vladimir Putin said relations were at an all-time low since the end of the Cold War. In mid-June 2017, the Russian foreign ministry confirmed that, for the first time ever, Russia had failed to receive a formal greeting from the U.S. government on occasion of Russia's national day celebrated on June 12. \c\cIn April 2017, Trump's administration denied a request from ExxonMobil to allow it to resume oil drilling in Russia. In July 2017, ExxonMobil filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government challenging the finding that the company violated sanctions imposed on Russia. \c\cOn May 10, 2017, Trump had an unannounced meeting in the Oval Office with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. During the meeting he disclosed highly classified information, providing details that could have been used to deduce the source of the information and the manner in which it was collected, according to current and former government officials. Although the disclosure was not illegal, it was widely criticized because of the possible danger to the source. \c\cOn July 6, 2017, during a speech in Warsaw, Poland, Trump urged Russia to cease its support for "hostile regimes" in Syria and Iran. On July 7, 2017, in what appeared to be a sign of good relations between the leaders of both countries, Trump met with Putin at the G20 Hamburg summit in Germany and described the meeting as "an honour."\c\cIn mid-July 2017, the Russian foreign ministry noted that the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, following expulsion of diplomats by the Obama administration in December 2016, far exceeded the number of Russian embassy employees in Washington and indicated that the Russian government was considering retaliatory expulsion of more than thirty-five U.S. diplomats, thus evening out the number of the countries\' diplomats posted. On July 28, Russia announced punitive measures that were cast as Russia's response to the additional, codified, sanctions against Moscow passed by Congress days prior, but also referenced the specific measures imposed against the Russian diplomatic mission in the U.S. by the Obama administration. Russia demanded that the U.S. reduce its diplomatic and technical personnel in the Moscow embassy and its consulates in St Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and Vladivostok to four hundred fifty-five persons — the same as the number of Russian diplomats posted in the U.S. — by September 1; Russia’s government would also suspend the use of a retreat compound and a storage facility in Moscow used by the U.S. by August 1. Two days later, Vladimir Putin said that the decision on the curtailment of the U.S. diplomatic mission personnel had been taken by him personally and that 755 staff must terminate their work in Russia. After the sanction bill was on August 2 signed by Donald Trump, Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev wrote that the law had ended hope for improving U.S.–Russia relations and meant "an all-out trade war with Russia." The law was also criticised by Donald Trump, whose signing statement indicated that he might choose not to enforce certain provisions of the legislation that he deemed unconstitutional. \c\cRussia protested on September 2, 2017, against a search it said U.S. officials were planning of a Russian trade mission building in Washington D.C., shortly after the U.S., ′′in the spirit of parity invoked by the Russians′′, demanded that Russia shut two of its diplomatic annexes (buildings) in Washington D.C. and New York City as well as its Consulate General in San Francisco. The Russian foreign ministry said the inspection would be "illegal" and an "unprecedented aggressive action"; it also demanded that the U.S. ′′immediately return the Russian diplomatic facilities′′. \c\cIn November 2017, Trump and Putin both attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Danang. Although they had no formal meeting they spoke informally several times during the event. \c\cAt the end of 2017, CNN concluded that a series of steps undertaken by the Trump administration within a mere week before Christmas such as naming Russia a "rival power" and ′′revisionist power′′ (along with China), imposing sanctions on Ramzan Kadyrov, a close Putin ally, the decision to provide Ukraine with anti-tank weapons, coupled with tougher line from the State Department about Moscow's activities in eastern Ukraine, and accusations from the Pentagon that Russia was intentionally violating de-confliction agreements in Syria, highlighted "a decided turn away from the warmer, more cooperative relationship with Russia that President Donald Trump called for during his campaign and early in his presidency". In February 2018, echoing Donald Trump's own statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said: "[President Donald Trump] has been tougher on Russia in the first year than Obama was in eight years combined."\c\cA highly unusual unannounced visit to Washington D.C. at the end of January 2018 by the directors of Russia's three main intelligence and security agencies (FSB, SVR, and GRU), two of whom (Sergey Naryshkin and Igor Korobov) were on the U.S. sanctions list, and their reported meetings with top U.S. security officials caused political controversy in the U.S. and elicited no official comment in Russia, while it occurred days before the Trump administration chose not to impose immediately new sanctions on Russia at the deadline mandated by the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. \c\cThe U.S. air and artillery strike on a pro-government formation in eastern Syria on February 7, 2018, which caused massive death toll among Russian nationals and a political scandal in Russia, was billed by media as "the first deadly clash between citizens of Russia and the United States since the Cold War" and "an episode that threatens to deepen tensions with Moscow". \c\cPublic statements read out by Vladimir Putin on March 1, 2018, days before the presidential election, about missile technology breakthroughs made by Russia, were referred to by the Trump administration officials as largely boastful untruths, as well as confirmation that "Russia ha[d] been developing destabilizing weapons systems for over a decade, in direct violation of its treaty obligations". U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis remarked that the systems Putin had talked about "[were] still years away" and he did not see them changing the military balance. Nevertheless, White House insiders were later quoted as saying that Putin′s claims "really got under the president [Trump]'s skin" and caused Trump to take a sharper tone behind the scenes vis-à-vis Vladimir Putin. \c\cOn March 26, 2018, following the United States National Security Council's recommendation, to demonstrate the U.S.'s support for the UK's position on the Salisbury poisoning incident, president Donald Trump ordered the expulsion of sixty Russian diplomats and closure of Russian consulate in Seattle. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov responded to the simultaneous expulsion of the total of 140 Russian diplomats by 25 countries by accusing the U.S. government of "blackmailing" other nations. \c\cIn April 2018, US-Russian relations were further exacerbated by missile strikes against the Syrian government targets following the suspected chemical attack in Douma on April 7. The countries clashed diplomatically, with Russia′s top military officials threatening to hit U.S. military targets in the event of a massive U.S.-led strike against Syria. In late May, during an interview with RT, Syria′s president Bashar al-Assad said that direct military conflict between the Russian forces and the U.S. forces in Syria had been averted in April "by the wisdom of the Russian leadership" and that the US-led missile attack against Syria would have been far more extensive had it not been for Russia′s intervention. \c\cOn June 8, 2018, Trump called for Russia to be readmitted to the G-7, from which it was expelled after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. \c\cTrump's public statements during his first formal meeting with Putin in Helsinki on July 16, 2018, drew criticism from the Democratic members of the U.S. Congress and a number of former senior intelligence officials as well as some ranking members of the Republican party for appearing to have sided with Putin rather than accepting the findings of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election issued by the United States Intelligence Community. Republican senator John McCain called the press conference "one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory." The press around the world ran publications that tended to assess the news conference following the presidents′ two-hour meeting as an event at which Trump had "projected weakness". \c\cIn December 2019, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on businesses involved in the construction of Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, as the U.S. sought to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas (LNG) to European states. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz called the sanctions "a severe intervention in German and European internal affairs", while the EU spokesman criticized "the imposition of sanctions against EU companies conducting legitimate business." Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also criticized sanctions, saying that U.S. Congress "is literally overwhelmed with the desire to do everything to destroy" the U.S.–Russia relations. \c\cA June 2020 New York Times report, citing unnamed sources, stated that American intelligence officials assessed with medium confidence that Russian military intelligence unit 29155 had supervised a bounty program paying Taliban-linked militants to kill foreign servicemembers, including Americans, in Afghanistan in 2019. The bounty program reportedly resulted in the deaths of "several" U.S. soldiers, but The Pentagon's top leaders said that Russian bounty program has not been corroborated. The Taliban and Russia have both denied that the bounty program exists. President Donald Trump and his aides denied that he was briefed on the intelligence. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said that Trump had not received a briefing on the bounty program. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the same. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said that General Kenneth McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command, and General Scott Miller, the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, did not think "the reports were credible as they dug into them." McKenzie said that he found no "causative link" between reported bounties to actual U.S. military deaths, but said a lack of proof is "often true in battlefield intelligence."\c\cOn July 1, 2020, following media reports of Taliban participation in an alleged Russian bounty program, the U.S. House Armed Services Committee overwhelmingly voted in favor of an amendment to restrict President Trump's ability to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan. \c\cOn September 25, 2020, U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers staged a mock attack run on Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave locked between NATO countries. The simulated raid on the Kaliningrad region was a test case of destroying Russian air defense systems located in the region. \c\cPresident Donald Trump made both pro- and anti-Russia statements regarding Crimea, Syria, Ukraine, North Korea, Venezuela, election meddling, Skripal poisoning, and oil drilling in Russia. Throughout his tenure as president, persistent conspiracy theories were voiced concerning the alleged collusion between Donald Trump's campaign team and/or administration and the Russian government. \c\cThe Steele dossier alleged that the Russians possessed kompromat on Trump which could be used to blackmail him, and that the Kremlin had promised him that the kompromat would not be used as long as he continued his cooperation with them. Trump's actions at the Helsinki summit in 2018 "led many to conclude that Steele's report was more accurate than not.... Trump sided with the Russians over the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Moscow had waged an all-out attack on the 2016 election,... The joint news conference,.. cemented fears among some that Trump was in Putin's pocket and prompted bipartisan backlash."\c\cAt the joint news conference, when asked directly about the subject, Putin denied that he had any kompromat on Trump. Even though Trump was reportedly given a "gift from Putin", the weekend of the pageant, Putin argued "that he did not even know Trump was in Russia for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013 when, according to the Steele dossier, video of Trump was secretly recorded to blackmail him."\c\cIn reaction to Trump's actions at the summit, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke in the Senate: \c\cSeveral operatives and lawyers in the U.S. intelligence community reacted strongly to Trump's performance at the summit. They described it as "subservien[ce] to Putin" and a "fervent defense of Russia's military and cyber aggression around the world, and its violation of international law in Ukraine" which they saw as "harmful to US interests". They also suggested that he was either a "Russian asset" or a "useful idiot" for Putin, and that he looked like "Putin's puppet". Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wondered "if Russians have something on Trump", and former CIA director John O. Brennan, who has accused Trump of "treason", tweeted: "He is wholly in the pocket of Putin."\c\cFormer acting CIA director Michael Morell in January 2019 called Trump "an unwitting agent of the Russian federation", and former CIA director Michael V. Hayden said Trump was a "useful fool" who is "manipulated by Moscow". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioned Trump's loyalty when she asked him: "[Why do] all roads lead to Putin?"\c\cYnet, an Israeli online news site, reported on January 12, 2017, that U.S. intelligence had advised Israeli intelligence officers to be cautious about sharing information with the incoming Trump administration until the possibility of Russian influence over Trump, suggested by Steele's report, had been fully investigated. \c\cIn October 2020, former British senior diplomat Nigel Gould-Davies argued that Russia would be a central priority of the future Biden administration as ′′no other country threatens a wider range of American interests and values, foreign and domestic[,] nor has any other country been the source of more domestic controversy and contradictory policy over the past four years′′. \c\cFollowing the arrest of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on January 17, 2021, Jake Sullivan, who was to become President Joe Biden's national security adviser after the January 20 inauguration, wrote, "Mr. Navalny should be immediately released, and the perpetrators of the outrageous attack on his life must be held accountable. The Kremlin's attacks on Mr. Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard."\c\cOn the day of Joe Biden′s inauguration, Russia urged the new U.S. administration to take a "more constructive" approach in talks over the extension of the 2010 New START treaty, the Russian foreign ministry accusing the Trump administration of "deliberately and intentionally" dismantling international arms control agreements and referring to its "counterproductive and openly aggressive" approach in talks. On January 26, Biden and Putin agreed in a phone call that they would extend by five years the New START treaty, which would otherwise have expired in February 2021. \c\cOn 17 March 2021, the Russian foreign ministry announced that Russia had recalled its ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, for "consultations" in a move that was characterised by the ministry′s spokesperson as being without precedent for a Russia ambassador to the U.S. The recall came after U.S. president Joe Biden an interview with ABC News confirmed he thought the Russian president was "a killer" and said Putin would "pay the price" for the interference in the 2020 U.S. election, which interference was confirmed by a declassified DNI report released a day prior. The State Department commented on the recall by saying that while the U.S. would work with Russia to advance U.S. interests, they would "be able to hold Russia accountable for any of their malign actions". \c\cOn April 15, the U.S. announced the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats and imposed sanctions on six Russian technology companies as well as 32 other individuals and entities. The new sanctions also targeted ruble-denominated sovereign debt. Nevertheless, the economic punishments were assessed by observers as "more bark than bite" and likely to be "largely symbolic", with the ruble even rebounding against the dollar on the news. Biden commented the United States "could have gone further" with the sanctions, but that he had opted for a milder form of sovereign-debt sanctions for now because he wanted to avoid a “cycle of escalation and conflict." Russia retaliated the following day, expelling 10 U.S. diplomats and suggesting the U.S. ambassador return home for consultations. \c\cOn May 19, The Biden administration lifted sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project between Russia and Germany. Despite Joe Biden's personal opposition to the project, the U.S. State Department says that it concluded that it was in the "U.S. national interest" to waive the sanctions. \c\cSoviet Union's systemic espionage efforts in the U.S. began in the 1920s. \c\cIn April 2015, CNN reported that "Russian hackers" had "penetrated sensitive parts of the White House" computers in "recent months."  It was said that the FBI, the Secret Service, and other U.S. intelligence agencies categorized the attacks "among the most sophisticated attacks ever launched against U.S. government systems."\c\cIn 2017, a cybersecurity specialist working in the Federal Security Service was arrested by Russian authorities on suspicion of passing information to U.S. intelligence. \c\cIn June 2019, Russia said that its electrical grid has been under cyber-attack by the United States. The New York Times reported that American hackers from the United States Cyber Command planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the Russian electrical grid. \c\cA poll by the University of Maryland, College Park, released early July 2009 found that only 2 percent of Russians had "a lot of confidence" that U.S. president Barack Obama would do the right thing in world affairs. Russian media has criticized the United States over the past years for pursuing an anti-missile system in Europe, for favoring NATO expansion and for supporting Georgia in its armed conflict with Russia in 2008. \c\cPrior to 2014, the Russian press expressed varying opinions of Russia–United States relations. \c\cRussian media treatment of America ranged from doctrinaire and nationalistic to very positive toward the United States and the West. In 2013, 51 percent of Russians had a favorable view of the U.S., down from 57 percent in 2010. \c\cThe opinion polls taken by the independent Levada Center in January 2015, showed 81 percent of Russians tended to hold negative views of the U.S., a number that had nearly doubled over the previous 12 months and that was by far the highest negative rating since the center started tracking those views in 1988, as well as surpassing any time since the Stalin era, according to observers. This contrasts with only 7 percent of Russians in April 1990 who said they had bad or somewhat bad attitudes towards the U.S. Likewise, the figures published by Gallup in February 2015 showed a significant rise in anti-Russian sentiment in the U.S.: the proportion of Americans who considered Russia as a "critical military threat" had over the 12 months increased from 32 to 49 percent, and, for the first time in many years, Russia topped the list of America's perceived external enemies, ahead of North Korea, China and Iran, with 18 percent of U.S. residents putting Russia at the top of the list of the "United States\' greatest enemy today". Public opinion polls taken by the Pew Research Center showed that favorable U.S. public opinion of Russia was at 22 percent in 2015. The most negative view of Russia was at 19 percent in 2014, and the most positive view at 49 percent in 2010 and 2011. The most negative view of the United States was at 15 percent in 2015, while the most positive view was at 61 percent in 2002. \c\cUS public opinion regarding Russia has changed substantially over the past 25 years. A Gallup poll from 1992 to 2017 shows 62% of American respondents having a favorable view of Russia in 1992, and 29% having an unfavorable view. In 2017, 70% of American respondents had an unfavorable view of Russia, and 28% had a favorable view. A poll conducted by YouGov in 2015 found that only 11% of Americans believed that the Soviet Union contributed most to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. \c\cA 2017 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed 41% of Russians had a positive view of the US, only one of two countries surveyed where positive perception for the US increased; 52% expressed a negative view. The same study also showed 53% of Russians had confidence in the U.S. president Donald Trump, compared to just 11% for former president Barack Obama. \c\cThere has also been a change in whether the Americans views Russia as an ally or a threat. In 1992, 44% of American respondents saw Russia to be friendly but not an ally, and 5% see them as a threat. In 2014, the Gallup poll reports that 21% of Americans see Russia as friendly but not an ally, and 24% of American respondents seeing them as a threat. This difference in how Americans view Russia has been attributed to the increasing lack of cooperation in the scientific field between the US and Russia, by some. Another perspective is the shift from ally to threat is due to the US being critical of Russia's aggression, especially with their aggression towards geographic neighbors, the United States being one of those neighbors, as it shares a common sea border with the Russian Federation and the US State of Alaska. \c\cThe 2016 surveys independently conducted by the Chicago Council and Russia′s Levada Center showed that mutual perceptions between Russians and Americans were at levels not seen since the Cold War, indicating considerable mutual distrust. \c\cU.S.–Russian relations have further deteriorated since 2016. A December 2017 survey conducted by the Chicago Council and its Russian partner, the Levada Center, showed that:\c\cA Levada poll released in August 2018 found that 68% of Russian respondents believe that Russia needs to dramatically improve relations with the United States and other Western countries. According to The Moscow Times, "Russians increasingly view the United States in a positive light following a presidential" summit in Helsinki in July 2018. "For the first time since 2014, the number of Russians who said they had “positive” feelings towards the United States (42 percent) outweighed those who reported “negative” feelings (40 percent)."\c\cThe 2019 poll independently conducted by the Chicago Council and Levada Center found that 85% of Russians and 78% of Americans say the United States and Russia are "more rivals than partners." The president of the Center for Citizen Initiatives, Sharon Tennison, stated in 2019, "In my 35 years of traveling throughout Russia, I’ve never before witnessed such a vast gap between what average Americans ‘believe’ about Russia and Russia’s reality on ground today."\c\cA Levada poll released in February 2020 found that 80% of Russian respondents believe that Russia and the West should become friends and partners. However, only 42% of Russians polled said they had a positive view of the United States. Only 18% of Americans polled by Pew Research Center said they had a positive view of Russia. According to the Pew Research Center, "57% of Russians ages 18 to 29 see the U.S. favorably, compared with only 15% of Russians ages 50 and older." In 2019, only 20% of Russians viewed U.S. President Donald Trump positively. Only 14% of Russians expressed net approval of Donald Trump’s policies. \c\cThe U.S. government funds Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that broadcasts in 26 languages to many countries. The radio's broadcasting is viewed by Russian researchers as an instrument of American propaganda targeting Russia as a state. According to The Intercept, some American media have been accused of spreading anti-Russian propaganda."\c\cRussia funds Russia Today and Sputnik News which have been accused of pushing pro-Kremlin narratives internationally. In 2021, the Russian state media budget was $211 billion rubles (about $2.8 billion USD), an increase of 34 billion-ruble ($460 million USD) over previous years. According to a University of Oxford report, Moscow uses RT "to sow conspiracy theories to cast doubt on traditional media outlets" and "skewing news output to promote narratives that showed the West as corrupt, divided and out of touch." The influence operation also extends to US allies. RT and Sputnik were cited by the European Parliament's resolution of November 23, 2016 as the Russian government's tools of "propaganda against the EU and its North American partners" such as pushing narratives against democratic values and portraying eastern countries as failed states. The RT America network has employed Americans, including TV hosts and political commentators such as Larry King and Ed Schultz, to help them appear more like a legitimate outlet. Jim Rutenberg described them "wittingly or not... playing the equestrians to Russia's trojan horse."\c\cThe timeline covers key events, 1991 to present. \c\c1991:  U.S. president George H. W.

The Russians thought it might be a nuclear missile launched from an American submarine. The incident occurred in the post-Cold War era, where many Russians were still very suspicious of the United States and NATO. The Norwegian rocket incident was the first and thus far only known incident where any nuclear-weapons state had its nuclear briefcase activated and prepared for launching an attack. \c\cPresident Donald Trump announced on October 20, 2018 that the U.S. would no longer consider itself bound by the 1987 INF Treaty’s provisions, raising nuclear tensions between the two powers. Two days later, Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer told Deutsche Welle that the new Cold War would make this treaty and other Cold War-era treaties "irrelevant because they correspond to a totally different world situation." In early 2019, more than 90% of world's 13,865 nuclear weapons were owned by Russia and the United States. \c\cPresident Putin oversaw Russia's large-scale nuclear war exercises on October 17, 2019, where the Russian army integrated land, sea and air components of the nation's nuclear triad, nearly one year after Trump announced that the US was pulling-out of the nuclear treaty it had signed with Russia. \c\cThe U.S. Congress repealed the Jackson–Vanik amendment on November 16, 2012. \c\c"Last year [2015] was not particularly favorable for trade between Russia and the U.S. Our overall 2015 turnover was $21 billion, a decline of 27.9 percent," said a senior Russian official in April 2016. \c\cReuters reported that U.S. companies "generated more than $90 billion in revenue from Russia in 2017." According to the AALEP, "there are almost 3,000 American companies in Russia, and the U.S. is also the leader in terms of foreign companies in Special Economic Zones, with 11 projects."\c\cFollowing the demise of the Soviet Union, the United States and Russia signed a bilateral treaty called the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II), signed by George H. W. Bush and Boris Yeltsin. \c\cThe United States and Russia have conducted joint military maneuvers, training and counter-terrorist exercises in Germany. This was done in hopes to strengthen relations with the United States and Russia. The Russian president has also proposed that the United States and Russia put a joint missile defense system in Azerbaijan, a proposal being considered by the United States. In 2008, in response to tensions over Georgia, the United States had cancelled its most recent joint NATO-Russia military exercises.[citation needed]\c\cAs of August 2012, the U.S. and Russia continue to hold joint military exercises like Northern Eagle (held since 2004, together with Norway) and Vigilant/Watchful Eagle (with Canada)[citation needed]\c\camong others, with the aim of improving joint cooperation against terrorism and piracy. \c\cRussia-U.S. relations are significantly influenced by the United States\' leading role in NATO and policies thereof. NATO and Russia agreed to cooperate on security issues at the 2002 Rome summit and had been gradually improving relations. However, due to the expansion of the alliance, the Russian intervention in Georgia, Russia's war campaign against Ukraine and other controversies, relations have since deteriorated significantly. \c\cIn May 2015, following increased tensions with NATO, Russia closed a key military transport corridor (the Northern Distribution Network), which had allowed NATO to deliver military supplies to Afghanistan through the Russian territory. The Northern Distribution Network was established in 2009 in response to the increased risk of sending supplies through Pakistan. \c\cA June 2016 Levada poll found that 68% of Russians think that deploying NATO troops in the Baltic states and Poland – former Eastern bloc countries bordering Russia – is a threat to Russia. \c\cRussia has expressed support for the United States\' War on Terror. Russia has also agreed to provide logistic support for the United States forces in Afghanistan to aid in anti-terrorist operations. Russia has allowed U.S. and NATO forces to pass through its territory to go to Afghanistan. In 2017, the former Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: "We cooperated with regard to Afghanistan, where Russia played a positive role, particularly in letting our forces and our equipment transit into and out of Afghanistan."
General elections were supposed to be held in Ethiopia on 29 August 2020 to elect officials to the House of Peoples\' Representatives, but were delayed, supposedly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regional and municipal council elections were also planned to be held at the same time around the country. In May the sitting House of Representatives voted to postpone the election until 2021. In late December 2020, the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) stated that it would take place on 5 June 2021, before being delayed to an unknown date. \c\cThe Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, along with three out of the four member parties of the political coalition which had dominated Ethiopian politics since the overthrow of the Derg regime in 1991, namely Amhara Democratic Party (ADP), Oromo Democratic Party (ODP) and Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM), was dissolved on 1 December 2019. Most of its member parties were merged into the Prosperity Party, which inherited the EPRDF's role as the governing party. The last leader of the EPRDF, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, became the first leader of the new party.[citation needed]\c\cBekele Gerba and Jawar Mohammed were imprisoned following the crackdown by the government following Hachalu Hundessa’s  assassination. 3-5 months after their arrest, the government accused them of terrorism, which they flat out rejected and rather claimed they are being jailed purely for political reasons. Both are members of the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC). \c\cThe upcoming election is overshadowed by a war and a myriad of massacres in various parts of the country. \c\cOromia Zone (Oromo: Godina Oromiyaa) is a zone in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. In early January, According Hassan Hadiya, a resident of Kemise, Conflict started between Oromo residents and Amhara Special Forces after Amhara Special Forces killing an individual at the entrances of the grand mosque in ataye, Oromia Zone of Amhara region.Another resident of kamise, Ahmed says The Amhara region Liyu Police are attacking civilians and ongoing a blazing movement. eyewitness evidences blame the Amhara regional special forces while the Amhara regional government accuse both OLF-Shene and TPLF as scape goat of the violence.Two Members of Ethiopian parliament accused Amhara liyu police for killing Oromo civilian in ataye, Oromia Zone by labelling them what he called ‘’bread name” refers to OLF. “Amhara Militia used OLF-Shane as a pretext to commit war crime on Oromo farmers in Wollo for the three major reasons the MP said on 11th Session of parliament of Ethiopia. The reasons are (1) their national identity (being an Oromo), (2) their religious identity (being Muslim) and (3)use the atrocity as a bargaining threat to fulfill all their demands in Oromia region” On the occasion of the attack of wallo Oromos in Oromia Zone of Amhara Region by Amhara region militia in March 2021, OPP and APP came with opposite statements, each blaming the other ethnic group for being the cause of the violence and killings.Borkena news website and Amhara region official claimed OLF involved ataye town\c\cMany news outlasts reported on the "massacre" but many responsible bodies, mainly the Federal army failed to stop the killing hundreds of people and the burning of many crops as shown latter in many satellite and civilian images/videos. \c\cThe statues quo has not changed, the Amhara special forces exert unrestricted mutiny and the situation remains dire for the helpless Oromos, as one local put it. "Oromo farmers in the area are surrounded by all sides by hostile Amhara's and they are cut off from the much larger Oromo community and forced to sleep with one eye open"\c\cMetekel is a district in north western Ethiopia where massacre of civilians has been happening regularly  in the past three years. The massacres  have been deemed to be as genocidal acts by some where formal investigation is being conducted in order to bring the perpetrators and their chain of command to trial. \c\cShashemene is a town south of Addis Ababa and was a scene of a massacre  where Orthodox Christians and Ethnic Amharas were targeted. The violence was triggred by the assassination of singer Hachalu Hundessa in Addis Ababa. An umbrella humanitarian organization, OTAGE, has engaged a legal firm, specialising in international crimes, to bring those responsible to justice. \c\cMai Kadra is a small town in north Western Ethiopia where a massacre  was perpetrated against the civilian population based on their Amhara ethnicity. The atrocities are alleged to have been perpetrated by militia linked to TPLF. \c\cThe Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the dominant component of the EPRDF, was the only constituent party that did not merge into the new Prosperity Party. In September 2020, Tigray Region held regional election that the government of Ethiopia deemed illegal. \c\cAttacks on 4 November 2020 by Tigray regional security forces on the headquarters of the Northern Command of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) belonging to the Government of Ethiopia led to armed conflict in the Tigray region. In late November and in December, the Tigray Region government was replaced by the Transitional Government of Tigray. TPLF was then dissolved by NEBE. \c\cThere have been various reports of atrocities committed against civilians since the breakout of the war.

{"On May 23, 2021, during a scheduled trip a cable car fell after its cable snapped 300 meters from the top of Mottarone mountain, which is located near Lake Maggiore in northern Italy. At least 12 people were killed as a result, and 3 people, including two children aged 5 and 9 years old were seriously injured. The cable car was traveling on a line connecting the town of Stresa with the Mottarone mountain when it plunged into a wooden area according to the National Alpine Speleological Rescue Corps, which is leading the rescue operation. The incident was Italy's worst cable car disaster since the 1998 Cavalese cable car disaster."}
Ryanair Flight 4978 was an international scheduled passenger flight from Athens International Airport, Greece, to Vilnius Airport, Lithuania, on 23 May 2021. While in Belarusian airspace, it was diverted by the Belarusian government to Minsk National Airport where two of its passengers, opposition activist and journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, were arrested by authorities. The flight was escorted to Minsk by a Belarusian fighter jet under the pretence of a bomb threat on the orders of President Alexander Lukashenko. \c\cThe incident was widely condemned by civil aviation authorities and multiple governments. Initially some European states and airlines responded with new restrictions on flights passing through and from Belarus; on the day after the incident, the European Union initiated new sanctions, including closing off Belarusian airspace and carriers to the EU. \c\cOn 23 May 2021, Ryanair Flight 4978 (Athens–Vilnius) was diverted to Minsk National Airport after a bomb threat was made whilst the aircraft was 45 nautical miles (83 km; 52 mi) south of Vilnius and 90 nautical miles (170 km; 100 mi) west of Minsk, but still in Belarusian airspace. According to the airline, its pilots were notified by Belarusian authorities of "a potential security threat on board" and instructed to land the plane in Minsk. \c\cThe flight was carrying 6 crew and 126 passengers. In Minsk, Belarusian opposition activist Roman Protasevich was removed from the plane and arrested on the basis that he was listed on a Belarusian wanted list, accused of "terrorist" activities. His girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, was also removed from the aircraft by Belarusian authorities and detained.  No explanation was presented for her detainment by Belarusian authorities. Sapega, a Russian citizen and student at the European Humanities University in Vilnius, was confirmed by the university to have been detained. Despite the fact that the plane was closer to Vilnius, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, according to his press service, personally ordered the flight to be redirected to Minsk and sent a Belarusian Air Force MiG-29 fighter aircraft to escort it. Belarusian government news agency BelTA said that the pilots asked to land in Minsk. Both Ryanair and Belarusian law enforcement said that no bombs were found onboard. \c\cAside from Protasevich and his girlfriend, four[clarification needed] other passengers who are presumed to be Belarusian KGB agents did not continue with the plane to Lithuania. Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called for an investigation of the incident by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Protasevich had been placed on a list of "individuals involved in terrorist activity" the previous year for his role in anti-government protests. Tsikhanouskaya stated that Protasevich "faces the death penalty" in Belarus. According to some passengers, Protasevich asked the cabin crew for refuge but was refused due to Ryanair legal agreements. As he left the plane, Protasevich independently told another passenger that "the death penalty awaits me here". Another source said that Protasevich faced fifteen years\' imprisonment. \c\cAccording to sources close to Tsikhanouskaya, Protasevich noticed that he was under surveillance at the Athens airport. In his messages, he stated that a man next to him at the line and at the checkpoint tried to take photos of his travel documents. Additionally, Tadeusz Giczan, a member of the Nexta Telegram channel that was previously edited by Protasevich, said that officers of the KGB had been on the flight and that they had "initiated a fight with the Ryanair crew", insisting there was a bomb on board the plane. A spokeswoman for the Lithuanian Airports state enterprise, Lina Beisine, told the AFP news agency that Minsk National Airport said that the flight had been diverted "due to a conflict between a member of the crew and the passengers". \c\cThe flight course of FR4978 over Belarus on 23 May became unusual even before making the U-turn. Based on Flightradar24 raw data, it was noted that the plane did not start to descend over Belarus even though this is usually done in preparation for landing in Vilnius. One possibility for this unusual route is that the plane's pilots tried to maintain the original route to enter Lithuanian airspace as soon as possible, but were forced to divert to Minsk after the Belarusian jet fighter's interference. \c\cThe aircraft was allowed to depart after seven hours on the ground at Minsk, reaching Vilnius eight and a half hours late. Protasevich, Sapega and three[clarification needed] Russian citizens were not on board the aircraft when it landed at Vilnius. Passengers noted having to wait 2.5 hours without water, toilet breaks or phone calls, while 50 to 60 Belarusian security officers at Minsk airport carried out checks. \c\cFollowing the incident, the Belarusian Ministry of Transport announced that it had set up a commission to investigate the forced landing, stating that it would notify the ICAO and IATA about the investigation's progress and publish a report shortly thereafter. \c\cOn 24 May 2021, director of the Department of Aviation of the Ministry of Transport of Belarus Artyom Sikorsky read out an email letter sent to Minsk airport on 23 May. This message was signed by "Hamas soldiers" and included demands to Israel to "cease fire in Gaza strip" (see 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis) and for the European Union to stop the support of Israel. It was threatened to blow up the plane over Vilnius, according to this letter. Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel called the Belarusian explanation "completely implausible". Hamas denied it was in any way connected to the incident. \c\cOn 24 May, the Lithuanian cabinet decided on a ban of all flights to and from Lithuania flying over the Belarusian airspace, effective 00:00 GMT, 25 May (03:00 EEST). British transport secretary Grant Shapps instructed the Civil Aviation Authority to request that British airlines avoid Belarusian airspace. Belarus state airline Belavia's permit to operate in UK airspace was suspended. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky instructed the government to halt air traffic with Belarus. \c\cThe EU held a meeting of leaders on 24 May in Brussels, Belgium. Before the meeting, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda called for the EU to impose fresh economic sanctions on Belarus. Calls were made by eight countries for flights over and to Belarus to be banned. Another suggestion was that ground traffic be banned from entering the EU from Belarus. At the meeting, it was agreed upon to prohibit EU-based airlines from flying through Belarusian airspace, ban Belarusian carriers from flying into EU airspace, and to implement a fresh round of sanctions. \c\c ICAO voiced its deep concern over "the apparent forced landing" of the flight. An ICAO tweet claimed that the forced landing could be in breach of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. \c\c NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted that the grounding of the flight constitutes a "serious & dangerous incident which requires international investigation". \c\c European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen described the incident as "utterly unacceptable", stating that "any violation of international air transport rules must bear consequences."\c\c Australia’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Marise Payne condemned the “forced military interception” of a civilian aircraft and called for the “immediate release” of the arrested Belarusian opposition figure. \c\c Belgium’s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo advocated for sanctions "including banning Belavia from landing at EU airports" and stated "Roman Protasevich must be immediately released". \c\c Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, Marc Garneau, said that the incident was "a serious interference in civil aviation and a clear attack on media freedom". \c\c Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, from whose country the Ryanair flight originated, described the forced landing of the aircraft as a "shocking act" and that political pressure on Belarus must be stepped up. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias described the event as a "states hijack". \c\c Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin described the incident as "a state-sponsored coercive act" and "piracy in the skies". \c\c Italian foreign minister Luigi Di Maio told the move was “unacceptable” and added “We’re talking about a state hijacking”, according to Italian news agencies ANSA and AGI. He said he expected the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, to discuss the matter with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: “It is clear that this is not only a European question but a question of the alliance of values that we share with many of our allies, including overseas” \c\c Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs described the incident as "contrary to international law" and said that the reaction should be "strong and effective". On 24 May, Latvia expelled Belarus's diplomats in retaliation for Belarus expelling Latvia's staff. \c\c Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda accused Belarusian authorities of carrying out an "abhorrent action". He also said: "I call on NATO and EU allies to immediately react to the threat posed to international civil aviation by the Belarus regime. The international community must take immediate steps that this does not repeat". Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė informed the public that the pre-trial investigation has been started for forced disappearance and hijacking of the aircraft. \c\c Dutch caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte condemned the "unacceptable and unprecedented" attack. \c\c Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called the incident "an unprecedented act of state terrorism that cannot go unpunished". \c\c Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman Maria Zakharova compared incident to the grounding of Bolivian President Evo Morales\' plane in Austria in 2013 during the hunt for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden after other European countries refused it permission to refuel or to use their airspace. \c\c Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi instructed the government to suspend direct flights between Ukraine and Belarus and close off Belarusian airspace for the transit of Ukrainian planes. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal convened the extraordinary cabinet meeting for 25 May. \c\c United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the incident was a "shocking assault on civil aviation". Chairman of the British Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat said that if it was not an act of war then it was certainly a warlike act. \c\c US Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the grounding of the flight as a "brazen and shocking act" and demanded an international investigation. There were American citizens onboard the flight. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced that the Biden administration and the Federal Aviation Administration were assessing whether it was safe for American-flagged airlines to continue to operate in Belarusian airspace. \c\cUkrainian aviation lawyer Andriy Huk suggested that the interception by the military aircraft and redirection of the plane to a more distant airport could have jeopardized the safety of the passengers and crew. He also noted that Appendix 2 of Chicago Convention considers interception of civilian planes by military aircraft a very last resort, but the Belarusian military jet took off immediately. Associate professor at the Russian Higher School of Economics Gleb Bogush stated that the staging (dramatizing) of a bomb threat and the interception of the plane by the Belarusian authorities could have jeopardized the passengers and crew and that both the Chicago Convention and 1971 Montreal Convention should be used in the legal assessment of the case. He also called the situation "a very dangerous precedent". \c\cRyanair CEO Michael O\'Leary stated that the event was a "state sponsored hijacking" and that Ryanair believes "there were some [Belarusian] KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well". Cyprus-registered Avia Solutions Group announced that their airlines will no longer use Belarusian airspace. On 24 May, Hungarian airline Wizz Air rerouted a flight from Kyiv, Ukraine, to Tallinn, Estonia, to avoid Belarusian airspace. Latvian airline AirBaltic announced on 24 May that it would no longer fly in Belarusian airspace until the situation became clearer. Dutch airline KLM stated that it was temporarily halting flights to Belarus. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) announced that in line with instructions from the Swedish Transport Agency, the twice weekly flight between Oslo, Norway and Kyiv would be rerouted to avoid Belarusian airspace. Lufthansa announced it would suspend operations in Belarusian airspace until further notice. Singapore Airlines (SIA) also began rerouting flights bound for Europe to avoid Belarusian airspace from 25 May, citing safety concerns. \c\cThe aircraft involved was a four-year-old Boeing 737-800, registered in Poland, registration SP-RSM. The aircraft, entered service with Ryanair in May 2017 registered EI-FZX in Ireland, and was transferred to Ryanair Sun on the Polish aircraft registry as SP-RSM in November 2019.
{"The  2021 Mount Nyiragongo eruption in the Democratic Republic of the Congo began on 22 May 2021. \c\cAccording to a Virunga National Park official, the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo is similar to the eruption in 2002, which caused the death of 250 people. In September 2020, Katcho Karume, director of the Goma Volcano Observatory, said that the lava lake had been rapidly filling, increasing the risk of an eruption in the next few years, though Karume also noted that an earthquake could trigger an eruption earlier. The Observatory had not been properly functioning for almost a year before the eruption, after the World Bank cut funding following allegations of corruption. The Observatory was unable to pay for an internet connection to connect remote monitors or for fuel to regularly transport staff to the observation points; staff manually downloaded data from memory cards during their few visits to the volcano. In August 2020, a report in Geophysical Research Letters based on a comparison of historical and current activity at Nyiragongo noted the possibility of a flank eruption between March 2024 and November 2027. \c\cThe eruption of Mount Nyiragongo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo threatened the city of Goma, which has a population of 2 million people, with the lava flow reaching Goma International Airport. The DRC government urged residents of the city to evacuate. The lava flow was estimated to have moved at 1 kilometre per hour (0.62 mph), allowing people time to escape but destroying residential areas north of Goma. \c\cAround 8,000 people from Goma have crossed into Rwanda for refuge. UNICEF stated that there's a possibility of evacuees returning home to discover their homes destroyed, including shortages of water and power supply. It was officially confirmed by the Rwandan authorities that over 3,000 had crossed into Rwanda from Goma, according to BBC News. Apart from those who fled to Rwanda, another 25,000 people were also said to have fled to the northwest in Sake, the UNICEF added. \c\cOn May 23, after word that the flow towards Goma had ceased, Rwanda's Emergency Management Ministry reported that refugees who had fled to Rubavu had mostly returned home. The International NGO Safety Organisation noted on May 23 that lava appeared to be flowing towards the Rwandan border and advised humanitarian workers in the northern Goma to move west for safety. DRC Communications Minister Patrick Muyaya stated that seismic tremors continued to be detected and advised vigilance and avoiding non-essential travel. \c\cOn 24 May, strong aftershocks shook the city of Goma. \c\cGovernment spokesman Patrick Muyaya stated on the night of May 23 that fifteen people had died: two who had burned to death; nine in a traffic accident while fleeing; and four prisoners killed while attempting to break out of Camp Munzenze prison in Goma. UNICEF reported more than 170 children as missing, and 150 children as separated from their families. On 24 May, five additional bodies of asphyxiated  victims were found, bringing the toll to 20. \c\cThe Norwegian Refugee Council reported that six hundred homes and five schools had been destroyed. The lava flow crossed the N2 road, cutting Goma off from the city of Beni to the north. Seventeen villages around the volcano reported damage, though the flow stopped just outside of Goma. \c\cResidents blamed the Goma Volcano Observatory for not providing warning of the eruption. The World Bank had eliminated funding for the scientists performing the observation in 2020, and the observatory had stopped monitoring the volcano a few months later. On May 10, 2021, the observatory had issued a warning that seismic activity at Nyiragongo had increased, and had previously warned that the volcano's lava lake was filling up, increasing the chances of an eruption or earthquake-related disaster."}
{"The COVID-19 pandemic in Malta is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in Malta was an Italian 12-year-old girl on 7 March 2020. The girl and her family were in isolation, as required by those following the Maltese health authority's guidelines who were in Italy or other highly infected countries. Later, both her parents were found positive as well. The second wave of the virus in Malta is considered to be worse than the first. \c\cAs of 25 May 2021[update], Malta has reported 30,509 confirmed cases, 30,022 recoveries and 418 deaths, while 69 cases remain active. \c\cA mandatory quarantine was imposed on travellers and those who were possibly in contact with those who travelled abroad.

He worked on 13 March, a day before symptoms emerged. Contact tracing ongoing, a woman whose relative reported being ill after returning from England. She reported symptoms on 19 March.

All cases are local transmission, with the majority being foreigners and some linked to previous cluster and expected spread among immigrants living in crowded conditions. One infected immigrant has supposedly fled from the police while being escorted to hospital. However, this was the result of missing understanding as the person went back to the centre where he was receiving treatment by the Red Cross. He was later transferred to Boffa Hospital in Floriana. Other immigrants at the centre were forcefully locked-in indefinitely (until coronavirus remains present) and safeguarded by the armed forces. The situation is considered more desperate as residents inside the facility have to share bathrooms.

Relations between the United States of America and Palestinians are complex and strained. The United States does not recognize the State of Palestine, but accepts the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as a representative of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian National Authority as the authority legitimately governing the Palestinian territories under the Oslo Accords. \c\cThe United States does not officially maintain any diplomatic office in the Palestinian territories nor provide consular services to Palestinians, and since the closure of the PLO mission in Washington D.C. in October 2018, the Palestinians have had no diplomatic representation in the United States. The United States has designated a Palestinian Affairs Unit within the US Embassy in Jerusalem to handle relations with the Palestinian Authority but Palestine is presently maintaining a public policy of noncooperation with the office and with the United States in general. \c\cSince 2011 at least, the PLO's  diplomatic effort has focused on the Palestine 194 campaign, which aims to gain full membership for Palestine in the United Nations. It seeks to effectively gain international recognition of the State of Palestine based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The US minimal conditions for relations with the Palestinians were Palestinian acceptance of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the recognition of Israel’s right to exist, and renunciation of terrorism. 
The 2019–2021 Iraqi protests are a series of protests that consist of demonstrations, marches, sit-ins and civil disobedience. They started on 1 October 2019, a date which was set by civil activists on social media, spreading over the central and southern provinces of Iraq, to protest corruption, unemployment and inefficient public services. The protest then escalated into calls to overthrow the Iraqi government. The government has used live bullets, marksmen, hot water, hot pepper gas and tear gas against protesters, leading to many deaths and injuries. \c\cThe protesters called for the end of the sectarian political system which was created by the US after the US-led invasion in 2003 and has been marked by sectarian divides between Shias and Sunnis. The protests are the largest incident of civil unrest Iraq has experience since the 2003 invasion. \c\cIn 2011, protests broke out in various provinces within Iraq demanding the end of corruption, nepotism, and unemployment, while also calling for increased wages and improved public services such as electricity, transportation, health care, education and municipal services. Protestors faced government suppression, police brutality and arrests. These reform demands in the six Sunni-dominant provinces escalated during the 2012–2013 Iraqi protests after Nouri Al-Maliki's acts of persecution against Sunni political figures. This, in turn, led to protests calling for the overthrow of the sectarian government and redrafting the constitution, as well as a march into Baghdad to occupy the Green Zone. These protests were faced with even more government suppression, leading to clashes between security forces and local tribesmen who had alleged support from Ba\'ath Party loyalists. After reports of the Sunni factions, which were part of the Iraqi insurgency against the American occupation, unifying their powers and taking control over Al Anbar Governorate, the government launched the 2013 Anbar campaign. By July 2014, these factions which merged with ISIL had occupied most of Al-Anbar, Ninawa, Salah ad-Din, Kirkuk and Diyala which ignited the War in Iraq (2013–2017). The U.S. Secretary of State pledged "intense" support to the Iraqi government while imploring the Government to rise above "sectarian motivations" but according to senior officials in the Department of Defense the U.S. was refraining from giving weapons to the Iraqi military "because of lack of confidence in Iraqi troops", while veteran U.S. journalists familiar with the situation claimed that Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki "is not the answer and should step down". \c\cFueled by the lack of progress of Haider al-Abadi's government and state corruption, the leader of the Sadrist Movement, Muqtada al-Sadr, called for a sit-in within the Green Zone in Baghdad to force the government to find serious solutions for corruption. On 30 April 2016, thousands of Al-Sadr's followers breached the barricades of the Green Zone and stormed into governmental buildings, including the Iraqi parliament, chasing representatives out of the Green Zone before retreating the day after by the call of Al-Sadr. Another demonstration broke out in Basra and nearby cities in July 2018 due to deteriorating public utilities, water contamination and lack of electricity and continued for a few months. Protestors burned down a number of government buildings and parties\' headquarters, blocked numerous main streets, tore and burned pictures of Khomeini and Khamenei and even occupied the Al-Najaf and Basra International Airports. They were faced with live bullets from security forces causing the death of at least 16 protestors. \c\cRemembering the rise of ISIS during the protests in 2012, these ones avoided sectarian rhetoric. Initially Americans had not seemed to be the focus of the anger although a 2019 poll found that only 22% of Iraqis had a favorable opinion of the United States, while 16% had a favorable opinion of Iran. However this preliminary assumption clearly turned out to be wrong when after a few months, hundreds of thousands rallied to oppose the US presence in the country. \c\cOn 20 June in Basra demonstrators gathered outside the city's new administrative headquarters to vent their anger about poor basic services and unemployment. The old headquarters were burnt down during 2018's months-long protest. Basra and the surrounding region produce about 90 percent of the country's oil wealth but most of its residents have not benefited from it. Protesters blamed Basra's authorities for the city's problems, from a lack of job opportunities to unreliable and poor public utilities. Riot police were deployed at the scene but the protest remained peaceful. \c\cOn 25 September 2019, a group of holders of higher degrees organized a protest in front of the Prime Minister's office in Baghdad, demanding their employment. The protest was faced with major suppression from security forces as armoured vehicles separated the demonstrators using hot water and police forces conducted random arrests among them which led to cases of fainting and injuries among the demonstrators. This incident was faced with country-wide anger because of the forceful methods that were used by the government towards intellectual demonstrators, along with the violence that was used against female protestors. Reactions included the Ministry of Interior forming a committee to investigate the incident and demonstrators organizing solidarity protests in many provinces to condemn these methods. The holders of higher degrees resumed their protests for three days after the incident, spreading over many southern provinces. \c\cOn 27 September 2019, Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi issued a decision to transfer the commander of the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Force, Lieutenant General Abdel-Wahab Al-Saedi, from the ICTF to the Ministry of Defence. Al-Saedi said the decision was an insult to his military rank and that he would rather go to jail than execute this decision. This decision caused political figures, including former prime minister Haider Al-Abadi and many representatives, to criticize Abdul-Mahdi and call for him to back down from his decisions. According to VOA News, Al Saedi's transfer was influenced individually by pro-Iran factions within the Al-Shaabi paramilitary force, said  a government official in Iraq who asked to be kept unknown. After the decision was made, social media was flooded with Al-Saedi's photos and achievements, calling for Abdul-Mahdi to back down from this injustice and accusing Iran of ordering the Iraqi government to replace every "national hero" in the army with Iranian loyalists. In response to this backlash, Abdul-Mahdi said he stands by his decision and that it is a normal routine decision with no political motivations. Furthermore, after calls for the unveiling of a statue of Al-Saedi in Mosul that was made to immortalize the commander's efforts in the city's liberation, security forces surrounded the statue, prohibiting its unveiling, before it was finally removed by them. On 30 September 2019, Al-Saedi announced that he executed Abdul-Mahdi's orders and joined the ministry of defence as "a loyal soldier to serve my country and my beloved people."\c\cStarting on 25 October 2019, mass protests took place in many cities in Iraq, including Kerbala, against corruption and a national government that protestors saw as unaccountable for its actions. After the U.S. occupation (2003–11), oligarchs and warlords were perceived to have taken control over Iraq. While the country produces more oil than the United Arab Emirates, the oil revenues were seen by protestors as failing to be spent on maintenance of hospitals and roads. A widely used slogan in this phase of the protests was: "We want a homeland"—reflecting a longing both for a sense of unity and for a self-determined life in dignity. \c\cWhile at daytime protesters from all strata of Iraqi society peacefully took to the streets and squares of cities like Kerbala, later at night, youths from the suburbs sought violent confrontations, using molotov cocktails and burning car-tires, which was answered by the state security forces with tear gas, rubber bullets, deadly snipers and even patrol vehicles lethally ramming into crowds. \c\cHassan Wahab of the Amal Association human rights group said, "Those [protestors] detained and released are only released on bail. Charges are not dropped so they face re-arrest and trial."\c\cAs of 23 December 2019, there were 29 assassinated activists related to the protests, most of them were in Baghdad. On 10 January 2020, an Iraqi journalist, Ahmad Abdelsamad, of Dijlah TV and his cameraman, Safaa Ghali, were shot in their car by unidentified gunmen. \c\cOn 21 January, the police stated that Janat Madhi, a 49-year old activist was gunned down by unknown gunmen as she came back home from protests in the southern city of Basra, according to the Urdu Point. \c\cOn 14 August, an activist, Tahseen Osama Al-Shahmani, was shot 20 times at his internet service company in Basra. On 19 August, a female activist, Reham Yacoub, was killed and three others were wounded in the city of Basra, when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their car. \c\cThe US Embassy in Baghdad was attacked on the last day of 2019. The attack was organized and directed by Iran's proxy leaders Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, Qays al-Khazali, Hadi al Amari, and Faleh al-Fayyad. They are seen in the pictures taken on the scene. \c\cAbu Mahdi al-Muhandis, one of the leaders of the attack on the US Embassy in Baghdad, was condemned and spent years in jail in Kuwait for directing the December 1983 attacks on the US and French embassies there. \c\cFor a long time, Iraqi anti-government protestors tried to enter Green Zone and were brutally suppressed and held back. On 31 December, groups of Popular Mobilization Forces (al-Hashd al-Sha\'abi) entered the Green Zone and went directly toward the American Embassy without being blocked by security forces. \c\cUS president Donald Trump accused Iran of "orchestrating" the attack on the embassy and added that they would be held "fully responsible". In the aftermath, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, Major General Qasem Soleimani, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were assassinated in a U.S. drone strike while traveling in a convoy near Baghdad International Airport. On 5 January in reaction to these airstrikes the Iraqi parliament called for the expulsion of US troops from the country. \c\c1 October: Protests erupted in Baghdad in Liberation Square over high unemployment, poor basic services, and state corruption. These protests spread to the southern provinces. The authorities imposed an internet blackout and shut down 75% of the country's internet access. Protesters demanded the resignation of Adil Abdul-Mahdi and prepare for early elections. The protesters also began demonstrating against Iranian influence, and against the leader of Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani. At the beginning of the protests, the demonstrators were mostly young male, holding the government responsible for its many failures, according to vox. The Iraqi prime minister declared a curfew until further notice. \c\c3 October: According to Amnesty International, 18 civilians and one police officer were killed and hundreds were injured after three days of protesting. \c\c4 October: In Nasiriyah, many headquarters of political parties were burned down. \c\c5 October: Unknown forces raided many TV channels such as Al Arabiya, Dijlah TV, NRT and Al Rasheed TV for airing the protests. The forces destroyed these channels\' properties. \c\c7 October: Dozens of protesters were killed and hundreds were injured in Sadr City. \c\c8 October: Protests largely ceased due to Arba\'een, a Shia religious holiday which occurred on 19 October. According to Arab News, regardless of warnings from the Iranian authorities for the pilgrims to procrastinate going on the pilgrimage to Iraq, 3.5 million Shiites, mainly Iranians entered Iraq through land borders on Friday. \c\c24 October: Thousands of protesters began to congregate at Liberation Square in Baghdad, protesting against the government and against the Iranian influence. Nearly 50 protesters were killed and injured after attempting to enter the Green Zone. \c\c25 October: Protesting in Maysan Governorate began to turn into riots between Peace Companies led by Muqtada al-Sadr on one side and Asa\'ib Ahl al-Haq and Badr Organization on another. Asa\'ib Ahl al-Haq member Wisam Alyawi and his brother, both PMU commanders for the Maysan Governorate, were lynched by angry protesters who dragged them out of an ambulance and beat them to death. Qais Khazali, chief of all Asa\'ib Ahl al-Haq, announced that nine PMU members had been killed in the recent protests, blamed Israel for their deaths, and stated he would take revenge "four times over."\c\cProtesters burned down and destroyed many offices of political parties in the city of Samawah.

The laws transitioned elections to a first-past-the-post system, which allowed voters to select individuals rather than use party lists, while the candidates would represent electoral districts rather than provinces. The new electoral law is expected to have representatives represent more local voices, as opposed to the entire governorate they were previously elected from, as well as stop infighting amongst list members and a myriad of small lists from siphoning off votes and failing to meet the electoral threshold. It would also prevent parties from running on unified lists, which had previously led some to easily sweep all the seats in a particular governorate. However, minority groups might end up being less represented, as they now have to obtain a plurality in the district they are running in, and the number of seats might not accurately reflect overall popular support. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy had previously endorsed this approach, although the Al-Bayan Center for Planning and Studies, an independent non-profit think tank in Baghdad, had proposed instead retaining the proportional system, but creating more districts so that each elected between three and eight seats each, which would retain the proportional aspect of seat allocation while binding representatives to more local areas. Most Kurdish legislators boycotted the meeting of the council, in opposition to changing the law. After its passage, legal experts, intellectuals, and some protestors suggested that the law as written might not work as intended, as there has not been a census to count population for the purpose of drawing districts in over two decades, and the parties might end up running candidates individually but then re-form parliamentary groups once the Council sits, effectively returning to the status quo. The new law apportions for the legislature to be shrunk to 251 seats (down from 329), says that the districts that are to be created must consist of over 100,000 people, and reduced the age of eligibility for candidacy to 25 from 30. One-quarter of seats would be reserved for women, and 9 would be reserved for national religious minorities. The law also established the Independent High Electoral Commission, which is to be composed of nine members, seven of whom would be judges from regular courts. In addition, there are two other judges from the State Council (administrative court). \c\c26 December: President Barham Salih submits a letter of resignation after refusing to appoint Asaad Al Eidani as Prime Minister following the resignation of Adil Abdul-Mahdi.

Also, no casualties were recorded during the incident, Al Jazeera added. \c\c22 April: Another rocket attack was launched close to the Baghdad International Airport, the Iraqi military revealed. At least three rockets were said to have landed near the perimeter of the airport. Also, Iraqi security forces were able to defuse pre-launched rockets which were kept on the rooftop of an unoccupied building that was used for the rocket launch. There were no immediate reports of casualties or property damages, according to Reuters. 
Milieudefensie et al v Royal Dutch Shell was a court case heard by the district court of The Hague in the Netherlands in 2021 related to efforts by multinational corporations to curtail carbon dioxide emissions. In May 2021, the Hague ordered that Royal Dutch Shell must reduced its global carbon emissions from its 2019 levels by 45% by 2030; it is considered the first major climate change litigation ruling against a corporation. \c\cFollowing the global adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2016, large corporations operating in signatory companies began evaluating if they could alter operations to meet targets of the Agreement. Royal Dutch Shell, one of the largest oil and gas companies operating from the Netherlands, a signatory of the Agreement, is considered the ninth larger contributors to global pollution, contributing about 1% to global emissions. As the Agreement was being developed, Shell evaluated its businesses to determine what it could do to address emissions, but had stated in 2014 that it believed that the Paris targets were unattainable and did not plan to change its business model away from oil and gas. Following the signing of the Agreement, Shell did issue a statement that it would address it emissions, releasing a plan that called for reductions of its carbon dioxide emissions by 30% by 2035, compared to 2016 levels, and by 65% by 2050. \c\cEnvironmental activists saw this plan as far slower than the requirements set out by the Paris Agreement. Seven environmental foundations — Milieudefensie, Greenpeace, Fossielvrij, Waddenvereniging [nl], Both ENDS [nl], Jongeren Milieu Actief [nl], and ActionAid — and 17,379 individual claimants in the Netherlands filed a class-action lawsuit against Shell in April 2019, arguing that Shell could change its business model to invest more in renewable energy, and reach a emissions reduction target of 45% by 2030. By failing to change to this alternative model, the suit argued, Shell had failed to uphold the unwritten standard of care laid down in Book 6 Section 162 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek as well as articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Shell stated in response to the lawsuit that it was doing its part to address climate change, and that "What will accelerate the energy transition is effective policy, investment in technology and changing customer behaviour. None of which will be achieved with this court action. Addressing a challenge this big requires a collaborative and global approach."\c\cThe trial at The Hague was held through December 2020. The plaintiffs were required under Dutch law to demonstrate that a viable alternative business model existed for Shell to achieve the suggested 45% reduction goal, and had used the recent transformation of Danish company Ørsted from fossil fuels to renewables as a viable example. During the trial, Shell issued a pledge in February 2021 to be net zero by 2050. Plaintiffs considered Shell's pledge to be inadequate as the company would fail to meet the Paris Agreement goals. \c\cThe court issued its decision on 26 May 2021. In its ruling, the court found Shell's current sustainability policy to be insufficiently "concrete", and that its emissions were greater than that of most countries. Due to these factors the cort ordered that Shell must reduce its global emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels; the reduction targets include emissions from its supplies and buyers.  The court declared the order provisionally enforcable [nl], meaning that the order has immediate effect, even if one of the parties appeals the ruling. \c\cThe case was considered a landmark ruling in environmental law related to climate change: while previous lawsuits against governments have prevailed for improving emissions, this was considered the first major suit against a corporation, holding a corporation to the tenets of the Paris Agreement. The case was expected to set a precedent for other environmental lawsuits against other large companies with high emissions that have not taken sufficient steps to reduce their emissions. The impact of the court's decision was considered to be strengthened by legal experts due to its reliance on human rights standards and international measures climate change. \c\cShell has stated they plan to appeal the ruling.
On May 26, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) train yard. Nine people were killed, including the gunman, identified as a VTA employee. Multiple others were also injured. 
On May 26, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) rail yard in San Jose, California. Ten people were killed, including the gunman, 57-year-old VTA employee Samuel James Cassidy, who shot and killed himself. \c\cThe Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) is a public transport service that operates bus and light rail services throughout the Santa Clara Valley and employs about 2,000 workers. The shooting took place at a VTA light rail facility located near the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office and across Highway 87 from San Jose International Airport. It is a transit control center that houses rail vehicles and a maintenance yard. \c\cAt 6:34 a.m. PDT (13:24 UTC), Santa Clara County authorities received 9-1-1 calls about shots being fired at the VTA facility. Law enforcement officers and firefighters responded. When they arrived, they found multiple people shot. The shooting occurred at the maintenance yard, reportedly during a union meeting for VTA workers, and also during a shift change in which employees from the overnight and day shifts overlapped. At 7:12 a.m., the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office instructed the public to stay away from the area. \c\cAt about 8:00 a.m., the gunman was confirmed to be dead. Officers did not exchange gunfire with him, and investigators believe he took his own life. Light rail service was suspended for the day, and buses were used to provide limited service. Police received reports of explosive devices inside the building, prompting a bomb squad to investigate. Agents from the FBI and the ATF also responded. \c\cThe gunman apparently set his house on fire before the shooting, but no one was inside at the time. At 6:38 a.m., firefighters responded to the home, located about 8 miles (13 km) away from the shooting scene, and discovered hundreds of rounds of ammunition and a gas can there. \c\cThere were ten fatalities in the shooting, including Cassidy. All of the victims were VTA employees. Their ages ranged from 29 to 63 years old. One of the victims was rushed to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in critical condition, but died later that day. \c\cPolice identified the gunman as 57-year-old VTA employee Samuel James Cassidy. He had been employed at VTA since 2012; for his first two years, he was a mechanic, and he later began maintaining substations. His ex-wife, who had been married to him for ten years before their divorce in 2005, described him as having anger issues and often being angry at his coworkers and at VTA for what he believed to be its unfair work assignments. \c\cA hotline was set up for VTA employees and family members for additional information about the shooting and the victims. The VTA also announced plans to help survivors and victims\' families. \c\cSan Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said it was a "horrific day" for the city and the VTA, and expressed his condolences to victims and their families. He also emphasized that VTA employees have been essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris both urged Congress to take action on gun control legislation. Biden ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff and called the shooting a "horrific tragedy".
{"The Kamloops Indian Residential School was part of the Canadian residential school system and one of the 130 schools for First Nations children that operated in Canada between 1874 and 1977. The Kamloops School was opened in 1893 (initially as the Kamloops Industrial School) and continued operation until 1977, located on the traditional territory of the Secwepemc (Secwépemcúl'ecw). Hundreds of Secwepemc children attended the school, often forcibly removed from their homes once attendance became mandatory by law. \c\cChildren were not allowed to speak their native Secwepemctsin language or practice their own spirituality. \c\cThe school still stands today."}
{"The 2021 Niger attacks are an ongoing series of attacks by militants on civilians and soldiers in Niger, mainly in the western region of Tillabéri. The attacks have left 349 people dead and at least 88 others injured. \c\cSeveral major attacks occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020. However, this is the first time that over 100 civilians were killed in single incidents, marking the January attack and 21 March attack as the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. It is the first year in which attacks were carried out with frequency in the country. The previous biggest attack in Niger against civilians was the 12 December 2020 Toumour attack, which resulted in 28 people killed. Both the December 2020 and January 2021 attacks were carried out during Niger's municipal and regional elections, while the February bombing specifically targeted members of the electoral commission. \c\cOn the same day as the January attacks, two Algerian soldiers were killed in a shooting in Algeria and two French soldiers were killed in a bombing in Mali. \c\cThe January attacks occurred in two villages, Tchombangou (at 14°49′48′′N 01°48′45′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.83000°N 1.81250°E\ufeff / 14.83000; 1.81250) and Zaroumdareye (at 14°54′21′′N 01°46′36′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.90583°N 1.77667°E\ufeff / 14.90583; 1.77667), which are seven kilometres apart, and initially left 79 people dead and 75 wounded. Of the deceased victims, 49 were killed in Tchombangou and 30 in Zaroumdareye. A day after the attack, 21 more people were found dead and others succumbed to their injuries on Tchombangou, bringing the total death toll to 100. On 8 January UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman said that 73 people had been killed in the village of Tchouma Bangou and 32 in Zaroumdareye, making the total death toll 105. The government of Niger dispatched soldiers to the border after the attacks. The attackers are Islamist militants who arrived in the villages while crossing the border from Mali; however, the exact terrorist organization who carried out the attacks is not clear so far. \c\cSome time before the massacre, two militants who were seen in the area were killed by the local villagers. Those attacks are suspected to be in retaliation for those killings, according to the country's interior minister. \c\cOn 21 February, seven members of the electoral commission were killed and three others wounded in a landmine explosion in Tillabéri. The attack was carried out on the same day of the presidential election's second round. \c\cOn 16 March, armed men on motorcycles attacked a convoy returning from a market in Banibangou by the Malian border to a nearby village in Southwestern Niger's Tillabéri Region, killing 58 people. \c\cOn 21 March, militants riding motorbikes attacked Intazayene, Bakorat and Wistan, three villages in the Tahoua Region close to the Malian border, killing 137 people. The death toll would make the attack the deadliest committed by suspected jihadists in Niger's history. Newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum condemned the attacks and declared three days of national mourning. \c\cOn 24 March, at least 10 people were killed during attacks at two villages in the Tillabéri Region. \c\cOn 18 April, at least 19 civilians were killed and two wounded when armed men raid a village in Tillabéri Region. \c\cOn 3 May, a military patrol was ambushed in the Tahoua Region, resulting in the killing of 16 soldiers and the wounding of six more. It was the first attack against soldiers in the country[citation needed] since the beginning of the year. \c\cOn 12 May, five villagers were killed and two more wounded after militants stormed the village of Fantio, in the Tillabéri region, during Eid al-Fitr celebrations."}
The United States is widely considered to have the most extensive and sophisticated intelligence network of any nation in the world, with notable suborganizations including the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, amongst others. It has conducted numerous espionage operations against foreign countries, including both allies and rivals. This includes industrial espionage  and cyber espionage. Through a combination of hacking and secret court orders against American technology companies, the United States has also employed mass surveillance of ordinary individuals, both American and foreign nationals alike. \c\cMany of these operations have generated public criticism as being unethical; examples include the overthrow of foreign governments, nonconsensual human experiments, extraordinary rendition, torture, targeted killings, assassinations,  and the funding and training of militants who would go on to kill civilians and non-combatants. \c\cA cache of top secret documents leaked in 2013 by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who obtained them  while working for Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the largest contractors for defense and intelligence in the United States., revealed operational details about the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and its international partners\' global surveillance of foreign nationals and U.S. citizens. In addition to a trove of U.S. federal documents, Snowden's cache reportedly contains thousands of Australian, British and Canadian intelligence files that he had accessed via the exclusive "Five Eyes" network. In June 2013, the first of Snowden's documents were published simultaneously by The Washington Post and The Guardian, attracting considerable public attention. The disclosure continued throughout the entire year of 2013, and a significant portion of the full cache of the estimated 1.7 million documents was later obtained and published by many other media outlets worldwide, most notably The New York Times, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Der Spiegel (Germany), O Globo (Brazil), Le Monde (France), L\'espresso (Italy), NRC Handelsblad (the Netherlands), Dagbladet (Norway), El País (Spain), and Sveriges Television (Sweden). \c\cThese media reports have shed light on the implications of several secret treaties signed by members of the UKUSA community in their efforts to implement global surveillance. For example, Der Spiegel revealed how the German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) transfers "massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA", while Sveriges Television revealed the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) provided the NSA with data from its cable collection, under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance. Other security and intelligence agencies involved in the practice of global surveillance include those in Australia (ASD), Britain (GCHQ), Canada (CSEC), Denmark (PET), France (DGSE), Germany (BND), Italy (AISE), the Netherlands (AIVD), Norway (NIS), Spain (CNI), Switzerland (NDB), as well as Israel (ISNU), which receives raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens that is shared by the NSA. \c\cThe disclosure provided impetus for the creation of social movements against mass surveillance, such as Restore the Fourth, and actions like Stop Watching Us and The Day We Fight Back.  On the legal front, the Electronic Frontier Foundation joined a coalition of diverse groups filing suit against the NSA. Several human rights organizations have urged the Obama administration not to prosecute, but protect, "whistleblower Snowden": Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, and the Index on Censorship, inter alia. \c\cSnowden's revelations confirmed that the United States, together with Israel, conducted Operation Olympic Games, a covert and still unacknowledged campaign of sabotage by means of cyber disruption, directed at Iranian nuclear facilities. As reported, it was one of the first known uses of offensive cyber weapons.  Started under the George W. Bush administration in 2006, Olympic Games was accelerated under President Obama, who heeded Bush's advice to continue cyber attacks on Iranian nuclear facility at Natanz. Amongst other things, they created the computer worm Stuxnet, which spread beyond Iran's nuclear facilities to the internet, causing collateral damage in other nations such as India and Indonesia. \c\cIn 1994, United States trade officials were accompanied with CIA agents to various international locations such as London and Geneva to spy on Japanese auto executives and government officials during Japan-U.S. negotiations on automotive trade. \c\cAn article in the New York Times wrote:\c\cIn April 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama placed Anwar al-Awlaki on a list of people whom the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was authorized to kill because of terrorist activities. The "targeted killing" of an American citizen was unprecedented. Al-Awlaki's father and civil rights groups challenged the order in court. Al-Awlaki was believed to be in hiding in Southeast Yemen in the last years of his life. The U.S. deployed unmanned aircraft (drones) in Yemen to search for and kill him, firing at and failing to kill him at least once, before succeeding in a fatal American drone attack in Yemen on September 30, 2011. Two weeks later, al-Awlaki's 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen who was born in Denver, was killed by a CIA-led drone strike in Yemen. Nasser al-Awlaki, Anwar's father, released an audio recording condemning the killings of his son and grandson as senseless murders. In June 2014, a previously classified memorandum issued by the United States Department of Justice was released, justifying al-Awlaki's death as a lawful act of war. \c\cIn 1993, the CIA's Paris station launched an economic espionage operation to gain an advantage in negotiations over the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They attempted to use a female operative posing as a public relations director for a save-the-rain-forest foundation as a honeypot trap to ensnare Henri Plagnol, an aide to French prime minister Édouard Balladur. However, Plagnol was warned by French counterintelligence officers who had seen through the plot and told him to play along. Over the course of two years, the French used Plagnol to turn the tables on the CIA, uncovering multiple CIA operatives and ultimately publicly expelling the CIA Paris station chief along with other key agents from the country. \c\cThe CIA recruited over a dozen spies working in multiple German industries, including a double agent in German intelligence. These spies were uncovered in raids on the Ministry of Defense by German authorities in 2014. Angela Merkel, whose personal cellphone was tapped by the NSA, ordered the CIA's Berlin station chief to leave the country. \c\cIn 1953, the CIA worked with the United Kingdom to overthrow the democratically elected government of Iran led by Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh who had attempted to nationalize Iran's petroleum industry, threatening the profits of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now known as BP.  Declassified CIA documents show that Britain was fearful of Iran's plans to nationalize its oil industry and pressed the U.S. to mount a joint operation to depose the prime minister and install a puppet regime. In 1951 the Iranian parliament voted to nationalize the petroleum fields of the country. \c\cThe coup was led by CIA operative Kermit Roosevelt, Jr. (grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt). With help from British intelligence, the CIA planned, funded and implemented Operation Ajax. In the months before the coup, the UK and U.S. imposed a boycott of the country, exerted other political pressures, and conducted a massive covert propaganda campaign to create the environment necessary for the coup. The CIA hired Iranian agents provocateurs who posed as communists, harassed religious leaders and staged the bombing of one cleric's home to turn the Islamic religious community against the government. For the U.S. audience, the CIA hoped to plant articles in U.S. newspapers saying that Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi's return to govern Iran resulted from a homegrown revolt against what was being represented to the U.S. public as a communist-leaning government. The CIA successfully used its contacts at the Associated Press to put on the newswire in the U.S. a statement from Tehran about royal decrees that the CIA itself had written. \c\cThe coup initially failed and the Shah fled the country. After four days of rioting, Shi\'ite-sparked street protests backed by pro-Shah army units defeated Mossadeq's forces and the Shah returned to power. \c\cThe CIA subsequently used the apparent success of their Iranian coup project to bolster their image in American government circles. They expanded their reach into other countries, taking a greater portion of American intelligence assets based on their record in Iran. \c\cIn August 2013 the CIA admitted that it was involved in both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda. The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out "under CIA direction" and "as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government." The National Security Archive said it that while it "applauds the CIA's decision to make these materials available, today's posting shows clearly that these materials could have been safely declassified many years ago without risk of damage to national security."\c\cThe New York Times reported in May 2017 that "the Chinese government systematically dismantled C.I.A. spying operations in the country starting in 2010, killing or imprisoning more than a dozen sources over two years and crippling intelligence gathering there for years afterward. Current and former American officials described the intelligence breach as one of the worst in decades."
The COVID-19 pandemic in Palau is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Palau on 18 May 2021. 
On 6 January 2021, 53 Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, former legislators, social workers and academics were arrested by the National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Force under the national security law over their organisation and participation in the primaries for the subsequently postponed Legislative Council election, including six organisers and 47 participants, making it the largest crackdown under the national security law since its passage on 30 June 2020. The police also raided 72 places including home of jailed activist Joshua Wong, the offices of news outlets Apple Daily, Stand News and InMedia HK and polling institute Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI), and froze more than $200,000 in funds related to the primaries. These were the most prominent politicians in the opposition camp that had been arrested by the authorities. \c\cOn 11 and 12 July 2020, the pro-democracy camp, organised by legal scholar and activist Benny Tai, held a primary to select numbers of candidates for the September Legislative Council election to maximise the chance for the pro-democrats to achieve the "35+" majority in the Legislative Council to block the government's bills and pressured the government to implement the five key demands of the ongoing protests. Tai envisaged that the democrats would veto all bills in the legislature to paralyse the government, and would force the Chief Executive to dissolve the Legislative Council after the government budget was vetoed, as on the fourth and fifth stages of the "ten-step lam chau" timeline. \c\cSecretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang warned that the primaries might violate the new Beijing-imposed national security law before the primaries. Tsang said one the objectives of the primaries was to win a majority of seats in the legislature and subsequently vote against the budget. He added this could contravene clauses in the new law prohibiting secession, subversion and collusion with foreign powers. Benny Tai refuted the claim by saying such advocacy work was in accordance with the principles of the Basic Law. He added that vetoing the budget would not constitute "seriously interfering in, disrupting, or undermining the performance of duties and functions" of the government under Article 22 of the new law because the chief executive has the power to dismiss the legislature and call a by-election. \c\cDespite the national security law and legal threats, over 600,000 voters, including 590,000 electronic ballots and more than 20,000 paper ballots, turned out throughout the two-day vote, more than 13 per cent of the total number of registered voters and far exceeding the organisers\' expected turnout of 170,000. Chief Executive Carrie Lam issued a strong warning to the candidates and organisers of the primaries, saying it was subversive for them to vow to seize control of the legislature and vote down key government proposals. "If this so-called primary election's purpose is to achieve the ultimate goal of delivering what they called \'35+\' [lawmakers], with the objective of objecting or resisting every policy initiative of the HKSAR government, it may fall into the category of subverting the state power – one of the four types of offences under the national security law," she said. \c\cA spokesman for Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong condemned the opposition camp for ignoring the Hong Kong government's warning of possible legal breaches and pressing ahead with the primary. It named Benny Tai as a suspect in a possible breach of the national security law by coordinating with the opposition camp to seek control of the legislature, vote down the budget, paralyse the government and subvert the state power. It also accused Tai and the opposition of aiming to take over the city's governance by staging the Hong Kong version of a "colour revolution". The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) accused Tai of "illegally manipulating" Hong Kong's electoral system, challenging the new national security law and acting as a political agent for foreign forces. \c\cIn the morning on 6 January 2021, the National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Force raided 72 places including home of jailed activist Joshua Wong and co-organisers Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI) and law firm Ho Tse Wai and Partners, demanded three news outlets Apple Daily, Stand News and InMedia HK to hand over information and froze $206,000 in funds related to the election. In the operations, the police arrested 53 men and women including activists, former legislators, social workers and academics who organised or contested in the primaries across the pro-democracy spectrum on suspicion of "subversion of state power" under the national security law. They included organiser Benny Tai and jailed activist and primary candidate Joshua Wong, seven former legislators of the Democratic Party, the Hong Kong's largest opposition party including the party chairman Wu Chi-wai, veteran politicians and activists Leung Kwok-hung and Claudia Mo, and newcomers including Jeffrey Andrews, a social worker serving the city’s ethnic minority community, and disability rights advocate Lee Chi-yung. American lawyer John Clancey, partner of Ho Tse Wai and Partners and treasurer of the Power for Democracy which co-ordinated the primaries, was also arrested. PORI executive director Robert Chung and his deputy Chung Kim-wah were also visited by police asked to assist with the investigation. \c\cAccording to Secretary for Security John Lee, the arrestees were accused of "subverting state power" for holding the primaries and were suspected of attempting to gain a majority in the Legislative Council with the goal of paralysing the government. Lee also cited Benny Tai's "10-step to lam chau" scenario as an evidence for the "vicious plan" to "sink Hong Kong into an abyss."\c\c53 arrestees, excluding Joshua Wong and Tam Tak-chi who were already in prison, are listed as the following. All were released on bail on 7 January, except Wu Chi-wai, who was alleged to have violated bail conditions related to a separate case of unauthorized assembly. \c\cBenny Tai, former associate professor of law at the University of Hong Kong\c\cAu Nok-hin, former member of the Legislative Council (2018–2020)\c\cBen Chung, chairman of the Sai Kung District Council and deputy convenor of the Power for Democracy\c\cAndrew Chiu, vice chairman of the Eastern District Council and convenor of the Power for Democracy\c\cJohn Clancey, lawyer and treasurer of the Power for Democracy\c\cNg Ching-hang, activist\c\cTiffany Yuen, member of the Southern District Council\c\cFergus Leung, member of the Central and Western District Council\c\cTat Cheng, member of the Eastern District Council\c\cChui Chi-kin, member of the Eastern District Council\c\cClarisse Yeung, chairman of the Wan Chai District Council\c\cMichael Pang, member of the Southern District Council\c\cJimmy Sham, member of the Sha Tin District Council and former convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front\c\cClaudia Mo, former member of the Legislative Council (2012–2020)\c\cKalvin Ho, member of the Sham Shui Po District Council\c\cFrankie Fung, convenor of the Peninsular Commons\c\cLawrence Lau, barrister and member of the Sham Shui Po District Council\c\cHelena Wong, former member of the Legislative Council (2012–2020)\c\cLau Chak-fung, activist\c\cJeffrey Andrews, social worker\c\cJoshua Wong, former secretary general of Demosistō, in jail\c\cJeremy Tam, former member of the Legislative Council (2016–2020)\c\cLi Ka-tat, member of the Kwun Tong District Council\c\cTam Tak-chi, vice chairman of the People Power, in jail\c\cWu Chi-wai, former chairman of the Democratic Party and member of the Legislative Council (2012–2020)\c\cSze Tak-loy, chairman of the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood and member of the Wong Tai Sin District Council\c\cEddie Chu, former member of the Legislative Council (2016–2020)\c\cSam Cheung, member of the Tuen Mun District Council\c\cWong Ji-yuet, former spokesperson of Scholarism\c\cNg Kin-wai, member of the Yuen Long District Council\c\cAndrew Wan, member of the Kwai Tsing District Council and former member of the Legislative Council (2016–2020)\c\cKwok Ka-ki, former member of the Legislative Council (2004–2008; 2012–2020)\c\cCarol Ng, chairperson of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions\c\cTam Hoi-pong, member of the Tsuen Wan District Council\c\cGwyneth Ho, former journalist for Stand News\c\cVentus Lau, activist\c\cAlvin Yeung, former leader of the Civic Party and former member of the Legislative Council (2016–2020)\c\cRaymond Chan, chairman of the People Power and former member of the Legislative Council (2012–2020)\c\cOwen Chow, activist\c\cLam Cheuk-ting, member of the North District Council and former member of the Legislative Council (2016–2020)\c\cGary Fan, member of the Sai Kung District Council and former member of the Legislative Council (2012–2016; 2018–2020)\c\cHendrick Lui, social worker\c\cLeung Kwok-hung, former member of the Legislative Council (2004–2017)\c\cMike Lam, businessman\c\cRicky Or, member of the Sai Kung District Council\c\cLee Chi-yung, spokesman for the Association of Parents of the Severely Mentally Handicapped\c\cKwong Chun-yu, member of the Yuen Long District Council and former member of the Legislative Council (2016–2020)\c\cLester Shum, member of the Tsuen Wan District Council\c\cWong Pak-yu, member of the Yuen Long District Council\c\cJames To, member of the Yau Tsim Mong District Council and former member of the Legislative Council (1998–2020)\c\cLee Yue-shun, member of the Eastern District Council\c\cWinnie Yu, chairperson of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance\c\cMichael Lau, officer of the Hong Kong Allied Health Professionals and Nurse Association\c\cJoseph Lee, former member of the Legislative Council (2004–2020)\c\cYuen Wai-kit, principal of the School of Nursing of the Union Hospital\c\cCivic Party chairman Alan Leong criticised the mass arrests as he could not see why those who promised to exercise their power to veto budgets – as outlined in the Basic Law – would be considered subversive. "We know that many in Hong Kong are very disappointed. But we appeal to the people of Hong Kong not to despair," Leong said. "We should insist on speaking the truth and living in truth. There will be light in the end of the dark tunnel, and every dark night will see the dawn. So, let us stand and fight."\c\cMaya Wang of the Human Rights Watch issued a statement condemning the arrests: "The Chinese government has decided to mark 2021 with sweeping arrests of over 50 prominent pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, removing the remaining veneer of democracy in the city. Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government."\c\cA joint statement issued by the foreign ministers of Australia, the US, Britain and Canada expressed "serious concern" over the arrests and criticised the national security law as: "a clear breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and undermines the \'One Country, Two Systems\' framework." They said the law "has curtailed the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong" and "being used to eliminate dissent and opposing political views" and called on Hong Kong and Chinese authorities to "respect the legally guaranteed rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong." The Hong Kong government responded by saying that "[we] are appalled by remarks made by some overseas government officials that seemed to suggest that people with certain political beliefs should be immune to legal sanctions."\c\cU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slammed the arrests as an "outrage" and said that the U.S. would "consider sanctions and other restrictions on any and all individuals and entities involved in executing this assault on the Hong Kong people." Antony Blinken, US President-elect Joe Biden's pick for Secretary of State, said the arrests was "an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights" launched by the Chinese authorities. "The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy," he said. \c\cThe U.S. imposed sanctions on six officials on 15 January including Hong Kong delegate to the National People’s Congress Standing Committee Tam Yiu-chung, vice-chairman of the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs You Quan, deputy director of the Office for Safeguarding National Security Sun Wenqing and three officials in the National Security Division of the Hong Kong Police Frederic Choi Chin-pang, Kelvin Kong Hok-lai and Andrew Kan Kai-yan, over the mass arrests. \c\cBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the arrests "a grievous attack on Hong Kong's rights and freedoms as protected under the Joint Declaration" and reiterated the UK’s offer to the British National (Overseas) passport holders to emigrate Britain. "The UK will not turn our backs on the people of Hong Kong and will continue to offer BNOs the right to live and work in the UK," Raab said. \c\cThe last British Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten urged the European Union not to go ahead with the draft investment deal with China. "If this deal goes ahead it will make a mockery of Europe's ambitions to be taken seriously as a global political and economic player. It spits in the face of human rights and shows a delusional view of the Chinese Communist Party's trustworthiness on the international stage."\c\cThe European Union called for the immediate release of the arrestees. "We are currently analysing the situation to see how we might need to react. There are other possibilities open to us, sanctions for example," the European Commission spokesperson Peter Stano said. The German Foreign Ministry called the arrests "another milestone in a worrying development in recent months." The arrests confirmed fears that the security law "is leading to an erosion of civil liberties and the rule of law."\c\cThe European Parliament on 21 January adopted a resolution by 597 votes in favor, 17 against and 61 abstentions on the deteriorating human rights situation in Hong Kong and urged EU countries to consider introducing sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials including Carrie Lam, under the EU Human Rights Global Sanction Regime. The Parliament also regretted the EU's decision to enter the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment by risking its credibility as a global human rights actor. \c\cTaiwan President Tsai Ing-wen condemned the arrests and called on the world's democracies to speak out against China's political repression in the territory. She vowed that Taiwan will "continue to resolutely support a free Hong Kong and stand up for our shared democratic values." Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu described the arrests in Hong Kong as a "deep shock to those who treasure freedom" and called on the world to "unite against authoritarianism."\c\cThe government of Japan has stated that it could not tolerate the mast arrests in Hong Kong, it would convey this position to China and join hands with foreign countries to deal with the Hong Kong issue. The government refers to Hong Kong as an extremely important partner for Japan's close economic relations and talent exchange. The government's position is that Hong Kong should maintain a free and open system under "one country, two systems" and to develop democratic and stable development. The government continued to point out that after the implementation of the National Security Law, it has deep doubts about whether Hong Kong respects basic values \u200b\u200bsuch as freedom of speech and freedom of the press. It also said that it is impossible for Japan to tolerate the arrests. It also reiterated that Japan will cooperate with the G7 and other countries. A ruling party LDP lawmaker Keisuke Suzuki said that the current situation in Hong Kong is serious and it is at a critical juncture. He emphasized that the international community must regard the actions of the Hong Kong government as a violation of international agreements. To describe the nature of the Chinese Communist Party is to deny universal values \u200b\u200bsuch as freedom, democracy and human rights. \c\cOn 28 February 2021, of the 55 pro-democracy figures initially arrested in January, 47 were officially charged with conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law. They were denied bail and instead remain in detention before trial on 1 March, while Jeffrey Andrews, Lee Chi-yung, Kwong Chun-yu, James To, Michael Lau, Joseph Lee, Yuen Wai-kit and John Clancey were released on bail. On the eve of the charges, pro-democracy group Power for Democracy which co-organised the primaries announced its disbandment on 27 February. \c\cThe trial began on 1 March at the West Kowloon Magistrates\' Court. About 1,000 supporters gathered at the court, most wearing black to express solidarity with the detainees, and some holding banners calling for the release of the "political prisoners" and chanting "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times", "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong" and "Five demands, not one less", slogans which were deemed illegal under the national security law, making it one of the largest rallies since the COVID-19 outbreak. Foreign diplomats joined the crowds queuing for one of the about 100 seats inside the courtroom. The police set up security lines around the court in the afternoon and forced demonstrators to disperse. \c\cBefore the trial, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Xia Baolong singled out three pro-democracy activists charged with the national security law, Joshua Wong, Jimmy Lai and Benny Tai, saying they were "extremely wicked" and "must be severely punished for their illegal actions." Hong Kong Free Press enquired with the Department of Justice about the department's position on the remarks of Xia, given its statements that comments from third parties on ongoing court proceedings were inappropriate. The department  \c\cpointed to the words "in accordance with the law" which Xia had added; it refused to elaborate on the significance of this comment in this context, and on the question of whether anyone else would be able to legally use the formulation of Xia. \c\cThe prosecution applied to postpone the hearing until 31 May as its investigations had not finished. Defence Senior Counsel Alan Leong questioned the police for "rushing" to press charges without finishing the investigations, some five weeks earlier than originally scheduled. Traditionally, Hong Kong's common law system put the onus on the prosecution to prove its case for objecting bail, but under the national security law the defendants instead needed to prove to the court that they would not be a national security threat if released on bail. Due to the large number of defendants being trialed at the same time, the court had only managed to hear the bail applications of seven defendants by 10:30 p.m. The trial dragged on for close to 14 hours until almost 3 a.m., resulted in four defendants being hospitalised due to exhaustion. Leo Yau, one of the defence solicitors for nine of the defendants, was arrested by the police when he attempted to attempted to pass a police cordon to get into the courtroom. \c\cSecond day of the trial resumed late on the next morning, giving defendants little time to rest. Defence lawyers voiced criticism of the court over defendants not being given the opportunity to shower or change clothes for four days since they were detained on 28 February. One of the defendants, Lawrence Lau, 53, also a practicing barrister, apologised for not bathing for three days before addressing the court. He added: "When someone is stripped of their freedom, they are also stripped of their personal hygiene and appearance, which makes them lose confidence. I do not understand why I ended up in custody when I have been law-abiding my whole life." A defence counsel also told the court that his defendants had not been sent back to the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre until nearly 7 a.m. on 2 March. "The defendants have to attend court hearings that started at 8 this morning [yesterday], which means they could only rest for at most two hours, causing them to be physically tormented," he said. Amnesty International Hong Kong program manager Lam Cho Ming warned that an extended hearing "along with insufficient time to rest could potentially violate the right to a fair trial." Chief magistrate Victor So called a halt to the second day of hearings at 10:36 p.m. on 2 March. \c\cAnother defendant, Winnie Yu, 33, a nurse and chairwoman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, was suspended from her duties by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority after she was prosecuted. \c\cEight defendants had not addressed the court regarding their bail applications in the more than 24-hour marathon hearing. On the third day on 3 March, four Civic Party defendants Alvin Yeung, Kwok Ka-ki, Jeremy Tam and Lee Yue-shun announced their resignations from the party, with Yeung resigning from the party. Barrister Alan Leong, chairman of the party, terminated his legal representation of the four. Lam Cheuk-ting, Clarisse Yeung and Gwyneth Ho also told the court they had terminated the services of their legal representatives. Alvin Yeung said before addressing the court: "As a barrister, I would never have imagined that I would have to address the court in the docks. On March 2 five years ago, I was sworn in as a legislative councillor, fighting for Hongkongers, but five years later, I am fighting for my own freedom." Chief Magistrate Victor So adjourned the third day proceedings at 8:30 p.m. \c\cAll defendants finished their addresses to the court with proceedings deep into the fourth day on 4 March. Hundreds of people queued in the rain for entering the courthouse before the proceedings until nighttime, defying police warnings of violating the national security law. \c\cSome media outlets applied to the court for lifting reporting strict restrictions on the bail proceedings which could only report the name of the court and the magistrate of the case, the date and place of the proceedings, the name of the defendants and their legal representation, the offence they were charged of and the result of a proceedings. The defence proposed a set of relaxed reporting rules, with Barrister David Ma saying that an open, fair and transparent trial was the "cornerstone of the rule of law", pointing out that freedom of speech and the press are respected under the national security law. A representative of Senior Counsel Hectar Pun argued that "if the media cannot report on this open hearing, then it will undermine the principle of open justice." Chief Magistrate Victor So refused the plea on the grounds that the general public or the press may not be able to determine whether a statement made in court fell under the scope of "legal argument," causing citizens to accidentally breach the restrictions, which would be "a bit dangerous for them". \c\cChief Magistrate Victor So initially granted bail to 15 of the 47 defendants at around 8 p.m., but the decision was immediately appealed by the Department of Justice. The 32 remaining defendants were denied bail on grounds that they would be likely to continue to commit acts endangering national security, meaning they would have to be remain in detention until the trial begins on 31 May. When the defendants left the court, the supporters who waited outside waved goodbye and thanked their lawyers. Some also chanted "Five demands, not one less", "Political prisoners are not guilty" and "Hongkonger won\'t die!"\c\cFour of the defendants Clarisse Yeung, Lawrence Lau, Hendrick Lui and Mike Lam were released on bail on the next day after prosecutors dropped the appeal. \c\c(will be held on 31 May)\c\cOn 11 March, High Court judge Esther Toh rejected the appeal by the Department of Justice against Chief Magistrate Victor So's decision to grant bail to former Democratic Party legislator Helena Wong, but approved the appeal against Yuen Long District Councillor Ng Kin-wai's bail. After release, Wong reunited with her husband and said: "I was really calm while I was in custody, as I know I did nothing wrong, but the bail hearing was really tiring in the first few days." Of the 21 defendants presented to the courts on the next day on 12 March, judge Victor So, who was the magistrate who granted the appeals in the first place, rejected 11 appeal applications, while the ten remaining defendants withdrew their applications. On 13 March, Tat Cheng, Michael Pang and Ricky Or were granted bail by High Court judge Esther Toh, while Jeremy Tam and Kwok Ka-ki were denied bail. High Court judge Esther Toh approved bail for Kalvin Ho, Sze Tak-loy and Lee Yue-shun on 14 March, but denied the bail application of Sam Cheung. On 29 March, High Court judge Esther Toh adjourned the bail applications of Jimmy Sham and Claudia Mo to a later date but denied bail to veteran politician and activist Leung Kwok-hung. \c\cOn 12 April, High Court judge Esther Toh granted bail to Clarisse Yeung, Mike Lam King-nam, and upheld the release on bail of Tat Cheng and Helena Wong, but denied bail to Jimmy Sham. On 14 April, High Court judge Esther Toh denied bail to former lawmaker Claudia Mo. On 22 April 2021, High Court judge Esther Toh upheld her decision to deny bail to opposition former lawmaker Jeremy Tam after she said that Tam had signed a letter in September 2019 supporting the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.

India began administration of COVID-19 vaccines on 16 January 2021 (1 year, 77 days ago). As of 2 June 2021[update], India has administered 221,043,693 doses overall, including first and second doses of the currently-approved vaccines. \c\cTwo vaccines received approval for emergency use in India at the onset of the programme; Covishield—a brand of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, which was developed by Bharat Biotech. In April 2021, the Indian government approved the Russian Sputnik V vaccine (which is distributed locally by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories) as a third vaccine, which began use in May 2021. \c\cVaccines distributed listed in million as of 2 June 2021\c\cIn September 2020, India's science minister Harsh Vardhan stated that the country planned to approve and begin distribution of a vaccine by the first quarter of 2021. The first recipients were to be 30 million health workers directly dealing with COVID patients. \c\cOn 1 January 2021, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approved emergency use of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine (local trade name "Covishield").  On 2 January, the DCGI also approved BBV152 (trade name "Covaxin"), a domestic vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology. This approval was met with some concern, as the vaccine had not then completed phase 3 trials. Due to this status, those receiving Covaxin were required to sign a consent form, while some states chose to relegate Covaxin to a "buffer stock" and primarily distribute Covishield. Following the conclusion of its trial, the DCGI issued a standard emergency use authorisation to Covaxin in March 2021. \c\cIndia began its vaccination program on 16 January 2021, operating 3,006 vaccination centres on the onset. Each vaccination centre will offer either Covishield or Covaxin, but not both.  Since Covaxin had not yet completed phase 3 trials, those receiving it were required to sign a consent form. Following the conclusion of its trials, the DCGI issued a standard emergency use authorisation to Covaxin later on  in March 2021. \c\c165,714 people were vaccinated on the first day of availability. Difficulties in uploading beneficiary lists at some sites caused delays. In the first three days, 631,417 people were vaccinated. Of these, 0.18% reported side-effects and nine people (0.002%) were admitted to hospitals for observation and treatment. Within those first days, there was concerns about low turnout, due to a combination of vaccine safety concerns, technical problems with the software used, and misinformation. \c\cThe first phase of the rollout involved health workers and frontline workers including police, paramilitary forces, sanitation workers, and disaster management volunteers. By 1 March, only 14 million healthcare and frontline workers had been vaccinated, falling short of the original goal of 30 million. \c\cThe next phase of the vaccine rollout covered all residents over the age of 60, residents between the ages of 45 and 60 with one or more qualifying comorbidities, and any health care or frontline worker that did not receive a dose during phase 1. Online registration began on 1 March via the Aarogya Setu app and Co-WIN ("Winning over COVID-19") website. Amid the beginnings of a major second wave of infections in the country,  vaccine exports were suspended in March 2021, and the government ordered 110 million Covishield doses from SII. The company aims to produce 100 million doses per month, but by May 2021 its production capacity was only 60–70 million doses. \c\cFrom 1 April, eligibility was extended to all residents over the age of 45. On 8 April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a four-day Teeka Utsav ("Vaccine Festival") from 11 to 14 April to mark the birthdays of Jyotirao Phule and B. R. Ambedkar, with a goal to increase the pace of the program by vaccinating as many eligible residents as possible. By the end of the Utsav, India had reached a total of over 111 million vaccine doses to-date. \c\cOn 12 April, the DCGI approved Russia's Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use in India. A phase 3 trial had been conducted in the country in September 2020, which showed 91.6% efficacy. The local distributor Dr. Reddy's Laboratories stated that it planned to have the vaccine available in India by late-May 2021. \c\cOn 19 April, it was announced that the next phase of the vaccine program would begin on 1 May, extending eligibility to all residents over the age of 18. Under phase 3, individual stakeholders were also given more flexibility in how they conduct the vaccine program. As part of this plan, only half of the vaccines supplied by manufacturers to the Central Drugs Laboratory would be distributed by the central government. This supply would go to government-run clinics and be offered free-of-charge to residents 45 and over and priority workers, and siphoned off to states based on factors such as the number of active cases and how quickly they are administering vaccines. The remainder would be offered to individual states and purchased on the open market (including private hospitals), which would be able to serve residents over the age of 18. \c\cRegistration for the next phase began on 28 April; a single-day record of nearly 13.3 million people registered. Due to supply issues, several states, including Delhi, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh announced that they would delay their wider rollouts of vaccines to later in the month. The initial shipment of 150,000 Sputnik V doses arrived on 1 May, and began to be administered on 14 May. An estimated 156 million doses is expected between August and December; initially, doses will be sourced from Russia, but domestic production is expected to begin by August 2021. \c\cOn 13 May, the DCGI approved phase 2 and phase 3 trials of Covaxin among children 2–18. On 14 May, health officials projected that based on the anticipated approval of additional vaccine options, it could receive at least 2.17 billion more vaccine doses from August to December 2021. \c\cOn 25 May, India exceeded 200 million vaccine doses administered. \c\cAs of early May 2020, there were over 30 vaccine candidates in development in India, many of which were already in pre-clinical trials. \c\cThe Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is the world's largest vaccine maker, and this existing capacity enabled India to be a major participant in the COVAX program to distribute vaccines to developing countries. In February 2020, SII had begun animal trials of vaccine candidates. SII announced in April 2020 that it would apply for clinical trials from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in April 2020. SII president Adar Poonawalla said that a vaccine would be delivered within a year, but projected an efficacy between 70 and 80%. \c\cIn August 2020, SII received approvals for phase 2 and phase 3 trials of its version of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford's Vaccitech. SII joined GAVI in a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to produce 100 million doses of vaccine for developing countries. The SII planned to manufacture 1.5 and 2.5 billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine per-year under the trade name "Covishield". By its approval in January 2021, the company had stockpiled 50 million doses, but well short of its own target of 400 million. The government ordered 21 million doses to be delivered by February, but the company said no indication of any further orders were given. The company began to export the remaining stocks instead. \c\cHyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, in collaboration with U.S.-based FluGen, expected to begin the first clinical trials of a nasal vaccine by late-2020. The Indian Council of Medical Research partnered with Bharat Biotech in May 2020 to develop a COVID vaccine entirely within India. In June 2020, it received DCGI approval to begin phase 1 and phase 2 trials on its vaccine, BBV152 (trade name "Covaxin"). In September 2020, it was reported that in pre-clinical trials on animals, Covaxin was able to build immunity. On 3 March 2021, Bharat Biotech reported that Covaxin showed an efficacy of 81% in its phase 3 trial. On 20 April 2021, Bharat Biotech announced that it had expanded its production capabilities for Covaxin to 700 million doses per-year. \c\cCadila Healthcare began vaccine development in March 2020, including a viral vector vaccine and a DNA plasmid vaccine.  In mid-July 2020, Cadila held early human trials of its vaccine candidate ZyCoV-D, and received approval for phase 3 trials in January 2021. It began large-scale production in April 2021, with Cadila expecting to receive emergency authorisation between May and June 2021. \c\cIn September 2020, Dr. Reddy's partnered with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct phase 3 trials of the Sputnik V vaccine in India, and to distribute the vaccine there once approved.  In April 2021, RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev told NDTV that they had "five great manufacturers in India" who would be producing the vaccine, and felt that the country could become Sputnik V's "production hub" for use and export. Dr. Reddy's is also working with the RDIF on approval of "Sputnik Light"—a regiment of Sputnik V consisting only of the first dose. \c\cIn January 2021, India began a humanitarian initiative known as Vaccine Maitri (vaccine friendship), which aims to leverage the country's pharmaceutical industry to export Indian-manufactured vaccines to other countries. The Ministry of External Affairs stated that since 20 January, India had donated over 5.5 million vaccines to neighbouring countries such as Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka, and that the country was also planning to send doses to Africa, Nicaragua, Oman, the Caribbean Community, and the COVAX programme, and to distribute vaccines to other countries via commercial exports. \c\cA spokesperson of the MEA stated that "In line with the prime minister's announcement that India sees international cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic as its duty, we have played the role of the first responder in our neighbourhood as well as undertaken supplies to countries beyond." In response to these donations, Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres stated that he "strongly hope[s] that India will have all the instruments that are necessary to play a major role in making sure that a global vaccination is campaign is made possible", and went on to say that "I think that the production capacity of India is the best asset that the world has today. I hope the world understands that it must be fully used."\c\cAs of 10 March 2021, India had distributed over 58 million vaccine doses to 65 nations through the scheme, but due to India's domestic need for vaccines, these exports were suspended later in March and the suspension was expected to continue throughout 2021. \c\cAndhra Pradesh had received 370,000 doses of Covishield and 20,000 of Covaxin. It was decided that only Covishield would be administered. The state aims to vaccinate 32,000 people a day. However, on the first two days, only 61 and 47.8 per cent of those days\' targets could be vaccinated. There were two cases of adverse events, but neither required hospitalization. \c\cBihar received 569,000 doses of the vaccine. 4,64,160 health workers had registered for the vaccine, and the state expects to vaccinate 30,000 people a day across 300 sites. Some doctors had doubts about the efficacy of Covaxin and refused to take it. \c\cOne person was admitted to hospital following complications, but was later discharged. \c\c4,319 health workers were administered the vaccine on the first day, and there were 51 minor and one major cases of adverse effects. By day three, four people had been admitted to hospitals following complications, of which three had been later discharged. \c\cKarnataka Health Minister K. Sudhakar announced on 9 January that the state would be given 13.9 lakh (1.39 million) doses of Covishield in two batches. 6.3 lakh (630,000) health workers had registered for the vaccine. Two people were admitted to hospital following complications; one person was later discharged. A 43-year old vaccine recipient in Ballari died of a heart stroke two days after the jab. \c\cKerala initially received 433,500 doses of Covishield, and an additional batch of 360,500 Covishield doses were announced three days later. In total, 459,853 people from the state registered for the vaccine, including 1,75,673 healthcare workers from state-run hospitals, 199,937 from private hospitals, 2,932 from federal hospitals, 74,711 police staff and 6,600 municipal workers. A total of 24,558 healthcare workers were vaccinated on the first three days. No adverse reactions were reported. After vaccinating 3.75 lakh health workers by 11 February, the focus of the campaign shifted to other front-line staff such as police and municipal workers. The second dose was provided from 15 February onwards. \c\cIn order to create public confidence in the vaccine, several prominent officials and politicians took the vaccine. This includes Health Minister KK Shailaja, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, state police chief Lokanath Behera, former Chief Minister VS Achuthanandan and Thiruvananthapuram District Collector Navajoth Khosa. By 21 February, 3,36,327 health workers and 57,658 other frontline staff had been vaccinated, and Kerala requested more vaccines from the national pool. \c\cVaccination of senior citizens and people over 45 with pre-existing conditions began in March. In addition, vaccines ere also provided to government employees involved in running the upcoming state elections. Since the online registration system was not accessible to everyone, and particularly to senior citizens, vaccination was also provided without prior registration. Asha workers would help senior citizens in finding and booking slots at the nearest vaccination centre. District and Taluk hospitals and Primary Health Centres would provide vaccinations, in addition to selected private hospitals and special vaccination camps. \c\cKerala was affected by the nationwide shortage of vaccines in mid-April, with stocks falling to 7.22 lakh doses. For example, in Palakkad district, nearly half the camps were not in operational condition due to vaccine shortage. Vaccination centres were directed to use the remaining stocks to vaccinate front-line workers. \c\cAs of June 2, 2021. Madhya Pradesh vaccination has administered more than 1 crore vaccine doses. The pace of immunization has picked up and there are more than 2.0 lakh doses being administered daily. \c\cDue to a shortage of vaccines, the Madhya Pradesh health department has raised a tender estimated at Rs 50.0 Crores which will be open for bidding from 8th June to 22nd June 2021.. Other States such as Karnataka have launched similar efforts which have garnered little success. In Cities, government is making efforts to vaccinate the population by using drive-in vaccination centers. .Some government departments are pushing their own employees by bringing in policies such as No Vaccine, No Pay.   \c\cIn Rural Madhya Pradesh, Immunisation efforts have been marred by rumors and resistance by locals. \c\cMaharashtra received 963,000 doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin. 785,000 health workers had registered to get the vaccination. 14,883 health workers in Maharashtra given COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday In Mumbai, only 1,926 people could be vaccinated on the first day, due to a combination of low turnout and technical problems with the software. The vaccination drive was temporarily suspended due to the technical glitches in the software alerting people to their vaccination appointments. \c\cOdisha had received doses of both Covishield and Covaxin. The first vaccine dose was given to a sanitation worker on 16 January. Covishield is the predominant vaccine used in Odisha. All the districts use Covishield to vaccinate their people. The only exception being Khurda where both covaxin and covishield are used to vaccinate people. \c\cOn 3 January 2021, the state conducted its first round of dry run for COVID vaccination in 7 districts. On 13 January, Rajasthan received the first consignment of COVID-19 vaccines at Jaipur and Udaipur, which included Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Serum Institute of India's Covishield. The vaccines were then transported to state and district level storage centres. \c\cOn 16 January, as a part of nationwide vaccination programme, the first dose of the vaccines were given to selected frontline health workers at 167 sites across the state. In a review meeting held in January 2021 by the state government, the state head of World Health Organization said that Rajasthan is the best state in terms of preparation for COVID vaccination. The second dose of the vaccine started from 15 February. \c\cBy April 13, the state had administered 1 crore doses of vaccine. On 14 April, a theft of 320 doses of Covaxin was reported from a government hospital in Jaipur. \c\cSince the central government did not agree to absorb vaccine costs, the state government announced free vaccines for the age group 18-45 from 1st May. But the rollout was limited to 11 districts only due to shortage of vaccines. Since May 10, every district in Rajasthan started opening slots for 18-45 age group. \c\cTamil Nadu received 536,000 doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin. \c\cOne person was admitted to hospital following complications regarding vaccine, but was later discharged. \c\cUttar Pradesh was the first state to vaccinate over 20 lakh people. Uttar Pradesh received 11,796,780 doses, it consumed 10,261,718 of them, and has 2,211,000 in the pipeline. \c\cThe third phase of vaccination commenced from 5 May 2021.. The state government had procured one lakh Covaxin doses and 3.5 lakh Covishield doses on its own for the phase 3 immunization. \c\cA total of 617 serious adverse events were reported until March 29. Of these, 180 cases resulted in death. The Immunisation Technical Support Unit at the federal health ministry examined 192000 case reports, including 12400 deaths. In more than half of the examined cases of death, the cause of death was found to be acute coronary syndrome. However, the documentation had been completed only in 3500 cases.
{"The COVID-19 vaccination in Vietnam is an ongoing immunization campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in response to the ongoing pandemic in the country. Following the approval of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on 30 January 2021, vaccinations commenced on 8 March 2021. The Sputnik V was later approved for use on 23 March 2021. \c\cThis is the country's largest-ever immunization campaign with over 150 million doses. The country is expected to reach its vaccination coverage target of 80% in June 2022. \c\cAlthough Vietnam is a success story in disease prevention and has kept outbreaks under control, the country's COVID-19 vaccination program is considered to be slower than other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. \c\cIn August 2020, the Vietnamese government announced that they had signed up for 50 to 150 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine from Russia. The Russians will also donate a number of machines, biological products and equipment to Vietnam for COVID-19 prevention, including their vaccine. In the meantime, Vietnamese researchers will still continue developing the country's own vaccine. \c\cIn February 2021, the health ministry had suggested the government to approve COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca, Moderna and Sputnik V for domestic inoculation. Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said the vaccine has been approved under emergent circumstances during the outbreak in Hải Dương and Quảng Ninh province. AstraZeneca has pledged to provide Vietnam with around 30 million doses in 2021. \c\cBesides the deal with AstraZeneca, Vietnam is also stepping up negotiations with Pfizer, Moderna, CureVac, Johnson & Johnson and Gamaleya. \c\cNational Deployment and Vaccination plan (NDVP) was signed off by Deputy Minister of Health on 9 February 2021. Vietnam will receive the feedback of the plan from NDVP review committee as one of the required steps to receive COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX Facility – a global mechanism for developing, manufacturing, supplying and procuring COVID-19 vaccines for all country, especially for low and middle-income economies. Through COVAX, it is confirmed that Vietnam will receive 30 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in 2022. The first batch of vaccines sourced via Covax mechanism, containing 811,200 doses, arrived in Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport on 1 April 2021. \c\cOn 7 May 2021, Vietnam recorded first death after administered AstraZeneca vaccine. She was a 35-year-old medical staff in An Giang Province. \c\cThe government began to procure doses of COVID-19 vaccines from various sources:\c\cEven when the Chinese announced it would provide priority access to Sinovac and Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine, Vietnam is the only ASEAN nation that has yet to publicly state if it will use this due to anti-China sentiment among the public. \c\cFor locally produced COVID-19 vaccines, the MOH expects to have the first batch ready for use at the end of the third quarter of 2021. These vaccines can be put into the country's vaccination campaign in 2022 to ensure supply source and health security, overcome the difficulties when purchasing foreign vaccines. The two locally produced vaccines, Nanocovax and COVIVAC, were put on trial on January to March 2021, respectively, with Nanocovax recognised in official WHO data. \c\cVNVC – the company in charge of importing and storing vaccines in Vietnam, said it is ready to have staff and facilities to store up to 170 million doses of vaccine. It has 49 provincial separate vaccine warehouses, 2 cold conditions warehouses, and 3 deep negative conditions warehouses for storing vaccines at a temperature of -40 to -86°C. In February 2021, the VNVC system's service capacity is up to 100,000 customers per day and can increase capacity to serve up to 4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines per month. \c\cAccording to Deputy Minister of Health Tran Van Thuan, to get protection for the majority of the population, Vietnam needs to diversify supplies of vaccines, which including locally manufactured vaccines and maximising the resources from the businesses and local administration's budgets in addition to the government's budget to get the vaccination programme running. The budget needed to give vaccine shots for 20% of the population is estimated at 6.739 trillion VND ($293.67 million USD), but over 90% of this cost is funded by the COVAX Facility. The government will contribute 24 billion VND, the remaining comes from municipal and provincial governments and private sources. \c\c117,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine arrived at Tan Son Nhat international airport in Ho Chi Minh City on 24 February. On 16 March, Vietnam received 1,000 doses of Sputnik V from Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev. The first batch of vaccines sourced via Covax mechanism, containing 811,200 doses, arrived in Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport on 1 April 2021. Vietnam received the second shipment of vaccines sourced via Covax, containing nearly 1.7 million AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine doses on 16 May. Another batch of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines containing 288,000 doses arrived at Tan Son Nhat Airport on 25 May. This is the second batch under a contract for 30 million the Ministry of Health and the VNVC have struck with the company. \c\cIt expected that a total of 110 million doses would be available by the end of 2021. \c\cVietnam's COVID-19 vaccination programme began on 8 March 2021, administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to medical workers in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Hải Dương province. As of 2 June 2021, a total of 1,110,111 administered vaccination doses have been reported. \c\cOf the 69 medical staff at Gia Lai Field Hospital who administered AstraZeneca vaccine on 9 March 2021, 8 had mild side effects and one female nurse had severe side effects. Five minutes after injection, this nurse (with a history of bronchial asthma) experienced symptoms of perioral numbness, vomiting, dizziness, chest tightness and difficulty breathing. As of 17 March 2021, in 20,000 people were injected, 4,078 cases had common reactions like muscle pain, headaches, diarrhoea, fever or hives, five with anaphylaxis grade II and one grade III case, all of these case are in stable conditions. The health ministry has asked local health authorities which face serious post-injection reactions to set up a professional council to evaluate the causes. There has not been a single case of severe blood clots reported in some European nations. \c\cOn 7 May 2021, Vietnam recorded first death after administered AstraZeneca vaccine. She was a 35-year-old medical staff in An Giang Province. This female health worker was vaccinated with AstraZeneca vaccine in the morning of 6 May at the vaccination site in Tan Chau Regional General Hospital. Before the injection, she was screened and explained about post-injection reactions. \c\cAfter the injection, she had anaphylactic shock reaction. According to the conclusion of the An Giang Department of Health, the cause of death is anaphylaxis on the basis of non-steroidal allergy (anti-inflammatory painkiller). \c\cA poll conducted from October to December 2020 found that Vietnam had one of the highest vaccine acceptance rate in the world. 98% of people surveyed responded they would definitely or probably get vaccinated when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available."}
On the night of 5 June 2021, insurgents attacked Solhan village in Burkina Faso killing around 100 civilians. They also burned homes and market. Government blamed terrorists for the attack, however no group so far has claimed responsibility for this. 72-hour period of national mourning was declared by the government.
{"Bangladesh began administration of COVID-19 vaccines on 27 January 2021 while mass vaccination started on 7 February 2021. \c\cOxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was the only COVID-19 vaccine that was authorized for emergency use from January to April 2021. Bangladesh ordered vaccine produced by Serum Institute of India, however it delivered less than half of the doses as agreed with Bangladesh government. After the vaccine shortage due to this, Bangladesh  approved Russian Sputnik V and Chinese BBIBP-CorV vaccines for emergency use in late April 2021. Bangladesh has also authorized the emergency of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and to be distributed as part of COVAX. It was reported that the Bangladesh government planned to give permission to Bangladeshi made Bangavax developed by Globe Biotech Ltd. to conduct the first clinical trial that got listed in the 'Draft landscape and tracker of Covid-19 candidate vaccines' by the World Health Organization (WHO). However fate of the Bangavax is still uncertain due to an unknown reason. As of May 2021, Bangladesh has not fully approved any COVID-19 vaccine. All the four vaccines got emergency authorization only. \c\cOn 21 June 2020, China invited Bangladesh to get priority access to COVID-19 vaccine once it is developed. In July 2020, Sinovac Biotech was given approval by the Bangladesh Medical Research Council to begin a third-phase trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine (now known as CoronaVac) at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. However Bangladesh later decided to cancel the trial of the vaccine after Sinovac asked to co-fund the domestic trials, which sources said would cost roughly $7 million. \c\cOn 2 July 2020, A Bangladeshi private  pharmaceutical company Globe Biotech Limited announced to be the first company from Bangladesh to have a COVID-19 vaccine under development. The lone Bangladeshi company actually developed three COVID-19 vaccine candidates with different technologies. The company named the mRNA based vaccin as Bangavax, which was initially called Bancovid. Globe Biotech took all the necessary steps from December 2020 to January 2021 to get the permission for ethical approval to conduct the first clinical trial of Bangavax. \c\cOn 5 November 2020, a tripartite agreement was signed between the government of Bangladesh, the Serum Institute of India, and Beximco Pharma of Bangladesh. Under the agreement Bangladesh ordered 30 million doses of Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine from Serum through Beximco for $4 per shot. The Bangladesh government paid in advance for 15 million doses. \c\cHowever Serum supplied only 7 million doses from the tripartite agreement in the first two months of 2021. Bangladesh was supposed to receive 5 million doses per month  but not received shipments in March and April. As a result, rollout of vaccine has been disrupted by supply shortfalls. Bangladesh then looked for alternative vaccine sources because India did not supply the vaccines. Bangladesh suspended the first dosing of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from 26 April 2021 due to the supply crunch. \c\cThe situation becomes complicated when the second dose of 1.3 million citizens is uncertain as India halts exports. They are worried about whether they will get the second dose of Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine on right time or whether another vaccine will be given as a second dose instead. According to experts it would not be wise to inoculate one person with different brands. Health experts and opposing political party have criticized government for turning only to India for vaccine instead of multiple sources. In addition, several citizens of Bangladesh have expressed doubts about its effectiveness and safety. \c\cOn 27 April 2021, Bangladesh's drug regulator has authorized the emergency use of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. Russia has proposed to   produce their vaccine in Bangladesh with joint collaboration with a local pharmaceutical company. Bangladesh has already given policy approval in this regard. \c\cOn 29 April 2021, Bangladesh's drug regulator has authorized the emergency use of China's BBIBP-CorV. Bangladesh ordered 15 million doses of Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV and received 500,000 doses as a gift. Bangladesh health department has begun administering the vaccine to 1,000 medical students in the beginning to observe its effect and safety.  According to Mahbubur Rahman, DGDA Director General, “Mass inoculation will start after the observation period.” It is reported that Bangladesh also wants to produce this vaccine locally. It is reported that Bangladesh interested to produce Sinovac CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine too. \c\cOn 27 May 2021, Directorate General of Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. COVAX is sending 106,000 doses of Pfizer’s Covid vaccine on June 2."}
On 7 June 2021, two trains collided near Daharki, in the Ghotki District of the province of Sindh in southern Pakistan, killing at least 45 people and injuring about 100 others. An express train derailed onto the opposite track, and a second express train crashed into the first. About six to eight bogies were left "completely destroyed". \c\cOn 7 June 2021, before dawn, the Millat Express, departing from Karachi for Sargodha, derailed onto the opposite track near Daharki, in the Ghotki District of the province of Sindh in southern Pakistan, between the Raiti and Obaro train stations, whilst most of its passengers were sleeping.  Barely more than a minute later and travelling in the opposite direction, the Sir Syed Express, which had left Rawalpindi bound for Karachi, crashed into the derailed train.  Roughly 1,100 people had been aboard the two trains.  A spokesperson for Pakistan Railways said that the Sir Syed Express had no time to avoid crashing into the derailed train. \c\cGhotki deputy commissioner Usman Abdullah stated that 13 or 14 bogies had derailed due to the accident, and 6 to 8 of them had been "completely destroyed". \c\cThe collision killed at least 45 people and injured about 100 more.  Umar Tufail, head of the Ghotki district police, stated that up to 25 people remained trapped in the wreckage. \c\cPrime Minister Imran Khan stated that he was "shocked by the horrific train accident" and ordered an investigation. Federal Minister for Railways Azam Khan Swati stated that a "high-level inquiry" has been ordered to determine how the collision occurred, adding that it was unclear if the accident was a result of sabotage or the track's poor quality.
The Australian government has a policy and practice of detaining in immigration detention facilities non-citizens not holding a valid visa, suspected of visa violations, illegal entry or unauthorised arrival, and those subject to deportation and removal in immigration detention until a decision is made by the immigration authorities to grant a visa and release them into the community, or to repatriate them to their country of origin/passport. Persons in immigration detention may at any time opt to voluntarily leave Australia for their country of origin, or they may be deported or given a bridging or temporary visa. \c\cIn 1992, Australia adopted a mandatory detention policy obliging the government to detain all persons entering or being in the country without a valid visa, while their claim to remain in Australia is processed and security and health checks undertaken. Also, at the same time, the law was changed to permit indefinite detention, from the previous limit of 273 days. The policy was instituted by the Keating Government in 1992, and has been varied by the subsequent Howard, Rudd, Gillard, Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison Governments. The policy is regarded as controversial and has been criticised by a number of organisations. The High Court of Australia has confirmed, by majority, the constitutionality of indefinite mandatory detention of non-citizens. \c\cMandatory detention rules also apply to persons whose visa has been cancelled by the Minister, for example on character grounds, allowing such persons to be detained in immigration detention and deported, some after living in Australia for a long period. Furthermore, if a person has Australian citizenship and another citizenship, his Australian citizenship can be revoked. \c\cThere is no maximum time limit for detaining a person in Australia under immigration laws. The length of immigrant detention has steadily increased in the past decade, and as of May 2020, the average period of time for people held in detention facilities was 553 days. The Australian Department of Home Affairs provides updated monthly detention statistics. \c\cIn some cases, people have been held in detention for over 10 years, such as Ghader, an Ahwazi man from Iran who has been detained since 2010, and Said Imasi, a stateless man born in Western Sahara. Ghader has a daughter, born in 2015, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. In February 2019, Imasi made a legal challenge to the High Court of Australia, attempting to overturn the landmark Al Kateb v Godwin decision. \c\cIn June 2019 it was revealed that a Tamil man from Sri Lanka had been held in detention for 9 years. The man, who was blind, as well as mentally and physically disabled, was being held in Villawood Detention Centre at the time of publishing. In 2002-2003 the man was captured by the Sri Lankan Army and tortured, after which he fled the country. He was recognised as a refugee by Australia, but received an adverse security assessment from ASIO. \c\cMandatory detention of asylum seekers (technically, "unlawful arrivals") in Australia was established by the Keating Government by the Migration Reform Act 1992 which came into operation on 1 September 1994. It was originally intended as an interim measure. Controls on unauthorised arrivals were tightened under the subsequent Howard Government, including under the Pacific Solution policy, contributing to a sharp decline in boat arrivals and, consequently, to numbers of people being detained. The Pacific Solution was dismantled by the Rudd Government and partially restored under the Gillard Government in response to increased boat arrivals and reported deaths at sea. \c\cMandatory detention was introduced to "support the integrity of Australia's immigration program" and "management of Australian borders" and to distinguish between those who have submitted themselves to offshore entry processes prior to arrival and those who have not. Under the policy, asylum seekers are mandatorily detained while they "undergo an assessment process, including security and health checking, to establish if they have a legitimate reason for staying in Australia". \c\cBefore 1992, the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989 had created a regime of administrative detention of unlawful boat arrivals. Although officers were obligated to arrest and detain anyone suspected of being an ‘illegal entrant’, detention was discretionary. Between November 1989 and January 1994, there was a "second wave" of unauthorised boat arrivals comprising eighteen boats carrying 735 people (predominantly Cambodian nationals). \c\cBy June 1992  there were 478 people in immigration detention of whom 421 were boat arrivals (including 306 Cambodians), compared to five in immigration detention in January 1985. The Keating Government's interim measures in 1992 were contained in the Migration Amendment Act 1992, which set up a regime of mandatory detention, with bipartisan support. Immigration Minister Gerry Hand told Parliament in his Second Reading Speech:\c\cThe Migration Amendment Act 1992 did impose a 273-day limit on detention, but specifically disallowed judicial review. The final scheme was contained in the Migration Reform Act 1992, which came into operation on 1 September 1994, which broadened the application of mandatory detention to all who did not hold a valid visa, and removed the 273-day detention limit. The Act also introduced detention charges (detention debts) whereby an unlawful non-citizen was liable for the costs of his or her immigration detention. \c\cNon-citizens in Australia without a valid visa were to be considered unlawful and would have to be held in detention, though those who met certain criteria and were not considered flight or security risks could secure lawful status by means of a bridging visa – but bridging visas would not be made available to those who arrived in Australia without visas in the first place (such as boat arrivals). The government argued that this distinction was justifiable because visa overstayers had already submitted themselves to proper entry processing offshore and were therefore in a different category to those who had not and that boat arrivals had demonstrated a high likelihood of absconding where detention was not in place. \c\cThe Liberal-National Party Coalition led by John Howard defeated the Keating Government in the 1996 federal election. In 1999 the Howard Government created the temporary protection visa category for asylum seekers whose claims for refugee status had been accepted. These visas were granted only to unauthorised arrivals and were criticised because they left the refugee in limbo indefinitely. These people did not have rights to work, to family reunion, a right to return to Australia if they left, and their status was to be reviewed every three years. \c\cAustralia's immigration policies towards asylum seekers were a significant issue in the 2001 federal election. Howard said in a campaign policy speech:\c\cThe Tampa affair arose during the election campaign. Following the election, the Howard Government made significant changes to Australia's immigration policy. It put in place a policy known as the Pacific Solution, which was enacted via an amendment to the Migration Act 1958, the  Migration Legislation Amendment (Excision from the Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001 reinforced the practice of mandatory detention, providing for the indefinite detention of asylum seekers. The policy was implemented by then Australian Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock. Under this policy, many islands were excised from the Australian migration zone, and asylum seekers were removed to third countries to determine their refugee status, namely at detention camps on small island nations in the Pacific Ocean. Also, a policy of turning back boats where possible was instigated. Howard's policies were often controversial, were criticised by some human rights groups and were the subject of protest both within and without detention centres. Through the final years of the Howard Government, Australia's detention facilities were near empty, few boat voyages were being attempted and the practice of detention of children had been ended. \c\cAlso in 2001, the Border Protection Bill provided the government with the power to remove any ship in the territorial waters of Australia, use reasonable force to do so, provide that any person who was on the ship be forcibly returned to the ship, and guaranteed that no asylum applications may be made by people on board the ship. \c\cMandatory detention of asylum seekers was popular with sections of the Australian electorate. Some commentators argue that it helped Howard win the 2001 federal election. While the Australian Labor Party supported the policy as Opposition, in June 2005 a small backbench revolt in Howard's party led by Petro Georgiou and Judi Moylan resulted in some concessions to humanitarian concerns, including the promised release of long-term detainees and review of future cases by an ombudsman. \c\cMany of those detained in Australia's detention centres between 1999–2006 have been asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan who sought protection or asylum under Australia's obligations to the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. More than 80 percent of these were found to be refugees by the Immigration Department, with some decisions taking more than 8 months. Few asylum seekers were able to be repatriated. \c\cOn 6 August 2004, the High Court of Australia handed down its decision in the case of Behrooz v Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and held that the harsh conditions of detention did not render the detention unlawful. On the same day, the High Court also handed down its decision in Al-Kateb v Godwin which held that unsuccessful asylum seekers who could not be removed to another country, despite their wish to leave Australia, could continue to be held in immigration detention indefinitely. \c\cDr Sev Ozdowski OAM Human Rights Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) held an inquiry into mandatory detention of children who arrived without a valid visa over the period 1999–2002 (with updates where possible – the report was completed in April 2004) . The vast majority of children arrived and were put into mandatory detention facilities with their families for indefinite periods of time with no real opportunity to argue their case before independent tribunal or court.  The inquiry found that between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2003, 2184 children were detained after arriving in Australia seeking asylum without a visa. Approximately 14% of those children came to Australia alone (unaccompanied children). Most of them came from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. Almost 98 percent of the Iraqi children were recognised as refugees;\c\cThe inquiry found that children detained for long periods of time were at a high risk of suffering mental illness. Mental health professionals had repeatedly recommended that children and their parents be removed from immigration detention. The inquiry found that the Australian government's refusal to implement these recommendations amounted to "..cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment of those children in detention". \c\cThe inquiry also found that many basic rights outlined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child were denied to children living in immigration detention. \c\cThe key recommendations of the Inquiry were that children with their parents be released immediately into the community and that detention laws should be amended to comply with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Howard government released the children and introduced limited changes to Migration Act 1958 as a result of the report. \c\cIn October 2001, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Australian Prime Minister John Howard regarding new legislation, the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001. The new act further strengthened the practice of mandatory detention, allowing for indefinite detention of unauthorised arrivals. The letter said:\c\cThe system of mandatory detention has been the subject of controversy. Opposition to the system on humanitarian grounds came from a range of religious, community and political groups including the National Council of Churches, Amnesty International, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens and Rural Australians for Refugees. Among the intellectual opponents of the system has been Professor Robert Manne, whose Quarterly Essay "Sending Them Home: Refugees and the New Politics of Indifference" (2004) called for an end to both mandatory detention and the temporary protection visa system on humanitarian grounds. \c\cThroughout the controversy, Prime Minister John Howard and successive immigration ministers maintained that their actions were justified in the interests of protecting Australia's borders and ensuring that immigration law was enforced. A 2004 Liberal Party election policy document stated:\c\cFor the final few years of the Howard Government, Indonesian boats carrying asylum seekers to Australia had virtually ceased and Australia's offshore detention centres were near empty. The newly elected Rudd Government, under Immigration Minister Chris Evans, announced a series of measures aimed at achieving what it described as a more "compassionate policy". The Pacific Solution had involved offshore processing, a system of "temporary protection visas" for unauthorised arrivals, and a policy of turning back boats where possible. The Rudd Government dismantled all three components, dubbing them "ineffectual and wasteful". Throughout 2009–2010, a flow of boat arrivals re-emerged. \c\cIn July 2008, the Australian government announced it was ending its policy of automatic detention for asylum seekers who arrive in the country without visas. While it remained committed to the policy of mandatory detention as an "essential component of strong border control", the Rudd Government announced that detention would now be restricted to unlawful non-citizens who pose a threat to the community, those who refuse to comply with visa conditions, or those who need to be detained for the period of conducting health, identity and security checks. By 29 June 2011, the Australian Government had delivered on its commitment to move the majority of children in immigration detention into community–based arrangements. \c\cThe Government announced that aspects of the original detention system in Australia would remain, but asylum seekers will be released more quickly. They would only be detained for lengthier time periods if they are deemed to pose a risk to the wider community or have repeatedly breached their visa conditions. "Boat people" in excised areas will still be subject to mandatory detention and processed offshore, but the Government will move to hasten the process. Boat people will also be able to access legal advice and apply for an independent review of adverse decisions. Each detainee's circumstances and justification for ongoing detention will be scrutinised by the Immigration Ombudsman every six months. A Migration Amendment (Immigration Detention Reform) Bill 2009 to make these amendments, was introduced but lapsed without being passed. \c\cThe Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Act 2009 was passed by the Australian House of Representatives with several Liberal MPs threatening to \'cross the floor\' and vote with Labor, and then passed into law on 8 September when the Senate passed the bill with the support of Senator Nick Xenophon, the Australian Greens, Liberal Senator Judith Troeth and at the last minute Steve Fielding. This act abolished the Keating-era policy whereby the government attempted to reclaim the costs of immigration detention from the detainee upon release. \c\cImmigration Department figures in October 2009 showed no improvement in the speed of processing claims since the change of government. As a proportion of the immigration intake, Australia accepted fewer refugees in 2009 than it did at any time under the Howard government. \c\cIn October 2009, the MV Oceanic Viking was involved in an emergency operation rescuing 78 Sri Lankan asylum seekers in international waters within the Indonesian sea rescue zone. Those rescued were due to be landed in Indonesia, for transfer to an Australia-funded immigration detention centre on the Indonesian island of Bintan. However, the asylum seekers refused to disembark until 18 November, following assurances of fast-tracked processing of their cases for resettlement. \c\cAs of 29 March 2010, 100 asylum seeker boats had been intercepted within Australian waters during the life of the Rudd government. \c\cOn 9 April 2010, former Minister for Immigration Senator Chris Evans announced that, with immediate effect, no new applications for people from Afghanistan would be processed for six months; and for Sri Lankans, three months. Senator Evans was quoted as saying that this change would result in a higher rate of refusal of claims based on circumstances in these countries. \c\cFollowing a complaint lodged in 2011 regarding the resulting indefinite detention, in 2013 the United Nations Human Rights Committee found Australia guilty of 138 counts of illegal detention, lack of judicial remedy, or inhumane or degrading treatment. \c\cThe Gillard Government undertook a series of adjustments to Australia's system of mandatory detention amid a growing stream of unauthorised boat arrivals. Julia Gillard and immigration minister Chris Bowen mooted various regional options for asylum seeker processing – notably East Timor and Malaysia – before reverting to Nauru and Manus Island in late 2012. \c\cOn 18 October 2010, Julia Gillard announced that changes would be made to Australia's mandatory detention policy, and that more children and families would be moved out of immigration detention centres into community-based accommodation, such as centres run by churches and charities. \c\cTo accommodate the reduction in detainees, the federal government announced that they would open two new detention facilities – a centre in Northam, 80 kilometres north-east of Perth, and an alternative place of detention in Inverbrackie, 37 kilometres north of Adelaide. Northam will house up to 1,500 single men and Inverbrackie will house up to 400 family members. \c\cIn a press conference, Prime Minister Gillard told media "when we came to government we issued detention values about not having children in high security, behind razor wire, and obviously we have worked to deliver on those detention values." She went on to say, "obviously we want to see kids in school. I understand that in some particular cases the minister will work through this case by case, there may be some reasons why this may not always be possible, but in the ordinary course of things I want to see kids getting a good education."\c\cAccording to the Immigration Department, as of February 2011, there are currently 5,061 men, 571 women and 1,027 children under 18 living in detention. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that 382 of those under 18 arrived without their parents. \c\cDepartment of Immigration and Citizenship statistics reflect that there were 4,783 people in immigration detention facilities and alternative places of detention, including 3,951 in immigration detention on the mainland and 832 in immigration detention on Christmas Island as at 31 January 2012.[citation needed]  The number of people in immigration detention who arrived unlawfully by air or boat as at 31 January 2012 was 6,031, representing about 94 per cent of the total immigration detention population. There were also 344 people (about five per cent of the total immigration population) who arrived in Australia lawfully and were subsequently taken into immigration detention for either overstaying their visa conditions, resulting in visa cancellation.[citation needed]\c\cFollowing an extended period of increasing boat arrivals and deaths at sea, in May 2011 Gillard announced that Australia and Malaysia were "finalising" an arrangement to exchange asylum seekers for processed refugees (the plan was dubbed the "Malaysia Solution").  On 31 August the High Court ruled that the agreement to transfer refugees from Australia to Malaysia was invalid, and ordered that it not proceed on the basis that it contravened human rights protections established under existing laws. The Government was unable to secure the support of the Greens or Opposition in the Senate for modifications to enable the Malaysia Solution to proceed and instead reverted to expanding onshore processing arrangements. Continued deaths at sea and ongoing boat arrivals kept the issue at the fore of policy debate during the term of the Gillard Government, leading to a major Parliamentary debate on the issue in June 2012, as news reports reached Canberra of another fatal sinking off Christmas Island. The government sought changes to the Migration Act, to allow asylum seekers to be processed in Malaysia. The Greens opposed the Bill outright and called for greater opening up of Australia's borders. The Opposition opposed the Bill on human rights grounds and called for restoration of the Howard Government's policies. The government allowed the possibility of returning processing to Nauru, on the condition that Malaysia was also permitted. \c\cUnable to secure passage of the Bill through Parliament following the emotional debate, the government convened a panel chaired by Angus Houston to consider options. The Houston Report found that "onshore processing encourages people to jump into boats" and called for the re-opening of offshore processing at Nauru and Manus Island. Gillard endorsed the plan in August 2012. \c\cOn 19 July 2013 in a joint press conference with PNG Prime Minister Peter O\'Neill and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd detailed the Regional Resettlement Arrangement (RRA) between Australia and Papua New Guinea:\c\c"From now on, any asylum seeker who arrives in Australia by boat will have no chance of being settled in Australia as refugees. Asylum seekers taken to Christmas Island will be sent to Manus and elsewhere in Papua New Guinea for assessment of their refugee status. If they are found to be genuine refugees they will be resettled in Papua New Guinea... If they are found not to be genuine refugees they may be repatriated to their country of origin or be sent to a safe third country other than Australia. These arrangements are contained within the Regional Resettlement Arrangement signed by myself and the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea just now."\c\cThe actions taken by the Rudd government from July 2013 were the primary cause for the major reduction seen in boat arrivals over the 2013 – 2014 period, according to research conducted by former Immigration Department chief John Menadue and Australian National University migration expert Peter Hughes. \c\cDuring the 2013 federal election the Coalition parties led by Tony Abbott strongly campaigned on a "stop the boats" slogan. Following the election the newly elected Abbott Government toughened policies to stop asylum seekers arriving by boat and launched Operation Sovereign Borders. A feature of the new government's policy was the total secrecy of the operations and treatment of persons intercepted at sea and those in immigration detention in general. The immigration minister stated that no immigrant who arrives in Australia by boat will be granted a visa, regardless of the legitimacy or otherwise of their claim. The Abbott Government's policy was apparently successful because no IMAs[clarification needed] have arrived in Australia since July 2014. The Abbot government also claimed responsibility for the overall decrease in boat arrivals during 2013 – 2014, however this was primarily due to policy enacted by the 2nd Rudd Government (2013) shortly before the Abbott Government took power in the 2013 Australian federal election. While this claim was incorrect, it was easy to effectively communicate as boat arrivals did decrease around the time of the Abbott Government taking power. \c\cIn addition, the Abbott Government has been more prepared to cancel visas on character grounds for people who have been lawfully present in Australia for some time, bringing them within the scope of the mandatory detention rules. Also, the Abbott Government has passed legislation to strip Australian citizenship of dual nationals in some circumstances, rendering such persons non-citizens and subject to immigration detention for not holding a valid visa, and deportation. \c\cIn 2014, the Human Rights Commission published a report, The Forgotten Children, into children in Australian detention, both onshore and on Christmas Island, for the period January 2013 to September 2014 — covering the period of Labor and Coalition governments. The report was limited because the HRC was barred from visiting and inquiring as to the condition of children in offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru. The report was damning of the treatment of children in immigration detention, at least in Australian territories. \c\cIn January 2015, the first refugees were moved out of Manus Island Regional Processing Center to a new detention center near Lorengau on Manus Island, in the midst of a hunger strike. \c\cThe condition of detainees in Nauru was reported in the Moss Review. The final report was produced 6 February 2015, and released on 20 March 2015. \c\cOn 30 November 2015 there were 3,906 people in Australia's immigration detention, including people in immigration detention facilities in Australia and in Australian-run facilities in other countries. 585 of these were in community detention (a form of detention separate from actual immigration detention facilities) in Australia proper. 70 were children in offshore immigration detention facilities, such as Nauru. \c\cThe time asylum seekers spent in Australian detention centres as stated by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection show that in December 2015 people in onshore immigration detention had been there for an average 445 days. The average detention period has increased since May 2014. There were 1792 people in onshore detention, including 91 children, and most were from Iran, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, China, Vietnam and Afghanistan. \c\cOn 26 April 2016, the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled that detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island was breaching their constitutional right to freedom and thus illegal, and ordered the Australian-run detention centre to close. However, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton iterated that the 850 asylum seekers were the responsibility of Papua New Guinea and would not come to Australia. \c\cIn September 2017, the Department of Immigration awarded a $423 million contract to Paladin Group, a little-known private military contractor, to manage the new centers at Lorengau. The closed-tender process of awarding of the contract, as well as Paladin's past record, attracted widespread criticism and controversy. \c\cIn November 2017, the last refugees in the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre were forcibly removed to West Lorengau Haus, Hillside Haus and East Lorengau Refugee Transit Center in Lorengau. Doctors Without Borders was denied access to asylum seekers and refugees. \c\cOn 20 December 2017 Peter Dutton was appointed Minister for Home Affairs, in charge of the newly-created Department of Home Affairs, to be responsible for national security, law enforcement, emergency management, transport security, border control, and immigration functions. \c\cMorrison, with Dutton still in place as Minister for Home Affairs, continued the policies of the previous Coalition governments towards asylum seekers, although they did promise to ensure that all children would be off Nauru by the end of 2018. \c\cOn 12 February 2019, the Morrison government suffered the first substantive defeat on the floor of the House of Representatives since 1929, after the Labor Party and several cross-benchers supported amendments to the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018 (the Home Affairs Bill) proposed by the Senate. The proposed amendments would give greater weight to medical opinion in allowing the medical evacuation of asylum seekers to Australia from Nauru (in the Nauru Regional Processing Centre) and Manus Island (in the Manus Regional Processing Centre). Further amendments followed negotiations between the Opposition and the House of Reps cross-bench members, before the Senate considered and agreed to the amendments to its original amendments on the following day, 13 February. The proposed amendments would affect three laws, being the Migration Act 1958, the Customs Act 1901 and the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978. The amended legislation, which had become known as "the Medevac Bill", passed in the House by 75 votes to 74 and passed in the Senate by 36 votes to 34, being passed as the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Act 2019. \c\cThe approval of two doctors is required, but approval may still be overridden by the home affairs minister in one of three areas. Human rights advocates hailed the decision, with one calling it a “tipping point as a country”, with the weight of public opinion believing that sick people need treatment. \c\cIn response to the bill passing into law, Scott Morrison announced the re-opening of the Christmas Island detention centre, intimating that this change in the law would provide the signal that people smugglers to begin operating again. In the days following, Dutton said that because of this change in the law, Australians on waiting lists for hospital treatment and those already in public housing were going to be adversely affected. \c\cThis was seen by Robert Manne as a turning point in Labor Party policy, after having had almost identical asylum seeker policies as the Coalition for the past five years. He also points out the numerous obstacles any potential people smuggler or asylum seeker would have to face, because the deterrent aspects of the policy are still firmly in place, and the new legislation applies only to the approximately 1000 people still on Nauru and Manus (of whom only a relatively small number will be allowed to access the urgent medical attention they need). \c\cHowever, the 2018 ruling was overturned in December 2019, after 37 votes to 35 supported the government's move to repeal the law. \c\cIn August 2019, PNG’s immigration department transferred more than 50 men deemed to be non-refugees to the Bomana Immigration Centre, a detention centre next to the Bomana Prison in Port Moresby. Boochani reported that some men had been approved for a Medevac transfer, and were most likely being targeted. PNG officials said that they continued to encourage non-refugees to depart voluntarily. About 100 men are unable to be deported because their country of citizenship refuses to accept involuntary returns. Ian Rintoul said that many of those being detained are being deemed not to be refugees even though they have never had a refugee determination in PNG. \c\cRecent global developments highlight the growing polarisation of the Australian public in relation to their government's policies. From late 2009, the increase in arrivals by boat fuelled a divide in public perception of people seeking asylum between sympathy and apathy. Following election victory by the Liberal/National coalition in 2013, the government mandatory detention policy has been widely criticised. \c\cThe Refugee Council viewed the immigration detention program as detrimental to Australia's interests in three ways: the people subjected to the detention programs endure inhumane conditions; those working in the detention centres often subjected to emotionally jarring situations; and Australia's reputation as a fair and just nation has been eroded. Timing is also of concern, with many refugees and asylum seekers reporting being detained for several years before receiving status determination from the government. The government often cites deterrence to frame the context in which their policies operate. \c\cWhile the immigration detention program draws some support from the Australian public, the program's treatment of children in detention has been widely criticised. There has been great concern about the adverse impact detention centres have on the health, well-being and development of children. Particularly worrying was the use of detention centres previously used for adults to house children. Wickman Point, one such Alternative Place of Detention (APOD) was previously deemed only suitable for adults, with reports that children had been brought in to live concurrently with the adult population. \c\cRe-detention occurs when those being detained by the immigration program are released on Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) while their refugee status is being determined, or who have succeeded in obtaining refugee status and subsequently re-detained for often minor violations, sometimes with lack of access to legal advice. Unaccompanied children have been removed from care in the community and re-detained in closed communities. \c\cOn 13 June, the Andrew & Renata Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law at the University of New South Wales published a paper citing seven principles which should be key to Australia's refugee policy, supported by law and evidence-based research. Professor Jane McAdam, director of the Centre, said that  in the last 25 years, policy has changed direction, and that offshore processing, boat turnbacks and mandatory detention "not only deny the humanity to people that applied and deflect problems elsewhere, but also violate many of our obligations under international law”. \c\cFrom 2000–2018 there have been dozens of deaths in Australia's immigration detention facilities, as many as 20 of those were suicide. In one case, a man died after publicly setting himself on fire in Nauru Regional Processing Centre to protest how he was being treated. Several more people have committed suicide after release, due to mental health issues connected with their being detained. \c\cIn February 2005, it was revealed that a mentally ill German citizen holding Australian permanent residency, Cornelia Rau, had been held in immigration detention as an unauthorised immigrant for 11 months, after identifying herself as a backpacker from Munich under the name of Anna Brotmeyer. \c\cAn audit in May 2005 revealed 33 cases of people wrongfully detained under the Migration Act 1958. This included the case of a woman, Australian citizen Vivian Alvarez Solon, who was forcibly deported to the Philippines and who subsequently went missing. As of May, it was not known how many actually spent time in an immigration detention facility. By late May, Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone announced that more than 200 cases of possible wrongful immigration detention had been referred to the Palmer Inquiry. In October 2005, the Commonwealth Ombudsman revealed that more than half of those cases were held for a week or less and 23 people were held for more than a year and two of them were detained for more than five years. Australia's longest-serving detainee in immigration detention was at the time, Peter Qasim who was detained for almost 7 years before being released in 2005 on a bridging visa.[citation needed] However there has since been prisoners held for longer. \c\cIn 2006, the federal government made a $400,000 compensation payout to an 11-year-old Iranian boy, Shayan Badraie, for the psychological harm he suffered while being detained in Woomera and Villawood detention centres between 2000 and 2002.
The Ardea shooting was a mass shooting incident carried out on June 13, 2021, in Ardea, Rome, Italy. 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Fiji is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in Fiji was reported on 19 March 2020 in Lautoka. As of 13 June 2021[update], the country has had a total of 1,118 cases as of which 796 are currently active and 4 deaths, with all cases recorded in the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. In March 2021 Fiji became the first Pacific island country to receive the COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX initiative with frontline workers and first responders the first to be vaccinated. Out of the target population of 587,651, more than 220,000 Fijians have received their first jab of the AstraZeneca vaccine. \c\cIn the early stages of the pandemic, Fiji imposed travel bans on highly affected countries. As the pandemic worsen, Fiji closed all borders and ports to non residents. Ports were closed on 16 March 2020 and the main international airport in Nadi was closed on 26 March 2020. Returning citizens were required to self isolate at a government funded facility for 14 days, supervised by Health Officials and the Military. Domestically, the government responded by imposing a national curfew, restricting large gatherings and closing down schools and non essential services. The government imposed lockdowns in the two largest cities of Lautoka and Suva and developed a contact tracing app named careFIJI. The government established a Centre for Disease Control for COVID-19 testing and built fever clinics nationwide for temperature checks. Such measures has helped eliminate local transmissions of the virus for more than a year. \c\cFrom July 2020 to April 2021, Fiji has only recorded cases from managed quarantine facilities at the border as repatriation flights brought stranded citizens back home. This has allowed the country to relax its COVID-19 restrictions to boost its economic recovery however on 19 April 2021, Fiji confirmed its first community case as a result of a breach in protocol. In response, the township of Nadi and the city of Lautoka went into a lockdown and previous health restrictions were re-imposed all over the country with the national curfew revised. As local transmission cases soared exacerbated by the B1617 variant, the Government sealed off Viti Levu establishing Suva, Lautoka, Nadi, Nausori, Rakiraki and Lami as containment areas and activating the Fiji Emergency Medical Assistance Team (FEMAT). The virus penetrated prominent hospitals of Fiji including the headquarters of the Ministry of Health which prompted senior health officials to go into self isolation. High number of cases were recorded from the Western and Central division with the highest number of cases being from the containment of Suva, Nausori and Lami alone. Fiji also confirmed two deaths from a locally transmitted case of the virus. \c\cThe pandemic forced Fiji to reduce its interest rate. The country's economy is expected to contract after decades of economic growth due to the pandemic's impact on tourism, retail, manufacturing and trade. The International Labour Organisation and the Asian Development Bank issued reports about workers being affected and warned about the rising youth unemployment rate and child labour. The impacts has also prompted residents to leave the country for short term employment overseas. There were even reported incidents of racism and xenophobia against Chinese people or to those perceived as such. Misinformation and conspiracy theories surfaced about the COVID-19 vaccines, the origin of the virus and the government's response to the pandemic. Domestic violence and assault cases against women also increased as a result of lockdowns. \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cCompared to SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19  has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cOn 3 February, the Government of Fiji toughened border security. Borders were closed to foreign nationals who have been in mainland China within 14 days of their intended travel to Fiji. Measures to maintain a hygienic environment and screening ill passengers will continue to be taken in-flight to further minimise any risk. \c\cOn 27 February, Fiji extended its travel ban and announced that travellers from Italy, Iran and the South Korean cities of Daegu and Cheongdo would be denied entry. From 28 February, all cruise ships entering Fiji have been required to make first berths at ports in Suva and Lautoka, where passengers undergo medical and travel history checks. \c\cOn 15 March, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama had announced that from 16 March cruise ships will be banned from berthing anywhere in Fiji and international events will not be allowed in Fiji. Government ministers and staff will be restricted from travelling overseas. \c\cOn 19 March, Fiji confirmed its first case, a 27 year old Fijian citizen and flight attendant of Fiji Airways. He had arrived from San Francisco returning via Nadi on 16 March. On 17 March, he had travelled from Nadi to Auckland and a return from Auckland to Nadi on the same day. He was admitted to Lautoka Hospital. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced a further extension of the ban to foreign nationals who had been present in the United States, as well as all of Europe including the United Kingdom. Also all travellers arriving in or returning to Fiji from outside of the country had to self-isolate for 14 days. \c\cOn 20 March, all schools and non-essential businesses in Lautoka had been closed at midnight, however banks, supermarkets, pharmacies and essential businesses remained open. The Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts Rosy Akbar in consultation with the Prime Minister announced that the national term one school holidays that were initially scheduled from 20 April to 1 May would be brought forward, to 23 March to 3 April. Fiji Airways suspended all international flights until the end of May, with the exception of twice-weekly services between Singapore and Nadi. The government established two fever clinics in Lautoka. \c\cOn 21 March, Fiji confirmed its second case and the first local transmission case through household contact. She is the mother of the first patient and was admitted in Nadi Hospital. Other family members remained in quarantine and being monitored. \c\cOn 23 March, Fiji confirmed its third case, a one-year-old nephew of the first patient. The government established eight fever clinics around the country with six clinics running in Nasinu, Labasa, Savusavu, and Nabouwalu. Two others had been running in Lautoka since 20 March. \c\cOn 24 March, Fiji confirmed its fourth case, a 28-year-old Fijian citizen, who had returned from Sydney over the weekend and was not related to the first three cases. He and his immediate family members were in quarantine and being monitored at the Navua Hospital.  Fiji Airways had suspended all Singapore and Hong Kong flights after the two countries introduced border restrictions. \c\cOn 25 March, Fiji confirmed its fifth case, a 31-year-old female from Lautoka. She was in contact with the first case, the flight attendant. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced that Nadi International Airport would shut down from 26 March and all local shipping services would cease from 29 March. \c\cOn 26 March, Attorney General and Minister for Economy Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum revealed the COVID-19 response budget. \c\cOn 27 March, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced a nationwide curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. that would take effect on 30 March. \c\cOn 30 March, Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts Rosy Akbar announced that the school holidays would be extended for another two weeks until 17 April. \c\cOn 1 April, Minister for Health and Medical Services Ifereimi Waqainabete announced that the Lautoka lock down will be extended till 7 April to ensure that no COVID-19 cases left undetected. \c\cOn 2 April, Fiji confirmed two cases, a couple from Suva.

The COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Taskforce (CRMT) announced that all inbound passenger flights to Fiji scheduled between 24 December and 28 December have been ceased. This is in response of the discovery of a new variant of the novel coronavirus, Variant of Concern 202012/01 in the United Kingdom which appears to be more contagious than previous variants. Thus, the Ministry of Health used that time to conduct an extensive review of its border quarantine processes. \c\cOn 29 December, Fiji confirmed three COVID-19 cases.

The Philippine drug war is the anti-drug policy and actions of the Philippine government under President Rodrigo Duterte, who assumed office on June 30, 2016. According to former Philippine National Police Chief and future senator Ronald dela Rosa, the policy is aimed at "the neutralization of illegal drug personalities nationwide". \c\cDuterte has urged members of the public to kill criminals and drug addicts. Research by media organizations and human rights groups has shown that police routinely execute unarmed drug suspects and then plant guns and drugs as evidence. Philippine authorities have denied misconduct by police. \c\cOwing to its geographical location, international drug syndicates use the Philippines as a transit hub for the illegal drug trade. Some local drug syndicates and gangs are also involved in narcotics, utilizing drug mules to transport small amounts of illegal drugs to other countries. In the 90s, the Philippines became a temporary theatre of the U.S.-led War on Drugs; at one point the Drug Enforcement Administration even conducted their own operations in the country. The new millennium saw a boom in the illegal drug industry. In 2010 alone, a U.S. International Narcotics Control Strategy report estimated the illegal drug trade in the Philippines at $6.4 to $8.4 billion annually. \c\cThis perceived growth of illegal drugs in the Philippines led to the nomination of Rodrigo Duterte in the 2016 presidential election, owing to his time as mayor in Davao City which was considered as the 9th "safest city in the world". Duterte would win the 2016 Philippine presidential election promising to kill tens of thousands of criminals, with a platform urging people to kill drug addicts. Duterte has benefited from reports in the national media that he made Davao into one of the world's safest cities, which he cites as justification for his drug policy, although national police data shows that the city has the highest murder rate and the second highest rape rate in the Philippines. \c\cAs Mayor of Davao City, Duterte was criticized by such groups as Human Rights Watch for the extrajudicial killings of hundreds of street children, petty criminals and drug users carried out by the Davao Death Squad, a vigilante group with which he was allegedly involved. Duterte has alternately confirmed and denied his involvement in the alleged Davao Death Squad killings. Cases of extrajudicial killings have long since been a problem in the Philippines even before the Duterte administration. In a research report for The Asia Foundation conducted by Atty. Al A. Parreno on the grim tradition of police executions, there were a total of 305 incidents of extrajudicial killings with 390 victims from 2001 to 2010, with only a total of 161 cases or 56% of the incidents have been filed with the prosecutor. Atty. Parreno also concluded that the number of cases could be higher. \c\cPhilippine anti-narcotic officials have admitted that Duterte uses flawed and exaggerated data to support his claim that the Philippines is becoming a "narco-state". The Philippines has a low prevalence rate of drug users compared to the global average, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. In his inaugural State of the Nation Address, Duterte claimed that data from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency shows that there were 3 million drug addicts two to three years ago, which he said may have increased to 3.7 million. However, according to the Philippine Dangerous Drugs Board, the government drug policy-making body, 1.8 million Filipinos used illegal drugs (mostly cannabis) in 2015, the latest official survey published, a third of whom had used illegal drugs only once in the past 13 months. \c\cEstimates of the death toll vary. Officially, 5,100 drug personalities have been killed as of January 2019. News organizations and human rights groups claim the death toll is over 12,000. The victims included 54 children in the first year. Opposition senators claimed in 2018 that over 20,000 have been killed. In February 2018, the International Criminal Court in The Hague announced a "preliminary examination" into killings linked to the Philippine drug war since at least July 1, 2016. \c\cBased on data from the PNP and PDEA from June 2016 to July 2019, 134,583 anti-drug operations were conducted, 193,086 people were arrested, and 5,526 suspects died during police operations. ₱34.75 billion worth of drugs were seized. 421,275 people surrendered under the PNP's Recovery and Wellness Program (219,979 PNP-initiated, 201,296 community center-supported), and 499 Reformation Centers established. On the law enforcement side, 86 personnel were killed during the drug war with 226 wounded since 2018. According to General Oscar Albayalde and the PNP, since 2019, 50 of these casualties killed and 144 others who were injured were police. \c\cIn speeches made after his inauguration on June 30 of 2016, Duterte urged citizens to kill suspected criminals and drug addicts. He said he would order police to adopt a shoot-to-kill policy, and would offer them a bounty for dead suspects. In a speech to military leadership on July 1, Duterte told Communist rebels to "use your kangaroo courts to kill them to speed up the solution to our problem". On July 2, the Communist Party of the Philippines stated that it "reiterates its standing order for the NPA to carry out operations to disarm and arrest the chieftains of the biggest drug syndicates, as well as other criminal syndicates involved in human rights violations and destruction of the environment" after its political wing Bagong Alyansang Makabayan accepted Cabinet posts in the new government. On July 3, the Philippine National Police announced they had killed 30 alleged drug dealers since Duterte was sworn in as president on June 30. They later stated they had killed 103 suspects between May 10 and July 7. On July 9, a spokesperson of the president told critics to show proof that there have been human rights violations in the drug war. Later that day, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front announced it was open to collaborate with police in the drug war. On August 3, Duterte said that the Sinaloa cartel and the Chinese triad are involved in the Philippine drug trade. On August 7, Duterte named more than 150 drug suspects including local politicians, police, judges, and military. On August 8, the United States expressed concerns over the extrajudicial killings. \c\cA presidential spokesperson said that Duterte welcomed a proposed Congressional investigation into extrajudicial killings to be chaired by Senator Leila de Lima, his chief critic in the government. On August 17,  Duterte announced that de Lima had been having an affair with a married man, her driver, Ronnie Palisoc Dayan. Duterte claimed that Dayan was her collector for drug money, who had also himself been using drugs. \c\cIn a news conference on August 21, Duterte announced that he had in his possession wiretaps and ATM records which confirmed his allegations. He stated: "What is really crucial here is that because of her [romantic] relationship with her driver which I termed \'immoral\' because the driver has a family and wife, that connection gave rise to the corruption of what was happening inside the national penitentiary." Dismissing fears for Dayan's safety, he added, "As the President, I got this information ... as a privilege. But I am not required to prove it in court. That is somebody else's business. My job is to protect public interest. She's lying through her teeth." He explained that he had acquired the new evidence from an unnamed foreign country. \c\cOn August 18, United Nations human rights experts called on the Philippines to halt extrajudicial killings. Agnes Callamard, the UN Special Rapporteur on summary executions, stated that Duterte had given a "license to kill" to his citizens by encouraging them to kill. In response, Duterte threatened to withdraw from the UN and form a separate group with African nations and China. Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella later clarified that the Philippines was not leaving the UN. As the official death toll reached 1,800, a Congressional investigation of the killings chaired by de Lima was opened. \c\cThen Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said that the government is open to subjecting the Philippines to a probe through regular domestic channels, as long as they are competent and unbiased rapporteur on the anti-drug campaign. \c\cOn August 23, Chito Gascon, head of the Philippine Commission on Human Rights, told the Senate committee that the International Criminal Court may have jurisdiction over the mass killings. On August 25, Duterte released a "drug matrix" supposedly linking government officials, including de Lima, with the New Bilibid Prison drug trafficking scandal. De Lima stated that the "drug matrix" was like something drawn by a 12-year-old child. She added, "I will not dignify any further this so-called \'drug matrix\' which, any ordinary lawyer knows too well, properly belongs in the garbage can." On August 29, Duterte called on de Lima to resign and "hang herself". \c\cFollowing the September 2 bombing in Davao City that killed 14 people in the city's central business district, on September 3, 2016, Duterte declared a "state of lawlessness", and on the following day signed a declaration of a "state of national emergency on account of lawless violence in Mindanao". The Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police were ordered to "suppress all forms of lawless violence in Mindanao" and to "prevent lawless violence from spreading and escalating elsewhere". Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said that the declaration "does not specify the imposition of curfews", and would remain in force indefinitely. He explained: "The recent incidents, the escape of terrorists from prisons, the beheadings, then eventually what happened in Davao. That was the basis." The state of emergency has been seen as an attempt by Duterte to "enhance his already strong hold on power, and give him carte blanche to impose further measures" in the drug war. \c\cAt the 2016 ASEAN Summit, US President Barack Obama cancelled scheduled meetings with Duterte to discuss extrajudicial killings after Duterte referred to Obama as a "son of a whore."\c\cOn September 19, 2016, the Senate voted 16-4 to remove de Lima from her position heading the Senate committee, in a motion brought by senator and boxer Manny Pacquiao. Duterte's allies in the Senate argued that de Lima had damaged the country's reputation by allowing the testimony of Edgar Matobato. She was replaced by Senator Richard Gordon, a supporter of Duterte. Matobato had testified that while working for the Davao Death Squad he had killed more than 50 people. He said that he had witnessed Duterte killing a government agent, and he had heard Duterte giving orders to carry out executions, including ordering the bombing of mosques as retaliation for an attack on a cathedral. \c\cDuterte told reporters that he wanted "a little extension of maybe another six months" in the drug war, as there were so many drug offenders and criminals that he "cannot kill them all". On the following day, a convicted bank robber and two former prison officials testified that they had paid bribes to de Lima. She denies the allegations. In a speech on September 20, Duterte promised to protect police in the drug war and urged them to kill drug suspects regardless if they draw a gun or not when conducting police operation. \c\cAt the beginning of October, a senior police officer told The Guardian that 10 "special ops" official police death squads had been operating, each consisting of 15 police officers. The officer said that he had personally been involved in killing 87 suspects, and described how the corpses had their heads wrapped in masking tape with a cardboard placard labelling them as a drug offender so that the killing would not be investigated, or they were dumped at the roadside ("salvage" victims). The chairman of the Philippines Commission on Human Rights, Chito Gascon, was quoted in the report: "I am not surprised, I have heard of this." The PNP declined to comment. The report stated: "although the Guardian can verify the policeman's rank and his service history, there is no independent, official confirmation for the allegations of state complicity and police coordination in mass murder."\c\cOn October 28, Datu Saudi Ampatuan Mayor Samsudin Dimaukom and nine others, including his five bodyguards, were killed during an anti-illegal drug operation in Makilala, North Cotabato. According to police, the group were heavily armed and opened fire on police, who found sachets of methamphetamine at the scene. No police were injured. Dimaukom was among the drug list named by Duterte on August 7; he had immediately surrendered, and then returned to Datu Saudi Ampatuan. \c\cOn November 1, it was reported that the US State Department had halted the sale of 26,000 assault rifles to the PNP after opposition from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee due to concerns about human rights violations. A police spokesman said they had not been informed. PNP chief Ronald dela Rosa suggested China as a possible alternative supplier. On November 7, Duterte reacted to the US decision to halt the sale by announcing that he was "ordering its cancellation". \c\cIn the early morning of November 5, Mayor of Albuera, Rolando Espinosa Sr., who had been detained at Baybay City Sub-Provincial Jail for violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, was killed in what was described as a shootout inside his jail cell with personnel from the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG). According to the CIDG, Espinosa opened fire on police agents who were executing a search warrant for "illegal firearms." A hard drive of CCTV footage which may have recorded the shooting of Espinosa is missing, a provincial official said. Espinosa had turned himself in to PNP after being named in Duterte's drug list in August. He was briefly released but then re-arrested for alleged drug possession. The president of the National Union of People's Lawyers, Edre Olalia, told local broadcaster TV5 that the police version of events was "too contrived". He pointed out that a search warrant is not required to search a jail cell. "Such acts make a mockery of the law, taunt impunity and insult ordinary common sense." Espinosa was the second public official to be killed in the drug war. \c\cFollowing the incident, on the same day, Senator Panfilo Lacson sought to resume the investigation of extrajudicial killings after it was suspended on October 3 by the Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights. \c\cOn November 28, Duterte appeared to threaten that human rights workers would be targeted: "The human rights [defenders] say I kill. If I say: \'Okay, I\'ll stop\'. They [drug users] will multiply. When harvest time comes, there will be more of them who will die. Then I will include you among them because you let them multiply." Amnesty International Philippines stated that Duterte was "inciting hate towards anyone who expresses dissent on his war against drugs." The National Alliance against Killings Philippines criticized Duterte's comment believing that human rights is a part of dealing the illegal drug issue and that his threats constitutes to "a declaration of an open season on human rights defenders". \c\cOn December 5 Reuters reported that 97% of drug suspects shot by police died, far more than in other countries with drug-related violence. They also stated that police reports of killings are "remarkably similar", involving a "buy-bust" operation in which the suspect panics and shoots at the officers, who return fire, killing the suspect, and report finding a packet of white powder and a .38 caliber revolver, often with the serial number removed. "The figures pose a powerful challenge to the official narrative that the Philippines police are only killing drug suspects in self-defense. These statistics and other evidence amassed by Reuters point in the other direction: that police are pro-actively gunning down suspects."\c\cOn December 8, the Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights issued a report stating that there was sufficient evidence to prove the existence of a Davao Death Squad, and  there is no proof of an imposed state-sponsored policy to commit killings "to eradicate illegal drugs in the country". Eleven senators signed the report, while senators Leila De Lima, JV Ejercito, Antonio Trillanes and Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto did not sign the report or did not subscribe to its findings. \c\cOn early morning of September 28, 2016, a riot erupted inside Building 14 at New Bilibid Prison. Initial reports from acting Bureau of Corrections director Rolando Asuncion said that one inmate witnessed three other convicts, namely Peter Co, Tony Co and Vicente Sy, using methamphetamine moments before the riot started. The inmate then alerted former police officer Clarence Dongail, who entered the cell and told them to stop. However, upon returning to the common area to watch TV, Tony Co attacked Dongail, triggering the riot. Department of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, in his media interview, said that high-profile convict Tony Co was killed after being stabbed. Convict and alleged drug lord Jaybee Sebastian—who was also involved in the riot, Peter Co and Sy were seriously wounded and taken to the hospital, however, Sebastian is in now stable condition while Peter Co is in critical condition. Dongail suffered minimal injuries. \c\cSenator Leila de Lima claimed that the Malacañang Palace was behind the Bilibid riot incident in order to persuade the inmates to testify against her for alleged drug operations inside the prison. Later in a press conference, de Lima angrily condemned the incident and challenged Duterte to arrest her. \c\cFollowing criticism of the police over the kidnapping and killing of Jee Ick-Joo, a South Korean businessman, Duterte ordered the police to suspend drug-related operations while ordering the military and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to continue drug operations. Human Rights Watch criticized the South Korean government in May 2018 for continuing to supply materials to the Philippine authorities after the death of Jee Ick-Joo. \c\cOn January 4, 2017, a Sputnik gang member by the name of Randy Lizardo shot and killed policeman PO1 Enrico Domingo in Tondo. Domingo, together with other PNP officers, were conducting a buy-bust operation inside Lizardo's home. As the lawmen burst inside, the gang surprised them out of the curtains with handguns. Domingo was hit in the head and died instantly, while another, PO2 Harley Gacera, was wounded in the shoulder. Lizardo and the gang managed to get away, but he would later be captured as he tried to flee the city nine days later. The death of Domingo became one of the most covered case of a police casualty during the drug war. \c\cOn January 31, 2017, Amnesty International published a report of their investigation of 59 drug-related killings in 20 cities and towns, "If you are poor you are killed": Extrajudicial Executions in the Philippines\' "War on Drugs", which "details how the police have systematically targeted mostly poor and defenceless people across the country while planting \'evidence\', recruiting paid killers, stealing from the people they kill and fabricating official incident reports." They stated: "Amnesty International is deeply concerned that the deliberate, widespread and systematic killings of alleged drug offenders, which appear to be planned and organized by the authorities, may constitute crimes against humanity under international law."\c\cThe Palace said that the report was wrong, and there were no such illegal killings."As for the spate of killings, there is no such thing as state-sponsored since the police has been following the strict protocols in arresting these drug-related criminals. Secretary Salvador Panelo said that the true cause of the killings are the “members of the drug syndicates are killing each other to prevent their competitors from informing the authorities which may lead to their arrest. As for those who were killed by the police, the same were made on the basis of self-defense when they employed unlawful means to resist arrest posing threat to the lives of the police officers."\c\cThe President also criticized the double standard narrative on the killings involved in the anti-illegal drug campaign. "When you bomb a village you intend to kill the militants, but you kill in the process the children there. Why do you say it is collateral damage to the West and to us it is murder?" President Duterte said months after he sat in office. \c\cA police officer with the rank of Senior Police Officer 1, a ten-year veteran of a Metro Manila anti-illegal drugs unit, told AI that police are paid 8,000 pesos (US$161) to 15,000 pesos (US$302) per "encounter" (the term used for extrajudicial executions disguised as legitimate operations); there is no payment for making arrests. He said that some police also receive a payment from the funeral home they send the corpses to. Hitmen hired by police are paid 5,000 pesos (US$100) for each drug user killed and 10,000 to 15,000 pesos (US$200–300) for each "drug pusher" killed, according to two hitmen interviewed by AI. \c\cAI spoke to many witnesses who complained of the dehumanizing treatment of their family members. Crisis Response Director Tirana Hassan stated: "The way dead bodies are treated shows how cheaply human life is regarded by the Philippines police. Covered in blood, they are casually dragged in front of horrified relatives, their heads grazing the ground before being dumped out in the open. The people killed are overwhelmingly drawn from the poorest sections of society and include children, one of them as young as eight years old."\c\cThe report makes a series of recommendations to Duterte and government officials and departments. If certain key steps are not swiftly taken, it recommends that the International Criminal Court "initiate a preliminary examination into unlawful killings in the Philippines’s violent anti-drug campaign and related crimes under the Rome Statute, including the involvement of government officials, irrespective of rank and status."\c\cThe Guardian and Reuters stated that the report added to evidence they had published previously about police extrajudicial executions. Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella responded to the report, saying that Senate committee investigations proved that there had been no state-sponsored extrajudicial killings. In an interview on February 4, Duterte told a reporter that Amnesty International was "so naive and so stupid", and "a creation of [George] Soros". He asked, "Is that the only thing you [de Lima] can produce? The report of Amnesty?"\c\cDe Lima was jailed on February 24, awaiting trial on charges related to allegations made by Duterte in August 2016. A court date has not been set. \c\cOn February 20, Arturo Lascañas, a retired police officer, told reporters at a press conference outside the senate building that as a leader of the Davao Death Squad he had carried out extrajudicial killings on the orders of Duterte. He said death squad members were paid 20,000 to 100,000 pesos ($400 to $2,000) per hit, depending on the importance of the target. He gave details of various killings he had carried out on Duterte's orders, including the previously unsolved murder of a radio show host critical of Duterte, and confessed to his involvement with Matobato in the bombing of a mosque on Duterte's orders. On the following day the senate voted in a private session to reopen the investigation, reportedly by a margin of ten votes to eight, with five abstentions. \c\cOn March 6, Lascanas gave evidence at the Senate committee, testifying that he had killed approximately 200 criminal suspects, media figures and political opponents on Duterte's orders. \c\cIn June 2017 Reuters reported that "Police were sending corpses to hospitals to destroy evidence at crime scenes and hide the fact that they were executing drug suspects." Doctors stated that corpses loaded onto trucks were being dumped at hospitals, sometimes after rigor mortis had already set in, with clearly unsurvivable wounds, having been shot in the chest and head at close range. Reuters examined data from two Manila police districts, and found that the proportion of suspects sent to hospitals, where they are pronounced dead on arrival (DOA), increased from 13% in July 2016 to 85% in January 2017; "The totals grew along with international and domestic condemnation of Duterte's campaign."\c\cThen-PNP Chief Gen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa dismissed the Reuters report, saying police were trying to save the victims’ lives even when encountering violent resistance. He added that police should not be disparaged for trying to save victims and the removal of bodies from a crime scene did not mean a proper investigation could not be carried out. \c\cOn July 30, Reynaldo Parojinog, the mayor of Ozamiz City, was killed along with 14 others, including his wife Susan, in a dawn raid at around 2:30 am on his home in San Roque Lawis. According to police, they were on a search warrant when Parojinog's bodyguards opened fire on them and police officers responded by shooting at them. According to police provincial chief Jaysen De Guzman, authorities recovered grenades, ammunition and illegal drugs in the raid. \c\cOn August 16, over 32 people were killed in multiple "one-time, big-time" antidrug operations in Bulacan within one day. In Manila, 25 people, including 11 suspected robbers, were also killed in consecutive anti-criminality operations. The multiple deaths in the large-scale antidrug operations received condemnation from human rights groups and the majority of the Senate. \c\cAs a result of involvement in the deaths of teenagers like Kian delos Santos, and Carl Angelo Arnaiz and Reynaldo de Guzman, and robbing of a drug suspect in an antidrug raid, National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) chief Oscar Albayalde ordered the firing and retraining of all members of the Caloocan City Police, with the exception of its newly appointed chief and its deputy. \c\cOn October 12, 2017, Duterte announced the transfer of anti-drug operations to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), ending the involvement of the Philippine National Police (PNP). The announcement followed the publication of an opinion poll on October 8, showing a drop in presidential approval from 66% to 48%. In a televised speech, Duterte scoffed and mocked the "bleeding hearts" who sympathized with those killed in the drug war, pointedly at the European Union, whom he accused of interfering with Philippine sovereignty. \c\cIn a speech before ASEAN representatives, Rodrigo Duterte refuted all extrajudicial killings related to the War on Drugs by stating that these stories only serve as a political agenda in order to demonize him. He stated that he has only used his mouth to tell drug users that they will be killed. He stated that "..."shabu" (crystal meth) users have shrunken brains, which is why they have become violent and aggressive, leading to their deaths." Duterte further added that all the drug pushers and their henchmen always carry their guns with them and killing them is justifiable so that they would not endanger the lives of his men. Duterte appointed a human rights lawyer, Harry Roque, a Kabayan partylist representative, as his spokesperson. Roque stated that he will change public perception by reducing the impact of the statements by which Duterte advocates extrajudicial killings in his war on drugs. \c\cIn a speech on March 26, 2018, Duterte said that human rights groups "have become unwitting tools of drug lords." Human Rights Watch denied the allegation, calling it "shockingly dangerous and shameful."\c\cThe controversial Tanauan, Batangas mayor Antonio Halili was assassinated by an unknown sniper during a flag-raising ceremony on July 2, 2018, becoming the 11th local government official to be killed in the drug war. On the following day, Ferdinand Bote, mayor of General Tinio, was shot dead in his vehicle in Cabanatuan City. \c\cAfter holding deliberations on petitions by the Free Legal Assistance Group and the Center for International Law, the Philippine Supreme Court in December 2017 ordered the solicitor-general to release documents related to the drug war. In January 2018, the Supreme Court granted the petitioners a writ of amparo and issued restraining orders against police officers. The spokesperson for the President said the administration will comply with the order. \c\cThe Supreme Court issued a second writ of amparo in February 2018, prohibiting Interior Secretary Ismael Sueno and police chief Ronald dela Rosa from going within one kilometer from the widow of a drug war victim killed in Antipolo, Rizal. \c\cThere was a certain sense of frustration because of the cases that were filed before the ICC without first going through the domestic remedies and the domestic channels, wherein remedies can be considered to be able to address these cases that were brought before the attention of the ICC. So the Philippine government thought it was very disrespectful and violative of the processes, according to the Presidential Human Rights Committee Secretariat (PHRCS)\c\cBut despite the withdrawal, it will not prevent the Philippine government from engaging other agencies such as the UN the European Union, which the Philippines have always remained faithful to the processes that are available, according to the PHRCS. \c\cOn January 17, 2019, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, on his state visit in the country, praised the war on drugs campaign, saying that the campaign is "an example to the whole world." Two days later, human rights groups had expressed alarm over the statement of Sirisena. On January 18, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) issued a statement, saying that the Philippines along with Syria, Nigeria, Yemen, and Afghanistan, is "one of the deadliest places in the world to be a civilian," citing deaths in the drug war. Malacanang reacted by saying that the report "is remarkable in ignorance and bias." A survey conducted by SWS from December 16–19, 2018, showing that 66% of the Filipinos believe that drug addicts in the country have diminished substantially. However, on February 19, 2019, opposition Senator Antonio Trillanes made a statement about the few drug addicts, whom Trillanes said that "they were killed \'without due process,\'" and slams Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo by saying "what are you celebrating, Mr. Panelo, the ruthlessness of your boss?"\c\cOn March 1, 2019, results of an SWS survey conducted from December 16 to 19, 2018, on 1,440 adults nationwide was released that concluded that 78% (or almost 4 out of 5 Filipinos) were worried "that they, or someone they know, will be a victim of extrajudicial killings (EJK)." However, Philippine National Police chief, Police General Oscar Albayalde criticized the survey results pointing out that the survey wrongly presented a question which "cannot be validated by respondents without keen awareness or understanding of EJK as we know it from Administrative Order No. 35 Series of 2012 by President [Benigno Simeon] Aquino [III]." He reiterated "I take the latest survey results on public perception to alleged extrajudicial killing with a full cup of salt. It shouldn’t be surprising that 78 percent are afraid of getting killed. Who isn’t afraid to die, anyway?"\c\cOn March 14, Duterte released another list of the politicians allegedly involved in the illegal drug trade. The list consists of 45 incumbent officials: 33 mayors, 8 vice mayors, 3 congressmen, one board member, and one former mayor. Of all politicians named, there are eight politicians belong to Duterte's own political party PDP–Laban. Opposition figures such as senatorial candidates from Otso Diretso said that Duterte used the list "to ensure their allies would win" in May 2019 election. \c\cOn March 17, the country formally withdrew from the ICC after the country's withdrawal notification was received by the Secretary-General of the United Nations last year. \c\cIn September 2019, the authorities have accused Guia Gomez-Castro, former chairwoman of Barangay 484 in Sampaloc, Manila as a mastermind of "recycling" the illegal drugs the law enforcement seized to the corrupt police officers. Dubbed by the authorities as "drug queen", the PDEA added that the corrupt police officers have been selling shabu which is worth P16.6 million daily in Gomez-Castro's cohort and also said that Gomez-Castro is allegedly being protected by the corrupt police officers and other politicians. On September 25, the Bureau of Immigration (BI) said that Gomez-Castro has already left the country on September 21. On the same day, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, through his Facebook live streaming, has ordered Gomez-Castro to surrender to her office. \c\cPrior to this, in November 2013, the NBI raided the house of Gomez-Castro in Barangay 484, Sampaloc, Manila where they seized a P240,000 worth of shabu. In November 2018, seven people were arrested by Tondo police during drug operation; some of them are chairwoman's relatives. In a text message, Castro refuted all the accusation thrown against her. \c\cOn October 25, 2019, Clarin, Misamis Occidental Mayor David Navarro, one of the mayor whom Duterte named him for alleged involvement in the illegal drug trade, was shot dead in ambush by four masked men while he was being transported to the prosecutor's office in Cebu City, following his alleged beating up the massage therapist. Prior to his death, Cebu City police said that according to Navarro's family, the mayor had been received death threats in Misamis Occidental. \c\cThe Philippines was deemed as the 4th most dangerous country in terms of violence directly meant at civilians in the world, declaring that 75% of reported deaths are from war on drugs pursued by authorities. \c\cThe "ninja cops" refers to the police officers who were accused of "recycling" the illegal drugs that they seized during the police operations. PNP Chief Oscar Albayalde was the center of the controversy who was accused of protecting the so-called "ninja cops" or the corrupt officials. \c\cOn November 29, 2013, twelve police officers, led by Major Rodney Baloyo, conduct a raid on Mexico, Pampanga and seized 36.68 kg (80.9 lb) of methamphetamine (shabu). Albayalde was the acting police chief of Pampanga at the time of the raid. That operation was supposed to go after Chinese drug lord Johnson Lee, but they evaded the arrest after Lee allegedly paid the police officers a P50 million. Lee currently remains at large and is now wanted by the authorities. Baloyo contradicted the morning police operations, saying that they raided Lee's house at 4:30pm. On November 30, 2013, authorities submitted the illegal drugs that they recovered as a evidence. PNP Chief General Oscar Albayalde was accused of covering-up in the issue. \c\cIn a Senate hearing, according to Major Rodney Baloyo, he ordered the Police Officer 2 Anthony Lacsamana to conduct a raid on the area; however, Lacsamana denied Baloyo's claim. Senator Richard Gordon has Baloyo detained at the New Bilibid Prison for "lying" at the hearing. A Senate investigation found out that P648 million worth of seized shabu from the November 2013 raid was not declared by the Pampanga police. Additionally, it was reported that the police officers have earned P50 million from the drug lord's wealth. Former Deputy Director for Operations of the CIDG Gen. Rudy Lacadin revealed that then-Pampanga provincial director Albayalde had received some money from the operation. A memo written by Albayalde sent to the Regional Director on December 2, 2013 stated that Albayalde himself ordered the buy-bust operation in Pampanga, however during the Senate hearing, Albayalde denied the knowledge of the operation. \c\cMeanwhile, in Central Visayas, nine police officers were dismissed from their duties of Police Regional Office 7 over the reports that they "were proven to be drug users."\c\cThe Makabayan bloc demanded the immediate resignation of Albayalde from his post and other officials over the implication of the controversy. On October 14, Albayalde eventually resigned as the PNP chief. Duterte expressed his disappointment over the issue. \c\cOn October 21, 2019, The PNP-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) filed a complaint before the Department of Justice, citing a re-investigation of Albayalde and 13 of his personnel over the alleged recycling of drugs of some 162 kilograms of shabu of that they seized, while a Senate suggested a life imprisonment for the mentioned police officers. The PNP said in a statement that the accused "remain innocent until proven guilty."\c\cOn October 23, 2019, Vice President Leni Robredo made a statement, saying that Duterte should allow the UN to investigate the war on drugs, and she added that a campaign has been "a failure and a dent on the country's international image." Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo slammed Robredo's remark, saying that her claim "lacked factual basis." However, on October 27, 2019, Robredo clarified that she suggested for "tweaks" to the campaign and denied that she called to stop the war on drugs. On November 4, 2019, Duterte assigned Vice President Leni Robredo to be co-chairperson of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD) until the end of his term in 2022, said presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo. \c\cThe Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) said that, the vice president is “misled in understanding the anti-drug campaign,” and that law enforcement is only a part of a multi-faceted dimension in addressing domestic drug issues using a holistic, balanced and comprehensive approach. “While enforcement issues are more evident, we cannot discount the successes we have gained in the demand reduction part of the campaign," the DDB said. Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo meanwhile tagged Robredo’s comments as “black propaganda” as they lacked factual basis—advising the Vice President to detach herself from detreactors. Panelo said that while the government is not intolerant of criticisms, Robrado’s comments “become a disinformation campaign and an abuse of the freedom of speech and of expression, and unproductive to the mature evolution of a democratic society and a hindrance to its progress. On November 12, 2019, former Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division Phelim Kline made a statement to Robredo, stating the recommendation of arresting Duterte "and his henchmen for inciting and instigating mass murder."\c\cOn November 24, Duterte fired Robredo from her post. According to Presidential Spokersperson Salvador Panelo, her removal is "in response to the taunt and dare" of Vice President Leni Robredo for Duterte "to just tell her that he wants her out."\c\cIn January 2020, vice president Leni Robredo reported her findings and recommendations on the drug war. Using data from the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), Robredo said, "In spite of all the Filipinos who were killed and all the money spent by the government, we only seized less than 1 percent in supply of shabu and money involved in illegal drugs." In December 2020, "International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said there is `reasonable basis\' to believe that crimes against humanity were committed in the killings related to President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs."\c\cIn June 2020, a shooting in Parañaque left one policeman and one criminal dead, as well as one cop wounded. P/ Lt. Armand Melad and his group were sent to Unida and Dimasalang streets, Brgy. Baclaran, to answer a complaint about loud noises from a karaoke. They then came across two males on a motorcycle without helmets. As they questioned the two men, an argument erupted, which led to the policemen trying to arrest the two. One of them by the name of Moamar Sarif drew and opened fire with a .40 Jericho Pistol. The police then swarmed and grabbed their own guns, while the other person on the motorcycle drove away. During the shootout, both Melad and Sarif were critically wounded, later dying in the same hospital. Another police named P/Corporal Allan Baltazar was also wounded. \c\cAugust 2020 was the sight of a bloody series of killings in the province of Leyte, of which many drug dealers and users were killed. Jason Golong, a former drug pusher and user, was killed outside of the RTR hospital in Calanipawan Road, shot upon while driving his car. He was the son of former Tacloban City prosecutor Ruperto Golong, and was once captured in a buy-bust operation conducted by the PDEA in 2018. Retired police officer and drug user Pio Molabola Peñaflor was were killed in a drive-by shooting together with his son Alphy Chan Peñaflor in Palo, Leyte. Four more people were killed in the next month, two of them were former police officers - Constantino Torre, Dennis Monteza, Ian Pat Cabredo and Maritess Pami. Ian Pat Cabredo was a former guard at the Leyte Provincial Jail and was in the police's drug suspect list before his death. \c\cIn November 24, Police Captain Ariel Ilagan of the Southern Police District, was driving together with his family inside a Toyota Fortuner in Imus City, when they were ambushed by armed assailants on foot. The SUV they were driving at where set upon by fire from M16 rifles. The attackers then fled onboard a red Toyota Innova that had no registration plate. The shooting was captured in CCTV. Ilagan was killed while his wife and daughter sustained injuries. Ilagan previously headed the Taguig City Police’s Drug Enforcement Unit, but had been recently transferred to the Discipline Law and Order Section (DLOS), which handles “administrative and less grave cases” of policemen. \c\cJanuary 23 saw a major gun battle between the PNP and a Mindanao drug syndicate in Maguindanao. The shootout started when a joint ask force of police and marines attempted to serve a search warrant to Pendatun Adsis Talusan, a former village chief who was convicted of robbery with homicide, double frustrated murder, and illegal possession of firearms. Members of Talusan's group then holed themselves up inside an apartment where they were besieged by the police. During the end of the firefight, 12 syndicate members including Talusan was killed, together with one policeman. The shootout happened a few days after the assassination of Christopher Cuan, mayor of Libungan and a politician included in Duterte's drug list. \c\cIn Palo, Leyte in the morning of February 10, a policeman by the name of Master Sergeant Jay Paul Culas was shot and killed while riding his motorcycle. The assailants were inside a four-wheeled vehicle when they shot Culas with pistol fire. His body laid dead on the national highway. Police determined the killers were tied to Culas\' occupation as a policeman, with various suspects presented, including a Waray-Waray gang. \c\cA fatal friendly fire incident happened on the evening of February 24 between PNP personnel and PDEA agents near a mall in Quezon City. Both organizations were conducting separate drug operations that intertwined near the Ever Gotesco Mall. A botched buy-bust operation then led to a shootout between the two that caused the deaths of two policemen, two PDEA agents, and one PDEA informant. Although the shootout happened near a crowded area, mall management managed to secure the mall of civilians. During the preliminary investigation, the PNP claimed that the PDEA agents fired first. The PNP and the PDEA decided to have a joint investigation on the matter, while Police General Debold Sinas appointed the CIDG as the lead investigating body. The Department of Justice had also ordered the National Bureau of Investigation to create a parallel investigation on the matter. \c\cIn February of the year, Department of Justice secretary Menardo Guevarra told the press that they have started the investigation on the alleged police misconduct during the drug war. The DOJ believed the PNP had constantly failed police protocols and ethics, due to the same similar patters that led to deaths and the lack of any ballistics tests or paraffin tests. Findings from the investigation will be forwarded to the Human Rights Watch. The HRW in turn, urged the DOJ to keep its promise on "regarding the alleged failures of the police force in its anti-drug operations". On the same month, Leila De Lima, one of Duterte's long-time critics, was acquitted of one of her three drug charges. \c\cIn June 2021, The International Criminal Court (ICC) Office of the Prosecutor has applied for an authorization to open an investigation into the alleged crimes against humanity committed in President Rodrigo Duterte's violent campaign against drugs. It also seeks to probe into the killings in Davao City from 2011 to 2016. \c\cThe Philippine National Police manages Oplan Double Barrel as part of its involvement in President Rodrigo Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs in the Philippines. It consists of two main components: Oplan Tokhang and Oplan HVT. Tokhang is characterized as the lower barrel approach while HVT which stands for high value targets is described as the police's high barrel approach. The operation was launched in 2016. \c\cThe Philippine police temporarily suspended its operations in October 2017 after a directive by President Duterte amidst reports of abuse by the police with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) taking over as the leading agency against illegal drug activities in the Philippines. The police resumed operations in January 2018 with the police officially playing a supporting role to PDEA in Duterte's campaign. \c\cOne component of the war on drugs by the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte is Oplan Tokhang. The name of the operation was derived from the Cebuano words tuktok (knock) and hangyo (plead). As the name suggests, Oplan Tokhang involves the police visiting the houses of individuals suspected to be involved in the illegal drug trade or as users, to persuade them to stop their activities and submit themselves to authority for potential rehabilitation. A more comprehensive guideline by the Philippine National Police then under the leadership of Police Chief Ronald dela Rosa was released prior to the resumption of police operations on the war on drugs in January 2019 after it was temporarily postponed. Tokhang is characterized as a Police Community Relations operation. \c\cUnder the guidelines, in a single operation, four police officers selected by the locality's police chief are designated as tokhangers to visit the suspects\' houses in full uniform. They are to be accompanied by one member of the barangay, municipality or city anti-drug abuse council, one representative from the PNP human-rights affairs office or any human rights advocate and at least one from the religious sector, members of the media or other prominent personalities in the area. They are only allowed to enter the suspect's house upon consent of the suspect or the house owner. The police coordinates with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the local anti-drug abuse councils for the conduct of the operations. The guidelines include the option for drug suspects to surrender themselves to the police or the barangay hall and the option to avail of rehabilitation. They are not required to sign any document. If the suspect refuses to surrender or engage with the visiting Oplan Tokhang team, their case is to be submitted to the Drug Enforcement Units which will conduct relevant police operations including case build-up and negation. \c\cThe policy was first used in a more local scale in Davao, when Dela Rosa was still the police chief of the locality leading police visits to drug suspects houses. The word tokhang has become associated with killings related to the campaign against illegal drugs prior to the release of the guideline with the PDEA chief General Aaron Aquino urging to discontinue the use "thokhang" to refer to the government's operations. \c\cOplan High Value Targets (HVT) is a component of the Philippine National Police operations under Operation Double Barrel which aims to arrest and neutralize individuals which the police allege to be involved in the country's illegal drug trade. They include drug lords and pushers who operate in groups. In its November 2016 report, the PNP Directorate for Intelligence said that of the 956 validated high-value targets identified by the national police since the start of the campaign, 23 were killed in police operations, 109 were arrested, and 361 surrendered. This accounts for over 54.6% of the total identified HVTs while another 29 targets were listed as deaths under investigation. The PNP also reported that at least ₱1.445 billion worth of illegal drugs has been seized in the first four months of their campaign against HVTs. \c\cThe high-value targets identified by the national police include Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa who earlier surrendered to the PNP before being killed in prison, and alleged number 2 Visayas drug lord Franz Sabalones, the brother of San Fernando, Cebu Mayor Fralz Sabalones, who surrendered to the PNP after being named by President Duterte in his narco-list speech. The high-value targets also include the following alleged drug lords and local chief executives killed since the start of the drug war on July 1, 2016. \c\cRodrigo Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs was aided by non-government organizations including rebel groups and vigilantes. The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing the New People's Army (NPA), initially cooperated with the government but withdrew its support for the government's campaign against drugs in August 2016 although the communist party vowed to continue its own operations, independent from the government's anti-drug campaign, against drug suspects. \c\cThe Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a rebel group at truce with the government,  forged a protocol with the Philippine government in July 2017 in which it pledged to arrest and turn over drug suspects taking refuge in the rebel group's camps and would allow the government to conduct its anti-drug operations in areas controlled by the rebel group. \c\cArmed vigilantes and hired killers are also involved in the campaign. \c\cOn August 17, 2017, Kian Loyd delos Santos, a 17-year-old Grade 11 student, was shot dead in an antidrug operation in Caloocan. CCTV footage appeared to show Kian being dragged by two policemen. Police say they killed him in self-defense, and retrieved a gun and two packets of methamphetamine. Delos Santos was the son of an overseas Filipino worker, a key demographic in support of Duterte. The teenager's death caused condemnation by senators. His funeral on August 25, attended by more than a thousand people, was one of the largest protests to date against the drug war. \c\cCarl Angelo Arnaiz, a 19-year-old, last found in Cainta, Rizal, was tortured and shot dead also on August 17 (the same date Kian delos Santos was killed) by police after robbing a taxi in Caloocan. His 14-year-old friend Reynaldo de Guzman, also known by the nickname "Kulot", was stabbed to death thirty times and thrown into a creek in Gapan, Nueva Ecija. Along with the deaths of Kian delos Santos, the deaths of the two teenagers also triggered public outrage and condemnation. \c\cHuman Rights Watch repeated their call for a UN investigation. HRW Asia director Phelim Kine commented: "The apparent willingness of Philippine police to deliberately target children for execution marks an appalling new level of depravity in this so-called drug war". Duterte called the deaths of Arnaiz and de Guzman (the former being a relative of the President on his mother's side) "sabotage", believing that some groups are using the Philippine National Police to destroy the president's public image. Presidential spokesman Abella said "It should not come as a surprise that these malignant elements would conspire to sabotage the president’s campaign to rid the Philippines of illegal drugs and criminality", which "may include creating scenarios stoking public anger against the government". \c\cOn August 23, 2016, a 5-year-old student named Danica May Garcia was killed by a stray bullet coming from unidentified gunmen in Dagupan City, Pangasinan during an anti-drug operation. Another minor, 4-year old Skyler Abatayo of Cebu was killed by a stray bullet through an \'anti-drug operation\'. In the first year of the drug war, 54 children were recorded as casualties. On the same week, a 15-year old by the name of Angelika Bonita (sometimes spelled "Angelica") was killed while riding inside the Toyota Hilux of 48-year-old narco-lawyer Rogelio Bato Jr., the attorney of Rolando Espinosa. The two were cruising in a subdivision near a mall  in Marasbaras, Tacloban when they were fired upon by M16s and .45 caliber guns. Both were killed instantly. Bato and Bonita were not related and mysteries surround their relationship. Rumors speculated that Bonita was Bato's girlfriend and that she was caught in the crossfire. \c\cNewly-seated Senator Ronald dela Rosa made a statement about the death of a 3-year-old child named Myka Ulpina in crossfire during police operations in Rodriguez, Rizal on June 29, 2019, reacting to the incident by saying "shit happens". It was alleged that Renato Dolofrina took his 3-year-old daughter hostage and that both were killed by the police after the father used the child as a "human shield." However, the family denied the allegations of hostage taking, insisting that the child was killed by a stray bullet. Also, a police officer who went undercover to buy crystal meth died in an operation after suspected drug user Dolofrina's companion discovered the ruse. A few days later, several militant groups and netizens, as well as opposition Senators, condemned dela Rosa's remarks. The Commission of Human Rights also condemned the child's death. \c\cOn July 8, 2019, dela Rosa apologized for his remarks and retracted his earlier statement, saying that the incident was "unfortunate."\c\cSenator Risa Hontiveros, an opponent of Duterte, said that the drug war was a political strategy intended to persuade people that "suddenly the historically most important issue of poverty was no longer the most important."\c\cPresident Duterte claimed to recognize poverty as a key problem of the country; the administration’s 10-point Socioeconomic Agenda, no.8 is to improve social protection programs, which includes the Conditional Cash Transfer Program, to protect the poor. President Duterte signed Republic Act (RA) No. 11315, or the Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS) Act. RA 11315 authorizing the government to adopt a CBMS. \c\cDe Lima expressed frustration with the attitude of Filipinos towards extrajudicial killings: "they think that it's good for peace and order. We now have death squads on a national scale, but I\'m not seeing public outrage."\c\cPresident Duterte has denied involvement in the ‘Davao Death Squad.’ “It started in Davao as a political issue. As a matter of fact, you go to Davao, the DDS is not really a DDS. It was during the time ‘Sparrow versus the DDS of government,” President Duterte said. The President has pointed out that not a single case was filed against him when Senator Leila de Lima was Chair of the Commission on Human Rights for 7 years. \c\cDuring his fourth SONA, the President called on officials to work towards lifting 6 million Filipinos out of poverty. According to data from Pulse Asia surveys, the poverty-stricken,classes D and E, never gave the President approval and trust ratings below 70% throughout the first half of his presidency. According to a Pulse Asia opinion poll conducted from July 2 to 8, 2016, 91% of Filipinos "trusted" Duterte. A survey conducted between February and May 2017, by PEW research center, found that 78% of the Filipinos support the drug war. A survey in September 2017 showed 88% support for the drug war, while 73% believed that extrajudicial executions were occurring. An independent survey in September 2017 showed that 88% of Filipinos support the drug war. As of 2019, it is at 82%. \c\cDela Rosa announced in September 2016 that the drug war had "reduced the supply of illegal drugs in the country by some 80 to 90 percent", and said that the War was already being won, based on statistical and observational evidence. \c\cAljazeera reported that John Collins, director of the London School of Economics International Drug Policy Project, said: "Targeting the supply side can have short-term effects. However, these are usually limited to creating market chaos rather than reducing the size of the market. ... What you learn is that you\'re going to war with a force of economics and the force of economics tends to win out: supply, demand and price tend to find their own way." He said it was a "certainty" that "the Philippines\' new \'war\' will fail and society will emerge worse off from it."\c\cMalacañang and the chief of police declared the drug war a success, claiming that supply has been cut by 90 percent, with the government regaining authority at national penitentiary Bilibid where incarcerated leaders of cartels continue to control the narcotics chain from their swish cells. \c\cIn June 2017 the price of methamphetamine on the streets of Manila was lower than it had been at the start of Duterte's presidency, according to Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency data. Gloria Lai of the International Drug Policy Consortium commented: "If prices have fallen, it's an indication that enforcement actions have not been effective". \c\cThe Chairman of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Sergio Ortiz-Luis Jr., quelled fears that foreign investors might be put off by the increasing rate of killings in the country, explaining at a press conference on September 19, 2016, that investors only care about profit: "They don\'t care if 50% of Filipinos are killing each other so long as they\'re not affected". On the following day the Wall Street Journal reported that foreign investors, who account for half of the activity on the Philippine Stock Exchange, had been "hightailing it out of town", selling $500 million worth of shares over the past month, putting pressure on the Philippine peso which was close to its weakest point since 2009. \c\cThe Archbishop of Manila Luis Antonio Tagle acknowledged that people were right to be "worried about extrajudicial killings", along with other "form[s] of murder": abortion, unfair labor practices, wasting of food, and "selling illegal drugs, pushing the youth into vices". \c\cDuring his official state visit to the Philippines in January 2017, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said: "On countering illegal drugs, we want to work together with the Philippines through relevant measures of support". He offered financial assistance for Philippine drug rehabilitation centers, and made no mention of deaths resulting from the drug war. He announced an $800 million Official Development Assistance package to "promote economic and infrastructure development". \c\cIn June 2016, Gary Song-Huann Lin, the representative of Taiwan in the Philippines, welcomed Duterte's plan to declare a war against criminality and illegal drugs. He said Taiwan is ready to help the Philippines combat cross-border crimes like human and drug trafficking. He later reasserted on October that Taiwan was an indispensable partner to the Philippines’ war on drugs. In 2018, Ricardo Parojinog, an alleged narcopolitician at Ozamiz and the brother of Reynaldo, was detained in Taiwan for illegal immigration and later deported to the Philippines; he was then found dead in September 2020. \c\cOn July 19, 2016, Lingxiao Li, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Manila, announced China's support for the drug war: "China fully understands that the Philippine government under the leadership of H. E. President Rodrigo Duterte has taken it as a top priority to crack down on drug-related crimes. China has expressed explicitly to the new administration China's willingness for effective cooperation in this regard, and would like to work out a specific plan of action with the Philippine side." The statement made no reference to extrajudicial killings, and called illegal drugs the "common enemy of mankind". On September 27, the Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua reiterated that "Illegal drugs are the enemy of all mankind" in a statement confirming Chinese support for the Duterte administration. \c\cIndonesian National Police Chief General Tito Karnavian commented in regards to Indonesia's rejection of a similar policy for Indonesia: "Shoot on sight policy leads to abuse of power. We still believe in the presumption of innocence. Lethal actions are only warranted if there is an immediate threat against officers... there should not be a deliberate attempt to kill". In September 2016 Budi Waseso, head of Indonesia's National Anti-Narcotics Agency (BNN), said that he was currently contemplating copying the Philippines\' hardline tactics against drug traffickers. He said that the Agency planned a major increase in armaments and recruitment. An Agency spokesman later attempted to downplay the comments, stating: "We can\'t shoot criminals just like that, we have to follow the rules." Most recently, Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo used the language of “emergency” to ramp up the country's war on drugs, in a move that observers see as "in step with Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte’s" own campaign against the illegal drug trade. \c\cOn September 9, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key spoke to Duterte about "arguably better" ways to deal with drug issues. The then Prime Minister commented "Now he didn\'t really give us a direct answer to what happens when and if innocent people get associated with what is essentially extra-judicial killings." The New Zealand government has repeatedly spoken to Duterte regarding his war on drugs across several administrations since and there was some consideration in barring Duterte from a layover arrival in New Zealand following the 2016 APEC summit in Peru, due to his human rights record, mainly as a result of the war on drugs. \c\cOn October 16, prior to Duterte's departure for a state visit to Brunei, the President said he would seek the support of that country for his campaign against illegal drugs and Brunei's continued assistance to achieve peace and progress in Mindanao. This was responded to positively by Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah the next day according to Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said "he respects the method undertaken by the Philippine government as it is suitable for their country’s situation", while stressing that "Malaysia will never follow such an example as we have our own methods such as seizing assets used in drug trafficking with resultant funds to be channelled back towards rehabilitation, prevention and enforcement of laws against drugs". \c\cOn December 3, 2016, Duterte said that during a phone conversation on the previous day with then-United States President-elect Donald Trump, Trump had invited him to Washington, and endorsed his drug-war policy, assuring him that it was being conducted "the right way". Duterte described the conversation: \c\cOn December 16, Duterte and Singaporean President Tony Tan and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong agreed to work together in the fight against terrorism and illegal drugs. In a meeting during a state visit both parties discussed areas of cooperation between the two countries. \c\cThe European Parliament expressed concern over extrajudicial killings in a resolution September 15, stating: "Drug trafficking and drug abuse in the Philippines remain a serious national and international concern, note MEPs. They understand that millions of people are hurt by the high level of drug addiction and its consequences in the country but are also concerned by the \'extraordinarily high numbers killed during police operations in the context of an intensified anti-crime and anti-drug campaign."\c\cIn response, the Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano stated that the European Parliament had crossed a red line when it called for interfering in the Philippines’ sovereignty. The resolution was said to be “biased, incomplete and even wrong information and does not reflect the true situation on the ground”. In addition,the European Parliament was also criticized when the Philippine Presidential spokesperson said that it is inconsistent that the European Parliament will condemn the war against drugs, which is now also being financed partly by the European Union especially in drug rehabilitation projects. \c\cIn response, at a press conference Duterte made an obscene hand gesture and called British and French representatives "hypocrites" because their ancestors had killed thousands of Arabs and others in the colonial era. He said: "When I read the EU condemnation I told them fuck you. You are doing it in atonement for your sins. They are now strict because they have guilty feelings. Who did I kill? Assuming that it's true? 1,700? How many have they killed?"\c\cEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, in a visit to the Philippines in March 2017, warned that unless the Philippines addresses human rights issues, the EU would cancel tariff-free export of 6,000 products under the Generalized System of Preferences. Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella dismissed the concerns, saying that they revealed European ignorance. \c\cOn December 24, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Edward Markey, and Christopher Coons expressed their concerns regarding the alleged extrajudicial killings and human rights violations in Duterte's war on drugs. Through a letter sent to the U.S. Department of State, they noted that instead of addressing the drug problem, investing in treatment programs or approaching the issue with an emphasis on health, Duterte has "pledged to kill another 20,000 to 30,000 people, many simply because they suffer from a drug use disorder." Rubio, Markey and Coons also questioned U.S. secretary of state John Kerry's pledge of $32-million funding for training and other law-enforcement assistance during his visit to Manila. In May 2017, Senator Rubio, along with Senator Ben Cardin, filed a bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate to restrict the exportation of weapons from the U.S. to the Philippines. \c\cThe US ambassador in Manila announced on December 14, 2016, that the US foreign aid agency, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, would cancel funding to the Philippines due to "significant concerns around rule of law and civil liberties in the Philippines", explaining that aid recipients were required to demonstrate a "commitment to the rule of law, due process and respect for human rights". The MCC had disbursed $434 million to the Philippines from 2011 to 2015. The funding denial was expected to lead to the cancellation of a five-year infrastructure development project previously agreed to in December 2015. \c\cIn February 2017, former Colombian President César Gaviria wrote an opinion piece on The New York Times to warn Duterte and the administration that the drug war is "unwinnable" and "disastrous," citing his own experiences as the President of Colombia. He also criticized the alleged extrajudicial killings and vigilantism, saying these are "the wrong ways to go." According to Gaviria, the war on drugs is essentially a war on people. Gaviria suggested that improving public health and safety, strengthening anti-corruption measures, investing in sustainable development, decriminalizing drug consumption, and strengthening the regulation of therapeutic goods would enhance supply and demand reduction. In response to Gaviria, Duterte called him an "idiot," and said the issue of extrajudicial killings should be set aside, and that there were four to five million drug addicts in the country. \c\cIn September 2017, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano delivered a speech at the 72nd United Nations General Assembly, during which he argued that extrajudicial killings were a myth, and that the drug war, which according to Human Rights Watch had resulted in 13,000 deaths to date, was being waged to "protect (the) human rights of...the most vulnerable (citizens)." In October 2017, Cayetano was interviewed by al-Jazeera. He asserted that all 3,900 people who were killed in the drug war had fought against the police, and that all of the killings were being investigated. \c\cIn January 2018, Philippines\' presidential spokesman Harry Roque relayed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expressed support for Duterte’s campaign against narcotics and also called for stronger cooperation against illegal drugs. \c\cOn May 27, 2020,a Human Rights Watch report showed the Impact of the “War on Drugs” in the Philippines. Children and thousands of people have been killed during anti-drug raids, which the authorities have called “collateral damage”, since President Rodrigo Duterte launched his “war on drugs” on June 30, 2016. \c\cThe International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda expressed concern over the drug-related killings in the country on October 13, 2016. In her statement, Bensouda said that the high officials of the country "seem to condone such killings and further seem to encourage State forces and civilians alike to continue targeting these individuals with lethal force." She also warned that any person in the country who provokes "in acts of mass violence by ordering, requesting, encouraging or contributing, and in any other manner, to the commission of crimes within the jurisdiction of ICC" will be prosecuted before the court. About that, Duterte is open for the investigation by the ICC, Malacañang said. \c\cIn February 2018, the ICC announced a “preliminary examination” into killings linked to the Philippine government's “war on drugs”. Prosecutor Bensouda said the court will “analyze crimes allegedly committed in [the Philippines] since at least 1 July 2016.” Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque dismissed the ICC's decision as a “waste of the court’s time and resources”. In March, Duterte announced his intention to withdraw the Philippines from the ICC tribunal, which is a process that takes a year. \c\cIn August 2018, activists and eight families of victims of the drug war filed a second petition with the ICC, accusing Duterte of murder and crimes against humanity, and calling for his indictment for thousands of extrajudicial killings, which according to the 50-page complaint included "brazen" executions by police acting with impunity. Neri Colmenares, a lawyer acting for the group, said that "Duterte is personally liable for ordering state police to undertake mass killings." Duterte threatened to arrest the ICC prosecutor Bensouda. \c\cOn June 19, 2018, 38 United Nations member states released a collective statement through the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), calling on the Philippines and President Duterte to stop the killings in the country and probe abuses caused by the drug war. The 38 nations included Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Macedonia, Montenegro, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. \c\cOn July 11, 2019, the UNHRC adopted an Iceland-proposed resolution calling on the council to look into the rising homicides related to the drug war and the human rights situation in the country. In response, President Rodrigo Duterte reacted to the resolution saying Iceland has no crime because its people "just go about eating ice" while Senators Vicente Sotto III and Imee Marcos said that countries who voted in favor of the resolution lacked the moral high ground due to abortion being legal in most of these countries. \c\cMalacañang called the resolution "outrageous interference" in the sovereignty of the Philippines as it has no jurisdiction to do so. The Philippine government also said that Iceland may have been fed with inaccurate information about the Philippines’ war on drugs, as the former has no embassy in the Philippines. \c\cThe Presidential Spokesperson called the resolution ”grotesquely one-sided, outrageously narrow, and maliciously partisan.” "It reeks of nauseating politics completely devoid of respect for the sovereignty of our country, even as it is bereft of the gruesome realities of the drug menace,” he added. \c\cAccording to the Presidential Human Rights Committee Secretariat (PHRCS) the government didn’t find the need for such a country-specific inquiry on the Philippines as there are so many existing mechanisms wherein the information in the country can be accessed. \c\cThe Philippine government continues to subject itself to the universal periodic review every four years as well as different treaty bodies periodically. Despite the mechanisms that are already in place, Iceland resorted to such a move. “The position of the Philippine government is that we will not respect such a resolution, but we will continue engaging the UN through the different mechanisms which we already availed and always respected throughout the years. There was a certain sense of frustration because of the cases that were filed before the ICC without first going through the domestic remedies and the domestic channels, wherein remedies can be considered to be able to address these cases that were brought before the attention of the ICC. So the Philippine government thought it was very disrespectful and violative of the processes,” PHRCS Undersecretary Severo Catura said. \c\cIn June 2020, a report by the UN Human Rights Office condemned the Philippine president’s so-called “war on drugs” and stated that more than 8,000 people , and at least 248 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists have died over the past five years. \c\cTwo months after the UN revealed that the Philippine government’s policies related to its war on drugs have caused systematic violations including killings, arbitrary detentions, and vilification of dissent, the government introduced HRC Resolution No. 45. \c\cThere was no voting for the Resolution. It requested High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet to provide support for the country in the continued fulfilment of its international human rights obligations and commitments. \c\cFollowing the UN Report, High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet called for the United Nations Human Rights Council to consider supporting new accountability measures against perpetrators of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines’ war on illegal drugs whilst also reiterating concerns over proposed new anti-terror legislation, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 stating “The recent passage of the new Anti-Terrorism Act heightens our concerns about the blurring of important distinctions between criticism, criminality and terrorism, the law could have a further chilling effect on human rights and humanitarian work, hindering support to vulnerable and marginalized communities... So I would I urge the President to refrain from signing the law, and to initiate a broad-based consultation process to draft legislation that can effectively prevent and counter violent extremism, but which contains some safeguards to prevent its misuse against people engaged in peaceful criticism and advocacy." According to Ms. Bachelet’s office, the campaign against illegal drugs has been linked to the deaths of 73 children. These figures “are not exhaustive...the youngest victim was five months old,” the OHCHR report noted. Echoing these concerns, Ms. Bachelet underscored that the operation was being carried out “without due regard for the rule of law, due process and the human rights of people who may be using or selling drugs. The report finds that the killings have been widespread and systematic – and they are ongoing.” The High Commissioner also addressed long-running concerns of “near-impunity” for perpetrators of illegal killings during police operations highlighted in the report. It details how the Philippines Police Internal Affairs Service (IAS) automatically investigates any deaths that occur during police operations, and yet of more than 4,580 investigations, “the Government has cited only one case – that of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos – where three police officers were convicted of a drug campaign-related killing”. Ms. Bachelet added: “The State has an obligation to conduct independent investigations into the grave violations we have documented. In the absence of clear and measurable outcomes from domestic mechanisms, the Council should consider options for international accountability measures.”\c\cA number of observers have compared the mass killings of alleged users and dealers to a genocide, and the ICC has opened a case of crimes against humanity. Writing in the Washington Post, Maia Szalavitz argued that the campaign has not had much blowback because drug users are seen by many as worthless members of society and therefore easy targets. In his book Dopeworld, author Niko Vorobyov has compared the drug war to the stages of annihilation outlined by Raul Hilberg to the Holocaust:\c\cIdentification – singling out a group of people as subhuman. Duterte has said meth addicts have shrunken brains. \c\cConfiscation and concentration – finding a way of taking those people's property, before taking themselves away, either to prisons, concentration camps, or to be deported. \c\cAnnihilation – the final solution, where the unwanted people(s) are simply exterminated. \c\cDuterte has himself likened his actions to Hitler. At a press conference on September 30, 2016, Duterte appeared to make a comparison between the drug war and the Holocaust. He said that "Hitler massacred three million Jews. Now there are three million drug addicts. I’d be happy to slaughter them." His remarks generated an international outcry. United States Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said the statement was "deeply troubling." The German government told the Philippine ambassador that Duterte's remarks were "unacceptable." On October 2, Duterte announced, "I apologize profoundly and deeply to the Jewish." He explained, "It's not really that I said something wrong but rather they don\'t really want you to tinker with the memory."\c\cIn 2016, director Brillante Mendoza filmed Ma\' Rosa, which follows the story of a mother who sells the local methamphetamine. The film's main actress, Jaclyn Jose, won  Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival of the same year. In 2018, Mendoza filmed Alpha: The Right to Kill, which follows similar themes of poverty, drugs, and corruption in the police force. In the same year, Netflix aired its first series from the Philippines entitled AMO, also made by Mendoza. \c\cThe long-running action drama series Ang Probinsyano has also tackled the issue in its storyline. The show's portrayal of the PNP and its handling of the drug war, however, was criticized by the PNP Chief Oscar Albayalde because of its alleged negative portrayal. The PNP at one point also withdrew its support for the show and threatened legal action if the show's story was not changed. Netizens, politicians, artists and others, on the other hand, defended the show's depiction of the police force and of the drug war. \c\cIn 2018, Alyx Ayn Arumpac filmed the documentary Aswang, which frames events related to the drug war, trailing journalists and interviewing left-behinds of the victims. It premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) in the Netherlands. \c\cAlso in 2018, the action film BuyBust was released which similarly tackled the subject of the drug war. The film was released imternationally and was an entry to the 2018 New York Asian Film Festival. \c\cIn 2019, a multi award-winning joint production by PBS and the BBC, On The President's Orders highlights the war on drugs in the Philippines. Produced and directed by two-time Emmy Award-winning and five-time BAFTA-nominated director James Jones, also filmed and directed by Emmy Award-winner for cinematography Olivier Sarbil. \c\cHustisya is a rap song about the drug war which was created by local artists inspired by the death of their friend immortalized in a photograph often compared to Michelangelo's Pieta. \c\cIn December 2016, American singer James Taylor posted on social media that he had cancelled his concert in Manila, which was set for February 2017, citing the increasing number of deaths related to the drug war. \c\cThe 2017 song Manila Ice, by musician Eyedress, and its music video depict violence and corruption and were created as a response to the drug war. \c\cIn May 2019, PDEA called for a ban on rapper Shanti Dope's song Amatz for allegedly promoting marijuana use, which is illegal in the Philippines. The Concerned Artists of the Philippines criticized the PDEA for the attempt to suppress freedom of expression. In June 2019, the National Telecommunications Commission ordered the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines) to stop the airing of the song. \c\cThe 2019 rap album Kolateral tells the story of the Philippine drug war through the eyes of the drug war's victims. The album features 12 songs by artists BLKD (pronounced Balakid), Calix, and others. \c\cOn December 10, 2019, Irish musician Bono of U2 sent a message to Duterte during his visit to Manila for concert tour, saying that he "can’t compromise on human rights." In a press conference, Bono said that he had been a member of Amnesty International and he is "critical" when it comes to human rights. During the U2's concert, the band paid tribute to important women in the history such late president Corazon Aquino and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa by flashing the images on the large screen. \c\cOn April 11, 2017, The New York Times won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography on their Philippine drug war report. The story was published on December 7, 2016, and was titled "They Are Slaughtering Us Like Animals."\c\cThe La Pieta or the "Philippines Pieta," named after the sculpture by Michelangelo, refers to the photograph of Jennilyn Olayres holding the lifeless corpse of Michael Siaron, who was shot dead by unidentified assailants in Pasay, Metro Manila, on July 23, 2016. The image was widely used in the national press. The death of Michael Siaron remains unsolved for almost a year. Malacañang asserts that the man behind the killing were committed by drug syndicates themselves. After Siaron was shot dead by unidentified assailants, a writing on a cardboard states, "Wag tularan si Siaron dahil pusher umano," was placed on his body. One year and three months after he was killed, the police identified the suspected assailant as Nesty Santiago through a ballistic exam on the recovered firearm. Santiago was apparently a member of a syndicate involved in robberies, car thefts, hired killings and illegal drugs. The Pasay city police declared his death as "case closed". However, Santiago was also killed by riding-in-tandem on December 29, 2016. No further investigation were made. \c\cA photo of a body of an alleged drug dealer, killed during a police anti-drug operation, in Manila by Noel Celis has been selected as one of Time magazine's top 100 photos of 2017. \c\cThere are various mobile games featuring Duterte fighting criminals, many of which have since been removed by Apple Inc. from their App Store following an appeal by various regional organizations. \c\cIn 2016, a group of artists exhibited Everyday Impunity: Ang Mga Walang Pangalan which took place during Art Fair Philippines.

The spectator is invited to sit and to hear Christine, his daughter, who talks about her father and their life in Payatas. \c\cA work of muralist Archie Oclos is also attributed to the Philippine drug war. His work entitled Ang Mamatay ng Dahil Sa\'yo at the Cultural Center of the Philippines shows a dead body wrapped in a blanket. The work consists of 20,000 black ink strokes, roughly the estimated casualties of the drug war. \c\cAn anthology of poems, Bloodlust: Philippine Protest Poetry (From Marcos to Duterte), was published in 2017. Edited by Alfred Yuzon and Gemino Abad, the book contains works by 65 Filipino poets writing about dictatorship, mass killings, and related subjects. \c\cReuters also covered the war on drugs with their 2018 Pulitzer Prize winning special report, Duterte's War, by Clare Baldwin, Andrew Marshall and Manuel Mogato.

The 2009–present phase of the Somali Civil War is concentrated in southern and central Somalia and portions of north eastern Kenya. It began in early February 2009 with the conflict between the forces of the Federal Government of Somalia, assisted by African Union peacekeeping troops, and various militant groups and factions. The violence has displaced thousands of people in the southern part of the country. The conflict has also seen fighting between the Sufi Ahlu Sunna Waljama\'a and Al-Shabaab. \c\cOn 16 October 2011, the Kenyan Army crossed the border into Somalia in Operation Linda Nchi against Al-Shabaab.[citation needed] It aimed to seize Kismayo and set up a buffer zone against Al-Shabaab. In 2012, Kismayo was captured. \c\cIn August 2014, the Somali government-led Operation Indian Ocean was launched to clean up the remaining insurgent-held pockets in the countryside. \c\cIn 2017, the 14 October and 28 October Mogadishu bombings were responsible for the deaths of over 500 individuals and injured more than 400. \c\cEstablished in 2004 and internationally recognized, the Transitional Federal Government's (TFG) support in Somalia was waning until the United States-backed 2006 intervention by the Ethiopian military, which helped drive out the rival Islamic Courts Union (ICU) in Mogadishu and solidify the TFG's rule. Following this defeat, the ICU splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to withdraw from the country, leaving behind an underequipped African Union (AU) peacekeeping force. A power sharing deal ensued between an Islamist splinter group led by Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed's Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia Djibouti faction (ARS-D) and TFG Prime Minister Nur Hassan in Djibouti. Al-Shabaab, which had separated from the moderate Islamists of the insurgency, rejected the peace deal and continued to take territories. It was joined by Hizbul Islam, which is an amalgamation of four Islamist group including the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia – Asmara faction. Another Islamist group, Ahlu Sunnah Waljama\'ah, which was allied with the TFG and supported by Ethiopia, continues to attack al-Shabaab and take over towns as well although they have been effective only in the central region of Galguduud, where they ousted al-Shabaab from most of the region. \c\cAfter the parliament took in 275 officials from the moderate Islamist opposition, ARS leader Sheikh Ahmed was elected TFG President on 31 January 2009. Since then, the al-Shabaab radical Islamists have accused the new TFG President of accepting the secular transitional government and have continued the civil war since he arrived in Mogadishu at the presidential palace in early February 2009. \c\cAl-Shabaab also vowed to fight the government. On 4 February 2009, four Islamist groups, including Hassan Dahir Aweys\' Eritrean branch of the ARS merged and created the group Hisbi Islam, to oppose the new government of Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. New TFG President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed arrived in Mogadishu as a president for the first time on 7 February 2009. The al-Shabaab and other radical Islamists began firing at the new TFG president hours later. They accused the new President of accepting the secular transitional government. \c\cOn 8 February, heavy fighting broke out in southern Mogadishu. al-Shabaab leader Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur) met with Sharif Ahmed for peace talks during his visit to Mogadishu, while Omar Iman rejected the president. During these negotiations, Sharif Ahmed said that he would be prepared to enforce Sharia Law in Somalia, which was the radical groups\' main demand. However, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow, a former Al-Shabab spokesman, denied having talked to Sharif Ahmed and vowed to continue fighting until his demands for Sharia Law were met. Sheikh Mukhtar Robow warned Nigeria against sending peace keepers to Somalia, as al-Shabaab view the AU peace keepers as occupying forces. An offensive was launched two days later by al-Shabaab to take the Bakool province. Government officials who had been ousted from Baidoa had been amassing troops in the city of Hudur (Xudur) and planning a major offensive to re-take Baidoa. Islamist forces attacked the province and reached the capital where they started a battle against government forces. In Galmudug, Clan militia took the town of Masagaway from al-Shabaab while there was also fighting in Warsheekh. \c\cThe spokesman for al-Shabaab at the time, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur), rebuffed reports from several media outlets that a mutual agreement between him and newly elected president Sharif Ahmed was made. In his 12 February statement he also added that he had no intention to contact the president on any matters, and that they would continue fighting against foreign troops and what he described as an "apostate" government. Al-Shabaab also vowed war against the new government. On 22 February, a double suicide bomb attack on an AU base in Mogadishu left 11 Burundian soldiers dead and another 15 wounded. Two days later heavy fighting erupted in the city as TFG and AU forces attempted to retake the city from radical Islamist forces. The fighting lasted for two days and killed 87 people, including: 48 civilians, 15 insurgents and 6 TFG policemen. At the same time as the fighting raged in Mogadishu, al-Shabaab forces took the town of Hudor, to the north-west, in fighting that killed another 20 people: 10 TFG soldiers, 6 insurgents and 4 civilians. On 28 February, it appeared that Hisbi Islam would sign a ceasefire with the Transitional Federal Government. However, by 1 March, it was clear that no ceasefire would be given, despite President Sharif Ahmed having agreed to proposals for a truce and having offered to accept the implementation of Sharia Law but refused to move troops from civilian areas despite the Islamists doing so. Al-Shabaab announced on 6 May that it would continue the war even if AMISOM withdrew. The Somali government in turn later announced an immediate blockade on airstrips and seaports under insurgent control to stop the flow of weapons reaching them. \c\cOn 7 May, a fierce battle for control of Mogadishu started between al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam against the TFG. Hundreds were killed and injured and tens of thousands were displaced. By 11 May, rebel forces gained the upper hand and made large gains taking over most of the capital. The rebels came close to overthrowing the government before fighting ended on 14 May, new rounds of fighting would last all through August. By 16 May, al-Shabaab captured the strategic town of Jowhar, which connects Mogadishu with central Somalia. One of the largest battles of the war took place about 3 weeks later on 5 June when Hizbul Islam captured Wabho leaving 123 combatants killed. It was also rumoured Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys was injured in this battle. On 19 June, the transitional parliament speaker Sheikh Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe asked the international community to send foreign troops to Somalia within the following 24 hours. He stated that the government's power is on the verge of being defeated by Islamist forces in the Somali capital. The Somali cabinet declared a state of emergency, and asked for help from neighboring countries which included Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Yemen. Ethiopia refused saying intervention needs an international mandate. Al-Shabaab responded by 21 June saying they would fight any foreign troops, and made threats against potential Kenyan intervention. \c\cPresident Sheikh Sharif Ahmed declared a state of emergency by 22 June, as a new round of fighting in Mogadishu left 12 dead and 20 injured with hundreds more fleeing the city. The notion of Ethiopian troops intervening in the conflict caused defections by local government administration officials. Areas affected by this included Beledweyne, El-gal village, and Hiraan. The effects also caused many pro-government Islamic Courts Union officials to resign. In response, TFG forces led by general Muktar Hussein Afrah started military manoeuvers in the East side of Mogadishu. On 6 July, The Amir of al-Shabaab (Sheikh Moktar Ali Zubeyr) gave government forces an ultimatum of 5 days to hand over their weapons which was rejected. At some point, foreign aid to the government was provided in the form of security advisors. On 17 July, two of these advisors (sent by France) were captured by insurgents. The Somali government gave permission for French commandos to launch operations inside Somalia to free the 2 French nationals that held by al-Shabaab. France responded on 22 July by sending in warships and helicopters near the ports of Mogadishu and Marka declaring they would undertake military operations to free the two French military advisers who had been captured by insurgents. One of the hostages eventually was able to escape by August 2009, while the other was last seen in a video released in June 2010 asking for assistance. The United States also took up targeting Al-Qaeda members such as Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, who was killed along with 6 others in military helicopter raid on 15 September. \c\cThe armed conflict between Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab began due to a dispute between the faction of the Ras Kamboni Brigades led by Sheikh Ahmed "Madoobe" and al-Shabaab, over a power sharing agreement in Kisimayo. Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab had made a power sharing agreement for the city, where the power would rotate between the two factions, with each faction controlling the city for periods of six months. However, due to clan politics al-Shabaab refused to let the power rotation take place. This led to internal problems within Hizbul Islam as its ARS-A and JABISO factions, which were aligned with al-Shabaab in Hiran and Mogadishu, refused to support the Ras Kamboni Brigades, while Anole remained neutral. It also led to a split within the Ras Kamboni Brigades, with a faction led by Hizbul Islam's deputy chairman Sheikh Hassan "Turki" refusing to back Ahmad "Madoobe" and instead siding with al-Shabaab. It was reported on 1 October that heavy fighting in Kisimayo had broken out between the two factions, al-Shabaab controlled most of the city with dozens of casualties reported by the afternoon. At least 17 more people were killed in a series of battles overnight on 5 October. Hizbul Islam claimed that they had captured foreign fighters in the battle. The battle eventually ended with a decisive victory for al-Shabaab, which expelled Madbobe's Ras Kamboni Brigade forces from the city. \c\cThroughout 2009 November, fighting between the two factions continued as the battle lines moved into Southern Somalia, resulting in a decrease in insurgent attacks at Mogadishu targeting government forces (TFG) and their allies (AMISOM). Sheikh Ahmad Madobe's forces were ultimately overpowered by al-Shabaab and its local allies, and forced to withdraw from the Lower Jubba region and most of Southern Somalia. The merger between al-Shabaab and Sheikh Hassan Turki's branch of the Ras Kamboni Brigades occurred early in 2010 (February) with a call for other groups in Hizbul Islam to do the same. Additional battles throughout 2010 were fought between Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab in central Somalia as fighting moved from the Hiran region to the Bay region, to Lower Shabelle. Hizbul Islam eventually was forced to surrender the Luuq District in Gedo region to al-Shabaab, after which the group announced that it would merge with al-Shabaab. From mid-December al-Shabaab fighters started taking over Hizbul Islam positions. The merge was confirmed on 20 December, when Hizbul Islam Chairman Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys and Sheikh Mohammad Osman Arus, the organisation's official spokesman, surrendered to al-Shabaab and disbanded the organisation. \c\cAl-Shabaab controlled roughly half the lands claimed by the Somali government at their greatest extent in 2009 July. With the help of allies, government forces slowly started to make gains that would lead to a retake of lost territory through various military operations. An offensive on 20 February 2011 was dubbed by AU Representative Wafula Wamunyinyi as the "Battle of Gashandiga." This offensive involved AMISOM troops destroying a large complex of al-Shabaab trenches, killing six al-Shabaab commanders in Mogadishu. Towards the end of February, disturbances moved into Mogadishu again in the form of one suicide attack and heavy shelling as al-Shabaab fighters attempted to re-take lost territory. This push resulted in the deaths of at least 47 people, rebels displayed one wounded and five dead Burundian AMISOM soldiers. Another offensive was opened up between 26 February and 28 February by TFG troops with support of Ethiopian soldiers in Bula Hawo (southern Somalia), resulting in 33 deaths. \c\cBy 5 March, AMISOM and TFG forces claimed to control seven of the city's districts, while six were contested and three were controlled by anti-government forces. Al-Shabaab responded to the government offensive by putting up roadblocks to prevent the movement of goods from the seaport. This adversely affected both sides of the conflict, as the TFG controlled the port and its profits. At the same time though, places such as Bakaara Market were controlled by the insurgents where many of the goods were bound to be sold. It was also reported by this time that up to 53 AMISOM may have died in the clashes, which included 43 Burundian and 10 Ugandans. An additional 1,000 peacekeepers to assist in the TFG's renewed offensive against al-Shabaab were brought in, and by 16 March AMISOM had a force of nearly 9,000. \c\cThe 2010–11 battle of Mogadishu began when al-Shabaab militants launched an offensive to capture the city. The battle soon swung in favor of government forces, who were able to drive the militant group out by 11 October 2011. The complete capture of the city took place on 7 September 2012, when the Transitional Federal Government's troops and their AMISOM allies managed to secure the city. Around the same time witnesses reported Al-Shabaab vehicles abandoning their bases in the capital for the south-central city of Baidoa. The group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage described the exodus as a tactical retreat, and vowed to continue the insurgency against the national government. Observers have suggested that the pullout may have been caused in part by internal ideological rifts in the rebel organization. The city was by no means safe after al-Shabaab withdrew as the militant group continued hit and run tactics in the Northern part of the city. Suicide bombs continued to be an occurrence lasting into 2020 (see below). \c\cOn 2 to 3 September, fighting was reported in Puntland that resulted in the deaths of up to 60 people, including 8 Puntland soldiers and 40 Al-Shabaab militants, with Insurgents being repelled. Al-Shabaab claimed on 7 September that they have captured 2 Kenyan troops who were on a surveillance mission near the Kenyan-Somali Border. Puntland forces captured 18 members of Al-Shabaab in counter-terrorism operations on 8 September. \c\cAl-Shabaab attacked the southern town of Elwaq on 10 September 2011, resulting in the deaths of 12 insurgents and soldiers. The next day, Somali troops fought back, retaking the town after militants fled on captured technicals. The bodies of 30 militants were later found, some of them children. Conversely, Al-Shabaab claimed they killed around 70 government aligned troops and captured 10 technicals. \c\cThe Burundian military lost 51 soldiers in October, causing anger among Burundians, who believe that their country is sacrificing too much. Many Burundians have urged other AU members to contribute troops to the Somalia mission.  Nigeria, Djibouti, and Guinea have indicated sending troops, but all have yet to contribute. \c\cOn 4 September 2012 the Kenyan Navy shelled Kismayo. This was part of an AU offensive to capture the city from al-Shabab fighters. The harbour was shelled two times and the airport three times. According to a UN report the export of charcoal through Kismayo is a major source of income for al-Shabab. \c\cOn 28 September 2012, the Somali National Army assisted by AMISOM troops and Ras Kamboni militia launched an assault on Kismayo, Al-Shabaab's last major stronghold. The allied forces reportedly managed to re-capture much of the city from the insurgents. \c\cIn August 2014, the Somali government-led Operation Indian Ocean was launched to clean up the remaining insurgent-held pockets in the countryside. On 1 September 2014, a U.S. drone strike carried out as part of the broader mission killed Al-Shabaab leader Moktar Ali Zubeyr. U.S. authorities hailed the raid as a major symbolic and operational loss for Al-Shabaab, and the Somali government offered a 45-day amnesty to all moderate members of the militant group. Political analysts also suggested that the insurgent commander's death will likely lead to Al-Shabaab's fragmentation and eventual dissolution. \c\cAt the end of the month of July 2015, AMISOM and Somalia National Army regained many villages and major towns of Baardhere and Dinsoor. \c\cOn 15 January 2016, Al Shabaab attacked a Kenyan-run AMISOM base in El Adde Somalia, overrunning the compound and killing approximately 60 soldiers. Al Shabaab then regained the important town of Marka, 45 km from the capital, and the port of Gard in Puntland region (March 2016). The resurgence of Al Shabaab could entail serious implications for the humanitarian sector. \c\cOn 5 March 2016, U.S. airstrikes carried out by aircraft and unmanned drones killed more than 150 Al-Shabaab terrorists at a terrorist training camp called "Camp Raso", located about 120 miles north of Mogadishu as they were completing "training for a large-scale attack" according to a Pentagon spokesman. The camp had been under surveillance for some time before the strike. In the early hours of 9 March 2016, U.S. special forces and Somali national army special forces killed between 1 and 15 Al-Shabaab terrorists in a heliborne-attack on the Al-Shabaab-controlled town of Awdhegele, as well as capturing an undisclosed number of high-value Al-Shabaab figures the mililtants were training for a major operation against coalition forces. \c\cOn 11/12 April 2016, two U.S. airstrikes on Al-Shabaab targets in the town of Kismayo killed about a dozen suspected militants who posed a "imminent threat" to American troops in the country. As of May 2016, roughly 50 U.S. special operations troops operate at undisclosed locations across southern Somalia, with their headquarters at the airport in Mogadishu; advising and assisting, Kenyan, Somali and Ugandan forces in their fight against Al-Shabaab. Also in that month, U.S. personnel helped those forces plan an operation against illegal checkpoints. \c\cOn 12 May 2016, a small group of U.S. military advisers accompanied some Ugandan soldiers during a raid on an illegal taxation checkpoint just west of Mogadishu, when the Ugandans came under fire from 15 to 20 al Shabaab militants, the U.S. commander on the ground called in a "defensive" airstrike, killing five militants and wounding two more. Two days previously, the U.S. provided helicopters and advise and assist in support of a Somali military mission against a group of al Shabaab militants, which one defense official said was also defensive because they had intelligence that the al Shabaab fighters were planning an attack on the AMISOM installation nearby. No word on how many al Shabaab were killed or wounded in that operation. On 13 May, a U.S. strike targeted nine al-Shabab militants, three of them were allegedly killed. \c\cOn the night of 31 May 2016, two senior Al-Shabaab operatives; Mohamud Dulyadeyn, the plotter behind the Garissa University attack in April 2015 and Maalim Daud, head of Al-Shabaab's intelligence hit squads and another 16 members from Al-Shabaab were killed by the Somali National Army and anti-terror partners. Defense Department spokeswoman Lt. Col. Michelle L. Baldanza told CNN "U.S. forces supported this Somali-led operation in an advise-and-assist role,". \c\cOn 1 June 2016, Al Shabaab militants attacked with a car bomb on the gate of Ambassador Hotel in Mogadishu, Somalia. At least 15 people have been killed in the attack, among 10 civilian pedestrians and two members of parliament near the gate. Also that day, the Pentagon announced that it had conducted an airstrike that killed a senior Al-Shabaab leader in Somalia on 27 May. On 3 August 2016, a contingent of elite American troops acting as military advisers assisted Somali commandos in an assault on an al-Shabaab checkpoint in Saakow, as the Somali-led force approached the checkpoint the militants opened fire, a gun battle ensued that resulted in 3 militants killed. \c\cOn 29 September 2016, a Somali regional government demanded an explanation from the United States after an airstrike killed 22 civilians and other soldiers instead of the targeted al-Shabab militants in Galmudug. The Military Times also reported that on 26 September a bomb-manufacturing network linked al-Shabaab attacked a small team of U.S. and Somali troops, who were conducting an operation near Kismayo, with small-arms fire. A Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. military "conducted a self-defense strike to neutralize the threat and in doing so killed nine enemy fighters." Also on 28 September, near the town of Galkayo, a Somali army unit conducting counterterrorism operations nearby, when the Somali soldiers came under fire from al-Shabab militants. The Somali soldiers engaged them, then broke contact and rejoined with their nearby American advisers and soon afterwards the militants "began to maneuver in an offensive manner" so the U.S. conducted a self-defense airstrike, killing 4 militants. \c\cIn late March 2017, President Donald Trump signed off a new strategy granting AFRICOM more freedom in counterterrorist operations. \c\cStars and Stripes reported that in addition to the stepping-up of airstrikes, US special forces on the frontlines with Somali forces have also been increased, conventional US troops give lessons in building defense institutions, with added support from other nations. \c\cCNN reported that General Thomas Waldhauser, commander of AFRICOM, told reporters in April that the US seeks to help Somali security forces gain the ability to provide for their own security by 2021. \c\cThe New York Times reported that on 4 May 2017, a US Navy SEAL team partnered with Somali National Army forces, carried out a mission on an al-Shabaab-occupied complex around 60 kilometres (40 mi) west of Mogadishu. Fox News reported that they targeting what Pentagon spokesperson Captain Jeff Davis said was a "group of people" associated with attacks on Mogadishu. The New York Times reported that Defence Department officials said that Somali forces were to have led the operation, with the SEALs hanging back in an advise, assist and accompany role, however Brig.Gen. David J. Furness, the commander of the military's task force for the Horn of Africa, said that American and Somali forces were traveling together in a single group. Whilst approaching the complex, the militants opened fire and the mission was aborted, Senior chief petty officer Kyle Milliken was killed, 2 other SEALs and an interpreter were wounded. Captain Jeff Davis said that the mission "resulted in the death of three Shabaab operatives including Moalin Osman Abdi Badil," the group quickly returned to the aircraft that had taken it to the area and was exfilled. Davis described Badil as an al-Shabaab leader responsible for gathering information on troop movements in order to support attacks on Somali and African Union forces and that he had been linked to the death of several soldiers and at least one civilian. \c\cCNN reported that on 11 June 2017, that a US air strike killed 8 al-Shabaab militants in Sakow, the president of Somalia said that "This was a successful strike which destroyed a key Al-Shabaab command and supply hub," and that "This will ultimately disrupt the enemy's ability to conduct new attacks within Somalia." CNN reported that on 23 July 2017, The US carried out a targeted airstrike an al-Shabaab regional commander in Banadir. Fox News reported that on 30 July 2017, a US strike near Tortoroow in southern Somalia which was coordinated with regional partners as a direct response to al-Shabaab's actions which included attacks on Somali forces, killed Ali Jabal, who was considered a senior al-Shabaab terrorist and was responsible for leading forces operating in the Mogadishu and Banadiir area, including planning and carrying out attacks in Mogadishu. \c\cABC reported that on 10 August 2017, airstrikes conducted by drones in Banaadir in a joint operation against al-Shabaab fighters, killing a high-level al-Shabaab leader. The airstrikes marked the fourth offensive airstrike against al-Shabaab since the new authorisation in March. CNN reported that on 17 August 2017, the US conducted a "self defense" drone strike in Jilib after a joint US-Somali force, consisting of Somali troops and US advisors, came under direct attack by al-Shabaab militants and a firefight ensued, 7 militants were killed. \c\cMilitary.com reported that on 3 November 2017, that a US drone conducted two airstrikes against Islamic State in Somalia, at least six missiles were used which struck in Buqa, 37 miles north of Qandala, AFRICOM said in a statement that "several terrorists" were killed and that the strikes were carried out in coordination with Somalia's government; marking the first time the US has conducted airstrikes against ISS terrorists in Somalia. CNN reported that US drone aircraft conducted 5 strikes between 9 and 12 November against al-Shabaab and ISS linked militants, killing 36 al-Shabaab and 4 ISS terrorists. One of the strikes killed an al-Shabaab terrorist who had attacked a joint US-Somali military convoy in Gaduud. CNN reported that a US airstrike on a camp 125 miles northwest of Mogadishu killed more than 100 al-Shabaab militants; the US now estimates there are between 3,000 and 6,000 al-Shabaab fighters and less than 250 ISIS operatives in Somalia Military Times reported that on 14 November, a US drone strike roughly 60 miles northwest of Mogadishu killed several al-Shabaab militants. CNN reported that on 24 December, a U.S. airstrike in southern Somalia killed 13 al-Shabaab terrorists. \c\cBy 2019, the United States has been heavily involved through airstrikes in the Somali conflict. On 14 April 2019, AFRICOM managed to kill Abdulhakim Dhuqub, a high ranking ISIS-Somalia official, near Xiriiro, Bari Region.

Days later on 24 July, a suicide bomber detonated inside the office of the Mayor of Mogadishu killing six government officials, mayor Abdirahman Abdi Osman was hospitalised in Doha, Qatar before succumbing to his injuries on 1 August. \c\cOn 26 August 2019 Somali army captured Burweryn from Al-Shabaab. \c\cOn 5 January 2020, Al-Shabbab militants attacked the airstrip of the military base Camp Simba used by US and Kenyan forces. One US serviceman and two contractors were killed and two US servicemen wounded, four militants were also killed in the gunfight. \c\cOn 19 March 2020 Somali army captured Jamale town from Al-Shabaab with support from US military. \c\cOn 31 May 2020, the Somali military shot dead approximately 18 al-Shabaab militants and injured several others in an operation conducted in the southern lower Shabelle region. \c\cOn 3 April 2021, Al-Shabaab militants attacked two SNA bases near Mogadishu resulting in several hours of fighting. The SNA claim to have killed 76 Al-Shabaab militants and claim to have captured another 10. Al-Shabaab claim to have also killed 47 SNA troops in the attack.

As part of its duties, AMISOM also supports the Transitional Federal Government's forces in their battle against Al-Shabaab militants. \c\cAMISOM was created by the African Union's Peace and Security Council on 19 January 2007 with an initial six-month mandate. On 21 February 2007 the United Nations Security Council approved the mission's mandate. Subsequent six-monthly renewals of AMISOM's mandate by the African Union Peace and Security Council have also been authorised by the United Nations Security Council. \c\cAMISOM's UN mandate was extended for a further six months in August 2008 by UNSCR 1831. The AMISOM's mandate has been extended each period that it has been up for review. It is now set to be reviewed again on 16 January 2013. \c\cOn 12 November 2013, the UN Security Council adopted SC Resolution 2124 (2013) extending AMISOM's mandate from 28 February 2014 to 31 October 2014. Acting upon the force's request, the resolution also increases AMISOM's maximum authorized strength from 17,731 to 22,126 troops. \c\cThe force, which has been reportedly engaged in fighting in Mogadishu and throughout the country, has reportedly suffered significant casualties during their mission, although no precise figures have been issued by the contributing countries. \c\cThe United National Development Program for Somalia spends about $50 million each year, though these funds are not related to military aid. Instead these programs, such as Employment Generation for Early Recovery (EGER). As of October 2010, the U.S. State Department noted the United States directly obligated over $229 million to support AMISOM, and paid for other UN assistance for the mission indirectly through its obligations to the international body. \c\cIn January 2013, the U.S. announced that it was set to exchange diplomatic notes with the new central government of Somalia, re-establishing official ties with the country for the first time in 20 years. According to the Department of State, the decision was made in recognition of the significant progress that the Somali authorities had achieved on both the political and war fronts. The move is expected to grant the Somali government access to new sources of development funds from American agencies as well as international bodies like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, thereby facilitating the ongoing reconstruction process. In addition to diplomatic ties; roughly 50 U.S. special operations troops operate at undisclosed locations across southern Somalia advising and assisting, Kenyan, Somali and Ugandan forces in their fight against Al-Shabaab. \c\cAt the behest of the Somali and American federal governments, among other international actors, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved United Nations Security Council Resolution 2093 during its 6 March 2013 meeting to suspend the 21-year arms embargo on Somalia. The endorsement officially lifts the purchase ban on light weapons for a provisional period of one year, but retains certain restrictions on the procurement of heavy arms such as surface-to-air missiles, howitzers and cannons. On 9 April 2013, the U.S. government likewise approved the provision of defense articles and services by the American authorities to the Somali Federal Government. At the request of the Somali authorities and AMISOM, the U.S. military in late 2013 also established a small team of advisers in Mogadishu to provide consultative and planning support to the allied forces. \c\cThe United Kingdom is also involved in combating Islamist terrorists in Somalia, since 2009, members of the Special Air Service and the Special Reconnaissance Regiment have been deployed to Camp Lemonnier to conduct counter-terrorist operations against Islamist terrorists in Somalia; they have carrying out surveillance missions of Britons believed to be travelling to Somalia for terrorist training and they are also working with US counterparts observing and "targeting" local terror suspects. They have also been carrying out a similar role in Yemen. In May 2016, it was reported that 70 UK military personnel have arrived in Somalia to counter Al-Shabaab as part of a UN peacekeeping mission; 10 soldiers will offer medical, engineering and logistical support to AMISOM. Personnel will also be sent to South Sudan to carry out a similar role. \c\cOn 16 October 2016, the New York Times reported that American officials said the White House had quietly broadened the president's authority for the use of force in Somalia by allowing airstrikes to protect American and African troops as they combat fighters from al-Shabaab. About 200 to 300 American Special Operations troops work with soldiers from Somalia and other African nations like Kenya and Uganda to carry out more than a half-dozen raids per month, according to senior American military officials. The operations are a combination of ground raids and drone strikes. SEAL Team 6 has been heavily involved in many of these operations. American military officials said once ground operations are complete, American troops working with Somali forces often interrogate prisoners at temporary screening facilities, including one in Puntland, before the detainees are transferred to more permanent Somali-run prisons. The Pentagon has only acknowledged a small fraction of these operations, announcing 13 ground raids and airstrikes so far in 2016 (3 of which took place in September) — up from 5 in 2015; according to data compiled by New America (a Washington Think tank) the strikes have killed about 25 civilians and 200 people suspected of being militants. At a former Russian fighter jet base in Baledogle, U.S. Marines and private contractors are working to build up a Somali military unit designed to combat Al-Shabaab throughout the country. \c\cOn 30 March 2017, CNN reported that US President Donald Trump signed off a decision by the White House which approved a new strategy granting AFRICOM the authority to step up counterterrorism strikes in Somalia; under the new strategy, the US military will now be able to conduct precision airstrikes in support of the Somalia National Army and AMISOM forces. The new authorization designates some regions of Somalia an "area of active hostilities," freeing counterterrorism strikes there from restrictions governing other strikes outside the areas; an official said that the designated areas will not include Mogadishu and Puntland. Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon Spokesman said that "The additional support provided by this authority will help deny al-Shabaab safe havens from which it could attack US citizens or US interests in the region." Another official said that the legal basis for the new authority is the 2001 AUMF. In mid-April 2017, it was reported that 40 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division were deployed to Somalia on 2 April 2017 to improve the capabilities of the Somalia Army in combating Islamist militants. AFRICOM stated that the troops will focus on bolstering the Somali army's logistics capabilities; an AFRICOM spokesman said that "This mission is not associated with teaching counterextremism tactics" and that the Somali government requested the training. \c\cOn 16 June 2020, Human Rights Watch revealed the inconsistency in investigation by the US authorities in a 2 February airstrike, which killed one woman. And a 10 March attack that killed five men, including a child. \c\cPresident Donald Trump ordered the Department of Defense to remove the majority of the 700 U.S. military troops in Somalia from the country in December 2020. \c\cOn 16 February, Somali MP Mohamud Sayid Adan, former Mogadishu mayor Mohamed Omar Habeeb and local police officer Hassan Dhicisow, were arrested by Ethiopian forces in the town of Dolow in Gedo region. \c\cOn 28 May, 2 Ethiopian soldiers, 1 Ethiopian civilian, 2 Somali soldiers, 4 Somali civilians (working for the government) and 4 Somali insurgents were killed when insurgents attacked a convoy carrying Omar Hashi Aden, who was returning from his visit to Ethiopia. \c\cOn 31 May, Ethiopian forces launched search and seizure operations in Hiraan, in Kalaberyr village, near Beledweyn. \c\cOn 12 June, Ethiopian forces with several battle wagons entered in Balanbal town in Galgudud and set up military bases. \c\cOn 14 June, the Ethiopian military said it had come to fight foreign mujahedin which the military described as "foreign enemies of Ethiopia and Somalia" and launched operations to search for them in Balanbal town which they control. Sheik Hassan Ya\'qub Ali, head of the information affairs for Islamic administration in Kisimayo warned the Ethiopians that "there is no candy and dates to eat from here in Somalia. But the men who chased you forcibly from the country are here in Somalia."\c\cThe suicide bombing on 18 June targeted a meeting between TFG and Ethiopian commanders. \c\cOn 19 June, Ethiopian forces entered Bakool and reached Elberde town. They withdrew after holding talks with local clan elders. \c\c22 June, Ethiopian forces started launching search and seizure operations in Kala-beyrka intersection in Hiran region. \c\cThe Ethiopian government then announced it would not intervene without an international mandate. \c\c30 June, Ethiopian forces entered El-gal and Ilka\'adde villages which are less than 20 km north of regional capital Beledweyn. Reports from Kala-beyrka intersection say that more extra troops from Ethiopia crossed from the border. \c\c4 July, Ethiopians withdrew from their bases in Banabal town in Galgudug. \c\c18 July, Ethiopian forces vacated their bases in Yed Village in insurgent-controlled Bakool region. \c\cDuring the weekend of 29–30 August, Ethiopian forces advanced to Beledweyne, supporting a government offensive on the insurgent part of, Beledweyne. They withdrew on 31 August. The assault on Beledweyne by government forces came as the TFG governor of Hiraan (belonging to Sharif Ahmed's ARS-Djibouti faction), Sheikh Abdirahman Ibrahim Ma\'ow, which controls the other part of Beledweyne, withdrew his administration's support for the TFG. \c\c19 March, Mohammed wali Odowa, spokesman of Hizbul Islam's Hiraan administration in Beledweyne, threatened that Hizbul Islam forces would attack any Ethiopian forces which entered Hizbul Islam controlled territories in Hiraan. \c\c20 May, Ethiopian forces seized control of the previously al-Shabaab held towns of Yeed and Elbarde, in Bakool region. Al-Shabaab had captured Elbarde from the TFG on 20 April. \c\cOn 18 July, Ethiopian forces withdrew from all their bases in Hiraan and Bakool regions. Ethiopian forces had held these territories for two months, during which they clashed several times with al-Shabaab forces which control most of Hiraan. Before they withdrew they released over 20 lorries which used to travel between the South and Central regions of Somalia. \c\cOn 1 August, 27,000 Ethiopian troops entered Somalia through the border town of Dolo, where 6,000 Ethiopian forces are based. They advanced deep into Gedo region in the direction of the towns of Beledehawa and Elwak, accompanied by militia of pro-Ethiopian, Somali fraction leaders. In Hiraan, Ethiopian forces which entered along with TFG-forces exchanged fire with al-Shabaab militants and advanced until the Kalaber junction, near Beledweyne. The Ethiopian troops then withdrew to Ferfer. \c\cOn 29 August, there was a second Ethiopian incursion. A large number of Ethiopian forces in military vehicles, accompanied by highly trained TFG forces, entered several villages in al-Shabaab controlled Hiraan region. This came at a time when al-Shabaab militants regularly ventured near the border. Hussein Abdallah, an ASWJ loyalist claimed that the movements were a preliminary action to signal that Ethiopian authorities are able of weakening the Islamist insurgents, to al-Shabaab's leadership. \c\cOn 1 September, Ethiopian forces moved deeper into Gedo region, via Dolow, entering the TFG-held village of Yeed. TFG officials in the region reported they were planning to capture the entire Bay and Bakool regions from al-Shabaab. \c\cOn 30 December, TFG forces clashed with Ethiopian troops in the Jawil district, near Beledweyne, after Ethiopian forces took a TFG soldier into custody. One TFG soldier and one civilian were injured in the clashes. \c\c3 January, Ahlu Sunna Waljamaa official Sheikh Abdi Badel Sheikh Abdullahi, complained about Ethiopian forces in the town of Dolo, in Gedo region. The town is controlled by 300 ASWJ and TFG forces, but it is also home to several Ethiopian military bases. Ethiopian forces had called on ASWJ fighters in the district to lay down their arms. According to a TFG official, three Ethiopian commanders had then come to the town of Dolo and ordered TFG forces to disarm. Ethiopian troops then disarmed a number of TFG and ASWJ forces. Sheikh Abdullahi alleged that Ethiopian forces were doing this because they were outraged by ASWJ's military capability. \c\cOn 19 November, eyewitness reported large number of Ethiopian troops crossing into Somalia. Ethiopian authorities denied this. \c\cAfter a multinational conference held on 25 November in Addis Ababa, IGAD announced that the Ethiopian government had agreed to support the allied forces\' campaign against Al-Shabaab. \c\cOn 31 December 2011, the Transitional Federal Government soldiers and around 3,000 allied Ethiopian army troops attacked Beledweyne in the early morning, capturing it after hours of fighting. They later took control of Baidoa, among other areas. \c\cOn 22 October 2012, the Spokesman of African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) Col. Ali Aden Humed speaking to journalists in Mogadishu on Saturday said that Ethiopian forces present in parts of the regions of Somalia will soon pull out from the country. \c\cThe spokesman said AMISOM troops will take over the areas where Ethiopian forces are holding at the moment. "The plan by AMISOM is to take over the positions held by Ethiopian forces in parts of the regions of the country, Ethiopian troops will soon retreat back to their position along Somalia border" said Col. Ali Aden Humed. \c\cIn 2013, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom announced that Ethiopian troops were pulling out of Baidoa as the situation on the ground was relatively stable and the Somali military and AMISOM forces were now able to assume security duties. The withdrawal was well planned and coordinated. Adhanom added that a pullout could have occurred twelve months earlier, but the allied forces were at the time unprepared to take over, so the move was postponed. Additionally, he asserted that Eritrea was attempting to destabilize Somalia and environs, and that the international community should take the situation seriously since Eritrea was also still allegedly supporting Al-Shabaab. Following the Westgate shooting in Nairobi by Al Shabaab operatives, the Ethiopian government halted its plans to withdraw completely out of Somalia. In November 2013, the Ethiopian government announced that it would integrate its troops that are deployed in Somalia into the AMISOM multinational force. Somalia's Foreign Minister Fowzia Haji Yussuf welcomed the decision, stating that the move would galvanize AMISOM's campaign against the insurgent group. She also emphasized the importance of collaboration between Somalia and Ethiopia. The Ethiopian authorities\' announcement came a month after a failed October bombing attempt by Al-Shabaab in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, and a week after Ethiopia received a renewed terrorism threat from the insurgent group. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure. Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces\' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains. On the other hand, there is a certain amount of unease following Ethiopia's entry into AMISOM given local animosity originating from Ethiopia's heavy handed intervention in 2006. There are also fears that Al Shabaab could use Somali animosity towards Ethiopia as a rallying cry and to recruit more members. It is also believed that some Ethiopian troops in Somalia operate independently from AMISOM. \c\cIn December 2014, the Ethiopian government offered to replace the last AMISOM contingent from Sierra Leone with fresh Ethiopian military reinforcements. \c\cIn 2015, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), announced a new military operation against Al Shabaab, for removing it in the last strong holds in Somalia. The operation involved Ethiopian National Defence and Kenya Defence Forces too. \c\cAt the end of the month of July 2015, AMISOM and Somalia National Army regained many villages and major towns of Baardhere and Dinsoor. \c\cOn 15 December 2018, there were demonstrations in the city of Baidoa in Somalia by supporters of Mukhtar Robow, a presidency candidate, who was arrested two days before by government forces and transferred to Mogadishu. Rowbow is a senior member of al-Shabab. African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) announced in a statement that its forces did not assist in Rowbow's arrest and his transfer to Mogadishu. \c\cOn 4 May 2020, an East African Express Airways Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia airliner on an air charter flight delivering COVID-19 pandemic relief supplies crashed on approach to Berdale, Somalia, killing all 2 crew and 4 non-revenue passengers on board. On 10 May, a leaked AMISOM report alleged that ground troops of the Ethiopian National Defense Force operating outside AMISOM authority had shot the aircraft down, mistakenly believing it was undertaking a suicide attack. This allegation ignited renewed controversy over unauthorized Ethiopian incursions into Somalia to fight Al-Shabaab. Ethiopian, Kenyan and Somali authorities have initiated a joint investigation of the accident. \c\cOn 7 February 2021, a roadside bomb exploded in Dusmareb, Somalia, killing 12 agents working for the National Intelligence and Security Agency. The local head of the intelligence agency, Abdirashid Abdunur, was among those killed. \c\cOn 14 February, Al Shabaab killed two SNA soldiers in Awdheegle district in southern Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region. \c\cOn 2 March, al-Shabaab publicly executed five people by firing squad for allegedly spying for the United States and Somali intelligence agencies in Jilib, Middle Juba. Hundreds of people reportedly gathered to watch the killings. \c\cOn 5 March, 20 people were killed and 30 were wounded after a suicide car bombing took place in Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab later claimed the attack. \c\cAccording to press reports, Somali and Kenyan government officials have recruited and trained Somali refugees in Kenya and Kenyan nationals who are ethnic Somalis to fight insurgents in Somalia. However, the Somali chief of military staff and spokesmen from the Kenyan government have denied this. \c\cOn 20 July 2010 border clashes between Kenya and Al-Shabaab insurgents occurred when gunmen from the militia attacked a Kenyan border patrol along the border area in Liboi, Lagdera. There was a subsequent fierce exchange of fire between the two sides leading to the deaths of 2 militia and the wounding of one Kenyan officer. Hundreds of security personnel were later deployed to the border following the clash and because of continued fighting between two militia groups in the neighbouring town of Dobley, Somalia. Al-Shabaab had previously claimed responsibility for a deadly suicide bombing in Uganda in July. \c\cIn October 2011, the Kenya Defence Forces began Operation Linda Nchi against Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia. The mission was officially led by the Somali armed forces, with the Kenyan armed forces providing supporting role. In early June 2012, Kenyan forces were formally integrated into AMISOM. \c\cOn 5 January 2020, Al-Shabaab militants launched an attack at on Camp Simba at Manda Air Strip used by Kenyan and U.S. troops in Lamu County, Kenya, the attack was repelled, leaving 3 American nationals killed; 1 serviceman and two contractors. Four militants died in the attack and five were arrested. Moreover, six aircraft and land vehicles were destroyed or damaged at the airstrip. Some of the airframes lost included a De Havilland Canada Dash 8 and two helicopters. 
The Winston Boogie Smith protests are a series of protests and civil unrest in Minneapolis in the United States that began on June 3, 2021 as a reaction to the police killing of Winston Boogie Smith. Smith, a 32-year-old black American man, allegedly shot at law enforcement officers as they attempted to apprehend him on June 3 at a parking ramp in the Uptown neighborhood of Minneapolis. Police fired approximately twelve rounds at Smith, killing him. There was no known video evidence of the encounter, and a passenger in Smith's car and protesters disputed the law enforcement account of events. Civil unrest began in the Uptown neighborhood on June 3 with two nights of protests that included looting and rioting. Protests were held over subsequent days with demonstrators periodically occupying a street intersection near where Smith was killed. The night of June 13, a demonstrator was killed when a vehicle rammed into a street demonstration. \c\cWinston Boogie Smith, Jr. was a 32-year-old black American man who resided in Saint Paul, Minnesota. On June 3, 2021, a law enforcement task force that apprehends wanted fugitives shot and killed Smith during an attempted arrest at 2:08 p.m. CDT at a parking ramp in the Uptown neighborhood of Minneapolis. An investigation of law enforcement conduct by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in the days afterward said that Smith had brandished a firearm and shot at officers who attempted to arrest him. Smith was killed by the approximately twelve rounds fired by law enforcement officers. Law enforcement did not use body cameras or dashcams when apprehending Smith, and there was no known video evidence of the June 3 encounter. \c\cThe Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area was experiencing a prolonged period of protests and unrest in 2020 and 2021 over issues of police brutality and racial injustice. Smith's death occurred in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin on May 25, 2020, and the subsequent criminal trial resulting in Chauvin's conviction on April 20, 2021. It also followed unrest and protests over the killing of Daunte Wright on April 11, 2021, by a police officer in the nearby suburb of Brooklyn Center. \c\cSmith's death occurred three miles from the 38th Street and Chicago Avenue intersection where Floyd was killed. Activists had referred to the location as George Floyd Square and converted the area into a memorial site and occupied protest. Early in the morning on June 3, 2021, city workers in Minneapolis removed barricades and attempted to reopen the intersection to vehicular traffic, but faced opposition from the community. \c\cAfter news of the shooting spread in the afternoon of June 3, 2021, a small crowd gathered at the scene in the afternoon and some began chanting anti-police slogans at Minneapolis Police Department officers present at the location. Several community organizers worked to keep the gathering peaceful by deescalating tensions in the crowd. Most of the initial crowd dispersed by the early evening. Later in the night, demonstrators blocked the street with a dumpster that they lit on fire. Overnight, dozens of buildings were vandalized or looted, and several fires were started in the area. Patrols of Minneapolis police officers in riot gear fired flashbangs to disperse crowds, and made nine arrests of demonstrators and looters during the overnight hours into June 4. Many businesses in the Uptown area, which had economic activity interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and other riots during the prior year, spent the day of June 4 cleaning up property damage and boarding up storefronts in preparation for further unrest. \c\cSoon after the shooting, Smith's family demanded greater law enforcement transparency and the release of any surveillance footage that might have captured the incident. Civil rights activists and Smith's friends and family disputed the law enforcement accounts of the incident. Local organization Communities United Against Police Brutality held a press conference near the shooting site on June 4 to call for officials to release video footage and other details of the shooting. During the afternoon of June 4, protesters briefly blocked the intersection of Hennepin Avenue and West Lake Street. Minneapolis police later reopened the intersection by removing objects that had been placed as barricades, and slashing the tires of and towing vehicles that blocked the street. Family and friends of Smith held a peaceful vigil the evening of June 4 at the parking ramp where he was killed. Demonstrators returned to Lake Street near Girard Avenue that evening; two dumpsters and several trees were set fire, and some property was vandalized. Minneapolis police made 27 arrests in connection to the late-night demonstrations. \c\cA peaceful protest rally and march occurred on West Lake street the evenings of June 5 and 6. \c\cOn June 13, a rally was held on top of the parking ramp where Smith was killed. That evening, demonstrators blocked the intersection of West Lake Street and Girard Avenue for an event, with some playing volleyball and lawn games. At approximately 11:39 p.m. CDT, a man in a Jeep Cherokee drove into the crowd at a high rate of speed, striking a parked vehicle that had been used to block off the intersection to traffic, which then collided with protesters. One protester was killed, and three others suffered injuries that were not life-threatening. Demonstrators detained the driver until police arrived at the scene. \c\cMinneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender wrote on June 14 that "based on the information available, it does not seem possible at this time to say if the crash was accidental or intentional," and noted the high frequency of vehicle crashes in the stretch of road where the incident occurred. \c\cFamily of the deceased identified her as Deona M. Knajdek (some reports also identified her as Deona Erickson or Deona Marie), a 31-year-old woman from Minneapolis. According to her family, the car that was struck belonged to Knajdek, and she had parked it there as a blockade to protect protesters. Her family described her as an active supporter of Black Lives Matter and other social justice causes. Knajdek was a program manager for The Cottages Group, a home health care provider. She had two daughters, who were 11 and 13 at the time of her death. \c\cAfter crashing, the man exited the Jeep Cherokee and was held by protesters until police arrived. The suspect, a 35-year-old man from Saint Paul, Minnesota, was booked into a Hennepin County Jail that night on probable cause of criminal vehicular homicide and other charges. Minneapolis police said in a statement that they believed that the driver may have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol. As of June 14, 2021[update], details about whether the crash was intentional or accidental, and any potential motive, were unknown. \c\cAccording to Minneapolis police, three hours prior to the vehicle crash, an unknown person had disabled the view of a West Lake Street surveillance camera with spray paint, which they said would have captured video of the incident. According to search warrants filed in court on June 15, officials believed that footage captured by another a city closed-circuit camera appeared to show that the driver's brake lights did not activate prior to the crash. \c\cDuring the early morning hours of June 14, a small group continued to block the West Lake Street and Girard Avenue intersection with some yelling at drivers in other vehicles. A person fired gunshots after a confrontation with the driver of a vehicle. Minneapolis police made two additional arrests. Protests were held in Uptown on June 14 with demonstrators calling for justice for Smith and Knajdek. Protesters blocked vehicular traffic on West Lake Street at Hennepin Avenue. Hundreds of people gathered for a vigil for Knajdek that night. \c\cOn June 15, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced plans to amass law enforcement resources from several local jurisdictions and federal agencies in Minneapolis. City crews removed makeshift barricades erected by demonstrators who intermittently held portions of West Lake Street.
An outbreak of violence in the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict commenced on 10 May 2021, though disturbances took place earlier, and continued until a ceasefire came into effect on 21 May. It was marked by protests and rioting, police riot control, rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Israeli airstrikes targeting the Gaza Strip. The crisis was triggered on 6 May, when Palestinians began protests in East Jerusalem over an anticipated decision of the Supreme Court of Israel on the eviction of six Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah. Under international law, the area, effectively annexed by Israel, is a part of the occupied Palestinian territories. Israel applies its laws there. On 7 May, according to Israel's Channel 12, Palestinians threw stones at Israeli police forces, who then stormed the compound of the al-Aqsa Mosque using tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades. The crisis prompted protests around the world and reactions from world leaders. \c\cThe violence coincided with Qadr Night (8 May), observed by Muslims, and Jerusalem Day (9–10 May), an Israeli national holiday. The confrontations occurred ahead of a planned Jerusalem Day march by far-right Jewish nationalists that was later canceled. More than 600 people were injured, mostly Palestinians, drawing international condemnation. The Supreme Court ruling was then delayed for 30 days as the attorney general of Israel, Avichai Mandelblit, sought to reduce tensions. \c\cOn the afternoon of 10 May, Hamas gave Israel an ultimatum to withdraw security forces from the Temple Mount complex and Sheikh Jarrah by 6 p.m. or otherwise there would be consequences. When the ultimatum expired without a response, both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched rockets.  Some rockets hit residences and a school. Israel began a campaign of airstrikes against Gaza; by 16 May, some 950 targeted attacks had demolished, completely or partially: 18 buildings including four high-rise towers, 40 schools and four hospitals, and also struck the al-Shati refugee camp. In addition, at least 19 medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombardment. By 17 May, the United Nations estimated that Israeli airstrikes destroyed 94 buildings in Gaza, comprising 461 housing and commercial units, including the al-Jalaa Highrise, housing offices of the Associated Press and Al Jazeera and 60 condominiums. \c\cAs a result of the violence, at least 256 Palestinians, including 66 children,  have been killed. In Israel, at least 13 people have killed, including two children. The Gaza Ministry of Health reported that more than 1,900 Palestinians were injured, and as of 12 May, Israel reported at least 200 injured Israelis.[needs update] As of 19 May, at least 72,000 Palestinians have been displaced. Around 4,360 rockets have been fired towards Israel from Gaza, of which 680 landed within the strip, and over 90 percent of rockets bound towards populated areas were intercepted by the Iron Dome. Israel has conducted 1,500 air, land and sea strikes on the Strip.  Calls for a ceasefire were first proposed on 13 May by Hamas, but rejected by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On 18 May, France, along with Egypt and Jordan, announced the filing of a United Nations Security Council resolution for a ceasefire. A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect on 21 May 2021, ending 11 days of fighting with both sides claiming victory. On 16 June 2021, incendiary balloons were launched by Hamas into Israel, which the Israeli Air Force retaliated to by carrying out multiple airstrikes in the Gaza Strip; thus breaking the ceasefire and causing the fighting to resume. \c\cAt the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 2021, Jerusalem Islamic Waqf officials said that on the night of 13 April, the Israeli police entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and severed the loudspeaker cables used to broadcast the  muezzin's ritual call to prayer, so that the Memorial Day speech being delivered by President Reuven Rivlin below at the Western Wall would not be disturbed. Israeli police declined to comment.  The incident was condemned by Jordan, and the Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called the incident “a racist hate crime”, but it did not draw other international attention. Same month Israeli police closed the staired plaza outside the Old City's Damascus Gate, a traditional holiday gathering spot for Palestinians. The closure triggered violent night clashes, the barricades were removed after several days. On 15 April, a TikTok video of a Palestinian teen slapping an ultra-orthodox Jewish man went viral, leading to several copycat incidents. The next day, tens of thousands of Palestinian worshippers were turned away from al-Aqsa, on the first Friday of Ramadan when Israel imposed a 10,000-person limit on prayers at the mosque. On the same day, a rabbi was beaten in Jaffa causing two days of protests. On 22 April, the far-right Jewish supremacist group Lehava held a march through Jerusalem chanting "death to Arabs." On 23 April, after fringe military groups fired 36 rockets at southern Israel, the IDF launched missiles at Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. The barrage of rocket fire came as hundreds of Palestinians clashed with Israeli police in East Jerusalem and on 25 April, the United Nations envoy Tor Wennesland condemned the violence and said “The provocative acts across Jerusalem must cease. The indiscriminate launching of rockets towards Israeli population centers violates international law and must stop immediately” On 26 April, after more than 40 rockets have been launched from the Gaza Strip into Israel while one projectile exploded inside the Gaza Strip over of the previous three days, the Security Cabinet of Israel voted in favor after an hours-long debate of an operational plan to strike Hamas if rocket fire from Gaza continues. In the following days, a Palestinian boy and a 19-year-old Israeli settler were killed. On 6 May, the Israel Police shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian during a raid of Nablus in the West Bank. According to Addameer, Israeli police arrested at least 61 children from mid-April during clashes in and about East Jerusalem, and 4 were shot death in three weeks. \c\cItamar Ben-Gvir visited Sheikh Jarrah shortly before the clashes began, where he said that the houses belonged to Jews and told police to "open fire" on protesters. Agence France-Presse reported that Israeli settlers had been seen in Sheikh Jarrah openly carrying assault rifles and revolvers leading up to the clashes. A video was posted of Ben-Gvir, in a joking exchange with the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, Arieh King, mocking a Palestinian resident shot by Israeli police during a protest. \c\cThe Sheikh Jarrah district houses the descendants of refugees expelled or displaced from their homes in Jaffa and Haifa in the Nakba of 1948. Today, around 75 Palestinian families live on this disputed land. The long-running dispute over land ownership in Sheikh Jarrah is considered a microcosm of the Israeli–Palestinian disputes over land since 1948. Currently, more than 1,000 Palestinians living across East Jerusalem face possible eviction. Israeli law allows Israeli land owners to file claims over land in East Jerusalem which they have owned prior to 1948, except where expropriated by the Jordanian government, but rejects Palestinian claims over land in Israel which they owned. The international community considers East Jerusalem to be Palestinian territory held under Israeli occupation and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has called on Israel to stop all forced evictions of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah, saying that if carried out the expulsions of the Palestinians would violate Israel's responsibilities under international law which prohibit the transfer of civilians in to or out of occupied territory by the occupying power. A spokesman for the OHCHR said that such transfers may constitute a "war crime". Human rights organizations have been critical of Israeli efforts to remove Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah, with Human Rights Watch releasing a statement saying that the disparate rights between Palestinian and Jewish residents of East Jerusalem "underscores the reality of apartheid that Palestinians in East Jerusalem face." Israeli human rights group estimate that over 1,000 Palestinian families are at risk of eviction in East Jerusalem. \c\cA Jewish trust bought the land in Sheikh Jarrah from Arab landowners in the 1870s in Ottoman Palestine. However, the purchase is disputed by some Palestinians, who have produced Ottoman-era land titles for part of the land. The land came under Jordanian control following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Following the war, Jewish residents were expelled from East Jerusalem, and Palestinians from Israel. In 1956, the Jordanian government, in cooperation with the United Nations\' organization for refugees, housed 28 of these Palestinian families on land owned by Jewish trusts. After the Six-Day War the area fell under Israeli occupation. In 1970, Israel passed a law that allowed previous owners to reclaim property in East Jerusalem that had been taken by Jordan without having  ownership transferred. Under this law, in 1972, the Israeli Custodian General registered the properties under the Jewish trusts which claimed to be the rightful owners of the land. The trusts then demanded that the tenants pay rent. Eviction orders began to be issued in the 1990s. In 1982, the families agreed to recognise ownership of the Jewish trusts\' claim to the land, which was then endorsed by the courts.[clarification needed] They later said this agreement had been made without their knowledge, and disputed the original ownership claims by the Jewish trusts. These challenges were rejected by Israeli courts. Palestinian tenants say that Israeli courts have no jurisdiction in the area since the land is outside Israel's recognized borders; this view is supported by the UN Human Rights Office. \c\cIn 2003, the Jewish trusts sold the homes to a right-wing settler organization, which then made repeated attempts to evict the Palestinian residents. The company has submitted plans to build more than 200 housing units, which have not yet[when?] been approved by the government. These groups succeeded in evicting 43 Palestinians from the area in 2002, and three more families since then. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Israel rejected an appeal by Palestinian families who had resided in 57 housing units in the area of Sheikh Jarrah, who had petitioned the court to have their ownership to the properties recognized. An Israeli court had previously ruled that the Palestinians could remain on the properties under a legal status called "protected tenants", but had to pay rent. The move to evict them came after they refused to pay rent and carried out construction. In 2021 Israel's Supreme Court was expected to deliver a ruling on whether to uphold the eviction of six Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood on 10 May 2021, after a court ruled that 13 families comprising 58 people had to vacate the properties by 1 August. On 9 May 2021, the Israeli Supreme Court delayed the expected decision on evictions for 30 days, after an intervention from Attorney General of Israel Avichai Mandelblit. On 26 May 2021, the court ordered Mandelblit to submit his legal opinion on the matter within two weeks. In a related case, the Jerusalem District Court is holding a hearing on appeals filed on behalf of seven families subject of eviction orders from the Batan al-Hawa section of Silwan. According to Haaretz, Mandelblit notified the court on 7 June that he would decline to present a view on the case; a new hearing date of 20 July was set. \c\cAccording to the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, this approach to property rights is unacceptable in international law. The Jerusalem-based non-profit organization B\'Tselem and the international Human Rights Watch cited discriminatory policies in East Jerusalem in recent reports, alleging that Israel is guilty of the crime of apartheid. Israel rejected the allegations. East Jerusalem is effectively annexed by Israel, and Israel applies its laws there. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the area is a part of the Palestinian territories that Israel currently occupies. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Israel that evicting Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem is among the actions by both sides that could lead to "conflict and war."\c\cThe 2021 Palestinian legislative election for the Palestinian Legislative Council, originally scheduled for 22 May 2021, was indefinitely postponed on 29 April 2021 by President Mahmoud Abbas. Hamas, which was expected to do well in the elections, called the move a "coup", and some Palestinians believed Abbas had delayed the election to avoid political defeat for his party Fatah. Analysts say the postponement contributed towards the current crisis, and encouraged Hamas to resort to military confrontation rather than diplomatic tactics. Opinion pieces in NBC News, the Wall Street Journal and Foreign Policy argued that by taking responsibility for the rocket fire, Hamas had improved its standing among Palestinians wary of the delayed elections. \c\cIn Israel, the 2019–2021 Israeli political crisis saw four inconclusive elections which left Israel functioning under a caretaker government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to persuade several extreme-right politicians to form a coalition. The presence of right-wing Israeli politicians Ben-Gvir and King contributed to the crisis. The New York Times said Netanyahu was trying to instigate a crisis to build support for his leadership, and thus allowed tensions to rise in Jerusalem. An article in The Conversation dismissed this as "conspiratorial", arguing that although the crisis has given Netanyahu a political opportunity, he "was not looking or hoping for a major conflict with the Palestinians to help him hold onto power". \c\cPalestinian protests began on 6 May in Sheikh Jarrah, but clashes soon spread to the al-Aqsa Mosque, Lod, other Arab localities in Israel, and the West Bank. Between 10 and 14 May Israeli security inflicted injuries on approximately 1,000 Palestinian protesters in East Jerusalem. \c\cPalestinians and Israeli settlers first clashed on 6 May in Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families are at risk of being evicted. Palestinian protesters had been holding nightly outdoor iftars. On 6 May, Israeli settlers and members of the far-right political party Otzma Yehudit set up a table across the street from Palestinians. Social media videos showed both sides hurling rocks and chairs at each other. Israeli police intervened and arrested at least 7 people. Israeli police subsequently engaged in extensive spraying of Sheikh Jarrah's Palestinian homes, shops, restaurants, public spaces and cultural institutions with Skunk, a lasting stench used to contain protests. \c\cOn 7 May, large numbers of police were deployed on the Temple Mount as around 70,000 worshippers attended the final Friday prayers of Ramadan at al-Aqsa. After the evening prayers, some Palestinian worshippers began throwing previously stockpiled rocks and other objects at Israeli police officers. Police officers fired stun grenades into the mosque compound, and into a field clinic. A mosque spokesman stated the clashes broke out after Israeli police attempted to evacuate the compound, where many Palestinians sleep over in Ramadan, adding that the evacuation was intended to allow access to Israelis. More than 300 Palestinians were wounded as Israeli police stormed the mosque compound. Palestinians threw rocks, firecrackers, and heavy objects, while Israeli police fired stun grenades, tear gas, and rubber bullets at worshippers. The storming came ahead of a Jerusalem Day flag march by Jewish nationalists through the Old City. More than 600 Palestinians were injured, more than 400 of whom were hospitalised. Militants in Gaza fired rockets into Israel the following night. \c\cMore clashes occurred on 8 May, the date of the Islamic holy night of Laylat al-Qadr. Palestinian crowds threw stones, lit fires, and chanted "Strike Tel Aviv" and "In spirit and in blood, we will redeem al-Aqsa", which The Times of Israel described as in support of Hamas. The Israel Police, wearing riot gear and some on horseback, used stun grenades and water cannons. At least 80 people were injured. \c\cOn 10 May, Israeli police stormed al-Aqsa for the second time, injuring 300 Palestinians and 21 Israeli police. According to the Red Crescent, 250 Palestinians were hospitalized for injuries and seven were in critical condition. \c\cAlso on 10 May, a video showing a tree burning near al-Aqsa began to circulate on social media. Below in the Western plaza, a crowd of Jewish Israelis was singing and dancing in celebration of Jerusalem Day. Yair Wallach accused them of singing "genocidal songs of vengeance." The crowd cheered the flames with words from a song from Judges 16:28 in which Samson cries out before he tears down the pillars in Gaza, "O God, that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes!" Witnesses differed as to whether the fire was caused by an Israeli police stun grenade or by fireworks thrown by Palestinian protesters. Although the fire happened just 10 meters away from al-Aqsa, there was no damage to the mosque. \c\cAfter Friday prayers on 14 May, Palestinians protested in more than 200 locations in the West Bank. Protesters hurled stones and Israeli soldiers responded with live fire and tear gas. As a result, 11 Palestinians were killed in the clashes. A Palestinian man who attempted to stab a soldier was shot, but survived; no Israeli soldiers were wounded in the incident. More than 100 Palestinians were injured. There have been daily demonstrations since the escalation in Gaza. As of 16 May, a total of 13 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank in clashes with Israeli troops by 14 May. On 17 May, three Palestinian demonstrators were killed in clashes with the IDF. \c\cAccording to Al Arabiya, Fatah has backed a call for a general strike on 18 May in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Palestinians in Israel have been asked to take part. In an unusual display of unity, the strike went ahead and "shops were shuttered across cities in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and in villages and towns inside Israel". During the day of protests and strikes, a Palestinian man was killed and more than 70 wounded in clashes near Ramallah and two Israeli soldiers were injured in a shooting attack. Large crowds also gathered in Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron while police deployed water cannons in Sheikh Jarrah. \c\cDuring the evening and night of 10 May, Arab rioters in Lod threw stones and firebombs at Jewish homes, a school, and a synagogue, later attacking a hospital. Shots were fired at the rioters, killing one and wounding two; a Jewish suspect in the shooting was arrested. \c\cWidespread protests and riots intensified across Israel, particularly in cities with large Arab populations. In Lod, rocks were thrown at Jewish apartments and some Jewish residents were evacuated from their homes by the police. Synagogues and a Muslim cemetery were vandalized. A Jewish man was critically wounded after being struck in the head by a brick, and died six days later. In Acre, the Effendi hotel was torched by Arab rioters, injuring several guests. One of them, Avi Har-Even, a former head of the Israel Space Agency, suffered burns and smoke inhalation, and died on 6 June. In the nearby city of Ramle, Jewish rioters threw rocks at passing vehicles. On 11 May, Mayor of Lod Yair Revivio urged Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu to deploy the Israel Border Police to the city, stating that the municipality had "completely lost control" and warning that the country was on the brink of "civil war". Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod on 11 May, marking the first time since 1966 that Israel has used emergency powers over an Arab community. Border Police forces were deployed to the city. A nighttime curfew was declared and entry to the city was prohibited for non-resident civilians. Minister of Public Security Amir Ohana announced the implementation of emergency orders. \c\cUnrest continued on 12 May. In Acre, a Jewish man was attacked and seriously injured by an Arab mob armed with sticks and stones while driving his car. In Bat Yam, Jewish extremists attacked Arab stores and beat pedestrians. An Arab motorist was pulled from his car and severely beaten in the street. The incident was caught live by an Israeli news crew. \c\cAs of 13 May, communal violence including "riots, stabbings, arson, attempted home invasions and shootings" was reported from Beersheba, Rahat, Ramla, Lod, Nasiriyah, Tiberias, Jerusalem, Haifa and Acre. An Israeli soldier was severely beaten in Jaffa and hospitalized for a skull fracture and cerebral hemorrhage, a Jewish paramedic and another Jewish man were shot in separate incidents in Lod, a police officer was shot in Ramla, Israeli journalists were attacked by far-right rioters in Tel Aviv, and a Jewish family that mistakenly drove into Umm al-Fahm was attacked by an Arab mob before being rescued by other local residents and police. Israel Border Police forces were deployed throughout the country to quell the unrest, and 10 Border Police reserve companies were called up. In an address to police in Lod, Prime Minister Netanyahu told them not to worry about future commissions of inquiry and investigations into their enforcement during the riots, reminding them of the way the police had suppressed the Palestinian Land Day riots of 1976. \c\cBy 17 May, the rioting had mostly died down. However, on 18 May, Israeli-Arabs, together with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, held a general strike in protest against Israeli policies toward Palestinians. Numerous employers threatened to fire Arab workers who participated in the strike. The management of Rambam Hospital in Haifa sent letters to their Arab employees warning against participating in the strike, and the Ministry of Education came under heavy criticism from teachers throughout Israel after it sent requests to the principals of schools in Arab towns asking for a list of teachers who participated in the strike. There were some instances of employees who participated in the strike being unlawfully dismissed without a prior hearing as required under Israeli law. The Israeli telecommunications company Cellcom paused work for an hour as an act in support of coexistence. The move led to calls for a boycott of Cellcom among Israeli right-wingers who accused it of showing solidarity with the strike, and several Jewish settlement councils and right-wing organizations cut ties with it. Cellcom's stock subsequently dropped by two percent. \c\cThroughout the riots, Arab rioters set 10 synagogues and 112 Jewish homes on fire, looted 386 Jewish homes and damaged another 673, and set 849 Jewish cars on fire. There were also 5,018 recorded instances of stone-throwing against Jews. By contrast, Jewish rioters damaged 13 Arab homes and set 13 Arab cars on fire, and there were 41 recorded instances of stone-throwing against Arabs. One Arab home was set on fire by Arab rioters who mistook it for a Jewish home. No mosques were set on fire and no Arab homes were reported looted during the unrest. By 19 May, 1,319 people had been arrested for participating in the riots, of whom 159 were Jewish, and 170 people had been criminally charged over the riots, of whom 155 were Arab and 15 Jewish. On 23 May, it was reported that 10% of those arrested over the riots were Jews, with the vast majority of those arrested being Arabs. On 24 May, the police launched a sweeping operation to arrest rioters called Operation Law and Order, deploying thousands of police officers to carry out mass arrests of suspected rioters. By 25 May, over 1,550 people had been arrested. On 3 June, the police announced the completion of arrests, of 2,142 arrested, 91% were Arab. \c\cHamas delivered an ultimatum to Israel to remove all its police and military personnel from both the Haram al Sharif mosque site and Sheikh Jarrah by 10 May 6 p.m. If it failed to do so, they announced that the combined militias of the Gaza Strip ("joint operations room") would strike Israel. Minutes after the deadline passed, Hamas fired more than 150 rockets into Israel from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that seven rockets were fired toward Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh and that one was intercepted. An anti-tank missile was also fired at an Israeli civilian vehicle, injuring the driver. Israel launched air strikes in the Gaza Strip on the same day. Hamas called the ensuing conflict the "Sword of Jerusalem Battle." The following day, the IDF officially dubbed the campaign in the Gaza Strip "Operation Guardian of the Walls."\c\cOn 11 May, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched hundreds of rockets at Ashdod and Ashkelon, killing two people and wounding more than 90 others. A third Israeli woman from Rishon LeZion was also killed, while two more civilians from Dahmash were killed by a rocket attack. \c\cOn 11 May, the 13-story residential Hanadi Tower in Gaza collapsed after being hit by an Israeli airstrike. The tower housed a mix of residential apartments and commercial offices. IDF said the building contained offices used by Hamas, and said it gave "advance warning to civilians in the building and provided sufficient time for them to evacuate the site"; Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fired 137 rockets at Tel Aviv in five minutes. Hamas stated that they fired their "largest ever barrage." In addition, an Israeli state-owned oil pipeline was hit by a rocket. \c\cOn 12 May, the Israeli Air Force destroyed dozens of police and security installations along the Gaza Strip; Hamas said its police headquarters were among the targets destroyed. Over 850 rockets were launched from Gaza into Israel on 12 May. According to the IDF, at least 200 rockets launched by Hamas failed to reach Israel, and fell inside the Gaza Strip. Hamas also struck an Israeli military jeep near the Gaza border with an anti-tank missile. An Israeli soldier was killed and three others were wounded in the attack. \c\cOn 13 May, Israeli forces and militant groups in Gaza continued to exchange artillery fire and airstrikes. Hamas attempted to deploy suicide drones against Israeli targets, with an Israeli F-16 engaging and shooting down one such drone. The Iron Dome intercepted many of the rockets fired at Israel. A series of Israeli strikes targeted the headquarters of Hamas\' internal security forces, its central bank, and the home of a senior Hamas commander. On 14 May, Israel Defense Forces claimed to have troops on the ground and in the air attacking the Gaza Strip, although this claim was later retracted and followed with an apology for misleading the press. Israeli troops were reportedly told that they would be sent into Gaza and ground forces were reportedly positioned along the border as though they were preparing to launch an invasion. That same day, the Israeli Air Force launched a massive bombardment of Hamas\' extensive underground tunnel network, which was known as "the metro", as well as above-ground positions, reportedly inflicting heavy casualties. It was suspected that the reports of an Israeli ground invasion had been a deliberate ruse to lure Hamas operatives into the tunnels and prepared positions above ground to confront Israeli ground forces so that large numbers could then be killed by airstrikes. According to an Israeli official, the attacks killed hundreds of Hamas personnel, and in addition, 20 Hamas commanders were assassinated and most of its rocket production capabilities were destroyed. However, the estimated Hamas death toll was revised to dozens, as information came out that senior Hamas commanders had doubted that the ruse was genuine and only a few dozen Hamas fighters took positions in the tunnels. In total, 160 Israeli Air Force aircraft fired 450 missiles at 150 targets, with the attacks lasting about 40 minutes. Also on 14 May, a Hamas drone was downed by Israeli air defense forces. \c\cOn 15 May the IDF destroyed the al-Jalaa Building in Gaza, which housed Al Jazeera and Associated Press journalists, and a number of other offices and apartments. The building was hit by three missiles, approximately an hour after Israeli forces called the building's owner, warning of the attack and advising all occupants to evacuate. The press agencies demanded an explanation; the IDF said at the time that the building housed assets of Hamas military intelligence. On 8 June Israel said that the building was being used by Hamas to develop an electronic system to jam Iron Dome. AP demanded proof of this; Hamas did not immediately make any comment. Israel said that they did not suspect that AP personnel knew of Hamas's use of the building, and offered to assist AP in rebuilding its offices and operations in Gaza. \c\cThe Israeli Air Force carried out another large-scale series of raids against Hamas\' tunnel network on 17 May, bombing over 15 kilometers of underground passages, with 54 Israeli jets dropping 110 bombs. The homes of nine Hamas commanders and a home used by Hamas\' military intelligence branch were also bombed. \c\cDuring the fighting, Hamas militants with anti-tank guided missiles repeatedly took positions in apartments and behind dunes. These teams were identified by IDF reconnaissance units and subsequently destroyed in pinpoint attacks. At least 20 such teams were destroyed by Israeli air and ground forces. On 20 May, a Hamas anti-tank missile attack on an IDF bus lightly wounded one soldier. The attack came moments after a group of 10 soldiers had disembarked from the bus. \c\cIn addition, the IDF sank Hamas\' fleet of small unmanned submarines designed to explode under or near Israeli naval vessels or oil and gas drilling rigs. Hamas tried repeatedly to attack Israel's Tamar gas field. At two least attempts to launch attacks with autonomous submarines were intercepted. In one instance, a Hamas team was spotted launching the submarine. An Israeli navy vessel destroyed the submarine while it was still close to the shore and the Israeli Air Force subsequently attacked the team which launched it. \c\cBy the end of the campaign, over 4,360 rockets and mortar shells had been fired at southern and central Israel, an average of 400 per day. About 3,400 successfully crossed the border while 680 fell in Gaza and 280 fell into the sea. The Iron Dome shot down 1,428 rockets detected as heading toward populated areas, an interception rate of 95 percent. Some 60–70 rockets hit populated areas after the Iron Dome failed to intercept them. The attacks killed 6 Israeli civilians, among them a 5-year-old boy and two Israeli-Arabs, as well as three foreign nationals working in Israel: an Indian woman working as a caregiver in Ashkelon and two Thai workers who were killed when the packing house of a community in southern Israel close to the Gaza border took a direct hit. Three other Israeli civilians including an 87-year-old woman died from injuries sustained after they fell while running to bomb shelters during attacks. \c\cThe IDF estimated that it destroyed 850 rockets in strikes on the Gaza Strip and also severely degraded local rocket manufacturing capabilities in strikes on about three dozen rocket production centers. In addition, Israel assassinated numerous Hamas and Islamic Jihad commanders with airstrikes. Nearly 30 senior Hamas commanders were assassinated by the IDF during the campaign. Israel's ability to locate senior commanders to such an extent indicated extensive Israeli intelligence penetration of Hamas\' ranks. \c\cIn three instances, Hamas attempted to launch cross-border raids into Israel to kill or kidnap soldiers and civilians, utilizing tunnels that approached but did not cross into Israeli territory to enable its fighters to get close. All of these attacks were foiled. In one instance, a group of Hamas fighters were struck before entering a tunnel and in two other instances the groups were targeted while in the tunnels. A total of 18 Hamas fighters were killed. The IDF also claimed that seven Hamas drones that crossed into Israeli airspace were shot down, including at least one by an Iron Dome battery. An Israeli drone was also accidentally shot down by an Iron Dome battery. \c\cAccording to Israeli journalist Haviv Rettig Gur, Israel systematically thwarted Hamas\' tactical innovations and destroyed the military infrastructure it had prepared for a future war, which proved "ineffective or outright useless". \c\cThe United Nations said that more than 72,000 Palestinians had been internally displaced, sheltering mostly at 48 UNRWA schools in Gaza. After the ceasefire, less than 1,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering in UNRWA schools, down from a peak of around 66,000. \c\cUNWRA discovered a cavity 7.5 metres under one of its two schools in Gaza  that had been damaged by  Israeli  air strikes. The structure had neither an exit from or entry into the school's premises, and the organization strongly condemned both the IDF and the Palestinians responsible for building the tunnel. \c\cOn 13 May at least three rockets were fired from the coastal area of Qlaileh just South of the Palestinian refugee camp of Rashidieh in the Southern Lebanese district of Tyre across the Israeli–Lebanese border, according to the IDF, landing in the Mediterranean Sea. Hezbollah denied responsibility for the rocket launches and Lebanese Army troops were deployed to the area around the refugee camp, finding several rockets there. \c\cOn 14 May, dozens of Lebanese demonstrated on the Israel-Lebanon border in solidarity with the Palestinians. A small group of demonstrators cut through the border fence and crossed into Israel, setting fires near Metulla. IDF troops fired at them, killing one who was later identified as a member of Hezbollah. Another was wounded and later died of his injuries. That evening, three rockets were fired from Syria, while two of them hit the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights but fell in uninhabited places. The following day, Lebanese demonstrators damaged the border fence with Molotov cocktails and other items. \c\cOn 17 May, six rockets were fired by Palestinian militants towards Israel but the rockets failed to cross the Lebanese-Israeli border. The Israeli military responded by firing artillery shells across the border in the direction of the rocket fire. No one was injured in the incident. \c\cThe IDF said that on 19 May four rockets were fired from near Siddikine village in the Tyre District of Southern Lebanon towards Haifa. One was intercepted, another landed in an open area, and the remaining two fell into the sea. The Israeli army responded with artillery fire. \c\cThirteen people were killed in Israel, including two children, one Indian woman and two Thai men living and working in Israel. By May 18, the Magen David Adom ambulance service had treated 114 injuries directly related to rocket attacks, and another 198 indirectly related to rocket attacks. \c\cAfter the ceasefire, UN and Gaza Health Ministry sources stated that 256 Palestinians had been killed, including 66 children and 40 women, and almost 2,000 wounded, of whom over 600 were children, and 400 women. Four of the killed women were pregnant. Israel claimed that of those killed at least 225 were militants, while according to Hamas 80 Palestinian fighters were killed. One of the children killed was claimed by a militant group to be a member of its Al-Mujahideen Brigades. \c\cAccording to Israel, approximately 640 Palestinian rockets fell short and landed in the Gaza Strip, resulting in casualties. It is disputed whether some of the first victims on 10 May died as a result of an Israeli airstrike or an errant Palestinian rocket. \c\cAccording to Amira Hass, 15 Israeli strikes have targeted individual family dwellings, causing multiple deaths among members of the 15 families living there. When the ceasefire came into effect, the Palestinian National Authority set the number of entire families killed at 20, and announced it will lodge a complaint at the International Court of Justice for "war crimes" in that regard. Palestinian journalist Yusuf Abu Hussein was killed in an Israeli airstrike in his home on 19 May, prompting outcry from the International Federation of Journalists. An Israeli airstrike on 20 May killed a disabled Palestinian man, his pregnant wife, and their three-year-old daughter. A later investigation found that Hamas militants had built a military structure inside a Palestinian elementary school. \c\cA Hamas commander, identified as Mohammed Abdullah Fayyad, as well as three high-ranking Islamic Jihad commanders were also killed. Another Hamas member was killed on 11 May. The deaths of the five commanders were confirmed by official statements of both the groups. The deaths of other militants are suspected but not confirmed. Bassem Issa, a top Hamas commander, was killed. \c\cIn a study that monitored 29,000 incidents from 123 countries, calculations for the last decade rank Gaza in 9th place among cities where civilians are killed or injured by explosive weaponry. Gaza was the ninth most affected territory in terms of numbers. In 764 incidents of explosions, some 5,700 civilian casualties died, 90 percent of the total. This puts it in second place worldwide among the cities affected by bombing in terms of the proportion between civilians and militants killed. \c\cOn 18 May, Egypt pledged $500 million in efforts to rebuild Gaza after the missile strikes. Qatar likewise pledged $500 million. \c\cHamas has been accused by Israel of using medical facilities to cover its activities. The Ministry of Health is run by the Hamas government, and wounded soldiers are often treated in civilian hospitals. As of 17 May, the Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have caused the following damage, according to the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs:\c\c4 hospitals run by Gaza's ministry of health, including the Indonesian and Beit Hanoun hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip. \c\c2 hospitals run by NGOs\c\c2 clinics, one run by Médecins Sans Frontières, and one, the Hala al-Shawa clinic, in disuse at the time. \c\c1 health centre\c\c1 Palestine Red Crescent Society facility. \c\cPersonnel killed:\c\cDr Moein Ahmad al-Aloul (66), a leading Gaza neurologist, killed when his house in the Rimal quarter collapsed after an Israeli strike on shops on the building's ground level. His 5 children were also killed in the strike. \c\cDr Ayman Abu al-Auf, the Al-Shifa Hospital's head of internal medicine and director of Gaza's COVID-19 response, killed by falling rubble after a strike on al-Wehda Street, a controversial strike that killed over 40 people. 12 members of his extended family were also killed. \c\cBy 18 May, seventeen hospitals and clinics in Gaza had suffered damage, according to The New York Times. \c\cThe Israeli strike on the Rimal clinic also shut down the only COVID-19 laboratory in the Strip, rendering further screening for the pandemic impossible. \c\cAccording to a post-ceasefire UNOCHA estimate,\c\c1,042 housing and commercial units,  spread over 258 buildings, were destroyed\c\c769 further units suffered severe damage. \c\c53 schools were damaged\c\c6 hospitals and 11 clinics were damaged. \c\cThe IDF claimed it had destroyed 60 miles of  Hamas's underground tunnel system, nicknamed the Metro. \c\c3,424 claims of compensation for property damage have been filed by Israelis as a result of the fighting: 1,724 related to damage to motor vehicles. \c\cChina, Norway and Tunisia requested a public United Nations Security Council meeting for 14 May while the United States objected. The council has met privately twice but has not been able to agree on a statement over United States objections. \c\cOn 12 May, it was announced that Hady Amr, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Israeli-Palestinian Affairs and Press and Public Diplomacy, would be sent to the region "immediately."  Truce efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations showed no sign of progress. Amr arrived in Tel Aviv for discussions on how to achieve a "sustainable calm" ahead of a United Nations Security Council meeting on 16 May. \c\cOn 13 May, Hamas made a proposal for a ceasefire, stating that it was prepared to halt attacks on a \'mutual basis\'. Netanyahu informed his cabinet that Israel had rejected the overture. On 13 May, U.S. President Joe Biden held telephone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden stated that "Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory."\c\cUN Secretary-General António Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire, "out of respect for the spirit of Eid", making reference to Eid al-Fitr, an Islamic festival which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. \c\cOn 16 May, Biden held telephone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and President Mahmoud Abbas. \c\cFollowing the third UN Security Council emergency meeting in a week, the United States used its veto power to block a proposed statement drafted by China, Norway, and Tunisia and supported by the other 14 members of the council. No vote was held on the statement. The draft statement called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and condemned the violence in Gaza; it urged all parties, especially Israel, to use restraint, but made no mention of the rocket attacks by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. \c\cOn 18 May, the Greek foreign minister Nikos Dendias becomes the first European official to visit Israel and Palestine, followed by a visit to Jordan, in consultation with France, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and the United States as part of the efforts for brokering a ceasefire between the two parties, while France announced the filing of a resolution with the UN Security Council calling for a cease-fire, in coordination with Egypt and Jordan. The resolution could be circulated as soon as 19 May. Security Council press and presidential statements require approval of all 15 members while resolutions do not. \c\cOn 19 May, Biden held a phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressing to his Israeli counterpart that "he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire." Furthermore, multiple news sources announced that the German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas intends to travel to Israel, and possibly the Palestinian territories on 20 May to discuss the escalating conflict. On 20 May, the foreign ministers of Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia visited Israel to express support and solidarity with Israel. \c\cIsrael and Hamas agreed to cease hostilities from 20 May. A ceasefire deal brokered by Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations between Israel and Hamas was enacted at around 2:00 AM on 21 May 2021, ending 11 days of fighting. The final proposal by Egypt was voted on by the Israeli cabinet and was unanimously approved, and Hamas also indicated their acceptance of the peace deal. Other than a minor skirmish at Al-Aqsa Mosque, there were no substantive violations of the ceasefire throughout the day on 21 May. In the hours before the Egypt-brokered deal, Biden had spoken with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi about brokering such a deal. Biden later described the deal as "mutual" and "unconditional" and expressed his belief that both sides deserved to live in safety. Both sides claimed victory in the conflict. The truce tentatively concluded the fourth war between Israel and the Islamist militant group since 2008. \c\cJust hours after the ceasefire came into effect, what the New York Times described as a 'small skirmish\', in which 20 Palestinians were reportedly wounded, and 16 arrested, between Israeli police and Palestinians took place just outside the Al Aqsa mosque. The incident occurred after noon prayers, when most of the tens of thousands of worshipers had left the site. A few in the remaining group waved Palestinian flags; Israeli police entered to confiscate the flags and disperse the crowd. The Israeli version is that hundreds of Palestinians threw stones and firebombs on the arrival of the Israeli police. The Palestinian version is that the violence erupted only when the police entered the compound. \c\cOn 22 May, according to an Egyptian diplomat, two teams of Egyptian mediators were in Israel and the Palestinian territories with the intent to "firm up" the cease-fire deal and to secure a long-term calm. Blinken planned to visit Israel and the West Bank on 26–27 May with the same idea. The UN security council finally released an agreed statement calling for full adherence to the truce and stressing the immediate need for humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians while reiterating the need for a 2-state solution. The statement made no reference to Hamas. \c\cAfter international pressure was applied, on 23 May Israel agreed to permit the transfer of food and medical supplies furnished by the United Nations and Physicians for Human Rights, aid workers, and journalists into the Gaza Strip, but on 24 May refused transfer. On 25 May, coinciding with a state visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel, aid was permitted to enter the strip. \c\cAt the end of May Hamas said it would begin launching rockets again if the evictions in Sheikh Jarrah were allowed to go ahead; a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court was expected within a month. UNHCR was to investigate "systematic discrimination and repression" in Israel and Palestine to identify the root causes of the crisis. \c\cAmid continuing communal tension and protest, the Israeli police force said it had arrested 348 suspects in late May as it rounded up alleged participants in the unrest, confirming reports from human rights organisation Adalah which said at least 200 Palestinians in Israel had been arrested that week, and described the raids as a way to "intimidate and exact revenge". \c\cOn 5 June, at Sheikh Jarrah, border police forcefully detained an Al Jazeera reporter wearing body armor marked "press". Israeli police said the journalist was detained after she was asked for identification, refused and pushed a police officer. On 6 June Israeli police detained Muna al-Kurd. Her father told reporters that the 23-year-old activist was detained after police raided their home in Sheikh Jarrah and said that the police also delivered a notice ordering her twin brother Mohammed El-Kurd to surrender himself to authorities. He and his sister are running a social media campaign against the expulsions of Palestinians from their homes. The pair were later released. \c\cOn 9 May 2021, the Israeli Supreme Court delayed the expected decision on evictions for 30 days, after an intervention from Attorney General of Israel Avichai Mandelblit. Israel Police also banned Jews from going to the al-Aqsa plaza for Jerusalem Day festivities. On 10 May, Israel closed the Kerem Shalom border crossing, including for humanitarian aid. Due to rocket fire on 11 May, the Israel Airports Authority briefly halted air travel. \c\cIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the actions of the Israeli police and said that Israel "shall not allow any radical element to undermine the calm." He also said "we firmly reject the pressure not to build in Jerusalem." Israeli officials asked the Biden administration not to intervene in the situation. \c\cOn 10 May 2021, Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, issued a statement that the "brutal storming and assault on worshipers in the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and its courtyards is a new challenge to the international community."\c\cOn two separate occasions,  Christian groups in Jerusalem issued statements commenting on the outbreak of hostilities. Kairos Palestine  attributed the uprising to deprivations suffered, and called for the recognition of the rights of everyone as the only way to break the cycle of destruction. A joint declaration on 7 May, signed by the Greek Orthodox,  Armenian and Catholic Patriarchs of the city, together with prominent Heads of Churches of Jerusalem - who had all earlier expressed deep concern for Israeli plans under radical settler pressure to annex unilaterally West Bank land- blamed the growing tensions \'mainly\' on the destabilizing effects of right-wing settler groups on the fragile realities of Jerusalem. Their denunciation was followed up by a similar statement issued on 12 May by the Middle East Council of Churches, representing 28 denominations in the area. \c\cIsrael's Minister for Public Security Amir Ohana called for the release of the Israeli man arrested for the shooting of an Arab in Lod, arguing without providing evidence that the suspect was acting in self-defense and law-abiding citizens bearing arms assist the authorities. According to a Guardian report, the statement seemed to encourage mob violence. \c\cA spokesman for Palestinian Islamic Jihad said that Israel "started the aggression on Jerusalem. If this aggression does not end, there is no point to diplomatic efforts to reach a cease-fire." Hamas gave an ultimatum to the Israeli government, saying if they did not remove forces from the mosque by 2 a.m. on 11 May, then they would conduct another rocket strike. \c\cNetanyahu convened an emergency security meeting on 11 May, and schools in several parts of Israel were closed. Israeli president Reuven Rivlin condemned the riots in Lod, describing them as a pogrom.
On 30 May 2020, Eyad al-Hallaq, (Arabic:  إياد الحلاق ’iiad alhilaq) a 32-year-old autistic Palestinian man, was shot and killed by Israeli Police after not stopping at the Lions\' Gate checkpoint in Jerusalem when he was ordered to do so by officers stationed nearby. He fled from the area and police attempted to "neutralize" Halaq during the chase with at least seven shots fired in his direction. \c\cHalaq's relatives stated he was an autistic man who was heading to a school for students with special needs that he attended daily when he was shot by police. Friends and family of Halaq and the Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Saab Erekat, have drawn parallels with police brutality in the United States and the killing of George Floyd. \c\cHalaq and his teacher were walking on 30 May 2020 to the Elwyn El Quds center which provides services for children and adults with disabilities when they approached the Lions\' Gate checkpoint. The checkpoint was part of the daily walk from Halaq's home in East Jerusalem's Wadi al-Joz area to the special-needs center in the Old City, which he had attended since 2014. When he reportedly stepped through the arches of the Gate, officers on duty became suspicious when he placed his hand into his pocket for his cell phone. He had apparently not understood the shouted commands from the officers to halt, but fled on foot and hid in a garbage room. His father told reporters that the teacher attempted to tell police that Halaq was disabled and to check his identity, but officers maintained a distance and opened fire. \c\cIn a statement the Israeli police claimed that Halaq was believed to be carrying a weapon after officers spotted an object that looked like a pistol. When he failed to obey their calls to halt, officers gave chase. A local television station reported that he was chased into a dead-end alley, and a senior officer orders a halt in fire after entering the alley. A second officer reportedly ignored orders and fired about six or seven shots from a M-16 rifle which killed Halaq. He was found to not be in possession of a weapon when he was searched after his death. \c\cFollowing protocol, the officers involved in the shooting were questioned afterwards, and one issued a statement of condolences to Halaq's family through his lawyer in an interview with Israeli Army Radio. Reportedly the officer who continued to fire was a new recruit and his lawyer has argued that he thought he was in real danger. \c\cRelatives of Halaq have demanded any footage of the killing and chase be used in the investigation and for the family to be able to view it, as the Old City is covered extensively by security cameras. \c\cHallaq's parents have petitioned the High Court of Justice to conclude the investigation of the case and put the two police officers involved on trial. On October 21, 2020 Israeli prosecutors recommended that the police officer who shot and killed al-Hallaq be charged with manslaughter. \c\cThe Israel Police Internal Investigations Department opened an investigation into the incident. In October 2020, the Israeli Justice Ministry announced that the shooter would be charged with reckless manslaughter pending a hearing to dispute the charges. \c\cA protest was staged in front of the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem on 2 June, against police brutality and the deaths of George Floyd and Halaq, following similar protests in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on 30 May. Others used social media to protest with the hashtag #PalestinianLivesMatter while over a thousand mourners attended his funeral. \c\cHalaq's sister Diana told reporters that the police officer who shot her brother should be imprisoned but that she believed the officer would remain unpunished as her family were Palestinian. The leader of the main Arab party in Parliament, Ayman Odeh, echoed concerns about the lack of punishment for the officers, using Twitter to post concerns about an "expected cover-up" and that justice would only be done when the "Palestinian people know freedom and independence". \c\cBenny Gantz, the Alternate Prime Minister of Israel, discussed the issue at a weekly meeting of the Israeli cabinet the next day, stating the government was sorry about the incident and shared in the families grief while calling for a swift investigation. Benjamin Netanyahu was also in attendance and did not comment on the incident. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the killing a "war crime" and Hamas issued warnings of a new intifada. \c\cThe United Nations\' Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights called the killing another case of "the routine use of lethal force by Israeli Security forces against Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem". The statement continued by stressing the need for the least force possible to be used in any situation. It has also charged Israel with not being transparent about the rules of engagement, that were against international law regulations. \c\cOn 7 June 2020, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences and said that he "expected a full investigation into the matter." He also said the incident was a "tragedy."
A by-election was held in the United Kingdom Parliament constituency of Chesham and Amersham on 17 June 2021, following the death of the sitting member, Dame Cheryl Gillan, on 4 April 2021. Gillan had served as MP for the constituency since 1992. The by-election was the third to the 58th Parliament, which was elected in 2019. \c\cChesham and Amersham, named after the market towns of Chesham and Amersham in the constituency, has been held by the Conservative Party since its creation at the February 1974 election. The local authority is Buckinghamshire Council and the seat is coterminous with the abolished Chiltern District. The area is in the London commuter belt, and is home to many affluent professionals. \c\cIn June 2016, 55% of voters in the coterminous Chiltern District voted to remain in the European Union (EU) in the EU membership referendum. The estimated turnout of 83.6% was the highest figure for any constituency in the UK, with only Gibraltar reporting a higher percentage. At the 2019 European Parliament elections, the pro-EU Liberal Democrats were the most popular party in the Chiltern District with 31.9%, with the pro-Leave Brexit Party in second place with 30%. Despite the seat voting Remain, Gillan, a supporter of Brexit, was re-elected with over half the vote in both the general elections following the referendum. \c\cThe seat has had three MPs since its creation: Ian Gilmour, briefly Secretary of State for Defence under Edward Heath, and Lord Privy Seal under Margaret Thatcher; Cheryl Gillan, Secretary of State for Wales under David Cameron and Chair of the 1922 Committee in 2019; and now Sarah Green, elected in June 2021. \c\cOn 5 May, the Liberal Democrats selected training and communications professional Sarah Green as their candidate in the by-election. Green was the party's candidate in Arfon in North Wales in the 2010 general election, and came fourth, with 14.1% of the vote. \c\cOn 6 May, the Conservative Party selected Peter Fleet, Chairman of the Retail Automotive Alliance and former president of Ford Asia Pacific, as their candidate. Fleet was the Conservative candidate for Southampton Itchen in the 1997 general election, and came second with 28.4% of the vote. \c\cOn 7 May, the Green Party selected Carolyne Culver as their candidate in the by-election. Culver is the Green Party group leader on West Berkshire Council. \c\cOn 9 May, former Conservative MP Phillip Lee, who joined the Liberal Democrats before the 2019 election, urged the Labour and Green parties not to stand candidates in the by-election to avoid vote splitting. Lee argued that the Conservative Party would be more likely to lose if the anti-Conservative vote went to the Liberal Democrat candidate alone. Writing in The Guardian on 14 May, columnist Polly Toynbee also called for an electoral alliance of the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Green Party to beat the Conservatives. However, all three parties contested the by-election, but the Labour vote fell very considerably. \c\cOn 12 May, the writ for the by-election was moved in the House of Commons by Government Chief Whip Mark Spencer. \c\cOn 17 May, the Breakthrough Party selected Carla Gregory as their candidate. Gregory is a charity worker from the local area. \c\cOn 18 May, the Labour Party selected Slough councillor Natasa Pantelic as their candidate in the by-election. Pantelic is the lead member for health and wellbeing on Slough Borough Council. \c\cOn 30 May, The Independent reported that internal party polling by the Liberal Democrats put the Conservatives on 45.5% and the Liberal Democrats on 35.1%, a swing of 9.35% to them. The same survey also found 60% of Labour and Green voters were willing to vote tactically. Further internal party polling by the Liberal Democrats, reported by City A.M., found an even closer margin, with the Conservatives on 45% and the Liberal Democrats on 41%. Despite these figures, YouGov's director of political research said "the by-election will be tough to win for the Lib Dems" due to the party putting itself up against a "popular government", unlike when it has won by-elections in the past. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said that he visited the constituency 16 times during the campaign. \c\cAdrian Oliver stood for the Freedom Alliance, which opposes public health measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. He was previously a member of the Green Party, elected as a councillor for the Greens in Camden in the 2006 election.
The 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis is the ongoing state of heightened military tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States and their allies in the Persian Gulf region. Starting in early May 2019, the U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to deter an alleged planned campaign by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. This followed a rise in political tensions between the two countries during the Trump administration, which included the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the imposition of new sanctions against Iran, and the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. In response, Iran designated the United States Central Command as a terrorist organization. \c\cSeveral merchant ships in the Persian Gulf were damaged in two incidents in May and June 2019. Western nations blamed Iran, while Iran denied involvement. In June 2019, Iran shot down an American RQ-4A surveillance drone flying over the Strait of Hormuz, sharply increasing tensions and nearly resulting in an armed confrontation. In July 2019, an Iranian oil tanker was seized by Britain in the Strait of Gibraltar on the grounds that it was shipping oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Iran later captured a British oil tanker and its crew members in the Persian Gulf. Both Iran and the UK later released the ships. Meanwhile, the U.S. created the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), which sought to increase "overall surveillance and security in key waterways in the Middle East", according to the United States Department of Defense. \c\cThe crisis escalated in late 2019 and early 2020 when alleged members of the Kata\'ib Hezbollah militia, part of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces, killed an American contractor in an attack on an Iraqi base hosting U.S. personnel. In retaliation, the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Kata\'ib Hezbollah's facilities in Iraq and Syria, killing 25 militiamen. Kata\'ib Hezbollah responded with an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, which prompted the U.S. to deploy hundreds of new troops to the Middle East and announce that it would preemptively target Iran's "proxies" in Iraq. Days later, the commander of IRGC's Quds Force Qasem Soleimani and PMF commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were both killed in a U.S. drone strike, resulting in Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei pledging to exact revenge on U.S. forces. The U.S. deployed nearly 4,000 troops in response to the tensions, and Israel heightened its security levels. On 5 January 2020, Iran ended its commitments to the nuclear deal, and the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory. \c\cThe U.S. and Iran nearly entered into an open conflict on 8 January 2020 when the IRGC launched ballistic missile attacks against two military bases in Iraq housing U.S. soldiers in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani, a rare direct Iran–U.S. confrontation and the closest to the brink of war between the two nations in decades. Upon initial assessments of no U.S. casualties, the Trump administration curtailed tensions by temporarily ruling out a direct military response but announcing new sanctions. It was later revealed that more than a hundred U.S. troops sustained injuries during the attacks. During the crisis, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down after departing from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport, and Western officials said the plane had been brought down by an Iranian SA-15 surface-to-air missile. On 11 January 2020, the Iranian military admitted in a statement that they had mistakenly shot down the plane due to human error. \c\cOn 8 May 2018, the United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal, reinstating sanctions against Iran. Iran's oil production hit a historic low as a result of these sanctions. According to the BBC in April 2019, United States sanctions against Iran "led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests". Iranian officials have accused the U.S. of waging hybrid warfare against the country. \c\cTensions between Iran and the U.S. escalated in May 2019, with the U.S. deploying more military assets to the Persian Gulf region after receiving intelligence reports of an alleged "campaign" by Iran and its "proxies" to threaten U.S. forces and Strait of Hormuz oil shipping. U.S. officials cited intelligence reports that included photographs of missiles on dhows and other small boats in the Persian Gulf, supposedly put there by Iranian paramilitary forces. The U.S. feared the missiles could be fired at its Navy. \c\cThe U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to deter what it regards as a planned campaign of belligerency by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the gulf and Iraq. PMF and Kata\'ib Hezbollah were targeted by U.S. airstrikes, claiming their proxy belligerent role on the orders of Iran. In June 2019, Iran shot down an American RQ-4A surveillance drone, sharply increasing tensions and nearly resulting in an armed confrontation. \c\cThe International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), formerly known as Operation Sentinel or the Sentinel Program, is a multinational maritime effort established by the U.S. to ensure gulf security following Iranian seizures of commercial tankers. \c\cFollowing Iran's shoot-down of a U.S. surveillance drone on 20 June 2019, the U.S. bolstered its efforts to establish a coalition to deter Iranian attacks in the Persian Gulf. On 19 July, U.S. Central Command acknowledged what it called Operation Sentinel which had the stated goal of de-escalating tensions and promoting maritime stability in international waters "throughout the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait (BAM) and the Gulf of Oman". Sentinel called for participating nations to provide escorts to their flagged commercial vessels in the region and for coordinating surveillance capabilities. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper later commented on the nature of the operation, stating "My view is... we would want to prevent the Iranians seizing or stopping a ship, certainly, for any arbitrary reason whatsoever". Some U.S. allies, particularly European allies, were reportedly reticent towards the Sentinel Program due to qualms associated with signing on to a U.S.-led naval effort that could potentially drag them into a confrontation with Iran; this was coupled with reports of a potential European-led naval security effort separate from the U.S. By September 2019, the U.S. had "rebranded" Operation Sentinel as the "International Maritime Security Construct", reportedly to attract more participation. \c\cIn early August 2019, the United Kingdom agreed to join the U.S. in its maritime program, abandoning the idea of a European-led naval protection force. On 21 August, Australia announced it would join the U.S.-led naval coalition, with plans to deploy a P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft to the Middle East for one month before the end of 2019, a frigate in January 2020 for six months, and Australian Defence Forces personnel to the IMSC headquarters in Bahrain. Australia ended its participation in the IMSC on 28 December 2020 after defense minister Linda Reynolds announced a shifting of naval resources to the Indo-Pacific. \c\cOn 16 September, IMSC members held a Main Planning Conference aboard RFA Cardigan Bay along with representatives from 25 additional countries where they reaffirmed commitments to the operation and discussed their efforts to enhance maritime security throughout key waterways in the region. Saudi Arabia joined the coalition on 18 September and the United Arab Emirates joined on 20 September. \c\cIn November 2019, Albania became the seventh nation to join the IMSC. Lithuania joined the coalition in March 2020. \c\c United Kingdom\c\c Bahrain (Headquarters)\c\c United States\c\c Saudi Arabia\c\c United Arab Emirates\c\c Albania\c\c Lithuania\c\c Estonia. \c\c Australia (2019–2020)\c\cOn 6 August 2019, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz reportedly said Israel would participate in the coalition, providing intelligence and other unspecified assistance. \c\cJapan announced on 18 October 2019 that it would not join the IMSC but would instead send its own separate naval assets to the region to guard merchant vessels "related to Japan" while still closely cooperating with the U.S. A senior Japanese official said the contingency would likely include warships and aircraft that will patrol the Gulf of Oman, the Northern Arabian Sea and other regional waters. In February 2020, as part of efforts by the Japanese government to protect the lanes that provide all the oil the Japanese economy depends on, a Japanese warship departed for the Gulf of Oman. \c\cKuwait and Qatar expressed the intention to join in November 2019. \c\cOn 5 May 2019, then-U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton announced that the U.S. was deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and four B-52 bombers to the Middle East to "send a clear and unmistakable message" to Iran following Israeli intelligence reports of an alleged Iranian plot to attack U.S. forces in the region. Bolton said, "The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack." The USS Abraham Lincoln was deployed to the Arabian Sea, outside the Persian Gulf. \c\cOn 7 May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a surprise midnight visit to Baghdad after canceling a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Pompeo told Iraqi President Barham Salih and Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi they had a responsibility to protect Americans in Iraq. On 8 May, an advisor to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran was confident the U.S. was both unwilling and unable to start a war with Iran. On the same day, Iran announced that it would reduce its commitment to the JCPOA nuclear deal which the U.S. had withdrawn from. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani set a 60-day deadline for the EU and world powers to rescue the current deal before it resumed higher uranium enrichment. The United States Air Forces Central Command announced that F-15C Eagle fighter jets were repositioned within the region to "defend U.S. forces and interests in the region". On 10 May, the U.S. deployed the Marine transport ship USS Arlington and a Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) battery to the Middle East. The Pentagon said the buildup was in response to "heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations". \c\cOn 12 May, four commercial ships, including two Saudi Aramco oil tankers, were damaged near the port of Fujairah in the Gulf of Oman. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) claimed the incident was a "sabotage attack", while a U.S. assessment reportedly blamed Iran or Iranian "proxy" elements for the attack. \c\cOn 13 May, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad said U.S. citizens should not travel to Iraq and for those who were already there to keep a low profile. On the same day, The New York Times reported that Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan had presented a military plan to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East if Iran attacked American forces or took steps toward developing nuclear weapons. U.S. president Donald Trump later discredited this, saying he would instead "send a hell of a lot more" than 120,000 troops if necessary. \c\cOn 14 May, both Iranian and U.S. officials said they were not seeking war, even as threats and counter-threats continued. Ayatollah Khamenei downplayed the escalation, saying in comments carried on state television that "no war is going to happen," while Mike Pompeo said while on a visit to Russia, "We fundamentally do not seek a war with Iran." On the same day, Houthi rebels—which have alleged ties to Iranian elements—in Yemen carried out multiple drone attacks on a Saudi oil pipeline deep in Saudi territory. The U.S. said it believed Iran sponsored the attack, though it was unclear if the attack was particularly related to the Iran–U.S. tensions or related to the Yemeni Civil War that began in 2015 and the U.S.-backed Saudi Arabian-led intervention there. On 15 May, the U.S. State Department announced that all non-emergency staff had been ordered to leave the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. \c\cOn 19 May, President Trump warned that in the event of a conflict, it would be "the official end of Iran". Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded that Trump's "genocidal taunts" would not "end Iran". On the same day, a rocket exploded inside the heavily fortified Green Zone sector of Baghdad, landing less than a mile from the U.S. Embassy. On 24 May, the U.S. deployed 1,500 additional troops to the Persian Gulf region as a "protective" measure against Iran. The deployment included reconnaissance aircraft, fighter jets and engineers; 600 of the troops were given extended deployments, meaning 900 would be fresh troops. U.S. Navy vice admiral and Director of the Joint Staff Michael Gilday said the U.S. had a high degree of confidence that Iran's Revolutionary Guard was responsible for the 12 May explosions on four tankers and that it was Iranian proxies in Iraq who fired rockets into Baghdad's Green Zone. \c\cOn 20 May, Trump said: "We have no indication that anything's happened or will happen" in Iran. However, on 25 May, Trump invoked a rarely used legal loophole to approve the sale of $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, declaring that ongoing tensions with Iran amounted to a national emergency. Weapons would also reportedly be sold to the UAE and Jordan. On 28 May, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran was abiding by the main terms of the JCPOA, although questions were raised on how many advanced centrifuges Iran was allowed to have, as that was only loosely defined in the 2015 deal. \c\cOn 1 June, President Hassan Rouhani suggested Iran would be willing to hold talks but asserted that it would not be pressured by sanctions and American military posturing. On 2 June, Mike Pompeo said the U.S. was ready for unconditional discussions with Iran on its nuclear program, but affirmed that it would not relent on pressuring Iran until it starts behaving like a "normal country". "We are prepared to engage in a conversation with no pre-conditions. We are ready to sit down," Pompeo said, while also saying Trump had always been willing to seek dialogue with Iranian leadership. Iran's foreign ministry responded stating, "The Islamic Republic of Iran does not pay attention to word-play and expression of hidden agenda in new forms. What matters is the change of U.S. general approach and actual behavior toward the Iranian nation," which it said needed "reform". The softening dialogue came amid U.S. military exercises in the Arabian Sea, which saw various aircraft "simulating strike operations"; Yahya Rahim Safavi, top military aide to Ayatollah Khamenei, said U.S. military vessels in the Persian Gulf were within range of Iranian missiles and warned that any clash between the two countries would push oil prices above $100 a barrel. \c\cOn 6 June, the Houthis in Yemen shot down an American MQ-9 Reaper (Predator B) drone. The U.S. military claimed the attack was performed with Iranian assistance. U.S. Central Command commander Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. warned that Iran and its "proxy" forces still posed an "imminent" threat to U.S. forces: "I think we\'re still in the period of what I would call tactical warning ... The threat is very real."\c\cAlso on 6 June, the UAE, supported by Norway and Saudi Arabia, told the United Nations Security Council 12 May attacks had the marks of a "sophisticated and coordinated operation", and were most likely performed by a "state actor". Video of the damage to the tankers Amjad, Al Marzoqah, A Michel and Andrea Victory was released to broadcasters. \c\cOn 13 June 2019 two oil tankers caught fire after allegedly being attacked by limpet mines or flying objects in another incident in the Gulf of Oman. As in the May incident, the U.S. blamed Iranian forces for the attacks. On 17 June, the U.S. announced the deployment of 1,000 more soldiers to the Middle East. \c\cTensions reached a new high when, on 20 June, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down a U.S. RQ-4A Global Hawk surveillance drone, saying the drone had violated Iranian airspace. IRGC commander Hossein Salami called the shoot-down a "clear message" to the U.S. while also warning that, though they were not seeking war, Iran was "completely ready" for it. U.S. Central Command later confirmed that the drone was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles but denied that it violated Iranian airspace, calling it an "unprovoked attack", and that it was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran and the U.S. provided conflicting GPS coordinates for the drone's location, making it unclear whether the drone was within Iran's 12-mile territorial boundary. The U.S. requested a 24 June closed-door United Nations Security Council meeting to address the regional tensions with Iran, according to diplomats. \c\cTrump ordered a retaliatory military strike on Iran on 20 June, but withdrew the order minutes before the operation began. Trump said he had decided to halt the operation after being told that as many as 150 Iranians would be killed, although some administration officials said Trump had been advised of the potential casualties before he ordered the operation to be prepared. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton reportedly objected to the reversal. \c\cOn 22 June, it was reported that Trump had approved cyber attacks that disabled IRGC computer systems used to control rocket and missile launches the night of the drone-downing. The cyber strikes were handled by U.S. Cyber Command in conjunction with U.S. Central Command. It represented the first offensive show of force since Cyber Command was elevated to a full combatant command in May 2018. Also on 22 June, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to U.S. industries that Iran was stepping up cyber attacks of critical industries—particularly oil, gas and other energy sectors—and government agencies, and has the potential to disrupt or destroy systems. \c\cOn 23 June, Iranian President Rouhani blamed the United States\' "interventionist military presence" for the high tensions. Iranian Major General Gholam Ali Rashid warned the U.S. of "uncontrollable" consequences should a conflict break out. Meanwhile, during a speech in Israel, U.S. security advisor John Bolton said Iran should not "mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness", emphasizing that future military options are not ruled out and that Trump had only stopped the strike from going forward "at this time". Mike Pompeo visited the Persian Gulf region for talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in a bid to build a coalition to combat perceived Iranian nuclear and "terror" ambitions. \c\cOn 24 June, the Trump administration announced new sanctions against Iranian government and IRGC leadership, including Supreme Leader Khamenei and his office. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions were to block "billions" in assets. On the same day, Trump told reporters he did not need congressional consent for an initial strike on Iran. On 25 June, Iran said the new sanctions prompted a "permanent closure" of their diplomatic ties, and the regime refused to negotiate with Washington until the sanctions were lifted. On 27 June, Javad Zarif tweeted that sanctions are not an "alternative to war; they ARE war" and argued that Trump's usage of the term "obliteration" against Iran is a reference to genocide, a war crime. He also said negotiations and threats are "mutually exclusive" and called the concept of only a short war with Iran an "illusion". \c\cIn classified briefings, Pompeo and other U.S. State Department and Pentagon officials reportedly advised members of the U.S. Congress on what they described as alarming ties between Iran and al-Qaeda—including giving the terrorist organization safe haven in the country. The New York Times reported that lawmakers were leery of assertions of Iranian links to al-Qaeda, notably due to concerns that the administration may be using specious assertions to build a case for military action against Iran based on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists—supposed links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda were used as partial justification to invade Iraq in 2003. On 27 June, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy sharply denied that Pentagon officials linked al-Qaeda to Iran during congressional meetings. "In these briefings, none of the officials mentioned al-Qa\'ida or the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force," Mulroy said, adding that he and the Defense Intelligence Agency instead "described the historical ties between Iran and the Taliban, and I explained that these ties are widely and publicly known and referenced in articles and books". \c\cFollowing the drone shoot-down, the U.S. continued unabated to deploy military assets to the region. By 28 June, the U.S. had deployed nearly a dozen F-22 Raptor fighter jets to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar—the first ever deployment of F-22s to the base—to "defend American forces and interests". \c\cOn 18 July, according to the Pentagon, USS Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone that had closed in within approximately 1,000 yards (910 m) of the ship in the Persian Gulf; U.S. forces jammed the drone, causing it to crash. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi denied any of the country's drones had been brought down. U.S. General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., commander of the U.S. Central Command, subsequently claimed that USS Boxer may have downed a second Iranian drone. \c\cOn 3 July, Gibraltar enacted "Sanctions Regulations 2019" after the March 2019 Sanctions Act, referring to the EU sanctions for Syria (EU No. 36/2012). It also specified the Panama-flagged Iranian tanker Grace 1 as a ship under those regulations. On 4 July, the ship was seized by British authorities while carrying out an off-port limited logistics stop near Gibraltar, on suspicion that the vessel was carrying oil to Syria in breach of the European Union sanctions. A force of 30 Royal Marines boarded the ship from a helicopter and speedboat, accompanied by Royal Gibraltar Police officers and HM Customs Gibraltar officers. Four of the ship's crew, including the captain and chief officer, were arrested but subsequently released on bail without charge. The Spanish Foreign Office lodged a complaint with its British counterpart. Iran demanded the ship's release and denied the vessel was violating sanctions, and an official of the IRGC issued a threat to seize a British ship in retaliation. Ayatollah Khamenei described the incident as a British act of "piracy" which has been given a "legal appearance". Britain offered to release the ship in exchange for an Iranian guarantee that it would not proceed to the Syrian port of Baniyas to deliver oil to the refinery there. On 11 July, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose foiled an Iranian attempt to capture the BP-owned British oil tanker British Heritage as it transited through the Strait of Hormuz. Three boats believed to be from the IRGC approached the tanker and tried to halt it, after which HMS Montrose, which had been shadowing the tanker, moved between the boats and the tanker and trained guns on the boats, warning them to back off. The Iranian boats then turned away. The Royal Navy subsequently deployed the destroyer HMS Duncan to the Persian Gulf to reinforce HMS Montrose. \c\cOn 14 July, a Panamanian-flagged oil tanker, MT Riah, which was operating in the UAE, disappeared from ship tracking maps near Iran after crossing the Strait of Hormuz. Adding to the mystery, no entity claimed ownership of the tanker. \c\cOn 20 July, the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero was seized in a raid by IRGC forces. Four small boats and a helicopter stopped the ship and Iranian commandos rappelled on board from the helicopter. The ship was taken to Bandar Abbas and its crew of 23 detained on board. On 4 September, Iran decided to free only seven crew members of the detained British tanker. A second British-owned and Liberian-flagged ship was also seized but later allowed to continue its journey. In a letter to the UN, Iran said the Stena Impero had collided with and damaged an Iranian vessel, and ignored warnings by Iranian authorities. \c\cThe ship's seizure sparked a diplomatic crisis between the United Kingdom and Iran. The British government condemned the seizure of the ship and demanded its release, warning of "serious consequences". Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi visited Iran to negotiate the release of Stena Impero at the request of the British government. Iran confirmed that it seized the ship as retaliation over the British seizure of Grace 1 in Gibraltar and hinted that it would be willing to release Stena Impero in exchange for the release of Grace 1. \c\cOn 31 July, the United States sanctioned the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, complicating the chances of a diplomatic resolution of the crisis. \c\cOn 4 August 2019, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized an Iraqi tanker for allegedly smuggling oil to other Arab countries. The seven crew members on board were detained, further heightening tensions in the Persian Gulf.[citation needed] Three days later, Britain joined the U.S.-led International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC)—then known as the "Sentinel Program"—to protect oil tankers in the gulf and surrounding seas. \c\cOn 15 August, Gibraltar released Grace 1 after receiving assurances the oil would not be sold to an EU-sanctioned entity, and after rejecting a request from the United States Department of Justice to allow them to seize the ship. The Iranian government later said it had issued no assurances that the oil would not be delivered to Syria and reasserted its intention to continue supplying oil to the Arab nation. On 16 August, the Department of Justice issued a warrant in Washington, D.C. to seize Grace 1, the cargo of oil, and $995,000 on the grounds that the profit from the ship's voyage was intended to enrich the IRGC, which the U.S. had previously designated a terrorist organization. On 18 August, Gibraltar announced that its Justice Ministry had rejected the U.S. warrant, as U.S. sanctions against Iran did not apply in the European Union, and the ship, renamed Adrian Darya 1 and registered under the Iranian flag, was expected to sail imminently from Gibraltar. \c\cAfter releasing the ship, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the tanker and its captain and inputted them in the blacklist. Some days later, Brian Hook, the U.S. Special Representative for Iran, sent emails to the Indian captain of the ship and offered some million dollars in U.S. cash to steer the Adrian Darya 1 to a country where it could be seized by U.S. forces; but he rejected these offers. \c\cOn 3 September, Iran announced that the oil tanker Adrian Darya 1 had delivered its cargo, defying U.S. threats. Satellite imagery had shown the tanker near Syria. On 9 September, Britain's foreign minister accused Iran of selling the oil that was carried in Adrian Darya 1 to Syria. Iran said the oil had been sold to a private company which is not an EU-sanctioned entity, so its assurance to Gibraltar had not been breached. \c\cOn 14 September, the 2019 Abqaiq–Khurais attack took place—a coordinated cruise missile and drone attack that targeted the state-owned Saudi Aramco oil processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais in eastern Saudi Arabia. The Houthi movement in Yemen claimed responsibility, tying it to events surrounding the Saudi Arabian intervention in the Yemeni Civil War. However, claims made by some U.S. officials that the attacks originated in Iran, despite Iran's denial, further escalated the current gulf crisis. \c\cOn 16 September, the IRGC seized another vessel near Iran's Greater Tunb island in the Persian Gulf. It was reported that the vessel was allegedly smuggling 250,000 litres of diesel fuel to the UAE. \c\cOn 23 September, the Iranian president criticized the IMSC, the new U.S.-led maritime coalition set to patrol the region's waterways, and asked the western powers to leave the security of the Persian Gulf to them. \c\cOn 27 September, the British oil tanker Stena Impero departed from Iranian waters after around two months in Iranian detention. The remainder of the ship's 23 crew members who were detained in Iran were released as well, with seven crew members already released on 4 September. On 28 September, Stena Impero, which was also able to transmit signals, docked at Port Rashid, Dubai. The same day, HMS Duncan returned to her homeport, Portsmouth naval base. \c\cOn 7 November 2019, International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) launched official operations in Bahrain to protect the shipping lanes near the troubled Iranian territorial waters. The coalition opened its command center in the kingdom, to ward off the perceived threat to the global oil supply amid the crisis. \c\cIn early December, the Pentagon considered sending reinforcements to the Middle East to deal with escalating tensions due to attacks against international shipping through the Persian Gulf, a missile strike against a Saudi oil facility, violent crackdown of protests in Iran, and heightened Iranian activities in the region. The number of people dead in Iranian demonstrations remained disputed, though Iran had not released any official estimates. U.S. special representative for Iran Brian Hook announced that his country was offering $15 million for information concerning the whereabouts of Abdulreza Shahlai, a senior Iranian commander accused of orchestrating numerous attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and a foiled attempt to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. \c\cOn 27 December, Iran, Russia, and China began a four-day naval exercise in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman. The exercise was launched from Chabahar Port near Pakistan, and included the Chinese Type 051 destroyer Xining. The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed it had deployed ships from the Baltic Fleet in its official newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda. According to Iranian government and military officials over its state news channel Press TV, the exercise was a response to U.S.–Saudi regional maneuvers and was meant to demonstrate that Iran was not isolated despite U.S. sanctions. In contrast, the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, Senior Colonel Wu Qian, claimed the exercise was a "normal military exchange" unconnected to the international tensions. \c\cAlso on 27 December, K-1 Air Base in Iraq's Kirkuk Governorate was attacked with Katyusha rockets, injuring several Iraqi Security Forces personnel, four U.S. soldiers, and killing a U.S. civilian military contractor. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the attacks, blaming Iranian-backed Shi\'ite Muslim militias. On 29 December, U.S. airstrikes targeted Kata\'ib Hizbollah facilities in Iraq and Syria killing 25 militants and injuring at least 55 others. The Department of Defense said the operation was in retaliation for repeated attacks on Iraqi military bases hosting Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) coalition forces, particularly the K-1 Air Base attack. About 5,000 U.S. troops were present in Iraq to deal with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant remnants and to assist the Iraqi military. Kata\'ib Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attacks. \c\cOn 31 December, Iran-backed militiamen under the Popular Mobilization Forces attacked the outer perimeter of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, prompting American diplomats to evacuate to safe rooms. The militiamen later withdrew. An additional 100 U.S. Marines were sent to reinforce the embassy. \c\cA major flashpoint in the crisis occurred on 3 January 2020, when President Donald Trump approved the targeted killing of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. Iraqi paramilitary leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and other IRGC and Iraqi paramilitary personnel were also killed in the drone attack. Shortly after the attack, the U.S. deployed an additional 3,000 ground troops to the Middle East, in addition to 14,000 already stationed there since May the previous year. President Trump defended the move, claiming in an interview with The Ingraham Angle on the Fox News Channel that General Soleimani was planning further attacks against four U.S. Embassies across the Middle East. This was later challenged by U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper in interviews on Face the Nation on CBS and State of the Union on CNN, who claimed that President Trump was not embellishing that there was an Iranian threat but that he had seen no evidence that U.S. embassies were to be targeted. As the funeral procession for Soleimani and al-Muhandis was ongoing in Baghdad, several rockets hit near the U.S. embassy and the Balad Air Base without any casualties. \c\cAmid international fears of a direct confrontation between the two nations, Trump warned Iran on 4 January against attacking U.S. assets or any Americans in the region. He threatened that in the event of an Iranian attack, the U.S. would target 52 Iranian sites, including cultural sites, which represented the 52 hostages taken by Iran in 1979, and would strike "very fast and very hard". The White House officially notified the U.S. Congress about the killing of Qassem Soleimani, in accordance with the 1973 War Powers Resolution, a day after the fact. Meanwhile, thousands of people in 70 cities across the U.S. participated in antiwar demonstrations against a new conflict in the Middle East. On the same day, the UK sent two warships, HMS Kent and HMS Defender, to the Persian Gulf to protect their ships and citizens. The Royal Navy was deployed to accompany British-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz. \c\cOn 5 January, Iran announced that it would not continue to abide by the limitations mentioned in the 2015 nuclear deal. An Iranian government statement on state television said "If the sanctions are lifted ... the Islamic Republic is ready to return to its obligations." Iran also demanded the Iraqi parliament to get rid of the American presence in their country. The Iraqi parliament passed a resolution to expel all foreign, particularly U.S., troops from Iraqi territory through a vote boycotted by Sunni and Kurdish representatives. The media initially reported that the U.S. would comply with the resolution after a draft letter from Brigadier General William H. Seely III addressed to the Iraqi Defense Ministry emerged claiming as such, but Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark A. Milley and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper soon clarified that the letter had been sent in error and the U.S. Armed Forces would not withdraw from Iraq. In response to the Iraqi parliament situation, Trump threatened to impose sanctions on Iraq "like they\'ve never seen before". On 10 January, Acting Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi placed a telephone call to Secretary of State Pompeo demanding that the U.S. send a delegation "to prepare a mechanism to carry out the parliament's resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq". Pompeo rejected Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi's requests. Shortly afterwards Iraq's highest-ranking Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, condemned the U.S.–Iran crisis. \c\cIn response to Iran's violations of the 2015 nuclear deal, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany threatened to activate the deal's dispute mechanism reenacting European Union and United Nations sanctions on Iran, a move supported by the U.S. State Department. In response, the Iranian Foreign Ministry threatened a "serious and strong response", and President Rouhani made a televised Cabinet address on Iranian state television directly threatening European troops while blaming U.S. escalation for the crisis. Soon afterwards, Rouhani claimed the country was enriching uranium at a higher rate per day than before the ratification of the deal, though experts questioned the logistical reality of that claim. \c\cMeanwhile, the legality of the Baghdad Airport strike was brought into question in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. Congress was not consulted before the attack and some congress members sought to restrict the president's ability to attack Iran. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the strike, and declared that Congress needed to be consulted in advance for any such military actions. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would introduce a resolution to limit Trump's ability to take actions against Iran. On 10 January, the House ratified the resolution by a vote of 224–194. The vote was mostly conducted among party lines, with eight Democrats opposing the resolution and three Republicans favoring it. Following the killing of Soleimani, a classified intelligence briefing to the U.S. Senate by CIA Director Gina Haspel was heavily scrutinized by many congressmembers and caused many legislators to question the Trump administration's rationale for the attacks. Shortly afterwards the U.S. State Department cancelled four further briefings on the crisis to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee without rescheduling them. Representative Eliot Engel, the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, invited Mike Pompeo to a 29 January hearing to testify on the crisis and threatened to issue a subpoena against him. \c\cOn 8 January 2020, Iraq's Al Asad Airbase, which hosted U.S.-led coalition troops, was attacked with ballistic missiles as a part of Iran's "Operation Martyr Soleimani", named for general Qasem Soleimani. It was reported that the airbase in Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan was attacked as well. During the attack, the IRGC declared that "fierce revenge by the Revolutionary Guards had begun", indicating it was the official response to the killing of Soleimani. Although among the facilities struck were troop sleeping quarters, some analysts suggested the strike was deliberately designed to avoid causing any fatalities to dissuade an American response. While the U.S. initially assessed that none of its service members were injured or killed, the U.S. Department of Defense ultimately said that 110 service members had been diagnosed and treated for traumatic brain injuries from the attack. \c\cDuring his White House address hours after the attack, Trump ruled out a direct military response, urged rapprochement with Iran, demanded NATO be more involved in regional affairs, and demanded a new Iran nuclear deal be arranged. Trump, however, also announced new sanctions on Iran and affirmed his position that Iran could not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. \c\cOn 9 January, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council announcing that the United States was willing to negotiate with Iran to prevent further escalation. Ayatollah Khamenei rejected the possibility of talks at any level between U.S. and Iranian officials unless the United States returned to the JCPOA; Iranian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Majid Takht-Ravanchi likewise rejected the option. Both ambassadors justified their countries\' military actions under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. On 14 January, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson encouraged the negotiation of a new nuclear deal between the Trump administration and the Iranian government, which President Trump expressed agreement with. \c\cOn 10 January, the Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions targeting Iran's metals industry and eight senior officials who were involved in the prior missile attacks. According to U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, the sanctions would affect "billions" in revenue. The U.S. also warned Iraq that it would freeze its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York if it continued to urge the withdrawal of American troops, which would prevent the Iraqi government from accessing oil revenues, damage the Iraqi economy, and devalue the Iraqi dinar. \c\cOn 15 January, the United States and Iraq resumed joint military operations against the Islamic State after a ten-day suspension following the drone strike on Soleimani. \c\cHours after the ballistic missile attacks, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crashed just after taking off from Tehran International Airport, killing all 176 passengers and crew, including 82 Iranian and 63 Canadian citizens. An investigation was launched to decipher the reason for the crash. On 9 January, U.S. officials said they believe the aircraft had been shot down in error by an Iranian Tor missile, based on evidence from reconnaissance satellite imagery and radar data. Iranian officials initially denied the allegations but, on 11 January, admitted to accidentally shooting down the plane. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged deescalation and claimed that the United States\' escalation of the conflict was partially to blame for the accident, saying "If there was no escalation recently in the region, those Canadians would be right now home with their families. This is something that happens when you have conflict and the war. Innocents bear the brunt of it." The incident slightly worsened Canada–United States relations. The airline shoot-down also reignited anti-government protests within Iran that had previously become dormant during the massive public outcry against the death of Soleimani. Foreign ministers from the countries who lost citizens in the crash—Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan, and the United Kingdom—met at the Canadian High Commission in London and demanded that Iran provide compensation for families of the victims. \c\cOn 12 January, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah called for Iran's allies in the Axis of Resistance—including Iran, the Syrian Arab Republic, Hezbollah, the Popular Mobilization Forces, and the Houthi movement in Yemen—to intensify its military campaigns against the U.S. to expel U.S. forces from the Middle East. During a state visit by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar to Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei called for regional cooperation against the U.S. However, following discussions between Sheikh Tamim and President Rouhani, Tamim concluded that de-escalation and dialogue were the only means to resolve the regional crises. In response to the increased tensions, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and many U.S. states released advisories warning of Iranian cyberattacks, while the Texas Department of Information Resources said Iranian cyberattacks had reached a rate of 10,000 per minute. \c\cOn 17 January, Ayatollah Khamenei personally led Friday prayers in Tehran for the first time since February 2012, speaking at the Imam Khomeini Grand Mosque. During his televised sermon, Khamenei lamented the shootdown of the Ukrainian airliner, sought to present the image that the country was unified despite protests and the international crisis, and lashed out at the UK, France, and Germany, referring to them as "servants" of the "villainous" United States. Khamenei denounced the Trump administration as "clowns" and insisted that the "real punishment" for General Soleimani's assassination would be forcing American forces out of the Middle East. In response Trump, who was vacationing at Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, at the time, made posts on Twitter urging Iranian leadership to stop "killing" Iranian protesters and that it "should abandon terror and Make Iran Great Again!" One of the posts was written in both English and Persian. On the same day, the Asian Football Confederation banned Iran from hosting international football matches. On 18 January, the U.S. sanctioned Brigadier General Hassan Shahvarpour, an IRGC commander in Khuzestan Province, after security personnel fired into protesters without warning during anti-government demonstrations in Mahshahr County. \c\cOn 26 January, three rockets were fired on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, wounding at least one staff member present at the cafeteria at dinner time, with the nationality of the wounded still undisclosed, other sources reported three wounded. \c\cOn 9 February, during routine maritime patrols, U.S. forces aboard the USS Normandy (CG-60) interdicted and seized a cache of Iranian-made weapons aboard a dhow in the Arabian Sea that was purportedly en route to supply Houthi rebels in Yemen. According to the U.S., the shipment consisted of 358 weapons components, including 150 Dehlavieh anti-tank missiles, three Iranian-made SAMs, thermal imaging weapon scopes, and other components for manned and unmanned aerial and surface vessels, such as bomb boats and weaponized drones. \c\cOn 10 February, the Pentagon confirmed that more than a hundred U.S. service members were injured from the 8 January IRGC ballistic missile attacks, with 109 personnel diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. \c\cOn 13 February, the U.S. Senate voted 55–45 to constrain Trump's ability to wage war on Iran without congressional approval. The bipartisan vote for the Iran War Powers Resolution included eight Republican senators. Trump threatened to veto the resolution. On the same day, a rocket hit an Iraqi base in Kirkuk that housed U.S. forces. No casualties were reported. \c\cOn 11 March, Qasem Soleimani's birthday, 15 Katyusha rockets struck Camp Taji, Iraq, killing two U.S. soldiers and one British soldier from the Royal Army Medical Corps. The attack left 12 other American soldiers, contractors and OIR coalition personnel (including a Polish soldier) injured, five critically. On 13 March after midnight, after a previous retaliatory operation, the U.S. launched air raids against Kata\'ib Hezbollah facilities in Karbala and the Babylon area near the Karbala International Airport; the strikes reportedly killed at least three Iraqi soldiers, two policemen and one civilian. 11 Iraqi soldiers were wounded as well as five Popular Mobilization Forces fighters. \c\cOn 14 March, before 11:00 AM, another rocket attack struck Camp Taji; more than 24 107mm caliber rockets struck the coalition compound and the Iraqi Air defenses installation there, injuring three coalition soldiers and two Iraqi soldiers. Iraqi forces subsequently found seven Katyusha rocket launchers with 25 rockets armed but not launched nearby. \c\cOn 16 March, the U.S. announced it would pull out from three of its eight bases on Iraq, amid continued tensions with the Iraqi government and Iran. In the border crossing of al-Qaim, the U.S. handed over equipment to the Iraqi security forces to ensure border security with Syria, a significant move that effectively ended any significant U.S. presence along the Iraqi side of the border. The other two military bases later transferred to the Iraqis were the Qayyarah Airfield and the K-1 Air Base. CJTF-OIR said the base transfers and repositioning of forces were pre-planned in coordination with the Iraqi government in response to progress in the ongoing operation against ISIL and unrelated to the recent base attacks or the COVID-19 viral pandemic situation in the country. The coalition added it would relocate and consolidate personnel and equipment from several Iraqi bases throughout 2020. \c\cOn 17 March, two rockets struck the Besmaya Range Complex, south of Baghdad, where Spanish troops were stationed; no casualties were reported. \c\cThe gradual reduction of NATO and coalition presence in Iraq continued on 24 March when the Czech Republic withdrew troops citing security threats, the global COVID-19 pandemic, and a planned mission restructuring. 30 Czech soldiers participating in Operation Inherent Resolve and the NATO Training Mission in Iraq returned to Prague. \c\cOn 25 March, France announced it would withdraw its forces from training duties in Iraq, mostly trainers to local armed forces, largely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Iraq's military halted all training in early March to minimize the risk of the illness spreading among its forces, including from the OIR coalition. \c\cOn 3 April, the Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed forces Mohammad Bagheri said, "Iran will respond severely if the United States does anything to undermine security of Iran". \c\cOn 7 April, in Iraq, the coalition withdrew from the Abu Ghraib operating base, the al-Sqoor base inside Nineveh Operations Command, and the Al-Taqaddum Air Base, handing control to the Iraqi security forces. However, amidst the force consolidation, by 13 April the U.S. had also installed and activated Patriot air defense systems, an Army C-RAM system, and an AN/TWQ-1 Avenger at Al Asad Airbase and the base at Erbil (the two bases attacked by Iran in January), and at Camp Taji, after gradually moving the systems piece-by-piece into Iraq since January. CENTCOM commander Gen. Frank McKenzie said the Patriots and other systems were taken from another location where they were also needed, without saying where. U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley also added that hundreds of troops from the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, which deployed to Iraq in January as an Immediate Response Force following the embassy attack, would remain until "... the situation with the Shia militia groups and Iran ... 100 percent settled down". \c\cOn 14 April, an oil tanker named SC Taipei sailing under the flag of Hong Kong was seized and released the same day by armed men while anchored 3 nm off Iran's Ras Al Kuh coast. \c\cGulf tensions remained high in mid-April between Iranian and U.S. vessels. On 15 April, during U.S. Army AH-64E Apache deck landing qualifications with the Navy in the northern Persian Gulf, 11 NEDSA speed boats began circling six U.S. vessels partaking in the exercise, including coming within 10 yards of the U.S. Coast Guard's Island-class cutter Maui (WPB-1304) and within 50 yards of the USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB-3). According to the U.S. Navy, "The IRGCN vessels repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of the U.S. vessels at extremely close range and high speeds ... the U.S. crews issued multiple warnings via bridge-to-bridge radio, five short blasts from the ships\' horns and long range acoustic noise maker devices, but received no response." The incident lasted almost an hour, until the Iranian vessels departed, and occurred about two weeks after the U.S. moved a carrier strike group out of the region. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group had departed the Middle East earlier in the month after operating in the region with the Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group, a rare occurrence for the Navy which has not had multiple strike groups in the region for years. On 19 April, the IRGC acknowledged that an incident took place, but dismissed the U.S. version of events. \c\cOn 22 April, in response to the 15 April incident, U.S. president Trump tweeted that he instructed the U.S. Navy to "shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats" if they harassed U.S. ships. Senior Pentagon officials said the tweet reflected a lawful order that would be implemented, though it did not mark a change in the rules of engagement. \c\cPresident Trump vetoed a Senate resolution on 6 May that would have required him to seek congressional authorization before taking military action against Iran. \c\cOn 7 May, the United States removed four Patriot missile batteries, two jet fighter squadrons and dozens of military personnel from Saudi Arabia while considering a reduction in the U.S. Navy presence in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. decision may have been related to the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war as it affected the U.S. oil prices. \c\cOn 10 May, the Iranian frigate Jamaran accidentally launched a Noor anti-ship missile at its support vessel, the Konarak, while the latter was deploying practice targets for a naval exercise. It was later determined that 19 sailors were killed and 15 injured. Some observers concluded that the Iranian friendly fire incident typified the ongoing instability in the Persian Gulf. Fabian Hinz of the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies, an expert on Iran's military, said the incident "... really showed that the situation with Iran is still dangerous because accidents and miscalculations can happen". \c\cOn 12 June, the United Nations concluded that the cruise missiles that struck the Saudi Aramco oil complex in September 2019 likely came from Iran. \c\cMeanwhile, on 19 June, the board of the UN's atomic watchdog agency adopted a resolution calling for Iran to provide inspectors access to sites where the country is thought to have stored or used undeclared nuclear material. \c\cOn 24 June, the U.S. imposed sanctions on five Iranian tanker captains for their links to the export of Iranian gasoline and gasoline components to Venezuela. \c\cOn 29 June, Iran issued an arrest warrant for U.S. president Donald Trump and 35 other individuals on "murder and terrorism charges" for the January drone strike on General Qasem Soleimani and requested international assistance in detaining him. Responding to Iran's request to issue a red notice, Interpol issued a statement that it could not comply as its charter prohibits "intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character." U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook dismissed the warrant as "a propaganda stunt that no one takes seriously and makes the Iranians look foolish." Analysts and commentators identified the issuance of the warrant as symbolic rather than a genuine attempt to arrest Trump. \c\cAlso on 29 June, a report by Al Arabiya released photo evidence of a wooden dhow carrying hundreds of reportedly Iranian weapons and other material bearing Persian language that was intercepted on 17 April. The dhow was found off the coast of Mocha, Yemen. \c\cSpecial representative Brian Hook visited Israel and Saudi Arabia and stated "Israel and the U.S. 'see eye to eye\' on the need to extend the UN conventional arms embargo [against Iran], warning that its expiration would allow it to export more arms to its regional proxies." On 30 June, Chinese ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun said during a virtual UN Security Council meeting the Trump administration could not initiate a Security Council mechanism to nullify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal by re-invoking the arms embargo, saying "Having quit the JCPOA, the U.S. is no longer a participant and has no right to trigger the snapback" of sanctions. Notably, German ambassador Christoph Heusgen concurred with the Chinese stance, though echoed the U.S. concern about "the expiration of these limitations" on Iran's ability to purchase weapons. \c\cOn 1 July, a fire and explosion hit a centrifuge production plant at a nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran. No deaths or injuries were reported. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz denied Israeli involvement, saying "Not every incident that transpires in Iran necessarily has something to do with us."\c\c"All those systems are complex, they have very high safety constraints and I\'m not sure they always know how to maintain them," Gantz told Israel Radio. \c\cOn 6 July, NEDSA commander Admiral Alireza Tangsiri claimed Iran had built offshore missile facilities and underground speedboat and "missile cities" along its southern coast. \c\cAlso on 6 July, the Mossad spy agency reportedly said it recently foiled planned or attempted Iranian attacks on Israeli diplomatic missions in Europe and elsewhere. \c\cOn 7 July, the United Nations Human Rights Council, led by special rapporteur Agnès Callamard, concluded that the killing of General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020 by U.S. forces was "unlawful". Callamard said that based on U.S. evidence, the killing was "arbitrary" and "violated the UN charter." "No evidence has been provided that General Soleimani specifically was planning an imminent attack against U.S. interests, particularly in Iraq, for which immediate action was necessary and would have been justified," Callamard wrote. On 21 July, Ayatollah Khamenei threatened that Iran would eventually conduct a reciprocal strike against the U.S. as further vengeance for the killing of Soleimani. \c\cOn 8 July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hinted at Iranian-links in the 6 July assassination of prominent Iraqi counter-terrorism expert Hisham al-Hashimi, highlighting threats made against him by Iranian-linked groups. \c\cOn 16 July, CNN reported the U.S. had "several" intelligence indications that Iran had put portions of its air defense system on "high alert" in recent days, following unexplained explosions at key facilities tied to the country's military and nuclear programs. On 18 July, according to Iranian media, a large explosion was heard in Ahvaz; further reports linked the explosion to an oil pipeline, though this was not officially confirmed. \c\cOn 24 July, two U.S. F-15 fighter jets briefly intercepted a Mahan Air passenger aircraft flying near a U.S. coalition garrison in Syria while en route from Tehran to Beirut. According to Iranian media and government officials, the intercepting F-15 made "provocative" and "dangerous" maneuvers, causing the airliner's pilot to abruptly lower altitude to avoid collision, injuring several passengers on board, with at least two taken to the hospital upon emergency landing. According to the U.S., however, the F-15s followed proper international procedure and were conducting a standard visual inspection of the airliner after it appeared "to have deviated from" an established commercial air corridor. The intercepting F-15 flew within 1,000-1,500 meters of the aircraft and then departed after identification, a U.S. official added. Iran demanded an international investigation in response to the incident and foreign minister Javad Zarif condemned the intercept and the American "occupation" in Syria as "lawlessness upon lawlessness". \c\cOn 26 July, satellite imagery revealed the IRGC Navy (IRGCN) had towed a replica U.S. Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, first revealed in 2014, from a naval base in Bandar Abbas to the Strait of Hormuz a day prior in preparation for annual live-fire drills similar to the 2015 Great Prophet IX exercise. Iranian officials and state media had yet to publicly acknowledge the development. The actual USS Nimitz entered the region the week prior to replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Arabian Sea after the latter's seven-month deployment. A spokeswoman for the United States Fifth Fleet, headquartered in Bahrain, commented that the fleet remained vigilant and questioned the "... tactical value they would hope to gain by using such a mock-up in a training or exercise scenario." U.S. special representative Brian Hook demanded Iran "spend more time on diplomacy and less time on military stunts". On 28 July, the IRGCN released footage of the drills, dubbed Great Prophet 14 (Great Prophet XIV), which included the mock carrier being assailed by commandos and a range of weaponry including limpet mines, anti-ship cruise missiles, truck-launched ballistic missiles, fast-attack speedboats, glide bombs, and, notably, Shahed 181 and 191 drones reportedly reverse engineered from the American RQ-170 drone captured by Iran in 2011. Iranian media also claimed the exercise was observed by its Nour military satellite launched in April 2020. \c\cOn 31 July, Pléiades commercial satellite imagery revealed Iran's mock carrier had inadvertently capsized while being towed on its way back to port in Bandar Abbas, listing at about 90 degrees with the starboard side facing upwards and "nearly half of the flight deck submerged" in shallow water just outside the harbor entrance, posing a navigation hazard near the main approach channel. Though regional U.S. forces detected the launch of ballistic missiles during Great Prophet XIV, according to Forbes, the satellite imagery did not appear to show extensive ballistic missile damage and, in fact, revealed less overall damage to the vessel than in Great Prophet IX, leaving "the impression that the IRGCN wanted to keep the mock carrier in better condition so it could be reused more easily in future exercises."\c\cOn 2 August, the Iranian foreign ministry announced they would put a sanction on Richard Goldberg. citing Law of "confrontation with human-rights violations and USA adventuresome and terrorist measures in the region". \c\cOn 6 August, China confirmed its support for United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 and affirmed it would veto any council proposal to extend the international Iran nuclear arms embargo, stopping a U.S.-led effort to do so. On 9 August, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) asked the UN to extend the arms embargo on Iran while, on 13 August, Saudi ambassador to the UN Abdul Aziz al-Wasel called for an embargo extension, arguing that Iran "smuggles weapons to militias to disturb the peace in the Middle East". On 15 August, the UNSC voted to deny extending the international arms embargo on Iran. Of the 15-member body, 11 members abstained while Russia and China opposed extension. \c\cLate on 12 August, the U.S. accused Iran of briefly seizing Liberian-flagged oil tanker MT Wila in the Gulf of Oman, with U.S. Central Command releasing video of apparent armed Iranian naval forces fast-roping from a Sea King helicopter and boarding the vessel. According to Coalition Task Force Sentinel, the operational arm of the IMSC maritime coalition, along with statements from an unidentified U.S. official, the seizure took place in international waters off the coast of the UAE's Khor Fakkan and the tanker was held for five hours before being released. The Wila did not make any distress calls before, during, or after the seizure and it was not immediately clear what cargo it carried or why it was seized. By 13 August, Iranian officials and state media had not publicly acknowledged the incident. \c\cOn 13 August, the U.S. seized Iranian fuel cargo for the first time. \c\cOn 13 August, UAE and Israel establish full bilateral diplomatic relations. \c\cOn 14 August, Khamenei again threatened retaliation against the U.S. for the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani.

The identification number system was developed and programmed by the Telecommunication Company of Iran. 33000 virtual ballot boxes are used. \c\cThe moderator asked every candidate different random questions, regarding economics, social and political, and people's issues. Additionally, 3 TV Chats were televised, hosting 7 candidates. \c\cHypothetical polls were done before the Guardian Council had announced who is approved to run. Therefore, these polls include several candidates (like Ahmadinejad) who were disqualified and are therefore ineligible to run. \c\cThese polls include all seven candidates who were approved by the Guardian Council. Note that Jalili, Mehralizadeh, and Zakani all withdrew after this poll was conducted. \c\cISPA (Iranian Students Polling Agency) is considered as one of the most reliable pollsters in Iran. They correctly predicted the results of the 2017 election. ISPA polls reveal that Ebrahim Raisi is heavily favored to win the election. Six "waves" of polls were conducted. Two (waves #4 and #5) were conducted before the Guardian Council's vetting and are therefore hypothetical. Four waves (waves #7, #8, #10, and #11) were conducted after the vetting; one was conducted immediately after the vetting, the other three coincided with one of the three debates. \c\c The Biden administration responded to Iran's mass disqualification of candidates for its upcoming presidential election by saying the Iranian people should be free to choose their own leaders. The statement from the White House coincides with sharp criticism of Iran’s electoral system from Iranian human rights activists and U.S. conservatives, who view the election as neither free nor fair. \c\c The President of Russia Vladimir Putin congratulated Raisi for his win and expressed hopes for strengthening of bilateral cooperation with Iran.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Fiji is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in Fiji was reported on 19 March 2020 in Lautoka. As of 19 June 2021[update], the country has had a total of 1,798 cases as of which 1,311 are currently active and 6 deaths, with all cases recorded in the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. A total of 8 COVID-19 patients have died from pre-existing non-COVID-19 related illnesses. In March 2021 Fiji became the first Pacific island country to receive the COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX initiative with frontline workers and first responders the first to be vaccinated. Out of the target population of 587,651, more than 250,000 Fijians have received their first jab of the AstraZeneca vaccine. \c\cIn the early stages of the pandemic, Fiji imposed travel bans on highly affected countries. As the pandemic worsen, Fiji closed all borders and ports to non residents. Ports were closed on 16 March 2020 and the main international airport in Nadi was closed on 26 March 2020. Returning citizens were required to self isolate at a government funded facility for 14 days, supervised by Health Officials and the Military. Domestically, the government responded by imposing a national curfew, restricting large gatherings and closing down schools and non essential services. The government imposed lockdowns in the two largest cities of Lautoka and Suva and developed a contact tracing app named careFIJI. The government established a Centre for Disease Control for COVID-19 testing and built fever clinics nationwide for temperature checks. Such measures has helped eliminate local transmissions of the virus for more than a year. \c\cFrom July 2020 to April 2021, Fiji has only recorded cases from managed quarantine facilities at the border as repatriation flights brought stranded citizens back home. This has allowed the country to relax its COVID-19 restrictions to boost its economic recovery however on 19 April 2021, Fiji confirmed its first community case as a result of a breach in protocol. In response, the township of Nadi and the city of Lautoka went into a lockdown and previous health restrictions were re-imposed all over the country with the national curfew revised. As local transmission cases soared exacerbated by the Delta variant, the Government sealed off Viti Levu establishing Suva, Lautoka, Nadi, Nausori, Rakiraki and Lami as containment areas and activating the Fiji Emergency Medical Assistance Team (FEMAT). The virus penetrated prominent hospitals of Fiji including the Fiji CDC and the headquarters of the Ministry of Health which prompted senior health officials to go into self isolation. High number of cases were recorded from the Western and Central division with the highest number of cases being from the containment of Suva, Nausori and Lami alone. Fiji also confirmed four deaths from a locally transmitted case of the virus. \c\cThe pandemic forced Fiji to reduce its interest rate. The country's economy is expected to contract after decades of economic growth due to the pandemic's impact on tourism, retail, manufacturing and trade. The International Labour Organisation and the Asian Development Bank issued reports about workers being affected and warned about the rising youth unemployment rate and child labour. The impacts has also prompted residents to leave the country for short term employment overseas. There were even reported incidents of racism and xenophobia against Chinese people or to those perceived as such.

Domestic violence and assault cases against women also increased as a result of lockdowns. \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cCompared to SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19  has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cOn 3 February, the Government of Fiji toughened border security.

Australia also invested in $500 million in the next three years to ensure that the countries of the Pacific including Fiji will be able to achieve full immunization coverage. Attorney General Aiyaz Sayed Khaiyum said that the government is working with International Agencies to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are not commercialized. \c\cIn January 2021, Australia and Fiji discussed vaccine options with the Australian Government indicating that if 80% of Fiji's population are vaccinated, chances of a travel bubble are high between the two nations. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services trained its staff for COVID-19 vaccination as the country is working to register all receivers planned for the first phase of vaccination. Vaccination are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2021 and throughout the year. \c\cIn February 2021, Fiji approved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine with the COVAX Facility committed in providing over 100,000 doses. \c\cIn early March 2021, Fiji became the first Pacific country to receive the first batch of vaccines from the World Health Organization's COVAX initiative.

On 19 April 2021, Fiji received its second batch of the AstraZeneca vaccines. \c\cAs of 8 June 2021, 220,437 Fijians (38% of the targeted population of 587,651 individuals) have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine while 4,773 individuals have been fully vaccinated (two doses). 
The COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China was the first country to identify the disease and its pathogen, the first country to impose drastic measures in response to the outbreak (including lockdowns and face mask mandates), and one of the first countries to bring the outbreak under control. The outbreak was first manifested as a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases, mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Market, in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. The outbreak was first reported to the local government on 27 December 2019 and published on 31 December. On 8 January 2020, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of the pneumonia by Chinese scientists. \c\cThe local governments of Wuhan and Hubei were widely criticized for their delayed responses to the virus and their censorship of the related information during the initial outbreak, especially during the local parliamentary sessions. This allowed early spread of the virus, as a large number of Chinese people returned home for the Chinese New Year vacation from and through Wuhan, a major transportation hub. However, stringent measures such as lockdown of Wuhan and the wider Hubei province and face mask mandates were introduced around 23 January, which significantly lowered and delayed the epidemic peak according to epidemiology modelling. Yet, by 29 January, the virus was found to have spread to all provinces of mainland China. By the same date, all provinces had launched high-level public health emergency responses. Many inter-province bus services and railway services were suspended. \c\cOn 31 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A severe shortage of face masks and other protective gear led several countries to send international aid, including medical supplies. \c\cBy late February, the pandemic had been brought under control in most Chinese provinces. On 25 February, the reported number of newly confirmed cases outside mainland China exceeded those reported from within for the first time; the WHO estimated that the measures taken in the country averted a significant number of cases. By 6 March the reported number of new cases had dropped to fewer than 100 nationally per day, down from thousands per day at the height of the crisis. On 13 March, the reported number of newly imported cases passed that of domestically transmitted new cases for the first time. Sporadic local outbreaks have happened since then, which authorities responded to with testing and restrictions. \c\cDifferent neighborhoods or townships were classified into high-, medium- or low-risk based on the number of confirmed cases and whether there were cluster cases,\c\cwhich formed the basis for the gradual easing of lockdown measures since March. Lockdown in hard-hit Wuhan was officially lifted on 8 April. \c\cDespite concerns about automated social control, health codes generated by software have been used for contact tracing: only people with green code can move freely, while those with red or yellow code need to be reported to the government. With domestic tourism first reopened among the pandemic-hit industries, China's economy continued to broaden recovery from the recession during the pandemic, with stable job creation and record international trade growth, although retail consumption was still slower than predicted. The International Monetary Fund forecasted that it would be the only major economy to grow in 2020. \c\cThroughout the pandemic, the Chinese government has shown a pattern of secrecy and top-down control. It censored discussions about the outbreak since the beginning of its spread, from as early as 1 January,  worked to censor and counter reporting and criticism about the crisis – which included the detention of several citizen journalists –  and portray the official response to the outbreak in a positive light, and restricted and facilitated investigations probing the origins of COVID-19. \c\cNews outlets have reported health experts\' concerns that the Chinese government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths. In July 2020, the government granted an emergency use authorization for two COVID-19 vaccines. It has also pledged or provided humanitarian assistance to other countries dealing with the virus. \c\cDuring June 2021, a billion doses of domestically produced vaccine will have been administered, giving a dose rate similar to many European countries. \c\cNew infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. \c\cSince the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in China have been worried about the potential return of the deadly virus which motivated the Chinese government to reform its public health system to handle the next public health crisis. As part of the reform, China expanded the laboratory networks to handle the pathogens of the infectious diseases which included a newly built BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan and a national key laboratory to investigate into pneumonia with unclear causes. Zeng Guang, the Chief Scientist at China CDC believed that a quicker publication of the epidemic information was a lesson that China learned from the SARS outbreak as the lack of information release worsened the outbreak. \c\cWith the improved public health system, China managed to handle several public health emergencies. In coping with the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak starting from Mexico, China developed and distributed vaccines to 100 million people within months as an active prevention. During the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in East China, the country's health system identified the pathogen 5 days after the outbreak. Test kits for diagnosis were designed and distributed to all mainland provinces 3 days after the identification. Within months, effective vaccines were developed. Besides, Chinese academic Li Lanjuan and her group was the first to reveal the virus's transmission methods, molecular mechanisms and effective treatment. \c\cHowever, Southern Metropolis Daily stated that although people paid more attention to public health, the government's funding to the health system was far from enough as CDCs in smaller municipalities had to reduce their staff. 10 years after the SARS outbreak, few people wore a face mask when they had respiratory symptoms and the hospitals were cutting the fever clinics off. Despite confidence in winning the next battle against SARS, Zhong Nanshan who earned fame in fighting the SARS outbreak in 2003 still held a conservative attitude to whether the Chinese officials would lie to the people about a disease outbreak. \c\cEarly cases surrounding the animal market suggested potential animal-to-human transmission while later the virus was found to be able to transmit from ill people to others. There have been cases where asymptomatic patients transmitted the virus to others. According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. The typical symptoms of the viral infection included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia which are usually developed after an incubation time lasting as long as 2 weeks. The existence of mild but infectious cases complicated the epidemic control efforts. It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period. \c\cBased on retrospective analysis published in The Lancet in late January, the first confirmed patient started experiencing symptoms on 1 December 2019, though the South China Morning Post later reported that a retrospective analysis showed the first case may have been a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province as early as 17 November. On 27 March 2020, news outlets citing a government document reported a 57-year-old woman, who started having symptoms on 10 December 2019 and subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus disease may have been the index case in the coronavirus pandemic. Although the first confirmed patient did not have any exposure to Huanan Seafood Market, an outbreak of the virus began among the people who had been exposed to the market nine days later. \c\cThe outbreak went unnoticed until 26 December 2019, when Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hubei Xinhua Hospital, noticed a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin, several of whom had connections to the Huanan Seafood Market. She subsequently alerted the hospital, as well as municipal and provincial health authorities, which issued an alert on 30 December. Results from patient samples obtained on 29–30 December indicated the presence of a novel coronavirus, related to SARS. On 1 January 2020, Jianghan District's Health Agency and Administration for Market Regulation closed down the seafood market and collected samples for testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first report on the outbreak on 5 January 2020. Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University completed sequencing of the novel virus on the same day, and published the results to the online database GenBank on 11 January. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted:\c\cOn 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted. \c\cSemi-log graph of 3-day rolling average of new cases and deaths in China during COVID-19 epidemic showing the lockdown on 23 January and partial lifting on 19 March. \c\cOn January 25, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping warned that China was facing a \'grave situation\'. He held a Party Politburo meeting which promised resources and experts for treatment and supplies to Hubei as more and more cases of the viral infection, mostly exported from Wuhan were confirmed in other cities in Hubei and multiple parts in mainland China. On 29 January, Tibet announced its first confirmed case, a male who traveled from Wuhan to Lhasa by rail on 22–24 January which marked that the virus spread to all parts of mainland China. \c\cThe 25 January Chinese New Year celebrations were canceled in many cities. The passengers were checked for their temperatures to see whether they had a fever. Henan, Wuxi, Hefei, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia suspended trade of living poultry on 21 January. \c\cFinancial Times described the outbreak as China's Chernobyl moment, increasing the pressure on its leader, Xi Jinping. A trade war with the US, Hong Kong protests, and an African swine fever outbreak that led to a pork shortage already placed pressure on the current government. \c\cAt the end of December 2019, Henan announced the suspension of passenger trains to and from Wuhan. In early January 2020, the local government of Henan Province with its complete disinfection measures, effective and intensive publicity, a strong awareness of epidemic prevention and quarantine among the people, the setting up of return spots at the village entrance and even the use of garbage trucks, the digging of trenches to block roads connecting Hubei and the hanging of slogans such as "return home with sickness is to dishonor your parents." #抄河南的作业 (lit. \'copy Henan's homework\') became a trending Weibo topic hashtag. \c\cHowever, cutting the roads off without authorization is illegal in mainland China as Xinhua and the Public Security Ministry pointed out. The Ministry of Transport asked the local governments to take the principle of "block one, not three (Chinese: 一断三不断)", that is, to block the virus from spreading, but not to block roads, traffic and Internet access, the transportation of emergency supplies and the transportation of essential goods. \c\cBy 21 January, government officials warned against hiding the disease. \c\cOn 22 January, Hubei launched a Class 2 Response to Public Health Emergency. Ahead of the Hubei authorities, a Class 1 Response to Public Health Emergency, the highest response level was announced by the mainland province of Zhejiang on 23. Guangdong and Hunan followed suit later on the day. On the following day, Hubei and other 13 mainland provinces also launched a Class 1 Response. By 29, all parts of mainland initiated a Class 1 Response after Tibet upgraded its response level on that day. \c\cThe highest response level authorizes a provincial government to requisition resources under the administration to control the epidemic. The government was allowed to organize and coordinate treatment for the patients, make investigations into the epidemic area, declare certain areas in the province as an epidemic control area, issue compulsory orders, manage human movement, publish information and reports, sustain social stability and to do other work related to epidemic control. \c\cOn 11 June, officials confirmed another outbreak of the infection in Fengtai, a south-western district in Beijing. Many of the cases had visited Xinfadi Market, the single largest source of the city's fresh food supplies. \c\cOn 26 January, the State Council extended the 2020 Spring Festival holiday to 2 February (Sunday, the ninth day of the first lunar month) with 3 February (Monday) marking the start of normal work.

Later, on 30 January, the Ministry of Civil Affairs ordered to cancel marriage registrations on 2 February. \c\cThe government of China, which upholds a policy of state atheism, used the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic to continue its antireligious campaigns, demolishing Xiangbaishu Church in Yixing and removing a Christian Cross from the steeple of a church in Guiyang County. In the Shandong, officials issued guidance forbidding online preaching, a vital way for churches to reach congregants amid both persecution and the spread of the virus.[unreliable source?]\c\cThe outbreak made an impact on the National People's Congress (NPC), China's national parliament and many local parliaments. On 27 January, the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee (PPCSC) of Yunnan announced to postpone local Lianghui sessions scheduled for early February which was followed by the PPCSC of Sichuan on 28 January. The local parliament sessions of cities including Hohhot, Chengdu, Jinan, Qingdao, Binzhou, Zhengzhou, Pingdingshan, Anyang, Hefei, Changzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Zhoushan, Ganzhou, Shangluo, and Jiangjin were also put off. \c\cThe NPC's Standing Committee will discuss on 24 February to decide whether to delay its March session or not. The 10-day session in March is an annual gathering of about 3,000 delegates from all parts of China where the major laws are passed and key economic targets are unveiled. The potential delay will be the first time since 1995 when the NPC first adopted the schedule for the March session. Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong believed that the sessions may not only increase the risk of infections but also "post hostile and embarrassing questions to the top officials about the outbreak." He also believed that canceling the meetings would be possible although this never happened after the Cultural Revolution. \c\cIn late January, economists predicted a V-shaped recovery. By March, it was much more uncertain. Millions of workers were stranded far from their jobs while the workplaces were short-handed. The data for February 2020—the first full month after the virus became a major factor in January—saw official indicators of economic activity fall to record lows. The Caixin manufacturing index (PMI) fell to 35.7 in February from 50 in January, showing a deep contraction. The nation's non-manufacturing index sank even further to a record low of 29.6 in February from 54.1 in January 2020. According to The Wall Street Journal, "The factory index indicated contraction for most of 2019, hit by a trade war between the United States and China. It didn\'t cross back into expansion until late last year when trade tensions between the two sides eased."\c\cChina's economic growth is expected to slow by up to 1.1 percentage in the first half of 2020 as economic activity is negatively affected by the new coronavirus outbreak, according to a Morgan Stanley study cited by Reuters. But, on 1 February 2020, the People's Bank of China said that the impact of the epidemic on China's economy was temporary and the fundamentals of China's long-term positive and high-quality growth remained unchanged. \c\cDue to the outbreak, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced that with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Spring Festival holiday was extended to 2 February and trading will resume on 3 February. Before that, on 23 January, the last trading day of shares before the Spring Festival, all three major stock indexes opened lower, creating a drop of about 3% and the Shanghai index fell below 3000. On 2 February, the first trading day after the holiday, the three major indexes even set a record low opening of about 8%. By the end of the day, the decline narrowed to about 7%, the Shenzhen index fell below 10,000 points, and a total of 3,177 stocks in the two markets fell. \c\cThe People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange announced that the inter-bank RMB foreign exchange market, the foreign-currency-to-market and the foreign-currency market will extend their holiday closed until 2 February 2020. When the market opened on 3 February, the Renminbi declined against major foreign currencies. The central parity rate of the Renminbi against the US dollar opened at 6.9249, a drop of 373 basis points from the previous trading day. It fell below the 7.00 than an hour after the opening, and closed at 7.0257. \c\cThe sale of new cars in China was affected by the outbreak. There was a 92% reduction on the volume of cars sold during the first two weeks of February 2020. According to the sources of Automative News, Chinese policymakers had discussed the extension of subsidies for electric-vehicle purchases beyond this year to revive sales, while also discussing reducing requirements for zero-emission vehicle shares of production. \c\cBy 13 March, most business outside of Hubei was active again. The Caixin PMI increased to 50 at the end of March. \c\cIn Q1 2020, China's GDP dropped by 6.8 percent, the first contraction since 1992. \c\cIn May 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that, for the first time in history, the central government wouldn\'t set an economic growth target for 2020, with the economy having contracted by 6.8% compared to 2019 and China facing an "unpredictable" time. However, the government also stated an intention to create 9 million new urban jobs until the end of 2020. \c\cBy late 2020, the economic recovery was accelerating amid increasing demand for Chinese manufactured goods. The UK-based Centre for Economics and Business Research projected that China's "skilful management of the pandemic" would allow the Chinese economy to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy by nominal GDP in 2028, five years sooner than previously expected. However, a government report cautioned that the recovery was "not yet solid". \c\cIn January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs. Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. \c\cBy the end of March, as many as 80 million workers may have been unemployed, according to an estimate by economist Zhang Bin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; this estimate included migrant workers and people in rural areas, whom the official statistics from Beijing do not take into account. \c\cIn China, face masks have been used widely by the general public during the pandemic, and have been required in many locations. As the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market saw a shortage of face masks due to the increased need from the public. It was reported that Shanghai customers had to queue for nearly an hour to buy a pack of face masks which was sold out in another half an hour. Some stores are hoarding, driving the prices up and other acts so the market regulator said that it will crack down on such acts. The shortage will not be relieved until late February when most workers return from the New Year vacation according to Lei Limin, an expert in the industry.[needs update]\c\cOn 22 January 2020, Taobao, China's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group said that all face masks on Taobao and Tmall would not be allowed to increase in price. The special subsidies would be provided to the retailers. Also, Alibaba Health's "urgent drug delivery" service would not be closed during the Spring Festival. JD, another leading Chinese e-commerce platform said, "We are actively working to ensure supply and price stability from sources, storage and distribution, platform control and so on" and "while fully ensuring price stability for JD's own commodities, JD.com also exercised strict control over the commodities on JD's platform. Third-party vendors selling face masks are prohibited from raising prices. Once it is confirmed that the prices of third-party vendors have increased abnormally, JD will immediately remove the offending commodities from shelves and deal with the offending vendors accordingly." The other major e-commerce platforms including Sunning.com and Pinduoduo also promised to keep the prices of health products stable. \c\cFigures from China Customs show that some 2.46 billion pieces of epidemic prevention and control materials had been imported between 24 January and 29 February, including 2.02 billion masks and 25.38 million items of protective clothing valued at 8.2 billion yuan ($1 billion). Press reported that the China Poly Group, together with other Chinese companies and state-owned enterprises, had an important role in scouring markets abroad to procure essential medical supplies and equipment for China. Risland (formerly Country Garden) sourced 82 tonnes of supplies, which were subsequently airlifted to Wuhan. \c\cBy March, China has been producing 100 million masks per day to meet the demand of medical staff and general public. \c\cThe slowdown in manufacturing, construction, transportation and overall economic activity created a temporary reduction by about a quarter in China's greenhouse gas emissions. \c\cEver since Hubei's lockdown, areas bordering Hubei including Yueyang in Hunan and Xinyang in Henan set up checkpoints on roads connecting to Hubei to monitor cars and people coming from Hubei. Between 24 and 25 January, the local governments of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hainan and other areas announced to quarantine passengers from "key areas" of Hubei for 14 days. Chongqing also announced mandatory screening of every person who arrived from Wuhan since 1 January, and set up 3 treatment centers. \c\cSince 1 February, a curfew law that resembles that of Huanggang, Hubei, was put in place by the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang, which is the second largest center after Hubei. Each local family can appoint one family member who may leave their house to purchase essential goods every two days. Since 4 February Zhejiang's capital, Hangzhou, announced the closure of all of its villages, residential communities and work units to guests. Those who enter and exit these places must show valid identification papers. Non-residents and cars will be checked strictly.[needs update] On the same day, Yueqing, Ningbo, Zhengzhou, Linyi, Harbin, Nanjing, Xuzhou and Fuzhou began to take the same approach. Zhumadian, Henan, announced that each family were only allowed to have one member leave the house to purchase essential goods every 5 days. \c\cFactories were closed or reduced production for a few weeks. When they opened again, measures were implemented to reduce risk. During the pandemic, Uyghur workers were sent to resume work. \c\cMany local governments implemented restrictions to control the outbreak, including keeping schools closed, cutting off villages, and restricting travel. A smartphone-based health-tracking system was introduced in much of the country. \c\cThe media were issued directives instructing them not to use certain terms:\c\cOn 2 April 2020, the government ordered a Hubei-like lockdown in Jia County, Henan, after a woman tested positive for the coronavirus. It is suspected that she may have been infected when she visited a hospital where three doctors tested positive for the virus, despite showing no symptoms. In early May, restrictions were tightened in Harbin. \c\cIn mid-July, Xinjiang province and its capital Ürümqi were locked down in the wake of the discovery of new cases in the city. \c\cIn January 2021, many cities and districts in the province of Hebei, Jilin and Heilongjiang were put into lockdown to contain a new outbreak in the region. \c\cOn 9 April, a COVID-19 cluster was detected in Heilongjiang Province, which started with an asymptomatic patient returning from the United States and quarantining at home. The US CDC reported that the infections were initially spread through a shared elevator used at different times, and led to at least 71 cases by 22 April. On 10 April, the state-operated Tianshannet reported that there had been no newly confirmed cases of coronavirus in Xinjiang for the preceding 53 days and that there were no coronavirus patients in Xinjiang. \c\cAs factories and other businesses reopened, extensive measures were put in place to avoid infection, including temperature checks, handwashing, disinfection, mask wearing, a mobile phone health app, avoiding public transportation, staggered lunches, physical distancing, contact tracing, and opening windows for ventilation. Rules vary by location, with different local governments enforcing different measures. \c\cIn June 2020, an outbreak with 45 people testing positive at Xinfadi Market in Beijing caused some alarm. Authorities closed the market and nearby schools; eleven neighborhoods in the Fengtai District started requiring temperature checks and were closed to visitors. By this time, public health technology included special leaf blower backpacks designed to vent hot air onto outdoor surfaces. By the evening of 23 June, Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan declared that the situation has been basically brought under control while China's traffic authorities vowed to strictly guard traffic out of Beijing: those with abnormal health QR codes or without recently-taken negative nucleic acid test proof will not be allowed to take public transportation or drive out of the capital; and started a new regulation to that effect, while 13 new cases were detected on that morning.[citation needed]\c\cOn 26 July, China saw its highest number of daily cases since March, mostly from outbreaks in Xinjiang and Liaoning. with 61 new cases, up from 46 cases a day earlier, This increased to 127 daily COVID cases on July 30.

On January 9, the cities of Shijiazhuang and Xingtai with total population of 19 million, were placed under lockdown measures, with passenger trains suspended, as well as flights and coach service to Beijing at 300 km distance in north east direction. \c\cOn January 14, Wangkui County of Suihua City, Heilongjiang Province moved into lockdown after reporting 40 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The virus sample taken from the cases in Suihua is reported to be similar to the strain identified in Dalian. \c\cAlso on January 14, China reported the first death from the virus after eight months, a patient from Hebei. A team of experts from the WHO visited Wuhan to conduct investigations into the origin of the pandemic. They were also supposed to quarantine for two weeks prior to starting their inquiry.

It urged the local governments to enhance epidemic control including cancelling meetings and events, strictly quarantining confirmed and suspected infection cases, extending the Chinese New Year holiday and supporting online office and teaching. The Central Government promised to crack down on hoarding and profiteering in materials for disease prevention and control. Public Finance at all levels should fully guarantee such funds as prevention and control of epidemic situations and treatment of the patients. \c\cOn 27 January, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, entrusted by Party general secretary Xi Jinping according to Xinhua arrived in Wuhan to inspect and guide the epidemic prevention and control work. According to The Wall Street Journal, the appointment of Li who is considered a technocrat surprised some observers, given that he had been sidelined in recent years as Xi concentrated power and cultivated a populist ideological image. Some suggest that Xi was more at risk to the political fallout of the coronavirus while Li could be a convenient political scapegoat. Li's visit to Wuhan earned high popularity on Chinese social media. Xi Jinping said that he personally commanded the fight against the coronavirus outbreak when meeting with WHO director general in Beijing on 28 January, but according to a report by The Guardian, he has not made any public presence since then as the social media posts mocking Xi's absence were promptly deleted by the censors. \c\cXi's first public appearance during the outbreak was at a residential community in Chaoyang, Beijing on 10 February. Xinhua posted photos of Xi wearing a mask and said that the aim of Xi's visit was to learn about the situation of epidemic prevision and control at the grassroots level. It was his first time to interact with the people since the outbreak after he paid a short visit to Yunnan during 19–21 January as a tradition that China's leaders observed to visit the smaller towns and villages before the Spring Festival. He was said to chair a meeting on 3 February by the state media, but no pictures or videos were released. Xi also met Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the first foreign leader to visit China since the coronavirus outbreak on 5 February. \c\cOn 15 February, Qiushi, the CCP's main theoretical magazine, documented a 7 January order by Xi Jinping regarding the COVID-19 outbreak at a Politburo Standing Committee meeting, 13 days before the public was aware of the outbreak's severity. This appeared to reveal that Xi knew about and was directing the response to the virus on 7 January and raised important questions about whether it was the Central Government that dithered over the response, allowing the virus to spread across the country and eventually the world. However, Homare Endo, director of the Global Institute for China Studies, said a record of the same meeting released beforehand shows there was no mention of the epidemic. She said this indicated that Xi was forced to make "additions" retrospectively because of the public's anger over the death of Dr. Li Wenliang, who was arrested by the Wuhan police for early warning of an epidemic. \c\cOn 10 March, Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, over one month after Premier Li Keqiang's visit. \c\cSince the outbreak of the epidemic, a number of government officials have been publicly held accountable for their dereliction of duty in the epidemic prevention in 6 provinces. \c\cOn 29 January, Director of Huanggang MHC Tang Zhihong failed to tell the capacity of the local hospitals including how many patients that they could handle, how many could be hospitalized and how many patients could be tested each day when asked about these questions despite being an administrator of the local hospitals. A day later, the Party Committee of Huanggang proposed a removal of Tang from the post. On 1 February, according to the Mayor of Huanggang named Qui Lixin, the city authority disciplined 337 of its officials and removed 6 cadres who caused disadvantages to the epidemic prevention. \c\cOn 2 February, Zhang Cong, Party Secretary of Xuanhua, Hebei was admonished. Zhang Guoqing, Deputy Party Secretary of Xuanhua and Guo Xiaoyi, the political commissar of the local police were given disciplinary actions by the Party. On the same day, February, Xiangshui, Jiangsu reported three cases of misconduct. The cases were associated with illegal disclosure of personal data and dereliction of duty. Party secretary, Zhang Changyue and deputy director Gu Bing of the Zhangji Health Center and the director of the Xiangshui CDC were removed or disciplined. \c\cTang Hu, the director of the Health Bureau of the Nanhu New District in Yueyang, Hunan Province was suspended. Cai Junfeng, the deputy director of the Lengshuijiang Municipal Committee and Yang Wen, the deputy director of the municipal government office are suspended. He Yong, the deputy secretary of the Gutang Party Committee and township chief was suspended. \c\cOn 4 February, Zhang Qin, the vice president of the Hubei Red Cross, was removed from his post while Gao Qin and Chen Bo of the Hubei Red Cross were given a warning. The deputy director of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Statistics, Xia Guohua was also removed from his post. The Secretary and Director of the Leading Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Development and Reform Commission, the Secretary and Director of the Leading Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Statistics, Meng Wukang and the deputy director of the General Office of the Wuhan Municipal Government, Huang Zhitong are admonished. \c\cOn 3 April, the Chinese government declared 4 April, the Qingming Festival of 2020, a national day of mourning for those who lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic. At 10 a.m., people were asked to observe three minutes of silence while sirens and vehicle horns blasted out. Chinese flags were flown at half-mast across the country and at embassies overseas. All public entertainment were halted for the day. \c\cResults from the 2020 Chinese census were delayed, which commentators speculated might be related to changes in migration patterns due to the pandemic. \c\cStatements issued by Xi Jinping on 3 February declared the need for an emphasis by state media on "telling the moving stories of how [people] on the front line are preventing and fighting the virus" as a priority of coverage, while top official Zhang Xiaoguo said that his department would "treat propaganda regarding the control and prevention measures of the virus as its top priority". For instance, state media organisations People's Daily and Global Times, along with deputy director of information Zhao Lijian from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been observed to be publishing effusive praise on Beijing's response to the epidemic, such as extensive coverage of the accelerated construction of the new hospitals in Wuhan (which Zhao said was completed in 16 hours), the lock down of Wuhan with its population of 11 million, and the "unprecedented" quarantine of Hubei province. Though such efforts had a questionable effect on the epidemic, as the new hospitals were operating at under half-capacity due to shortages of beds and medical resources while the lock down of Wuhan came too late to be effective as millions had left, the Financial Times and others noted that such widely publicised actions were a "PR coup" showing that the "overbearing, centralized government" of China was particularly suited to dealing with the outbreak, creating the impression as if Beijing had directly intervened at Xi Jinping's request.[excessive citations]\c\cObservers have warned that while "admiration of the front-line medical workers is widespread and sincere," the state media should also be highlighting the reality that many of those workers "lack protective gear" and that over 3000 have been infected since the outbreak so that media attention may bring them public support to obtain some much needed equipment. The New York Times has noted that such government propaganda attempts to control the narrative has been viewed with distrust among the younger individuals, who unlike older people depend less on state media and instead have sought "firsthand info and in-depth media studies concerning the epidemic on the web", suggesting that the central government was out of touch with the younger population. \c\cOutlets such as Politico and Foreign Policy have reported that China's efforts to send aid to virus-stricken countries are part of a propaganda push for global influence. The European Union's diplomatic service, the European External Action Service (EEAS) has fought back against propaganda highlighting China's role in providing medical supplies to Italy, pointing out that France and Germany combined had provided more masks to Italy than China. The EEAS also noted that China's "state media and government officials promote not proven theories about the origin of Covid-19" while China state media coverage highlighted "displays of gratitude by some European leaders in response to Chinese aid". China has been accused of opportunitism during the pandemic, alongside their donations and exports of faulty medical equipment to EU nations hardest hit by the virus, as their disinformation campaign "reputedly bid to denigrate Europe's responses to cast its own in a more favorable light", such as on 12 April 2020 when the Chinese embassy in Paris published an article titled "Restoring distorted facts – Observations of a Chinese diplomat posted to Paris" claiming that careworkers in Western nursing homes had abandoned their jobs leaving residents to die. The EEAS had toned down their report by omitting details of China's state sponsored disinformation campaign, which in turn led to allegations that the EEAS had bowed to pressure from China, as China reportedly threatened to withhold the shipment of medical supplies if the original report was released. \c\cA pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December. The early response by city authorities was accused of prioritising a control of information on the outbreak. A group of eight medical personnel, including Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist from Wuhan Central Hospital, who in late December posted warnings on a new coronavirus strain akin to SARS, were warned by Wuhan police for "spreading rumours" for likening it to SARS. \c\cBy the time China had informed the World Health Organization of the new coronavirus on 31 December 2019,  Nicholas Kristof commented that the government was still keeping its own citizens in the dark in an opinion published on The New York Times. While by a number of measures, China's initial handling of the crisis was an improvement in relation to the SARS response in 2003, local officials in Wuhan covered up and downplayed the initial discovery and severity of this outbreak. This has been attributed to the censorship institutional structure of the country's press and Internet, with Jude Blanchette of the Center for Strategic and International Studies quoted stating "under Xi Jinping, the inclination to suppress has become endemic and, in this case, contributed to a prolonged period of inaction that allowed the virus to spread". William Summers, a Yale University professor of medicine, told Undark Magazine though that such silencing and downplaying tactics are not unique to China, and seems to be standard operating procedure worldwide. \c\cOn 20 January, Xi Jinping made his first public remark on the outbreak and spoke of the need for the timely release of information. Chinese premier Li Keqiang also urged efforts to prevent and control the epidemic. One day later, the CPC Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the most powerful political organ in China overseeing legal enforcement and the police, wrote "self-deception will only make the epidemic worse and turn a natural disaster that was controllable into a man-made disaster at great cost," and "only openness can minimise panic to the greatest extent." The commission then added, "anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of cases out of self-interest will be nailed on a pillar of shame for eternity." Also on the same day, Xi Jinping instructed authorities to strengthen the guidance of public opinions, language which some view as a call for censorship after commentators on social media became increasingly pointedly critical and angry at the government due to the epidemic. Some view this as contradictory to the calls for openness that the central government had already declared. \c\cAs part of the central government's bifurcated approach to diffuse discontent, while the propaganda machinery was going into "overdrive...to protect [Xi Jinping's] reputation", citizens were permitted to criticise local officials so long as they did not question the basic legitimacy of the party. The Cyberspace Administration (CAC) declared its intent to foster a good online atmosphere, with CAC notices sent to video platforms encouraging them to not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus. Censorship has been observed being applied on news articles and social media posts deemed to hold negative tones about the coronavirus and the governmental response, including posts mocking Xi Jinping for not visiting areas of the epidemic, an article that predicted negative effects of the epidemic on the economy, and calls to remove local government officials. Chinese citizens have reportedly used innovative methods to avoid censorship to express anger about how government officials have handled the initial outbreak response, such as using the word \'Trump\' to refer to Xi Jinping, or \'Chernobyl\' to refer to the outbreak as a whole. Younger individuals have also been creating digital archives of media concerning the epidemic – which is prone to deletion by censors – and posting them on the exterior web. While censorship had been briefly relaxed giving a "window of about two weeks in which Chinese journalists were able to publish hard-hitting stories exposing the mishandling of the novel coronavirus by officials", since then private news outlets were reportedly required to use "planned and controlled publicity" with the authorities\' consent. \c\cOn 30 January, China's Supreme Court, delivered a rare rebuke against the country's police forces, calling the "unreasonably harsh crackdown on online rumours" as undermining public trust. In what has been called a "highly unusual criticism" by observers, supreme court judge Tang Xinghua said that if police had been lenient against rumours and allowed the public to have taken heed of them, an earlier adoption of "measures like wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding wildlife markets" might have been useful in countering the spread of the epidemic. The Human Rights Watch reported that "there is considerable misinformation on Chinese social media and authorities have legitimate reasons to counter false information that can cause public panic," but also noted censorship by the authorities on social media posted by families of infected people who were potentially seeking help as well as by people living in cordoned cities who were documenting their daily lives amidst the lockdown. \c\cJournalists in China have worked to publish information about the outbreak. The government initially allowed greater leeway than usual to reporters investigating the crisis, but then cracked down with greater censorship than usual. On 12 March, ten Tibetans were arrested for breaching control measures meant to prevent the spread of the virus. Dolma Kyab, a Tibetan writer and teacher, told Radio Free Asia that "the Chinese government is only using coronavirus as a convenient excuse to infringe on the human rights of Tibetans". \c\cThe New York Times later reported that "authorities issued strict commands on the content and tone of news coverage, directed paid trolls to inundate social media with party-line blather and deployed security forces to muzzle unsanctioned voices."\c\cOn 19 February 2020, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced the revoking of the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing, accusing the Wall Street Journal of failing to apologize for publishing articles which the Foreign Ministry said slandered the Chinese government's response to the COVID-19 outbreak, and failing to investigate and deal with those responsible. \c\cOn 18 December 2019, Ai Fen, director of the emergency department of Central Hospital of Wuhan came into contact with an unusual pulmonary infection from a delivery person of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. On 27 December, she received a second patient with similar symptoms, but who had no link to the wet market. In the afternoon of 30 December, upon  seeing the words "SARS coronavirus, pseudomonas aeruginosa", Ai immediately reported to the hospital's public health department and infection department. She circled the word "SARS", and took an image of it and forwarded it to another doctor in Wuhan. From there it spread throughout medical circles in Wuhan, and reached Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at the hospital. On the afternoon of the same day, Li sent a warning to former classmates over WeChat which was reposted widely. In an interview with Renwu magazine, Ai said she was reprimanded after alerting her superiors and colleagues of the SARS-like virus in December. Li Wenliang would later be canonised on the internet as a heroic whistleblower, and Ai would be lauded as the one who provided the whistle. \c\cOn 1 January, eight people were summoned for talks by Wuhan police for their claim that there were SARS cases in Wuhan. Li Wenliang said he didn\'t know whether he was one of them or not. According to Wang Gaofei, Weibo's CEO, the eight people are all doctors at Wuhan hospitals who "are still fighting at the frontline". The Supreme Court defended these doctors and pointed out in a WeChat article on 28 January, delay and opacity in public information are the root of fake news and the information that is mostly factual and not subjectively malicious and causes no objectively severe consequences should be tolerated. On 29 January, the eight doctors were also praised by Zeng Guang, Chief Scientist at China CDC. Hu Xijin, the editor of the Global Times, complained about the local governments\' low tolerance of differing online opinions and believed this weakened checks-and-balances of government powers through news media. \c\cAfter Li Wenliang was warned by Wuhan police, the doctor was diagnosed with the coronavirus infection and died from it on 7 February 2020. He was said to be dead on the evening of 6 February, although the hospital said that he was still under emergency treatment. People speculated that authorities were trying to censor the news. After his death, people mourned his death and criticized the government. some of the trending hashtags on Weibo such as "Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology" and "We want freedom of speech" became trending topics on Weibo until the posts were deleted by censors.[excessive citations] While media outlets were allowed to report his death, the nature of the doctor's censorship which produced widespread public anger in the aftermath, in what has been described as "one of the biggest outpourings of online criticism of the government in years," was not a topic that was permitted for coverage. \c\cA group of Chinese academics including Xu Zhangrun of Tsinghua University signed an open letter calling for the central government to issue an apology to Dr. Li and to protect freedom of speech. Professor Zhou Lian of Renmin University has observed that the epidemic has "allowed more people to see the institutional factors behind the outbreak and the importance of freedom of speech". After attempts to discourage the discussion on Dr. Li's death further escalated online anger, the central government has been accused of reportedly attempting to co-opt the incident by "cast[ing] Dr. Li's death as the nation's sacrifice – meaning, the Chinese Communist Party's own". The Financial Times considered it possible that Li's story may turn out to fit a historical archetype in China where an incorruptible Confucian scholar who speaks truth to the emperor is persecuted and ultimately dies for his honesty. \c\cLater in March, Wuhan police apologised to Li Wenliang's family after National Supervisory Commission admitted the conduct of local officials is inadequate and praised the whistleblower's effort on raising public awareness. \c\cIn January, Zhang Ouya, the Chief Journalist of Hubei Daily called for the removal of the current leaders of Hubei and Wuhan on Weibo. But, he was asked to remove his post and the newspaper that he worked for apologized to the Wuhan authorities, promising that they will publish only positive content from now on. Mayor Zhou of Wuhan said to the state media "As a local government, I could not disclose information until I get information and authorization which was not understood at the time." His argument which hinted at the Central Government's responsibility, was refuted by China CDC. Chief Scientist Zeng Guang said to Chinese tabloid The Global Times that what the scientists said was "often only part of their decision-making" and praised the eight whistleblowers who were warned by the Wuhan authorities before the epidemic. \c\cOn 1 April, two United States officials said that China had deliberately concealed its cases and deaths according to a report by United States Intelligence Community. The officials asked not to be identified because the report is secret, and declined to detail its contents. The sources stated that the Chinese central government does not know the extent of the outbreak because lower-level officials reported falsified statistics to avoid losing their positions. The CIA is currently investigating in China to assess the coronavirus totals. \c\cDuring the pandemic, no reports of cases of the coronavirus in Xinjiang prisons or of conditions in the Xinjiang re-education camps emerged. Anna Hayes of Australia's James Cook University expressed concern about possible spread in the camps. \c\cAs of late March, users of the social-media site Sina Weibo widely shared an undated photograph showing long lines at the Hankou funeral home in Wuhan. \c\cAccording to Caixin Global, the Hankou funeral home was operating 19 hours a day. Caixin also reported that there were a number of people who died with COVID-19 symptoms but were not tested and were thus excluded from the official case-tally. Some patients died of other diseases due to a lack of proper treatment when hospitals were overwhelmed dealing with those who had the coronavirus. Some social-media users have used the numbers of urns returned to families and the number of cremations conducted in Wuhan to estimate a death toll in Wuhan of about 42,000 or 46,800, compared to an official toll of 2,548 people attributed to the virus in Wuhan as of 27 March. There were 13,856 cremations in Wuhan in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the city's civil-affairs agency. That was 2,419 lower than in the fourth quarter of 2018. \c\cHealth experts, United States intelligence officials, British scientists, and British government officials have expressed doubts about the accuracy of the figures provided by the Chinese government relating to the epidemic, raising concerns that the Beijing government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported on 24 March 2020 that the spread of domestically transmitted epidemic has essentially stopped and the outbreak has been controlled in China.[weasel words]\c\cAsymptomatic cases (people who tested positive but did not develop symptoms) were not counted as confirmed cases before 1 March. \c\cOn 17 April 2020 the Wuhan government revised the number of COVID-19 deaths, accounting for deaths that occurred at home that went previously unreported, as well as for the subtraction of deaths that were previously double-counted\c\cby different hospitals, resulting in a net increase of 1,290 reported deaths in the city. \c\cBlood samples taken by the Chinese CDC from a random sampling of 34,000 Wuhan citizens one month after the virus first wave was contained showed 4.43% of people had antibodies which would equate to almost 500,000 infections. In the wider Hubei area 0.44% of those sampled were positive for antibodies, while of 12,000 nationally representative samples taken only two recorded positive results. \c\cThe central government has imposed restrictions on the publication of academic research regarding the origins of the coronavirus. The directive issued by the Ministry of Education's science and technology department stated that "academic papers about tracing the origin of the virus must be strictly and tightly managed", requiring that such papers be vetted by a State Council task force. A Chinese researcher who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation said "I think it is a coordinated effort from (the) Chinese government to control (the) narrative, and paint it as if the outbreak did not originate in China. And I don\'t think they will really tolerate any objective study to investigate the origination of this disease." The researcher said that such a move would obstruct important scientific research. Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations, said "it is no surprise that the government seeks to control related scientific research so that the findings do not challenge its own narrative on the origin of the virus and the government response to the crisis". \c\cAfter interviewing virologist Shi Zhengli who had investigated bat coronaviruses including the latest one, journalist Gao Yu said "We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January 2 but was muzzled." Shi said that Yanyi Wang, Director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, had ordered staff not to disclose information on the disease arguing that "inappropriate and inaccurate information was causing \'general panic\'". Furthermore, Wang directed that "The National Health Commission \'unequivocally requires that any tests, clinical data, test results, conclusions related to the epidemic shall not be posted on social media platforms, nor shall [it] be disclosed to any media outlets including government official media, nor shall [it] be disclosed to partner institutions\'". \c\cThe broad scientific consensus holds that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. A member of Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBRA) in the UK, tasked with dealing with crisis, has said that while British government intelligence does not dispute that the virus has a zoonotic origin, it also does not discount the idea of a leak from a Wuhan laboratory, saying that "Perhaps it is no coincidence that there is that laboratory in Wuhan" (the Wuhan Institute of Virology). On 15 April 2020, US President Donald Trump announced that the US government was investigating whether the virus spread from the laboratory. \c\cThe exodus from Wuhan before the lockdown resulted in angry responses on Sina Weibo from the residents in the other cities who are concerned that it could result in the spreading of the novel coronavirus to their cities. Some in Wuhan are concerned with the availability of provisions and especially medical supplies during the lockdown. \c\cThe World Health Organization called the Wuhan lockdown unprecedented and said that it showed how committed that the authorities are to contain a viral breakout. Later WHO clarified that the move is not a recommendation that WHO made and the authorities have to wait and see how effective that it is. The WHO separately stated that the possibility of locking an entire city down like this is new to science. \c\cThe CSI 300 Index, an aggregate measure of the top 300 stocks in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, dropped almost 3% on 23 January 2020, the biggest single-day loss in almost 9 months after the Wuhan lockdown was announced as the investors that are spooked by the drastic measure sought a safe haven for their investments. \c\cThe lockdown caused panic in the city of Wuhan and many expressed concern about the city's ability to cope with the outbreak. A medical historian named Howard Markel argued that the Chinese government "may now be overreacting, imposing an unjustifiable burden on the population" and said that "incremental restrictions, enforced steadily and transparently tended to work far better than draconian measures." Others such as Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases defended the intent behind the lockdowns, citing that the lockdowns bought the world a "delay to essentially prepare better." A mathematical epidemiologist named Gerardo Chowell of Georgia State University stated that based on mathematical modelling, "containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission."\c\cOn 29 January, the Ministry of Science and Technology issued a notice, urging the scientists "to write their papers on the land of the motherland, to use the results to fight the epidemic" and the scientists should not focus on publishing their papers until the epidemic prevention and control task is completed. Duowei News believed this was aimed to respond to the academic conflict between Zhang Yongzhen's group from Fudan University which published the first genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV and the Gao Shan group from Nankai University which published an analysis on the sequence without authorization from Zhang. Before the notice, Nankai and Fudan, two of China's top universities had a fight over the alleged academic misconduct related to the analysis published by the Gao Shan group. \c\cOn 30 January, Wang Liming, a neuroscientist from Zhejiang University expressed anger on a Weibo post about George F. Gao's latest NEJM article. Wang believed that the article indicated that the Chinese CDC had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in early January and kept it secret until three weeks later. Although the post was soon deleted, China CDC came under the spotlight. China CDC had to respond on the next day that the research was a retrospective analysis of the 425 cases reported to CDC on 23 January. Jennifer Zeis of NEJM's media Relations Department told The Paper, a Chinese newspaper that it took only two days to publish the article, but she refused to give further details. \c\cThe journal Nature reported at least 54 English-language papers about the new coronavirus in China were published by 30 January. Zuofeng Zhang, a public health expert from UCLA interviewed by the mainland China-based magazine Intellectual, asked why the published data were not used in epidemic control even before their publication. \c\cThe Chinese government has funded research on the origin of COVID-19, but has also restricted this research. In 2021, a WHO-led international mission traveled to China to investigate the origins of COVID-19; the Chinese government granted them permission to arrive after initially blocking them due to visa issues. \c\cOn 18 January 2021, an interim report from the independent panel on the world's response to the pandemic led by Helen Clark and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf criticised the local and national health authorities in China for not applying public health measures more forcefully to control the initial outbreak in January 2020. \c\cIn July 2020, the Chinese government granted an emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinovac Biotech and China National Biotech Group. The government also approved a vaccine developed by CanSino Biologics for use in the military. By mid-December, authorities said that over one million vaccine doses had been administered to over 650,000 people (the vaccines require two doses), with "no serious adverse reactions". By December, plans were in place to vaccinate more widely, beginning with high-risk groups. The vaccine rollout has been delayed by limited supplies and vaccine hesitancy. \c\cAs of February 2021 China had provided vaccines to 53 developing countries and vaccine exports to 22 countries. Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticized developed countries for hoarding vaccines and urged the international community to "promote fair and equitable distribution of vaccines". \c\cIn June 2021, China reached one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses administered, representing more than one third of the global total at that point in time. \c\cChina's scientists have been praised for rapidly sharing information on the virus to the international community, and leading some of the world's research on the disease.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on 21 January that the Chinese authorities would share information of the epidemic "with the WHO, relevant nations and China's Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions in a timely manner including the genome sequence of the new coronavirus." During the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn praised China for its improved transparency since 2003. US officials and WHO also praised China for sharing data about the epidemic and keeping transparent. The US experts had been invited by China's NHC.  On 23 January, WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom and WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, Takeshi Kasai arrived in Beijing to discuss the new coronavirus outbreak with the Chinese authorities and health experts. China agreed on 28 January that WHO would send international experts to China. \c\cJohn Mackenzie, a member of the World Health Organization's emergency committee criticized China for being too slow to share all of the infected cases, especially during major political meetings in Wuhan after Tedros Adhanom praised China for helping "prevent the spread of coronavirus to the other countries." US President Donald Trump said that China was "very secretive and that's unfortunate" regarding the information on the pandemic. Yanzhong Huang, a health expert at Seton Hall University, said that China could have been more forceful and "when there was a cover-up and there was inaction". \c\cA number of other countries\' governments have called for an international examination of the virus's origin and spread. \c\cAfter an initial block, the Chinese government granted permission for a WHO team to visit China and investigate COVID-19's origins. In January 2021, Tedros Adhanom expressed his dismay as China blocked the team's entry. The Chinese government had previously agreed to allow the team's entry. A few days later, permission was granted for the team to arrive. A WHO-affiliated health expert said expectations that the team will reach a conclusion from their trip should be "very low". \c\cMultiple countries evacuated or are trying to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan including South Korea, Japan, the US, the UK, Kazakhstan, Germany, Spain, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, France, Switzerland and Thailand. Korean media Channel A said that China asked the evacuation flights to arrive in the evening and leave Wuhan in the next morning so the evacuation would not be seen by the public. According to BBC, any Chinese national, even with a UK citizenship is not allowed to be evacuated by the UK. \c\cAfter initially refusing to allow Taiwanese citizens to evacuate due to the One-China policy, the Chinese government eventually allowed Taiwan to evacuate its nationals from Wuhan with the assistance of the local Taiwan Affairs Office. There were around 500 Taiwanese trapped in Wuhan. The first flight to help them leave left Wuhan on 3 February. All of them would be quarantined for two weeks after they enter Taiwan. \c\cThe evacuation halted after the first flight was found to carry an infected case. The Taiwanese government said that the person was not in the evacuation list and the most vulnerable were not included in the first flight. It also said that it was not prepared to take these people with a high risk of viral infections home. Tsai Ing-wen criticized China's attempt to rule Taiwan out in WHO and said, "The information obtained by the WHO was obviously inaccurate ... and could cause the WHO to make mistakes in dealing with the global epidemic." Premier Su Tseng-chang called for a government-to-government negotiation for the following arrangement of chapter flights despite the fact that the cross-strait communication mechanism between governments had been suspended since 2016 when Tsai was elected president. \c\cThe State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office urged the Taiwanese government to stop impeding the evacuation. The office said that before the flight, all of the passengers signed a personal declaration claiming that they have no contact with any confirmed or suspected cases and promising to comply with quarantine measures after returning to the island. All of the passengers are checked for their temperature three times before the flight and showed no abnormality. The office said critically that the Taiwanese government first expressed appreciation before the flight, but changed its attitude after the flight. Wuhan's Taiwan Affairs Office asked Taiwan for more details about the infected case as the basic descriptions of the patient including age and gender were not given as previously 17 cases in Taiwan. The office also said that the patient's close relatives were not at all informed of the viral infection. \c\cThe State Administration of Immigration promised that the border inspection agencies at all ports of entry and exit in China would continue to provide necessary facilities and services for Chinese citizens returning home. On 25 January, the General Administration of Customs reactivated the health declaration system where people entering or exiting mainland China are asked to write a health declaration. Border control staff shall also cooperate in health and quarantine work such as body temperature monitoring, medical inspection, and medical check-up. On 31 January, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was arranging charter flights to take the Chinese citizens from Hubei and Wuhan back to Wuhan 124, given the practical difficulties that they faced overseas. \c\cHubei suspended the processing of applications from mainland Chinese residents for entry and exit of mainland China. For those with a valid visa to enter Hong Kong and Macao, but fail to enter the areas due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese Immigration Administration will issue a new visa for free on request of the visa holder after the outbreak is lifted. Some of automated border clearance systems will be shut down according to the needs of the epidemic prevention. After Wuhan declared lockdown on 23 January, the Tianhe Airport and Hankou River ports have been without passengers for several days. \c\cSince 25 January, Taiwan's government banned anyone from mainland China entering the country with the ban extended to mainland Chinese overseas. Although the global health officials advised not to apply travel restrictions on China, the US and Australia restricted all Chinese citizens from China from entering their borders. Travel restrictions were announced by Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Italy and other countries despite China's criticism of border control. \c\cSince 28 January, the Hong Kong government began to cut traffic down connecting mainland China. On the same day, China's National Immigration Administration announced that with immediate effect, the application of mainland residents\' visa to Hong Kong and Macau would be suspended. On 3 February, Hong Kong closed most of its border to mainland China. However, Hong Kong nurses still held a strike, demanding a complete closure. \c\cChina received funds and equipment in donations from a number of other countries to help fight the pandemic. The United Front Work Department (UFWD) also coordinated diplomatic channels, state-owned businesses and Chinese diaspora community associations in urging overseas Chinese to buy masks and send them to China. Jorge Guajardo, Mexico's former ambassador to China, suggested that "China was evidently hiding the extent of a pandemic...while covertly securing PPE at low prices", according to Global News. Guajardo called it a "surreptitious" operation that left "the world naked with no supply of PPE."\c\cChina has also sent tests, equipment, and experts to other countries to help fight the pandemic. European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič expressed gratitude and praised collaboration between the EU and China. Chinese aid has also been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. Chinese-Americans also marshalled networks in China to obtain medical supplies. \c\cOn 13 March, China sent medical supplies, including masks and respirators to Italy, together with a team of Chinese medical staff. While the head of the Italian Red Cross, Francesco Rocca said these medical supplies were donated by the Chinese Red Cross, there were other sources that said that these were paid products and services. Chinese billionaire and Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma also donated 500,000 masks and other medical supplies, which landed at Liege Airport in Belgium on 13 March and then sent to Italy. Italian Prime Minister Conte thanked China for its support and assistance.  A former Mexican ambassador Jorge Guajardo said that masks sent to China in January and February were being sold back to Mexico at 20 to 30 times the price. \c\cA U.S. congressional report released in April concluded that "the Chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery, with designated countries selected, according to political calculations."\c\cOn 18 May 2020, the Chinese government pledged US$2 billion to help other countries fight COVID-19 and to aid economic and social development "especially [in] developing countries". \c\cFrom March through December 2020, China exported pandemic control equipment worth ¥438.5 billion (US$67.82 billion), including 224.1 billion masks, 2.31 billion other pieces of PPE clothing, 1.08 billion test kits, and 271,000 ventilators. A customs spokesperson said the mask exports were equivalent to "nearly 40 masks for everyone in the world outside China". \c\cOfficials in Spain, Turkey, and the Netherlands have rejected Chinese-made equipment for being defective. The Dutch Ministry of Health announced it had recalled 600,000 face masks which were made in China. The Spanish government said they bought thousands of test kits to combat the virus, but later revealed that almost 60,000 did not produce accurate results. The Chinese embassy in Spain said that the company that made the kits was unlicensed, and that these kits were separate from the ones donated by the Chinese government. The government of the United Kingdom paid two companies in China at least $20 million for test kits later found to be faulty. \c\cFear, regional discrimination in China, and racial discrimination within and beyond China increased with the growing number of reported cases of infections despite calls for stopping the discrimination by many governments. Some rumors circulated across Chinese social media, along with endorsements and counter-rumor efforts by media and governments. The Chinese government has worked to censor and counter reporting and criticism about the crisis – which included the prosecution of several citizen journalists – and portray the official response to the outbreak in a positive light. They have also provided humanitarian assistance to other countries dealing with the virus. News outlets have reported concerns that the Chinese government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths. \c\cAlthough there has been support from Chinese online towards those in virus-stricken areas, instances of regional discrimination have also arisen. According to World Journal, there have been instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels, having their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying "people from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not welcomed here." Numerous hotels, and guest houses refused entry to residents of Wuhan or kicked out residents of Hubei. Multiple hotels purportedly refused a Wuhan tour guide to check in after she returned to Hangzhou from Singapore with one of them calling the police to give her a health check and asking the police to quarantine her. Amidst these incidents, various cities and prefectures outside of Hubei adopted resettlement measures for Hubei people in their region such as designated hotel accommodation for visitors from the province. In Zhengding, Jingxing and Luquan of Shijiazhuang City, the local governments rewarded anyone who reported those who had been to Wuhan, but not recorded in official documents at least 1,000 yuan RMB. In Meizhou, residents reporting people entering from Hunan were awarded with 30 face masks. \c\cIt was reported that on a scheduled 27 January China Southern Airlines flight from Nagoya to Shanghai, some Shanghainese travellers refused to board with 16 others from Wuhan. Two of the Wuhan travellers were unable to board due to a fever while the Shanghainese on the spot alleged that the others had taken medicine to bypass the temperature check. One of the Wuhan tourists protested on Weibo, "are they really my countrymen?", to which a Shanghai tourist who was purportedly at the scene replied that they did it to protect Shanghai from the virus. Many netizens criticized the Wuhan tourists for travelling with a fever, although some also called for understanding and for Shanghainese not to regionally discriminate. \c\cMainland Chinese overseas have experienced discrimination and anti-Chinese sentiment during the coronavirus outbreak. In Hong Kong, a Japanese noodle restaurant said it would refuse mainland Chinese customers and said on Facebook, "We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us." In Japan, a sweet shop in Hakone and a ramen restaurant in Sapporo posted "no Chinese" signs outside. Similar events were reported in South Korea. The French newspaper Courrier Picard published two articles titled "Yellow Alert" and "New Yellow Peril?" which may allude to historical racist tropes about the Chinese. \c\cBeyond only Chinese, Asians in general are affected by anti-Chinese sentiment. Disinformation about Asian food and Asian communities have circulated, and videos showing Asian people eating bats have gone viral along with dehumanizing comments and implications of the cause of the virus outbreak. \c\cGuangzhou has a sizeable community of black Africans including migrants, who were allegedly singled out by local authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Chinese state media, five Nigerian men who had tested positive for COVID-19 broke quarantine and infected others, which triggered suspicion and anti-foreigner sentiment. In April 2020, Africans were forced to undergo coronavirus testing and quarantine, regardless of their travel history, symptoms, or contact with known patients. Some restaurants – including a branch of McDonald's – reportedly refused to service Africans, while landlords and hotels targeted Africans for eviction resulting in some becoming homeless. Xinhua reported 111 Africans tested positive for the coronavirus in Guangzhou out of a total of 4,553 tested, also saying that 19 of the cases were imported from unspecified countries. \c\cIt has been noted that public sensitivity in China to racism, particularly to Africans, has been low with little education against racism or use of political correctness, while government censors appear to tolerate racism online. In the preceding few years, many Chinese believed that foreigners have been given extra benefits, leading to concerns about unfairness and inequality. Many Chinese internet users soon posted racist comments, including calls for all Africans to be deported, while a cartoon depicting foreigners as different types of trash to be sorted through went viral on social media. \c\cLocal media in African countries were the first to report on the issue, while Beijing initially attempted to deny such reports, calling them “rumors” or “misunderstandings” while framing it as a “wedge driving attempt” by Western media. As further incidents of Africans being targeted were shared on social media, the United States Consulate General in Guangzhou warned African Americans to avoid travel to Guangzhou. The governments of Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda, in addition tothe African Union, placed diplomatic pressure on Beijing over the incidents, and a group of African ambassadors in Beijing wrote a letter of complaint to the Chinese government about the stigmatisation and discrimination being faced by Africans. The Nigerian Speaker of the House Femi Gbajabiamila showed one of the social media videos to the Chinese ambassador while the Ghanaian Minister for Foreign Affairs Shirley Ayorkor Botchway described the incidents as inhumane treatment. A U.S. State Department spokesman said, "The abuse and mistreatment of Africans living and working in China is a sad reminder of how hollow the PRC-Africa partnership really is". \c\cIn response to the diplomatic pressure and media coverage, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an official statement on 12 April 2020, saying that the Chinese government attached great importance to the life and health of foreign nationals in China, has zero tolerance for discrimination, and treats all foreigners equally. In a regular press conference on the following day, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian added that a series of new measures were adopted in Guangzhou to address the concerns of some African citizens and avoid racist and discrimination problems, while saying the United States was "making unwarranted allegations in an attempt to sow discords and stoke troubles". China's state media later described the incidents as "small rifts", while officials made PR visits to quarantined Africans with flowers and food accompanied by television cameras, and Chinese envoys have continued to reassure their African counterparts that they would correct the misunderstandings and establish an effective communication mechanism with African Consulates-General in Guangzhou. Chinese officials expressed remorse to African politicians but did not explicitly apologize, suggesting that it was largely due to “poor communication”. \c\cThere were conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being the CIA's creation to keep China down on China's Internet, according to London-based The Economist. \c\cMultiple conspiracy articles in Chinese from the SARS era resurfaced during the outbreak with altered details, claiming that SARS is biological warfare conducted by the US against China. Some of these articles claim that BGI Group from China sold genetic information of the Chinese people to the US, with the US then being able to deploy the virus specifically targeting the genome of Chinese individuals. \c\cIn late January 2020, Chinese military news site Xilu published an article claiming that the virus had been artificially combined by the US to target Chinese people from the Han ethnicity, to which the large majority of Chinese belongs. The article claimed that the poor performance of US military athletes participating in the Wuhan 2019 Military World Games, which lasted until the end of October 2019, was evidence that they had in fact been "biowarfare operatives" tasked with spreading the virus. The claim was later repeated on other popular sites in China. \c\cIn March 2020, this conspiracy theory was endorsed by Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China. On 13 March, the US government summoned Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai to Washington DC over this conspiracy theory; Cui had called this theory "crazy" on Face the Nation on 9 February, and re-affirmed this belief after Zhao's tweets. \c\cIn the United States, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others also pushed conspiracy theories repeatedly asserting that the virus had originated from a laboratory leak in Wuhan, despite widespread rejection from the scientific community and by allied intelligence.

The next stay-at-home order, Executive Order 2020–42, signed April 9, closed golf courses, disallowed recreational boating and travel to vacation homes in the state, and banned customers from shopping in non-essential sections of retail stores and businesses, including carpeting, flooring, furniture, garden centers, plant nurseries or paint. Failure to abide by the order could have resulted in a $1,000 fine or 90 days in jail. \c\cThe stay-at-home order was later extended to May 15, with some restrictions from the second one lifted and others added. The controversial bans of recreational boating and travel to vacation homes were removed, while non-medical grade face coverings in public became mandatory starting April 26. Several businesses and sections of stores were allowed to reopen, including those gardening supplies and paint, as well as golf courses, but Airbnb rentals were banned. The next stay-at-home order modified some of the restrictions from previous orders and allowed manufacturing to restart on May 11. On April 27, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order placing several new regulations on restaurant and grocery stores and their employees. \c\cOn May 18, Governor Whitmer announced bars and restaurant dining rooms in the Northern Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula would be allowed to open on May 22. She later announced retail stores and auto dealerships may reopen on May 26 and nonessential medical, dental, and veterinary procedures may begin on May 29. \c\cOn May 22, Governor Whitmer extended the stay-at-home order until June 12 and the state of emergency until June 19. \c\cOn June 1, Governor Whitmer lifted the stay-at-home order, and also announced that restaurants and bars would be allowed to reopen statewide on June 8. \c\cOn July 14, Governor Whitmer extended the state of emergency again until August 11. \c\cA month later Whitmer issued a new order to expire September 4. A later emergency order expired October 27. \c\cFacing a COVID-19 surge in the state in April, Governor Whitmer hoped to avoid more mandatory shutdowns and asked Michigan residents on April 9 to take more "personal responsibility," while asking the White House to send more vaccine doses. The request for vaccines was denied, in large part because the protection provided by vaccines activates only after several weeks while the need to prevent new infections was immediate. On April 12, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky argued that asking for voluntary quarantine would not be enough. She said that Michigan needed "to really close things down, to go back to our basics, to go back to where we were last spring, last summer, and to shut things down."\c\cDuring the week of March 16, 2020, Michigan Medicine started in-house testing for COVID-19, with the capabilities to deliver same-day results. This allowed the hospital to bypass the state's testing system, which was previously the sole provider of testing for the virus. The same week, the health system also launched drive-thru testing services for Michigan Medicine patients at West Ann Arbor Health Center, Brighton Health Center, and Canton Health Center. \c\cSimilarly, Beaumont Health and Henry Ford Health System in Metro Detroit also developed in-house testing methods in an effort to increase overall testing capacity within the state. On March 27, 2020, a regional drive-up testing center opened in Detroit, at the vacant State Fairgrounds site. A partnership between Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties, the city of Detroit, and three regional health systems, the center is able to test up to 400 residents a day, who are referred to the site from their doctor via scheduled appointments. The state restructured reporting procedures and began incorporating private test results in official government case tallies on March 19, 2020. On April 15, 2020, Hurley Medical Center in Flint opened a mobile testing clinic at Atwood Stadium, with capacity for at least 250 people per day. Testing is provided to those with orders from a doctor and is not open to the general public. Similar drive-thru testing facilities opened in Atlanta, Bad Axe, Battle Creek, Bay City, Benton Harbor, Dearborn, Grand Rapids, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Saginaw, and Traverse City. \c\cThe state health department released case counts and death tolls daily and updated recovered cases weekly. Reviews of the outcomes of reported COVID cases led to the discovery of unrecorded deaths on multiple occasions. These deaths were added to the daily toll when discovered, with the result that daily reported deaths did not always indicate the current state of the epidemic. Recovery from the disease was defined simply as surviving 30 days after first symptoms, with no review of actual health or hospitalization status. Starting May 29, 2020, families could get tested together in Kalamazoo. \c\cStarting April 13, 2020, new testing sites opened in Atlanta, Bad Axe, Bay City, Battle Creek, Benton Harbor, Detroit, Flint, Jackson, Kalamazoo, and Traverse City. \c\cMichigan airports received a combined $256 million in federal aid to help ease economic hardship from the coronavirus crisis, funded by the CARES Act. \c\cStarting March 13, 2020, Delta Air Lines, which has a major hub at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said it would cancel all flights to Europe for 30 days, decreasing flights by 40% and grounding 300 planes. Delta had previously indicated it would reduce international flights by 20–25% and domestic flights by 10–15%. On April 28, Delta announced it was suspending flights to and from Flint, Lansing, and Kalamazoo and several other small hub airports across the country after losing $534 million in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic. American Airlines ended service to 15 small airports, including Kalamazoo, starting October 7. \c\cStarting on March 15, 2020, several grocery chains that have stores in Michigan, including Kroger, Meijer, and Walmart, began reducing their business hours for cleaning and restocking in response to the pandemic. Similarly, Michigan-based Meijer reported a plan to hire 40–50 new seasonal employees per store to help meet public demand during the outbreak. Kroger announced that, starting the morning of March 23, all of its Michigan stores would be dedicating the first hour of business on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to seniors, expectant mothers, first responders, and those with compromised immune systems. The following week, Kroger announced it would hire up to 2,000 people in Michigan in response to the pandemic. \c\cThe 2020 North American International Auto Show in Detroit was canceled on March 29, due to the use of its venue TCF Center as a FEMA facility. \c\cMichigan-based automotive manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler announced plans to gradually shut down plants starting March 19 with all plants closed by the end of the month. \c\cOn March 30, Ford announced it will convert its Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti to produce GE/Airon Corporation Model A-E ventilators. It says it will produce 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days. \c\cOn April 1, 2020, General Motors announced it will produce 30,000  V+Pro critical care ventilators for the national stockpile. \c\cOn the morning of March 16, Governor Whitmer announced a temporary order to close all bars and restaurants in the state to sit-down service, effective at 3 pm the same evening until March 30. Carry-out and delivery options were excluded from the order, although restaurants were urged to limit in-building carry-out services to five customers at a time. The order also included fitness centers, theaters, casinos, and other venues that encourage large assemblages of patrons, with several exceptions, such as office buildings. This order is expected to have significant economic impacts on businesses, and it prompted the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association to call for Whitmer to submit paperwork to qualify Michigan for the U.S. Small Business Administration Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. The order also expands unemployment benefits to public health workers who become ill, people who need to take time off to care for children, and others, until April 14. \c\cDomino's Pizza, which is centered in the state, anticipated hiring up to 10,000 people to help meet increased demand for food delivery services due to the pandemic, while Jet's Pizza also prepared to hire "hundreds" of additional delivery drivers for the same reason. \c\cOn June 8, Lansing restaurants reopened for dine-in service for the first time since mid-May. \c\cOn September 21, it was announced three bars in West Michigan lost their liquor licenses temporarily after they allegedly failed to enforce coronavirus mandates. \c\cOn January 22, 2021, at Governor Whitmer announced that starting on February 1, restaurants may re-open at 25% capacity with up to 100 people, tables must be six feet apart with no more than six people per table, and bars and restaurants must close by 10 p.m. Contact information must also be collected from people for contact tracing purposes. \c\cSince December 1, 21 restaurants have received COVID-19 order violations by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Six restaurants had their food license suspended – and five of the six suspensions are still in place. Another 15 businesses were sent cease-and-desist orders, which is a lesser violation. \c\cRestaurants, bars and retail stores were allowed to operate at 50% capacity starting March 5, 2021. \c\cOn March 19, the owner of a pizza restaurant in Holland was criminally charged with allowing indoor dining when it was banned, not enforcing mask rules, and ignoring capacity limits. \c\cOn March 19, the Michigan Strategic Fund unanimously voted to approve a $20 million economic relief program meant to help struggling small businesses affected by the pandemic. The Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) had processed over 1.7 million applications as of May 13, with 1.375 million people receiving benefits. The state has paid $5.62 billion in benefits since the state of emergency was declared two months prior. By June 19, UIA disbursed $11.4 billion to two million people since the coronavirus pandemic reached the state. On August 21, the Federal Emergency Management Administration approved UIA's application for funding that would provide an additional $300 per week payment to Michigan residents receiving unemployment benefits. On October 14, the federal government approved unemployment benefits for 20 more weeks, with up to 59 weeks of benefits for some workers. On October 20, Governor Whitmer signed a bill approving six more weeks of state unemployment aid. \c\cOn March 12, Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training. Four days later, they announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, which affected Michigan's team, the Detroit Tigers. On June 24, two members of the Detroit Tigers organization (later identified as pitcher Daniel Norris and a coach) tested positive for COVID-19. Norris was later cleared to join the Opening Day roster. \c\cOn June 25, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order which allows professional sports to resume in the state. Two days before, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred unilaterally implemented a 60-game season. Players reported to training camps at their regular season home stadiums on July 1 in order to resume spring training, which included inter-squad games only, and prepare for a July 23 or 24 Opening Day (July 24 for the Tigers). In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, teams only played their own division and the opposite league's corresponding geographical division, e.g. the Tigers only played the American League Central (40 games total) and National League Central (20 games total). Games were played behind closed doors, with artificial crowd noise played over loudspeakers. \c\cThe Tigers\' August 3–6 series against the St. Louis Cardinals was postponed several times after 17 of the latter's members tested positive for COVID-19, with two of the games later cancelled outright. \c\cOn March 15, 2021 Governor Whitmer increased the maximum allowed capacity of sports stadiums from 375 people to 1,000, in time for the start of the 2021 Detroit Tigers season. On June 8, Comerica Park was allowed to return to operating at full seating capacity after April and May games this season were limited to 8,000 fans. \c\cAlso on March 12, the National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days, which affected the Detroit Pistons. \c\cOn March 14, Detroit Pistons power forward Christian Wood reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. \c\cThe Pistons\' season officially ended on June 5 when they failed to make the cut for a 22-team restart. \c\cIn their 2020–21 season, the Pistons\' game against the Denver Nuggets on February 1 was postponed due to a positive test on a Detroit player, as well as the February 16 game against the San Antonio Spurs due to an outbreak on the latter team. \c\cIn the National Hockey League, the season was suspended for an indefinite amount of time starting March 12, which affected the Detroit Red Wings. \c\cThe Red Wings\' season officially ended on May 27 when they failed to make a 24-team playoff tournament. \c\cThe NHL's shortened 2020–21 season began on January 13. The regular season ran for 56 games per team, ending on May 8. \c\cOn July 27, National Football League preseason games, which usually take place in August, were cancelled by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell due to the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the Detroit Lions. \c\cSince July 30, the Lions have placed eight players on the injury list after they tested positive for COVID-19. One player's test, quarterback Matthew Stafford, was later revealed to be a false-positive and he was removed from the list on August 4. \c\cMost games in the 2020 season were played behind closed doors, with crowds at some stadiums limited to friends and families of the players, coaches, and staff members. \c\cSeveral members of the Lions coaching staff, including interim head coach Darrell Bevell, sat out the December 26 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers due to an outbreak. \c\cExecutive Order 2020–42, signed April 9, closed golf courses in the state.

On September 3, the MHSAA approved the return of all fall 2020 sports. \c\cOn November 15, Governor Whitmer announced the MDHHS has ordered all high school sports to suspend activities for three weeks, effective November 18. \c\cOn April 15, a convoy of thousands of motorists drove from all over the state to protest the extension of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order. The protest, known now as Operation Gridlock, involved clogging the streets surrounding on near the Michigan State Capitol, including the Capitol Loop, with their vehicles, drawing national attention. The protest was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, a group with ties to the DeVos family, through Facebook. The Michigan Freedom Fund supported the rally by as an event co-host, spending an estimated $250 to promote the event. The Michigan Conservative Coalition is asking the governor to take a more measured approach that would allow certain parts of work and daily life to start returning to normal. The organizers urged participants to practice social distancing, and not leave their vehicles during the protest. Lt. Darren Green of the Michigan State Police estimated several thousand cars were part of the demonstration, with 100 to 150 people congregating on the Capitol lawn. “They’re doing a pretty good job of maintaining social distance," Green said. "They’re being respectful and not causing any issues at all.” Neither the Michigan State Police nor the Lansing Police Department had reported any arrests. Multiple services have been disrupted as a result of Operation Gridlock, such as the Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA) temporarily suspending their downtown route. Governor Whitmer said the protest was legal per the First Amendment's right to freedom of assembly, and understood the protesters\' anger, but warned them they were endangering their health by not following social distancing guidelines and noticed some people were not wearing personal protective equipment, including children, further adding "(It's) not a political decision, it's about public health. The enemy is the virus, not one another." President Donald Trump supported the protest on April 17 with an all-caps tweet saying "Liberate Michigan". \c\cOn April 30, a second protest occurred when hundreds of protesters, many carrying firearms, gathered at the Michigan Capitol.  Many protesters were able to enter the building.  The demonstration was organized by conservative group Michigan United for Liberty. Governor Whitmer said on April 30 that she found elements of the protest ‘disturbing.’ Also, in an appearance May 3 on CNN’s State of the Union, the governor said the Confederate flags, nooses and Nazi signs displayed were ‘outrageous’ and racist, with some depicting her as Adolf Hitler. On May 14, more armed protesters from Michigan United for Liberty gathered outside the Michigan State Capitol. The organization's Facebook group was deleted over death threats against Governor Whitmer and a fight broke out over a doll tied to a noose carried by a man who also had an axe at the protest. The Michigan Legislature closed its scheduled session to avoid the possibility of another armed confrontation inside the chamber. \c\cOn May 20, the Michigan Conservative Coalition held "Operation Haircut" on the lawn of the Capitol Building, in which barbers gave free haircuts, in support of an Owosso barber who was forced to shut down after continuing to operate until the previous week, violating the executive order closing non-essential businesses that included barbershops and beauty salons resulting in the state suspending his license. Several of the barbers at the demonstration were issued $1,000 citations by the Michigan State Police for disorderly conduct. A week later on May 27, the group from Operation Haircut delivered a letter to the Governor with a layout of safe practices to reopen. The charges against the Owosso barber were eventually dismissed. The charges against the other barbers arrested during the Operation Haircut demonstration were dismissed on February 8, 2021. \c\cA peaceful demonstration of prayers organized by the religious non-profit Transformation Michigan was performed on the Capitol lawn on May 28. \c\cA peaceful protest called "Let MI People Go" by religious group Stand Up Michigan took place on the Capitol lawn on October 8. \c\cOn December 15, a protest took place near the home of Robert Gordon, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, to oppose the new restrictions imposed by the state. \c\cDuring the summer and fall of 2020, Governor Whitmer was targeted with an alleged elaborate kidnapping plot. The plot was revealed when the Federal Bureau of Investigation thwarted it. In October 2020, fourteen members of a right-wing militia group called the Wolverine Watchmen were charged with several federal and state crimes. One of the suspects cited Governor Whitmer's handling of the pandemic as part of their motive to kidnap her. \c\cIn April multiple lawsuits were filed challenging Whitmer's executive orders. The suits were filed by individuals, business owners, recreational fishermen, a conservation organization, and several county prosecutors. They alleged that her orders were overly broad, violated their constitutional rights, harmed businesses, and amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property rights. Governor Whitmer's third stay-at-home order, issued April 24, overturned the restrictions on recreational boating and visits to vacation homes, effectively ending some of the lawsuits. \c\cOn April 29, inmates from various Michigan prisons filed a class action lawsuit against the Michigan Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, claiming the state is violating the Eighth Amendment by subjecting inmates to cruel and unusual punishment by not taking necessary pandemic precautions. \c\cOn May 6, a group of churches sued Governor Whitmer, claiming "Executive Order 2020-70 continues to prohibit gatherings of two or more individuals, including at churches, thereby denying them the ability to hold worship services and otherwise carry out their ministry functions until May 28, 2020" violates their First Amendment right of freedom of religion. 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Fiji is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in Fiji was reported on 19 March 2020 in Lautoka. As of 24 June 2021[update], the country has had a total of 2,848 cases as of which 2,173 are currently active and 13 deaths, with all cases recorded in the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. A total of 8 COVID-19 patients have died from pre-existing non-COVID-19 related illnesses. In March 2021 Fiji became the first Pacific island country to receive the COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX initiative with frontline workers and first responders the first to be vaccinated. Out of the target population of 587,651, more than 260,000 Fijians have received their first jab of the AstraZeneca vaccine. \c\cIn the early stages of the pandemic, Fiji imposed travel bans on highly affected countries. As the pandemic worsen, Fiji closed all borders and ports to non residents. Ports were closed on 16 March 2020 and the main international airport in Nadi was closed on 26 March 2020. Returning citizens were required to self isolate at a government funded facility for 14 days, supervised by Health Officials and the Military. Domestically, the government responded by imposing a national curfew, restricting large gatherings and closing down schools and non essential services. The government imposed lockdowns in the two largest cities of Lautoka and Suva and developed a contact tracing app named careFIJI. The government established a Centre for Disease Control for COVID-19 testing and built fever clinics nationwide for temperature checks. Such measures has helped eliminate local transmissions of the virus for more than a year. \c\cFrom July 2020 to April 2021, Fiji has only recorded cases from managed quarantine facilities at the border as repatriation flights brought stranded citizens back home. This has allowed the country to relax its COVID-19 restrictions to boost its economic recovery however on 19 April 2021, Fiji confirmed its first community case as a result of a breach in protocol. In response, the township of Nadi and the city of Lautoka went into a lockdown and previous health restrictions were re-imposed all over the country with the national curfew revised. As local transmission cases soared exacerbated by the Delta variant, the Government sealed off Viti Levu establishing Suva, Lautoka, Nadi, Nausori, Rakiraki and Lami as containment areas and activating the Fiji Emergency Medical Assistance Team (FEMAT). The virus penetrated prominent hospitals of Fiji including the Fiji CDC and the headquarters of the Ministry of Health which prompted senior health officials to go into self isolation. High number of cases were recorded from the Western and Central division with the highest number of cases being from the containment of Suva, Nausori and Lami alone. Despite continuous records of new cases, the government has ruled out any possibility of a nationwide lockdown adding that their directive would be on targeted lockdowns instead. \c\cThe pandemic forced Fiji to reduce its interest rate. The country's economy is expected to contract after decades of economic growth due to the pandemic's impact on tourism, retail, manufacturing and trade. The International Labour Organisation and the Asian Development Bank issued reports about workers being affected and warned about the rising youth unemployment rate and child labour. The impacts has also prompted residents to leave the country for short term employment overseas. There were even reported incidents of racism and xenophobia against Chinese people or to those perceived as such. Misinformation and conspiracy theories surfaced about the COVID-19 vaccines, the origin of the virus and the government's response to the pandemic. Domestic violence and assault cases against women also increased as a result of lockdowns. \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cCompared to SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19  has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cOn 3 February, the Government of Fiji toughened border security. Borders were closed to foreign nationals who have been in mainland China within 14 days of their intended travel to Fiji. Measures to maintain a hygienic environment and screening ill passengers will continue to be taken in-flight to further minimise any risk. \c\cOn 27 February, Fiji extended its travel ban and announced that travellers from Italy, Iran and the South Korean cities of Daegu and Cheongdo would be denied entry. From 28 February, all cruise ships entering Fiji have been required to make first berths at ports in Suva and Lautoka, where passengers undergo medical and travel history checks. \c\cOn 15 March, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama had announced that from 16 March cruise ships will be banned from berthing anywhere in Fiji and international events will not be allowed in Fiji. Government ministers and staff will be restricted from travelling overseas. \c\cOn 19 March, Fiji confirmed its first case, a 27 year old Fijian citizen and flight attendant of Fiji Airways. He had arrived from San Francisco returning via Nadi on 16 March. On 17 March, he had travelled from Nadi to Auckland and a return from Auckland to Nadi on the same day. He was admitted to Lautoka Hospital. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced a further extension of the ban to foreign nationals who had been present in the United States, as well as all of Europe including the United Kingdom. Also all travellers arriving in or returning to Fiji from outside of the country had to self-isolate for 14 days. \c\cOn 20 March, all schools and non-essential businesses in Lautoka had been closed at midnight, however banks, supermarkets, pharmacies and essential businesses remained open. The Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts Rosy Akbar in consultation with the Prime Minister announced that the national term one school holidays that were initially scheduled from 20 April to 1 May would be brought forward, to 23 March to 3 April. Fiji Airways suspended all international flights until the end of May, with the exception of twice-weekly services between Singapore and Nadi. The government established two fever clinics in Lautoka. \c\cOn 21 March, Fiji confirmed its second case and the first local transmission case through household contact. She is the mother of the first patient and was admitted in Nadi Hospital. Other family members remained in quarantine and being monitored. \c\cOn 23 March, Fiji confirmed its third case, a one-year-old nephew of the first patient. The government established eight fever clinics around the country with six clinics running in Nasinu, Labasa, Savusavu, and Nabouwalu. Two others had been running in Lautoka since 20 March. \c\cOn 24 March, Fiji confirmed its fourth case, a 28-year-old Fijian citizen, who had returned from Sydney over the weekend and was not related to the first three cases. He and his immediate family members were in quarantine and being monitored at the Navua Hospital.  Fiji Airways had suspended all Singapore and Hong Kong flights after the two countries introduced border restrictions. \c\cOn 25 March, Fiji confirmed its fifth case, a 31-year-old female from Lautoka. She was in contact with the first case, the flight attendant. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced that Nadi International Airport would shut down from 26 March and all local shipping services would cease from 29 March. \c\cOn 26 March, Attorney General and Minister for Economy Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum revealed the COVID-19 response budget. \c\cOn 27 March, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced a nationwide curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. that would take effect on 30 March. \c\cOn 30 March, Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts Rosy Akbar announced that the school holidays would be extended for another two weeks until 17 April. \c\cOn 1 April, Minister for Health and Medical Services Ifereimi Waqainabete announced that the Lautoka lock down will be extended till 7 April to ensure that no COVID-19 cases left undetected. \c\cOn 2 April, Fiji confirmed two cases, a couple from Suva. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama stated that the sixth case is a 22-year-old woman and the seventh case is her 33-year-old husband. They are admitted at Navua Hospital. Due to this, the Prime Minister announced that Suva will be going into a lockdown effective from 3 April at 5 a.m. Also, the government renewed the national curfew where it will start from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. \c\cOn 4 April, Fiji confirmed five cases from Labasa, Suva, Nadi and Lautoka. Two cases was confirmed in Labasa, a 53-year-old Fijian citizen who is the ninth case, he is related to the sixth and seventh case and is admitted at Labasa Hospital. The ninth case had arrived from India via Singapore on 22 March. He had failed to isolate for 14 days, thus increasing the risk of community transmission in Fiji. It is believed that he contracted the disease while attending the Tablighi Jamaat in India. An eighth case was confirmed in Lautoka, a 39-year-old female from Natowaqa.

Local testing began on 11 March 2020 at the Fiji Center for Disease Control. \c\cAs of 14 June 2021, Fiji has conducted 153,372 tests with a 7-day average daily test positivity of 2.1% and 3.8 tests per 1,000 population.

Australia also invested in $500 million in the next three years to ensure that the countries of the Pacific including Fiji will be able to achieve full immunization coverage. Attorney General Aiyaz Sayed Khaiyum said that the government is working with International Agencies to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are not commercialized. \c\cIn January 2021, Australia and Fiji discussed vaccine options with the Australian Government indicating that if 80% of Fiji's population are vaccinated, chances of a travel bubble are high between the two nations. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services trained its staff for COVID-19 vaccination as the country is working to register all receivers planned for the first phase of vaccination. Vaccination are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2021 and throughout the year. \c\cIn February 2021, Fiji approved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine with the COVAX Facility committed in providing over 100,000 doses. \c\cIn early March 2021, Fiji became the first Pacific country to receive the first batch of vaccines from the World Health Organization's COVAX initiative. Fiji received 12,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with the first six thousand earmarked for frontline and essential workers. On 19 April 2021, Fiji received its second batch of the AstraZeneca vaccines. \c\cAs of 24 June 2021, 266,436 Fijians (45% of the targeted population of 587,651 individuals) have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine while 32,766 individuals have been fully vaccinated (two doses). 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Fiji is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in Fiji was reported on 19 March 2020 in Lautoka. As of 23 June 2021[update], the country has had a total of 2,549 cases as of which 1,892 are currently active and 13 deaths, with all cases recorded in the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. A total of 8 COVID-19 patients have died from pre-existing non-COVID-19 related illnesses. In March 2021 Fiji became the first Pacific island country to receive the COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX initiative with frontline workers and first responders the first to be vaccinated. Out of the target population of 587,651, more than 260,000 Fijians have received their first jab of the AstraZeneca vaccine. \c\cIn the early stages of the pandemic, Fiji imposed travel bans on highly affected countries. As the pandemic worsen, Fiji closed all borders and ports to non residents. Ports were closed on 16 March 2020 and the main international airport in Nadi was closed on 26 March 2020. Returning citizens were required to self isolate at a government funded facility for 14 days, supervised by Health Officials and the Military. Domestically, the government responded by imposing a national curfew, restricting large gatherings and closing down schools and non essential services. The government imposed lockdowns in the two largest cities of Lautoka and Suva and developed a contact tracing app named careFIJI. The government established a Centre for Disease Control for COVID-19 testing and built fever clinics nationwide for temperature checks. Such measures has helped eliminate local transmissions of the virus for more than a year. \c\cFrom July 2020 to April 2021, Fiji has only recorded cases from managed quarantine facilities at the border as repatriation flights brought stranded citizens back home. This has allowed the country to relax its COVID-19 restrictions to boost its economic recovery however on 19 April 2021, Fiji confirmed its first community case as a result of a breach in protocol. In response, the township of Nadi and the city of Lautoka went into a lockdown and previous health restrictions were re-imposed all over the country with the national curfew revised. As local transmission cases soared exacerbated by the Delta variant, the Government sealed off Viti Levu establishing Suva, Lautoka, Nadi, Nausori, Rakiraki and Lami as containment areas and activating the Fiji Emergency Medical Assistance Team (FEMAT). The virus penetrated prominent hospitals of Fiji including the Fiji CDC and the headquarters of the Ministry of Health which prompted senior health officials to go into self isolation. High number of cases were recorded from the Western and Central division with the highest number of cases being from the containment of Suva, Nausori and Lami alone. \c\cThe pandemic forced Fiji to reduce its interest rate. The country's economy is expected to contract after decades of economic growth due to the pandemic's impact on tourism, retail, manufacturing and trade. The International Labour Organisation and the Asian Development Bank issued reports about workers being affected and warned about the rising youth unemployment rate and child labour. The impacts has also prompted residents to leave the country for short term employment overseas. There were even reported incidents of racism and xenophobia against Chinese people or to those perceived as such. Misinformation and conspiracy theories surfaced about the COVID-19 vaccines, the origin of the virus and the government's response to the pandemic. Domestic violence and assault cases against women also increased as a result of lockdowns. \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cCompared to SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19  has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cOn 3 February, the Government of Fiji toughened border security.

On 18 March, the Reserve Bank of Fiji reduced its overnight policy rate (OPR) and predicted the domestic economy to fall into a recession after decades of economic growth. GDP is expected to contract severely in 2020, with the economy predicted to contract by 21.7 per cent in the same year due to poor tourism activity. Annual inflation remained in negative territory in May (-1.7%) and is forecast to edge up to 1.0 percent by year-end. \c\cIn April 2020, the Construction Industry Council reported that they are already experiencing a downturn affecting construction projects due to limited raw materials.

Local testing began on 11 March 2020 at the Fiji Center for Disease Control. \c\cAs of 14 June 2021, Fiji has conducted 153,372 tests with a 7-day average daily test positivity of 2.1% and 3.8 tests per 1,000 population. Testing has increased significantly in response to the local transmission cases first confirmed in mid April 2021. \c\c              \c\c     No of test per month  \c\c     No of test (cumulative)  \c\cIn early June 2020, the Government of Australia ensured Fiji's access to a COVID-19 vaccine through GAVI at an affordable price. Australia also invested in $500 million in the next three years to ensure that the countries of the Pacific including Fiji will be able to achieve full immunization coverage. Attorney General Aiyaz Sayed Khaiyum said that the government is working with International Agencies to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are not commercialized. \c\cIn January 2021, Australia and Fiji discussed vaccine options with the Australian Government indicating that if 80% of Fiji's population are vaccinated, chances of a travel bubble are high between the two nations. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services trained its staff for COVID-19 vaccination as the country is working to register all receivers planned for the first phase of vaccination. Vaccination are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2021 and throughout the year. \c\cIn February 2021, Fiji approved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine with the COVAX Facility committed in providing over 100,000 doses. \c\cIn early March 2021, Fiji became the first Pacific country to receive the first batch of vaccines from the World Health Organization's COVAX initiative. Fiji received 12,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with the first six thousand earmarked for frontline and essential workers. On 19 April 2021, Fiji received its second batch of the AstraZeneca vaccines. \c\cAs of 8 June 2021, 220,437 Fijians (38% of the targeted population of 587,651 individuals) have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine while 4,773 individuals have been fully vaccinated (two doses). 
Relations between Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) started in 1994. Ukraine applied to begin a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) in 2008. Plans for NATO membership were shelved by Ukraine following the 2010 presidential election in which Viktor Yanukovych, who preferred to keep the country non-aligned, was elected President. Amid the Euromaidan unrest, Yanukovych fled Ukraine in February 2014. The interim Yatseniuk Government which came to power initially said, with reference to the country's non-aligned status, that it had no plans to join NATO. However, following the Russian military invasion in Ukraine and parliamentary elections in October 2014, the new government made joining NATO a priority. \c\cAt the June 2021 Brussels Summit, NATO leaders reiterated the decision taken at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine would become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process and Ukraine's right to determine its own future and foreign policy, of course without outside interference. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also stressed that Russia will not be able to veto Ukraine's accession to NATO, as we will not return to the era of spheres of interest, when large countries decide what smaller ones should do. \c\cAccording to polls conducted between 2005 and 2013, Ukrainian public support of NATO membership remained low. However, since Russian military intervention in Ukraine and Crimea, public support for Ukrainian membership in NATO has risen greatly. Since June 2014, polls showed that about 50% of those asked supported Ukrainian NATO membership. Some 69% of Ukrainians want to join NATO, according to a June 2017 poll by the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, compared to 28% support in 2012 when Yanukovich was in power. \c\cRelations officially began when Ukraine became the first CIS country to enter NATO's Partnership for Peace program in February 1994. In the summer of 1995 NATO stepped up to help to mitigate consequences of the Kharkiv Drinking Water Disaster. This was the first cooperation between NATO and Ukraine. On May 7, 1997 the first-ever official NATO Information and Documentation Center opened in Kyiv, aimed to foster transparency about the alliance. A Ukrainian public opinion poll of May 6 showed 37% in favor of joining NATO with 28% opposed and 34% undecided. On July 9, 1997, a NATO-Ukraine Commission was established. In 2002 relations with the government of the United States and other NATO countries deteriorated after one of the recordings made during the Cassette Scandal revealed an alleged transfer of a sophisticated Ukrainian defense system to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. At the NATO enlargement summit in November 2002, the NATO–Ukraine commission adopted a Ukraine–NATO Action Plan. President Kuchma's declaration that Ukraine wanted to join NATO (also in 2002) and the sending of Ukrainian troops to Iraq in 2003 could not mend relations between Kuchma and NATO. Currently, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are working with NATO in Iraq. \c\cAfter the Orange Revolution in 2004 Kuchma was replaced by President Viktor Yushchenko who is a keen supporter of Ukraine's NATO membership. In January 2008 the second Yulia Tymoshenko cabinet's proposal for Ukraine to join NATO's Membership Action Plan was met with opposition. A petition of over 2 million signatures has called for a referendum on Ukraine's membership proposal to join NATO. The opposition have called for a national referendum to be held on any steps towards further involvement with NATO. In February 2008 57.8% of Ukrainians supported the idea of a national referendum on joining NATO, against 38.6% in February 2007. \c\cIn January 2008, US Senator Richard Lugar said: "Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and Parliamentary Chairman Arsenii Yatseniuk have signed the statement calling for consideration on Ukraine's entry into the NATO membership action plan at the Bucharest summit."\c\cThe Ukrainian parliament headed by Arsenii Yatseniuk was unable to hold its regular parliamentary session following the decision of the Parliamentary Opposition to prevent the parliament from functioning in a protest against joining NATO. The parliament was blocked from January 25, 2008 till March 4, 2008 (on 29 February 2008 faction leaders agreed on a protocol of mutual understanding). US President George W. Bush and both nominees for President of the United States in the 2008 election, U.S. senator Barack Obama and U.S. senator John McCain, did offer backing to Ukraine's membership of NATO. Russian reactions were negative. \c\cAt the NATO summit in Bucharest in April 2008, NATO decided it would not yet offer membership to Georgia and Ukraine; nevertheless, Nato Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said that Georgia and Ukraine would eventually become members. Resistance was reportedly met from France and Germany. \c\cIn November 2008, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Prime-Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and former Ukrainian minister of defence Anatolii Hrytsenko doubted Ukraine would be granted membership of MAP in December 2008. In a Times of London interview in late November, President Yushchenko stated : "Ukraine has done everything it had to do. We are devoted to this pace. Everything else is an issue of political will of those allies who represent NATO." Although NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary-General Aurelia Bouchez and NATO's Secretary General, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer still supported Ukraine's NATO bid at the time the Bush administration seemed not to push for Georgian and Ukrainian membership of MAP late November 2008. President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev responded that "reason has prevailed". On December 3, 2008 NATO decided it will work out an Annual National Programme of providing assistance to Ukraine to implement reforms required to accede the alliance without referring to MAP. \c\cAt the NATO-Ukraine consultations at the level of Defense Ministers held at the NATO headquarters in Brussels in November 2009, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen praised Ukraine's first Annual National Program, which outlined the steps it intended to take to accelerate internal reform and alignment with Euro-Atlantic standards, as an important step on Ukraine's path to becoming a member of the Alliance. \c\cCandidate during the 2010 presidential election and Party of Regions leader Viktor Yanukovych stated during 2010 presidential election-campaign that the current level of Ukraine's cooperation with NATO was sufficient and that the question of the country's accession to the alliance was therefore not urgent. \c\cFollowing the election, on 14 February 2010, the newly elected President Viktor Yanukovych said that Ukraine's relations with NATO were currently "well-defined", and that there was "no question of Ukraine joining NATO". He said the issue of Ukrainian membership of NATO might "emerge at some point, but we will not see it in the immediate future."\c\cOn 1 March 2010, during his visit to Brussels, Yanukovych said that there would be no change to Ukraine's status as a member of the alliance's outreach program. He later reiterated during a trip to Moscow that Ukraine would remain a "European, non-aligned state."\c\cAs of May 2010, NATO and Ukraine continued to cooperate in the frame of the Annual National Program, including joint exercises. According to Ukraine the continuation of Ukraine-NATO cooperation does not exclude the development of a strategic partnership with Russia. \c\cOn 27 May 2010, Yanukovych stated that he considered Ukraine's relations with NATO as a partnership, "And Ukraine can\'t live without this [partnership], because Ukraine is a large country". \c\cOn 3 June 2010, the Ukrainian parliament passed a bill proposed by the President that excluded the goal of "integration into Euro-Atlantic security and NATO membership" from the country's national security strategy. The law precluded Ukraine's membership of any military bloc, but allowed for co-operation with alliances such as NATO. "European integration" is still part of Ukraine's national security strategy. \c\cOn 24 June 2010, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers approved an action plan to implement an annual national program of cooperation with NATO in 2010. This included:\c\cInvolvement of Ukrainian aviation and transport material in the transportation of cargo and personnel of the armed forces of NATO's member states and partners participating in NATO-led peacekeeping missions and operations\c\cThe continuation of Ukraine's participation in a peacekeeping operation in Kosovo\c\cPossible reinforcing of Ukraine's peacekeeping contingents in Afghanistan and Iraq\c\cUkraine's participation in a number of international events organized by NATO\c\cTraining of Ukrainian troops in the structures of NATO members\c\cUkraine and NATO continued to hold joint seminars and joint tactical and strategical exercises and operations during Yanukovych Presidency. \c\cYanukovych fled Ukraine amid the Euromaidan uprising in February 2014. As a result of this revolution, the interim Yatseniuk Government came to power in Ukraine. The Yatseniuk Government initially stated it did not have the intention of making Ukraine a member of NATO. \c\cNATO officials vowed support for Ukraine and worked to downplay tensions between the bloc and Russia, which refused to recognize the impeachment of Yanukovych or the Yatseniuk Government. In late February 2014, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Secretary General of NATO, reaffirmed that NATO membership is still an option for Ukraine. \c\cOn 29 August 2014, following reports that the Russian military was operating within Ukraine, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arsenii Yatseniuk announced that he would ask the Ukrainian parliament to put Ukraine on a path towards NATO membership. The government has also signaled that it hopes for major non-NATO ally status with the United States, NATO's largest military power and contributor. As part of these efforts, and to rule out future Ukrainian membership in the Eurasian Economic Union and other Russian-led supranational entities, Yatseniuk also submitted a draft law to repeal Ukraine's non-bloc status previously instituted by Yanukovych. Following parliamentary elections in October 2014, the new government made joining NATO a priority. \c\cOn 23 December 2014, the Ukrainian parliament renounced Ukraine's non-aligned status, a step harshly condemned by Russia. The new law states that Ukraine's previous non-aligned status "proved to be ineffective in guaranteeing Ukraine's security and protecting the country from external aggression and pressure" and also aims to deepen Ukrainian cooperation with NATO "in order to achieve the criteria which are required for membership in the alliance". On 29 December 2014, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko (elected president on 25 May 2014) vowed to hold a referendum on joining NATO. \c\cA number of military exercises were planned between NATO members and Ukraine in 2015. Among them were Operation Fearless Guardian (total 2,200 participants, including 1,000 U.S. military). Initial personnel and equipment of the 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived in Yavoriv, Lviv Oblast, on 10 April 2015. Fearless Guardian would train Ukraine's newly formed National Guard under the Congress-approved Global Contingency Security Fund. Under the program, the United States were to train three battalions of Ukrainian troops over a six-month period beginning in April 2015, Others exercises include Exercise Sea Breeze 2015 (total 2,500 personnel of which 1,000 US military and 500 military from NATO or "Partnership for Peace" countries), "Saber Guardian/Rapid Trident – 2015" (total 2,100 members, including 500 US military and 600 NATO/PfP personnel), as well as the Ukrainian-Polish air exercise "Safe Skies – 2015" (total 350 participants, including 100 Polish military) and military police "Law and Order – 2015" (total 100 participants, 50 of which are Polish military).[citation needed]\c\cIn September 2015, NATO launched five trust funds for €5.4 million for the Ukrainian army. €2 million are planned to be sent for the modernization of communication systems, €1.2 million – to reform the logistic and standardization systems, €845 thousand – for physical rehabilitation and prostheses, €815 thousand for cyber defense, and €410 thousand for retraining and resettlement.[citation needed]\c\cIn March 2016, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker stated that it would take at least 20–25 years for Ukraine to join the EU and NATO. On 8 June 2017, Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada passed a law making integration with NATO a foreign policy priority. In July 2017 Poroshenko announced that he would seek the opening of negotiations on a Membership Action Plan with NATO. In that same month President Poroshenko began proposing a \'patronage system\', tying individual regions with European States. \c\cOn the 10th of March 2018, NATO added Ukraine in the list of NATO aspiring members (others including Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia). Several months later, in late June, Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada passed a National Security bill: the bill defines the principles of state policy on national security and defence as well as focusing on Ukraine's integration into the European security, economic and legal system; improvement in mutual relations with other states and eventual membership in EU and NATO. \c\cOn September 20, 2018, the Ukrainian parliament approved amendments to the constitution that would make the accession of the country to NATO and the EU a central goal and the main foreign policy objective. \c\cOn 7 February 2019, the Ukrainian parliament voted with a majority of 334 out of 385 to change the Ukrainian constitution in order to help Ukraine to join NATO and the European Union. After the vote, Ukrainian president Poroshenko declared: "This is the day when the movement of Ukraine to the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance will be consolidated in the Constitution as a foreign political landmark."\c\cOn 12 June 2020, Ukraine joined NATO's enhanced opportunity partner interoperability program. According to an official, NATO statement the new status "does not prejudge any decisions on NATO membership."\c\cOn October 8, 2020, during a meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi stated that Ukraine needs a NATO Membership Action Plan, as NATO membership will contribute to Ukraine's security and defense. \c\cOn December 1, 2020, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Andrii Taran stated that Ukraine clearly outlines its ambitions to obtain the NATO Membership Action Plan and hopes for comprehensive political and military support for such a decision at the next Alliance Summit in 2021. Addressing the ambassadors and military attaches of NATO member states, as well as representatives of the NATO office in Ukraine, they were urged to inform their capitals that Ukraine would hope for their full politico-military support in reaching such a decision at the next NATO Summit in 2021. This should be a practical step and a demonstration of commitment to the 2008 Bucharest Summit. \c\cAt the end of November 2020, it became known that the NATO Summit in 2021 will consider the issue of returning to "open door policy", including the issue of providing Georgia with a Membership Action Plan (MAP). On February 9, 2021, the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, stated that he hoped that Ukraine would be able to receive an action plan for NATO membership at the same time as Georgia. In response, Alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed during Prime Minister Shmyhal's visit to Brussels that Ukraine is a candidate for NATO membership. \c\cOn April 7, 2021, after the start of the build-up of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told a press conference with his Spanish counterpart Arancha González Laya that Lithuania intends to offer its NATO allies to provide Ukraine with a Membership Action Plan (MAP):\c\cFor her part, the Spanish Foreign Minister, despite the fact that Ukraine is not a member of the Alliance, said that the Allies\' relations with it are already "fruitful, useful and are a symbol of NATO's vision of a peaceful neighborhood." She also added that the issue of Ukraine should be discussed at the summit of the North Atlantic Alliance, which is scheduled for June this year. \c\cFollowing in the footsteps of his Lithuanian counterpart, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs said that NATO should provide Ukraine with a membership action plan:\c\cOn April 10, 2021, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Andrii Taran stated that the top priority of the Ukrainian political leadership is to obtain the Action Plan for Membership (MAP) in the North Atlantic Alliance in 2021. According to the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, the most convincing and effective mechanism for communicating the position of the international community to Moscow is "accelerating the implementation of the decision of the 2008 NATO Bucharest Summit on our membership in the Alliance." Also receiving the MAP for Ukraine was supported by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a joint declaration of the Ninth High-Level Strategic Council between Ukraine and the Republic of Turkey. \c\cAt a briefing in Kyiv in May 2021, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said at a briefing in Kyiv following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi that granting Ukraine a MAP would be the next logical step toward NATO membership. He stressed that Ukraine has already made several reforms necessary to become a member of NATO, as well as to carry out additional reforms. He also noted that if Ukraine and Georgia had received the MAP in 2008, there would have been no conflict with Russia at all:\c\cSeparately, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi called one of the potential threats that could strengthen Russia's position in Europe the failure to give Ukraine a clear signal and specific deadlines for obtaining an Action Plan for NATO membership. \c\cAt the June 2021 Brussels Summit, NATO leaders reiterated the decision taken at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine would become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process and Ukraine's right to determine its own future and foreign policy. course without outside interference. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also stressed that Russia will not be able to veto Ukraine's accession to NATO, as we will not return to the era of spheres of interest, when large countries decide what smaller ones should do:\c\cWestern Ukraine has always been significantly more pro-NATO than the rest of the country. \c\cEastern Ukraine is far more anti-NATO and pro-Russia than the rest of Ukraine. \c\cA Gallup poll conducted in October 2008 showed that 43% of Ukrainians associated NATO as a threat to their country, while only 15% associated it with protection. A November 2009 poll by Ukrainian Project System relieved 40.1% of Ukrainians polled said the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) was the best global security group for Ukraine to be a part of and 33.9% of the respondents supported Ukraine's full membership in CSTO; more than 36% of the respondents of the poll said that Ukraine should remain neutral and only 12.5% supported Ukraine's accession to NATO. A 2009 Gallup poll showed that 40% of Ukrainian adults associate NATO with "Threat" and 17% with "Protection". According to a poll by Razumkov Center in March 2011 20.6% on average across Ukraine considered NATO a threat; this number was 51% in Crimea. A 2013 Gallup poll showed that 29% associated NATO with "Threat" and 17% with "Protection"; 44% viewed it as neither. \c\cFollowing the Russian military intervention of 2014, annexation of Crimea and the start of the Donbass War, many Ukrainians changed their views of NATO: polls from the middle of 2014 till 2016 showed that the majority of Ukrainians supported NATO membership. \c\cAn electronic petition to the president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko was filed on 29 August 2015 requesting that a referendum on joining NATO be conducted. The petition achieved the required 25,000 votes to be considered. The president's reply stated that "One of the main priorities of Ukraine's foreign policy is to deepen cooperation with NATO to achieve the criteria required for membership in this organization. Today, we carry out security sector reform in Ukraine to reach NATO standards and to strengthen the country's defense system, which is necessary to counter Russian aggression. Once Ukraine fulfills all the necessary criteria to join the Alliance, final decision on this important issue will be approved by the Ukrainian people in a referendum."\c\cIn February 2017, President Poroshenko announced that a referendum would be held during his presidency, with polls showing that 54% of Ukrainians favor such a move. \c\cRussia is strongly opposed to any eastward expansion of NATO. On February 12, 2008, (then) Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia may target its missiles at Ukraine if its neighbour joins NATO and accepts the deployment of a US missile defence shield. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko has stated more than once his country would not allow foreign military bases on its territory; as of December 2009, NATO was not planning to deploy military bases in Ukraine. \c\cPrime Minister Vladimir Putin reportedly declared at a NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine joined NATO his country could contend to annex the Ukrainian East and Crimea. \c\cDuring a NATO conference in Hungarian parliament on 20 November 2008, Deputy Assistant Secretary-General Aurelia Bouchez said: "We should not make a choice between NATO enlargement and Russia as we need both" and NATO's Secretary General, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told a conference in Spain twelve days later: "The emergence of independent states within the former Soviet space is a reality. The ability of these states to determine their own future is a litmus test for the new Europe. Do we have to choose between good relations with Russia and further enlargement? My answer is no – we will not choose, will not sacrifice one for the other. It would bring new dividing lines."\c\cIn an interview with the BBC on 18 November 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin spokesmen Dmitry Peskov called for "a 100% guarantee that no-one would think about Ukraine joining NATO"; 2 days later Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg rejected this call stating it would be "violating the idea of respecting the sovereignty of Ukraine, which is a fundamental".
A series of ongoing protests in Eswatini against the monarchy and for democraticisation began in late June 2021. Starting as a peaceful protest in 20 June, they escalated after 25 June into violence and looting as the government took a hardline stance against the demonstrations. \c\cEswatini is one of the few countries that is an absolute monarchy, with Mswati III having been the king since 1986. Political parties have been banned since 1973 due to a "state of emergency" that has remained to this day, and are heavily persecuted under "anti-terrorism" laws. The prime minister is appointed by the monarch. Although protests are reportedly rare, there have been demonstrations in 2018 and 2019 over Mswati III's lavish lifestyle and alleged misuse of public funds. \c\cThe first protests took place on 20 June when rural youth in Manzini Region went through a village shouting political slogans and calling for the right to a democratically chosen prime minister. They blocked roads and set tyres on fire. Police reacted to these demonstrations by deploying stun grenades and firing live bullets, leading to protestors retaliating by throwing rocks. The protests spread and escalated into violence on 25 June in Msunduza township, near Mbabane, as demonstrators "clashed" with police and stores were looted and burned. As thousands of people delivered petitions to tinkhundla authorities, who are democratically appointed in a "devolved" system, the government stopped them from being delivered, raising controversy from the national teachers union. On the night of 28-29 June, it was speculated that Mswati III had fled Eswatini amidst increasing disorder. \c\cAccording to the Times of Swaziland, a number of government figures encouraged violence and a hard crackdown through their statements. National Commissioner of Police William Dlamini stated the the protests were "war"; although he later clarified that he still wished for calm and only wished to show the the police were dedicated to restoring order, the editor of the Times blamed this statement, the  prohibition of petitions, and a call from Housing and Urban Development Minister Prince Simelane to "fight fire with fire" for inflaming the situation.
The Tigray War (Tigrinya: ውግእ ትግራይ) is an ongoing armed conflict that began around midnight of 3–4 November 2020 in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. The Special Forces of the Tigray Regional government are fighting the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF), the latter being aided by the Ethiopian Federal Police, regional police, and gendarmerie forces of the neighboring Amhara and Afar Regions with the involvement of the Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF). The Tigrayan Special Forces received reinforcements from defecting ENDF soldiers and civilian volunteers; they were integrated into the Tigray Defense Forces. All sides (but particularly the ENDF and EDF) have committed war crimes during the conflict. \c\cIn 2019, to distance the country from ethnic federalism and ethnic nationalist politics, prime minister Abiy Ahmed merged the ethnic and region-based constituent parties of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition and several opposition parties into his new Prosperity Party. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a politically powerful entity that had dominated Ethiopian politics for 27 years as a repressive regime through a one-party dominant system, refused to join the new party. The TPLF then alleged that Abiy Ahmed became an illegitimate ruler because the general elections scheduled for 29 August 2020 were postponed to 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The TPLF, led by its chairman Debretsion Gebremichael, went ahead with regional elections in Tigray in September 2020 in defiance of the federal government, which then declared the Tigray election illegal. \c\cAfter a long build up of Eritrean and Amhara forces on Tigray's borders, the actual fighting between the TPLF and the Ethiopia-Eritrea-Amhara alliance began with the 4 November attacks on Northern Command bases and headquarters of the ENDF in Tigray Region by TPLF-aligned security forces and with counterattacks by the ENDF in the Tigray Region on the same day, that federal authorities described as a police action. The federal forces captured Mekelle, the capital of Tigray Region, on 28 November, after which Prime Minister Abiy declared the Tigray operation "over". The TPLF stated in late November that it would continue fighting until the "invaders" are out. \c\cMass extrajudicial killings of civilians took place during November and December 2020 in and around Adigrat, Hagere Selam, in the Hitsats refugee camp, and in Humera, Mai Kadra Debre Abbay, and Aksum. \c\cPeace and mediation proposals included an early November African Union (AU) mediation proposed by Debretsion and refused by Abiy; an AU trio of former African presidents who visited Ethiopia in late November; an emergency Intergovernmental Authority on Development summit of East African heads of government and state that met in late 20 December 2020 in Djibouti; and peace proposals on 19 February by the TPLF and on 20 February by the National Congress of Great Tigray (Baytona), Tigray Independence Party (TIP) and Salsay Weyane Tigray (SAWET). Due to the onset of the war a deep humanitarian crisis has been feared. \c\cFollowing the end of the Ethiopian Civil War in 1991, Ethiopia became a dominant-party state under the rule of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of ethnically-based parties dominated by the Tigray People's Liberation Front. The founding and most influential member was the TPLF and the chairperson was Meles Zenawi, who was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death in 2012. \c\cOn 2 April 2018, the once powerful TPLF was ousted from power in the federal government owing to a growing discontent within the public, a reaction to 27 years of repression. In a closed door election to chair the EPRDF, executive committee members from Amhara, Oromia and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples\' regions voted for Abiy Ahmed in defiance of the TPLF, which was hoping to get Shiferaw Shigute elected chairman. After losing the election and being ousted from the federal government, TPLF officials relocated to Tigray and continued administering the region for three years frequently clashing with the federal government. In one instance, the regional administration of Tigray is reported to have defied the federal government and refused to allow Ethiopian Federal Police to arrest Getachew Assefa, the former chief of the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) of Ethiopia and executive member of TPLF. \c\cOn 1 December 2019, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed merged the ethnic and region-based parties of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (which had governed Ethiopia for 27 years) and several opposition parties into his new Prosperity Party. The TPLF, a politically powerful entity that had dominated Ethiopian politics during those 27 years, refused to join the new party, and alleged that Abiy Ahmed became an illegitimate ruler by rescheduling the general elections set for 29 August 2020 to an undetermined date in 2021 due to COVID-19. \c\cThe TPLF used to be part of the Ethiopian governing coalition until its 2019 refusal to merge into the Prosperity Party. In 2020, tensions between the government and Tigray escalated in the months before the November Tigray military intervention. Not only the TPLF, but even the Tigray branch of Abiy's own Prosperity Party expressed fears for an Eritrean invasion. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is of Oromo descent, accused the TPLF Party Members in the Tigray Regional Government of undermining his authority. By contrast, the Tigray authorities saw the refusal to recognize the September 2020 election for the Tigray parliament (which, along with all elections in Ethiopia, had been delayed by the federal elections board because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia) as the reason for the outbreak of the conflict. Abiy Ahmed's government considered the September Tigray election to be illegal. Several journalists were barred by the federal government (at Addis Ababa airport) from traveling to cover Tigray's regional election. \c\cThe warming of relations between Abiy Ahmed and Eritrean president Isaias Afwerki, who is poorly regarded in Tigray, was also considered to have fueled the tension. Ethiopian elite units were transported to Gherghera base near Asmara "as part of a security pact" between Abiy and Isaias in a plan to "strike out of existence the TPLF", according to former Eritrean Minister of Defence, Mesfin Hagos. In late October, the Ethiopian Reconciliation Commission stated that it was trying to mediate between the federal and regional governments and the Tigray People's Liberation Front, but that pre-conditions set by all sides were blocking progress. \c\cOpponents of the Tigray People's Liberation Front have described it as a heavily armed ethnic nationalist paramilitary insurgency, terrorist organization, political party, and former ruling authoritarian regime of Ethiopia. \c\cAs tension continued to grow, a general appointed by Abiy was prevented by the Tigrayan government from taking up his military post. The day prior to the TPLF's 4 November Northern Command attacks, the federal parliament of Ethiopia had suggested designating the TPLF as a terrorist organization. \c\cThe 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia states in Article 39.1, "Every Nation, Nationality and People in Ethiopia has an unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession."\c\cArticle 62.9 grants the House of Federation (HoF) the right to "order Federal intervention if any State [government], in violation of [the] Constitution, endangers the constitutional order."\c\cIn late September 2020, the TPLF stated that the constitutional term limit of the HoF, the House of Peoples\' Representatives (HoPR), the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers was 5 October 2020, and that for this reason, it would consider "the incumbent" constitutionally illegitimate after 5 October. TPLF proposed replacing the government by a technocratic caretaker government as detailed in a plan posted on Facebook by the Coalition of Ethiopian Federalist Forces. \c\cOn 4 November 2020, TPLF and Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) soldiers came into conflict during the TPLF attacks on the ENDF Northern Command headquarters in Mekelle, the Fifth Battalion barracks in Dansha, and other Northern Command bases. Several people were killed and the TPLF claimed the attack was carried out in "self-defense."\c\cIn retaliation, an Ethiopian offensive was launched which was accompanied by the declaration of a state of emergency, the creation of the State of Emergency Inquiry Board and a shutdown of government services in Tigray Region. During the subsequent days, skirmishes continued and the Ethiopian parliament declared the creation of an interim government for Tigray. Ethiopian offensives in the north were accompanied with airstrikes and several towns and cities were retaken. \c\cOn the night of 9 to 10 November 600 civilians, mostly Amhara people and Welkait people, were killed in a massacre in the town of Mai Kadra with machetes and knives used by local militias and police loyal to the TPLF, according to preliminary investigations by Amnesty International and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission. While refugees interviewed by the Financial Times and Reuters said it was the Amhara militia who were the perpetrators and Tigrayans who were the victims. Two days later, refugees interviewed by the Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The New York Times stated that Amhara militias, including Fano, and the ENDF carried out beatings and a massacre of 20 Tigrayans in Humera. Humera was shelled from the direction of the Eritrean–Ethiopian border for two days around 9–11 November. The ENDF gained control of Humera on 12 November. \c\cOffensives of joint ENDF-Amhara Region-Eritrean forces into Tigray were facilitated by the intervention of "Pterosaurus" drones, launched by the United Arab Emirates from its base in Assab in Eritrea. The Chinese-made, armed drones bombed Tigrayan towns and defense forces.[dubious  – discuss] \c\cOn 14 November 2020, Tigrayan forces launched rockets at the Eritrean capital of Asmara, but the missiles missed. In the late hours of 13 November 2020 TPLF-affilated forces fired a rocket towards the cities of Bahir Dar and Gondar in the Amhara Region. \c\cOn 17 November 2020, the Ethiopian government accused the TPLF of blowing up four main bridges leading to Mekelle. The TPLF denied the accusations. The TPLF also fired rockets at the Amhara Region in Bahir Dar and Gondar. The TPLF claimed these locations contained military terminals that served as bases to carry out airstrikes. From 17–19 November, Ethiopian forces captured the cities of Shire, Alamata, Raya, Adwa and Axum. In Raya there were an estimated 760 casualties from both forces. While fighting between the TPLF and Ethiopia continued in Zalambessa and Ethiopian forces starting moving towards Adigrat. Fighting between the TPLF and Eritrea took place in Adi Quala, Zalembesa, Taruna, Ali Tina, Wadqomdi, and Bademe. \c\cOn 23 November, Ethiopian forces reached the regional capital of Mekelle and encircled it. A military spokesperson for Ethiopia, Colonel Dejene Tsegaye, announced that Mekelle would be shelled, and told Tigray civilians to flee the city because Ethiopian forces would show no mercy. Many residents of Mekelle had already left the city due to airstrikes in and around the city, but many others still remained in the city. \c\cEven though TPLF leaders, Tigray special forces and militia forces had already left the city, the Ethiopian forces still began their direct assault on Mekelle on the morning of 28 November and started heavy shelling of the city. By the evening Prime Minister Abiy declared Ethiopian forces had taken full control of the city. In total 27 civilians were killed and 100 others were injured. The TPLF vowed to continue fighting. Two days later Prime Minister Abiy claimed no civilians were killed. \c\cAfter Ethiopian forces captured Mekelle and other major cities from forces loyal to the TPLF, the forces loyal to TPLF began to regroup into mountainous areas of Tigray and reorganized under the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF). The TDF forces also began to dig into their positions in rural Tigray. After that TPLF then started a guerrilla campaign against Ethiopian-allied forces from the mountains. This guerrilla insurgency proved unsuccessful, and by mid-December, fighting had reached the places of Hagere Selam, Samre, Dogu’a, Kolla Tembien, May Tsemre, and around Maychew. During this time, a violently enforced curfew was set up by Ethiopian forces along with Eritrean soldiers. In one town over 200 people were killed and the town left deserted. The Ethiopian government denied involvement in the killing. \c\cThe early gains made by the ENDF and Eritrean Defence Forces against the TDF have not led to decisive defeats of the TDF. In late January 2021, the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF) had rallied and were intensifying their insurgency against Ethiopian forces despite initial setbacks and heavy losses. During this time fighting was reported to have taken place around Mekelle and ENDF forces retreated from rural positions towards the Tigray capital of Mekelle. Mutinies were also reported in Mekelle after ENDF forces refused to launch an offensive into the mountains and fight TDF. The most fierce of these clashes to place in mid-February in Samre, a small town 40 km (24.85m) southwest of Mekelle. Thousands of Ethiopian troops supported by artillery, tanks, and airstrikes fought dug in forces loyal to the Tigray regional government. Current control was not stated, but The Guardian reported in late April that there was renewed fighting in the area. \c\cCurrently, the TPLF is in control of the rural areas of central and southern Tigray along with parts of eastern and south-eastern Tigray, while the ENDF is in control of the main roads and urban areas. Amhara and Eritrean forces also control parts of Tigray in the west and north respectfully. Both sides are now preparing for a pro-longed conflict as the war has reached a stalemate. All sides wish to secure a military victory but all lack the ability to do so in the near term. The Tigray Defense Forces are now engaged in a war of attrition with popular support from the people of Tigray who value the autonomy of the region. This is backed up by the TDF growing in strength in the past few months while being under pressure on all sides. Many Tigrayans have also begun to support secession from the Ethiopian government which would inflame the Amhara-Tigray territorial disputes. \c\cOn 26 March, Abiy Ahmed announced that Eritrean troops would begin to withdraw from Tigray but for now it remains to be seen if the troops would withdraw or not. Though for now EDF troops can\'t withdraw from Tigray without giving a boost to TDF in its campaign against the government. The withdrawal of EDF and Amhara troops is very difficult thing to achieve as the thing which brought them into the conflict in the first place was the elimination of the TPLF as a political force. \c\cOn 28 and 29 November 2020, witnesses and survivors including refugees in Sudan reported that the Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) carried out the Axum massacre of about 720–800 civilians. The Eritrean government stated that it was angered by Amnesty International's report on the Aksum massacre, that the report was "fallacious" and that the Eritrean government had not been contacted by Amnesty International prior to publication. The Eritrean government also said: "It must be underscored that Amnesty made absolutely no attempt to seek any information from Eritrea. Moreover, the fabricated Axum accusation has mutated over the last month from a \'massacre of Orthodox Christians at St. Mary's Church\' to \'house-to-house\' killing of civilians."\c\cAccording to people who were in Tigray when the war broke out and according to refugees, the EDF would then go on and kill 80–150 in Idaga Hamus on 30 November, and kill 17 in Hadish Hiwot on 2 December after forcing the victims to loot the Goda factory. The EDF would also kill 13 boys aged 12–15 from 1 to 14 December in Tokot.[dubious  – discuss]\c\cOn 26 December 2020, it was reported that Eritrea started withdrawing some of its troops from Tigray. \c\cOn 9 January 2021, Ethiopian TV reported that 300 refugees in Hitsats camp were executed by the TPLF. According to refugees, pro-TPLF forces used Hitsats as a base for several weeks in November 2020, killing several refugees who wanted to leave the camp to get food and, in one incident, killed nine young Eritrean men in revenge for having lost a battle against the EDF. \c\cOn 18 February 2021, unidentified militiamen ambushed a passenger bus in Adi Mesino, killing six and injuring 10. On 20 February, Yemane Niguse, a prominent Tigrayan dissident was assassinated in his birth town of Hewane by unknown assailants. The allegiance of the assassins is unknown. The federal Ethiopian authorities accused the TPLF of responsibility. \c\cOn 1 April 2021, a video surfaced that purports to show Ethiopian troops executing 11 unarmed men before disposing of their bodies near Mahibere Dego. The video has not been dated as of yet. \c\cOn 21 May 2021, Ethiopia’s military prosecutors have convicted 3 soldiers of rape and pressed charges against 28 others suspected of killing civilians in Tigray, 25 other soldiers are charged with rape and other forms of sexual violence, according to the statement by attorney general’s office. The statement also confirmed reports of two massacres in Tigray: It said 229 civilians were killed in the town of Mai Kadra at the beginning of November. Moreover, the Ethiopian government also for the first time accused troops from Eritrea of killing civilians: 110 civilians were killed in the city of Axum on November 27 and 28. \c\cBy 18 November, Abiy claimed that the Ethiopian National Defense Force had captured the cities of Shire and Axum with battles continuing around Mekelle; Ethiopian forces further claimed to have taken some land south of the city. On 23 November, the government issued an ultimatum giving the rebels 72 hours to surrender. On 26 November, after the ultimatum ended, Abiy ordered federal military forces to launch an attack on Mekelle. On 28 November, the Ethiopian government announced that it had taken control of the city, bringing "the last phase of its law enforcement operation" to an end. The TPLF said they would continue fighting. TPLF Chairman, Debretsion Gebremichael, confirmed the TPLF was withdrawing from Mekelle. On 2 December 2020 the United Nations was promised humanitarian access to the territory held by the ENDF in the Tigray Region. The first UN convoy reached Mekelle on 12 December. On 16 December the EU delayed financial aid to Ethiopia citing the Ethiopian government's restrictions against UN humanitarian aid as the reason. \c\cIn February 2021, UN chief coordinator of humanitarian efforts Mark Lowcock said that up 40% of Tigray was not controlled by Ethiopian troops. He said that much of that area was under the control of Eritrean soldiers pursuing their own objectives independent of Ethiopian command. \c\cRefugees told VICE World News that Eritrea is in control of parts of the northern Maekelay Zone and most likely extending beyond the zone. Different refugees told VICE that not only did Eritreans cross into border areas, but they also took control of the area. One refugee from Maekelay told them “Since the war started, we haven’t seen a single Ethiopian soldier. Only Eritreans, they occupy the rural areas.”\c\cBoth the military capabilities of the TDF and the broad-based support that it enjoys in Tigray contributed to the Ethiopian decision to allow Eritrean troops to occupy northern Tigray. The government also relies on the Amhara militias for support in the western and southern zones of Tigray. The ENDF alone is not capable of containing, much less defeating, the TDF. However, the reliance on Amhara militias and the Eritrean army to combat a domestic insurgency greatly complicates any future de-escalation efforts. \c\cOn 16 June 2021, the Ethiopian ambassador to the UN stated that Eritrean troops in Tigray were to "definitely leave soon". \c\cOn 28 June 2021, the Tigray Defense Forces captured the city of Mekelle, shortly after the Ethiopian government declared a ceasefire. Celebrations erupted in the streets of Mekelle as the TDF took the city. \c\cThousands of people were believed to have been killed in the conflict and around 44,000 fled to Sudan. On 29 November, claims that South Sudan was giving safe haven to Debretsion, led to the Ethiopian ambassador to South Sudan abruptly returning to Ethiopia, and South Sudanese diplomats in Ethiopia allegedly being given 72 hours to leave the country. \c\cOn 15 December, four Sudanese soldiers were killed, and 27 others were injured near the Ethiopia–Sudan border, in what Sudan claimed to be an ambush by Ethiopian forces and militias. A soldier later claimed that Ethiopian forces had launched artillery attacks on them and intruded into the Jebel al-Teyyour area, located 7 kilometers inside Sudan. Other soldiers claimed that the attackers were Amhara Region militias. Ethiopia claimed the clashes were Ethiopia trying to stop a Sudanese militia which had tried to cross into Ethiopian territory and seize farmlands. \c\cIn response to the killings, Sudan started to build-up its military along the border with Ethiopia. Military sources claimed that Sudan had recaptured Jebel Abutiour. Then on 19 December Sudanese army and Rapid Support Forces were reported to have taken areas previously taken by Ethiopia and Amhara Region militias in Al Qadarif. On the same day, 150 civilians were reported to have been killed by Eritrean forces in Edaga Hamus. \c\cOn 7 December heavy fighting broke out between African Union Mission to Somalia and Ethiopian troops in Halgan District, Somalia, when Ethiopian troops tried to disarm Tigrayan troops within their ranks. In total 21 Ethiopian soldiers of Tigrayan origin and 20 other Ethiopian soldiers were killed in the internal military mutiny. \c\cSomalia was involved in the Tigray War according to former head of the Somali National Intelligence and Security Agency, Abdilsalan Guld. \c\cGuld said that the soldiers, aged from 20 to 30 years old, were secretly taken from Mogadishu and sent to Asmara for military training. Guld stated that 370 of the Somali troops trained by Eritrea were killed in Tigray and hundreds of others were wounded. \c\cOn 18 January 2021, the head of Somalia's parliamentary committee on foreign affairs asked the Somali president to investigate claims by family members that their sons had gone off to fight in Ethiopia and are now missing. \c\cOn 19 January 2021, the Somalian government denied the claim that Somali troops had trained in Eritrea and then deployed in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. \c\cAccording to the United Nations (UN), some 2.3 million children have been cut off from desperately needed aid and humanitarian assistance. Since the start of the conflict, the Ethiopian federal government has strictly controlled access to the Tigray region, and the UN has said it is frustrated that talks with the Ethiopian government had not yet secured adequate humanitarian access for "food, including ready-to-use therapeutic food for the treatment of child malnutrition, medicines, water, fuel, and other essentials that are running low" said UNICEF. By 13 March 2021, the UN and its partners reached about 0.9 million people with complete food baskets, and 0.7 million people with clean water. Despite the progress made, many are still hard to reach due to ongoing fighting. About 4.5 million people of are still in need of aid and about 1 million of that are not in accessible areas due to ongoing fighting. \c\cSince the start of the conflict, there has been a limited access to clean water due to hygiene and sanitation services largely being disrupted across Tigray. The Tigray Regional Water Bureau reported that out of 36 villages it assessed, only 4 had partially functioning water sources. Along with that, an estimated 250 motorized water pumping systems have been out of order, and the status of 11,000 hand pumps in rural areas were unknown. Because of this there has been a heightened risk of outbreaks of water-born diseases and COVID-19. \c\cIn February 2021, it was reported by GOAL Ethiopia, IRC, MCMDO, MSF-Spain and World Vision, that nearly one in seven children in 16 woredas and town administrations across Tigray were found to be acutely malnourished. While in Enderta, Abi Adi and Shire, GOAL and IRC reported that 16.6% of children screened had acute malnutrition with 3.5% suffering from severe acute malnutrition. \c\cOut of more than 260 health centers in Tigray before the war, only 31 are fully functional, while 7 are partially functional, according to the Emergency Coordination Center. According to WHO, all of the functioning hospitals and health centers in Tigray had a lack of medical supplies, drugs and equipment. UN partners reported continued looting of health facilities. Only 16% of the health facilities had vaccination services and only 17% had maternal services (antenatal care, birth delivery, etc). \c\cIn November 2020, Amhara Region Special Forces and Amhara militias loyal to the Amhara regional government took control of the western zone of Tigray in order to settle a decades-old land dispute. They claim the area was taken from them by force in 1991 after TPLF forces overthrew the communist PDRE government and divided the country into 9 states. They have also claimed the areas of Welkait, Tegede, Humera, Telemte, and Raya to be theirs. Since then, the area has been under the de facto control of Amhara regional authorities. Their control has been marked by reports of ethnically motivated violence and forced displacement. By February 2020, about 45,000 civilians had been forced to leave the zone due to extrajudical killings, arbitary detentions, and the disappearances of people, especially young men. One refugee interviewed by Reuters said that if they didn\'t leave when they did, they would have been killed by Amhara forces. 41 other refugees interviewed have also described attacks, looting, and threats by Amhara forces. \c\cThe administrator of the disputed zone, Yabsira Eshetie, has denied any claims of violence or forced displacement by Amhara forces. Mulu Nega, the leader of the government-appointed interim Tigray government has stated the contrary. The Amhara government also denies reports of forced displacement and has even asked the Ethiopian government to change the regional border. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there have been acts of ethnic cleansing in Tigray. \c\cPossible COVID-19 outbreaks have been feared as refugees fleeing the Tigray conflict have sheltered in crowded camps. \c\cIn November 2020, the UN warned of “very critical” supply shortages for the nearly 100,000 Eritrean refugees who, prior to the war, were registered in four camps in Tigray region. Later that same month, the UN reported that people in Tigray were fleeing Mekelle. The federal government had warned of "no mercy" if TPLF and residents remained intermingled. \c\cAs of December 2020, the UN estimated more than one million people have been internally displaced by the fighting. More than 50,000 people have fled to Sudan due to the conflict. Communications and travel links were still blocked, and Human Rights Watch warned that "actions that deliberately impede relief supplies" would violate international humanitarian law. \c\cThere have been “deeply distressing reports of sexual and gender-based violence, extrajudicial killings, [and the] widespread destruction and looting of public and private property by all parties” according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. More than 136 cases of rape have also been reported in hospitals in Mekelle, Ayder, Adigrat and Wukro in the east of Tigray region between December 2020 and January 2021, with indications that there are many more such unreported cases. \c\cAs of 2 February 2021, 20,000 of the Eritrean refugees in Tigray, mostly from the Hitsats and Shimelba camps, remained unaccounted for, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \c\cThe fighting has killed thousands, according to International Crisis Group. \c\cThere have been several reported attacks on humanitarian workers, including attacks by Ethiopian government soldiers. The Danish Refugee Council and the International Rescue Committee reported the killings of their staff in early December 2020.  An employee of the Committee of the Development of Peoples was killed by a stray bullet in early June.  On March 23rd 2021, a driver from Médecins Sans Frontières was beaten by Ethiopian soldiers after witnessing extrajudicial killings by Ethiopian government soldiers.  Following the June 23rd bombing of Togoga, there were reports of Ethiopian government soldiers firing on ambulances to prevent them from reaching the injured.  On June 25th 2021, three Médecins Sans Frontières workers were found murdered near their car in Tigray. \c\cClaire Wilmot, writing in The Washington Post, found that a significant number of new, single-issue Twitter accounts were opened in the immediate aftermath of the 4 November attacks. Most appeared to be authentic accounts from people seeking to raise international awareness of the conflict in the midst of a communications blackout in Tigray. The Ethiopian government cited disinformation and hate speech to justify communications blackouts. Researchers suggested that reducing access to information could help to create contexts where misinformation can thrive, because it reduces the ability to verify information. The Ethiopian government tried to control the information environment by positioning itself as the sole provider of reliable information. In February, pro-government groups called on their supporters in Ethiopia and the diaspora to combat what they called "TPLF fake news" online. Pro-government groups used tactics similar to those of pro-TPLF groups to push their narrative of the conflict, though as of 5 February, pro-government campaigns had produced fewer Tweets overall. BBC News showed examples of manipulated photos which misleadingly endorsed both the federal Ethiopian government and the TPLF. Researchers found that groups use tactics such as "copy and paste" campaigns hosted on websites, which include instructions for opening new accounts, copying and pasting pre-written tweets, and tagging influencers. Both campaigns produced disinformation and misinformation, though the majority of content produced was activist in nature. Wilmot suggested that the lines between authentic political activity and deliberate manipulation of online content during the conflict were increasingly blurred. \c\cEthnic profiling against Tigrayans occurred during the Tigray War, with Ethiopians of Tigrayan ethnicity being put on indefinite leave from Ethiopian Airlines or refused permission to board, prevented from overseas travel, and an "order of identifying ethnic Tigrayans from all government agencies and NGOs" being used by federal police to request a list of ethnic Tigrayans from an office of the World Food Programme. Tigrayans\' houses were arbitrarily searched and Tigrayan bank accounts were suspended. Ethnic Tigrayan members of Ethiopian components of United Nations peacekeeping missions were disarmed and some forcibly flown back to Ethiopia, at the risk of torture or execution, according to United Nations officials. The State of Emergency Taskforce stated that the Tigrayan peacepeekers were returned to Ethiopia because of "infiltration of TPLF elements in various entities". \c\cSeveral proposals for peace negotiations and mediation were made involving some of the main groups involved in the war. Around 9 November 2020, Debretsion asked the African Union to stop the war and requested peace negotiations; Abiy refused to negotiate. On 25–27 November, a trio of former African presidents appointed by AU chair Cyril Ramaphosa visited Ethiopia with the aim of mediating; they met Abiy and representatives of the Transitional Government of Tigray that officially replaced the TPLF government. An emergency Intergovernmental Authority on Development summit of East African heads of government and state met on 20 December 2020 in Djibouti, resulting in a statement of support for the Ethiopian constitutional order and humanitarian access to Tigray Region. \c\cOn 19 February 2021, the TPLF expressed its wish for peace negotiations, declaring eight preconditions for the negotiations. On 20 February, the National Congress of Great Tigray (Baytona), Tigray Independence Party (TIP) and Salsay Weyane Tigray (SAWET) published six demands to the international community that closely overlapped with the TPLF's pre-conditions. \c\cOn 11 March 2021, the US ambassador to Ethiopia, Geeta Pasi, announced support for joint humanitarian activities by international partners and the federal government of Ethiopia. \c\cThe Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) condemned the "decision of President Mustafe to portray Somalis in Ethiopia as supporters of the war against Tigray". \c\cOn 12 November 2020, the TPLF chairman Debretsion Gebremichael denied allegations that the TPLF had surrendered, stating that "we are still holding. These people cannot defeat us. We cannot be beaten."\c\cOn 27 November, Ethiopian Attorney General, Gedion Timothewos, pressed by the BBC's Stephen Sackur to clarify if his country was now "sinking into civil war", responded: "If the Prime Minister were to let the TPLF go on with the kind of things they have been doing, if he had let them acquire the heavy weaponry they wanted to acquire by attacking the Northern Command, yes, we would have descended into that kind of situation; but by taking the measures we are taking right now, we will be able to avert that possibility."\c\cWhen Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018, he made significant reforms to the country's judicial system, economy and foreign policy. According to an article by Hailemariam Desalegn, the former prime minister of Ethiopia, TPLF officials were concerned these moves were going to threaten their political and economic position in the country. Thus TPLF officials started defying the orders from the federal government and made overt and covert actions to undermine and delegitimize the Ethiopian parliament, defense forces and the federal government. \c\c Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne called on all parties to show restraint. Champagne also called for a peaceful solution and protection of civilians. \c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, China objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Djiboutian President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh expressed strong support for Abiy, saying that he had chosen to "restore law and order at the federal level, and punish those seeking to break up the country" and dismissed the prospect of negotiations, saying that the TPLF had "structured itself so as to bring the central government to its knees" and that talks could "only lead to the partition of Ethiopia", setting a precedent for secession by other groups in the region. \c\c Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki politically support the actions taken by the Ethiopian national government against Tigray People's Liberation Front.[citation needed]\c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, India objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Japan extended its emergency grant aid of 6.6 million US dollars for people affected by the war. \c\c Kenya, Political Support for the Ethiopian national government. \c\c Minister of Foreign Affairs (Turkey) Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu stated that the Turkish government "understood" the federal Ethiopian government's decision and "expressed his confidence that the operation would end soon and not compromise the safety of civilians."\c\c Norway said it was “deeply concerned by reports of the use of SGBV in Tigray. Norway joins UN Special Rapporteur Pramilla Patten in calling on all parties to commit to a zero-tolerance policy for SGBV. Obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law must be respected.”\c\c The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in response to the  massacre in the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, "We strongly condemn the perpetrators of this barbaric crime committed in a place of worship. We expect the Ethiopian authorities to immediately take all possible to clarify its circumstances and punish the perpetrators.” Poland also called "on the parties to the conflict to refrain from violence and respect human rights, to ensure the safety of civilian population, and to properly protect the places of worship and freedom of religion. We appeal for an unimpeded access for humanitarian deliveries to the Tigray province. \c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, Russia objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo politically supports the current military actions taken by the Ethiopian government against Tigray People's Liberation Front. \c\c British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had spoken with Abiy and urged "de-escalation of the Tigray conflict" and further stated that "civilians and humanitarian access must be protected". \c\cBritish House of Lords member, David Alton, called on the British government to investigate the reports of massacres and attacks on refugee camps in Tigray. \c\c U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged de-escalation of the conflict and immediate action to restore peace, and emphasized the importance of protecting civilians. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's foreign policy adviser Antony Blinken expressed deep concern over the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, ethnic violence and threats to peace and security in the area. He called on the TPLF to protect civilians and take steps to end the conflict. \c\cU.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Tibor Nagy condemned the Tigray People's Liberation Front for their rocket attacks against Asmara, Eritrea, calling it an "unjustifiable attacks against Eritrea ... its efforts to internationalize the conflict in Tigray."\c\cOn 27 February 2021, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces and Amhara regional forces from Tigray. He also asked the African Union and regional partners, to work with the U.S. to address the crisis in Tigray. \c\cOn 12 March, the US announced it would be resuming some aid to Ethiopia, which had previously been blocked by the Trump administration over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) dispute, but that security assistance programs would remain suspended due to concerns over the conflict in Tigray. \c\c U.S. President Joe Biden met with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta to discuss the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Tigray and the need to prevent further loss of life and to ensure humanitarian access. \c\c The United Nations (UN) warned of the emergence of a major humanitarian crisis, if a full-scale conflict arose. \c\cUN Security Council: "The UN Security Council on Friday scrapped plans to issue a statement calling for an end to violence in Ethiopia’s Tigray region because of opposition from China and Russia, diplomats said."\c\c The European Commission said it was mobilizing an initial €4 million in emergency aid, in order to assist displaced Ethiopian refugees who had fled to Sudan.  The EU plans on cutting aid to and sanctioning other regions of Ethiopia due to the conflict. \c\c The African Union (AU) appealed for cessation of hostilities and protection of civilians. The AU also stated that the European Union and United Nations Security Council should not intervene until an African Union envoy is sent to Ethiopia. \c\cThe Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, made a statement defending the Ethiopian Government by tweeting "In #Ethiopia, the federal govt took bold steps to preserve the unity, stability and respect for the constitutional order of the country; which is legitimate for all states. It cannot be denied, however, that the crisis in #Tigray has provoked large scale displacement. We encourage #IGAD to support #Ethiopia in addressing the humanitarian dimensions. Particular attention should be paid to refugees and displaced people. #IgadSummit."\c\cWorldwide, humanitarian organizations and the scientific community asked for a rapid ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Tigray. \c\cInternational petitions for humanitarian aid to Tigray have been launched, for instance by concerned scientists (Professors Jan Nyssen, Eloi Ficquet, Wolbert Smidt, Jozef Deckers, Istvan Tarrosy, Paolo Billi, Sil Lanckriet, Kjetil Tronvoll and others), and another one on Avaaz. \c\cOn 9 February 2021, when religious leaders started a visit to Mekelle organized by federal authorities to show that the situation was "normal", protestors used stones and burnt tyres to block central parts of the town in objection to the claim that the situation had returned to normality. Soldiers fired at the protestors, killing one. The head of the transport division of Ayder Referral Hospital and his son were beaten by soldiers, and stated that there were many injured who were not being brought to the hospital. \c\cEthiopians and Eritrean in the diaspora took to the streets to protest and expresses their views. These protests included:\c\cOn 9 November 2020 in Washington D.C. (USA)\c\cOn 12 November 2020 in Denver, Colorado (USA)\c\cOn 14 November 2020 in The Netherlands\c\cOn 18 November 2020 in Las Vegas (USA)\c\cOn 21 November 2020 in Stavanger (Norway)\c\cOn 24 November 2020 in Louisville (USA)\c\cOn 25 November 2020 in South Africa\c\cOn 1 December 2020 in Brussels (Belgium), at the headquarters of the European Union\c\cOn 28 December in 2020 Denver, Colorado (USA)\c\cOn 3 January 2021 in Aurora, Colorado (USA)\c\cOn 8 January 2021 in  Melbourne (Australia)\c\cOn 8 January 2021 in Perth (Australia)\c\cOn 8 January 2021 in Portland, Oregon (USA)\c\cOn 8 January 2021 in Sioux City, Iowa (USA)\c\cMid-January 2021 in The Hague (The Netherlands)\c\cOn 22 January 2021 in Louisville (USA)\c\cOn 11 February 2021 in Headquarters of the United Nations (USA)\c\cOn 25 March 2021 in Wellington, New Zealand\c\cOn 12 June 2021, in Cornwall, England more than one thousand Ethiopians and Tigrayans rally around the annual G7 event. Ethiopian protesters were heard shouting “(Prime Minister of Ethiopia) Abiy is a criminal”. \c\cOn 10 March 2021 in Washington, D.C. at the United States Department of State\c\cOn 10–11 March 2021 in Toronto, and "Several Canadian Cities" (Canada)\c\cOn 15 March 2021 in Geneva, Switzerland hundreds of Ethiopians (including some Eritreans) held a protest outside of the United Nations building in support of "the government actions taken against the Tigray People's Liberation Front". \c\cOn 29 April 2021, in Milan, Italy, 28 Ethiopians and Eritreans peacefully marched in support of the Ethiopian government. \c\cOn 3 May 2021, in London, England, Eritreans and Ethiopians attended a "Peaceful Rally" supporting the actions of the federal Ethiopian government.[citation needed]
The 2021 Western North America heat wave is a heat wave in June and July 2021 that affects much of the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada, particularly, in western Nevada, Northern California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho in the United States, as well as British Columbia, and in the later phase, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon and Northwest Territories in Canada. It also affected inland areas of central and southern California, as well as northwestern and southern Nevada, though the temperature anomalies were not as extreme as regions farther north. \c\cThe heat wave appeared due to an exceptionally strong ridge centered over the area. It caused some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in the region, including the highest temperature ever measured in Canada at 49.6 °C (121.3 °F). \c\cThe exact death toll is still unknown but is growing. On June 20, 2021, the chief coroner of British Columbia said 321 more sudden deaths than usual were reported in the province, suggesting the majority or all of them could have died as a result of the heat, not counting the so far unreported deaths in the databases. Human losses in the United States include at least 63 in Oregon (of which 45 in Multnomah County, home to Portland); Washington has also seen some people die of hyperthermia. \c\cThe Pacific Northwest lies close to the North Pacific High, a semi-permanent anticyclone which is most active in summer. In addition to that, 2021 is a year of La Niña, a phenomenon during which warmer waters stay on the western part of the Pacific Ocean. \c\cOn June 23, the National Weather Service warned of an approaching heat wave on the Pacific Northwest, whose origins could be traced to torrential rains in China. There, the warm, moist air rose and was eventually sucked up by the jet stream, which transported it east over cooler waters. When that air current encountered an upper-level high-pressure zone, also called a ridge, it started to significantly deform on 25 June, forcing to accommodate the high-pressure area south of the jet stream's meander. At the same time, the Southwestern states are enduring an intense drought, which allowed higher-than-average temperatures over the Southwestern United States; that hot and dry air then moved north to the Pacific Northwest. \c\cThese conditions made way for a massive Rex block, also called an omega block due to the specific shape of the jet stream that surrounds the area of high pressure, looking like the last letter of the Greek alphabet, Ω. In this situation, a high-pressure area stays there for a long time and does not let cyclones pass through it, which could have cooled the region. As the Pacific Northwest, just as the Southwest, experienced severe drought conditions, the air was heating more quickly than usual, which intensified the ridge so strongly it caused a heat dome. In this scenario, the high-pressure area forced the air downwards, heating the air column; but even as the air became increasingly lighter and hotter due to the sun's energy, it could not escape the dome because of the high pressure, a situation which has been compared to a pressure cooker. Indeed, in Prince George, British Columbia, the geopotential height value at 500 hPa on 27 June was reported at 5986 m - the highest ever recorded in the area; adjacent stations have similarly reported record-high values. The downslope winds from the Cascades and other mountain ranges further warmed the air in the valleys. \c\cClimate change in Canada and climate change in the United States are widely considered to be the major causes of the heat wave's unprecedented intensity, although whether the frequency of these omega blocks is due to global heating is not yet known. All of these events contributed to what has been described as a phenomenon that could statistically occur only once in several thousand years. \c\cMuch of the Pacific Northwest, normally known for its temperate weather in June, received maximum temperatures 20-35 °F (11-19 °C) above normal during this heat wave. In fact, the temperatures were so anomalous that nighttime lows were higher than the average high temperatures that this region would normally observe at this time of year. \c\cOn June 29, the temperature in Lytton, British Columbia, hit 49.6 °C (121.3 °F), the highest temperature ever recorded in Canada. This occurred after consecutively setting new record highs of 46.6 °C (115.9 °F) on June 27 and 47.9 °C (118.2 °F) on June 28. It is also the highest temperature ever recorded not only north of 50°N, but also north of 45°N, and is also the highest temperature in the U.S. or Canada recorded outside the Desert Southwest. \c\cOn June 27, local records were set in areas such as Cultus Lake, Lillooet, Ashcroft (43.8 °C (110.8 °F)) and Kamloops (44 °C (111 °F)); in all, there were 59 weather stations in B.C. that set records for hottest temperatures recorded for June 27. These were largely beaten in the following days (Kamloops, for instance, has registered 45.8 °C (114.4 °F) on June 28 and 47.3 °C (117.1 °F) on June 29). On June 28, records were set in Abbotsford at 42.9 °C (109.2 °F), Victoria at 39.8 °C (103.6 °F) and Port Alberni at 42.7 °C (108.9 °F). As of June 29, 103 all-time heat records were set across Western Canada, including east of the Rocky Mountains. In Alberta, Banff 37.2 °C (99.0 °F), Beaverlodge 40.5 °C (104.9 °F), Cochrane 34.5 °C (94.1 °F), Jasper 40.8 °C (105.4 °F), Grande Prairie 41.1 °C (106.0 °F), Hendrickson Creek 38.1 °C (100.6 °F), Nordegg 36.9 °C (98.4 °F) and Red Earth Creek 39.6 °C (103.3 °F) have all seen the strongest heat ever measured in these communities. Nahanni Butte, Northwest Territories, also set a regional record at 38.1 °C (100.6 °F). \c\cSweltering conditions are also expected in the final days of June and early July as far east as Saskatchewan and western Manitoba. \c\cSeveral major cities, including Seattle, Portland, and Spokane, experienced high temperatures far exceeding 100 °F (38 °C) and low temperatures higher than the area's normal daily high temperatures.  \c\cThe hottest temperatures were recorded on the Oregon-Washington border. In The Dalles and Dallesport, on either side of the Columbia River, daytime high temperatures reached 118 °F (48 °C), tying an all-time high for the state of Washington and beating the June statewide record by 5 degrees Fahrenheit. The same heat was measured in Tri-Cities on June 28-29. \c\cOn June 26, Portland broke its previous all-time record high temperature of 107 °F (42 °C), set in July 1965 and August 1981, with a temperature of 108 °F (42 °C). It topped that record again on June 27, with a temperature of 112 °F (44 °C). The following day, the mercury rose further to 116 °F (47 °C). All of these extremes also beat the previous record June temperature, which was 102 °F (39 °C) set on June 26, 2006. \c\cSalem, Oregon, reached 105 °F (41 °C) degrees on June 26, its record high temperature for June. It then hit 113 °F (45 °C) degrees on June 27, breaking the record for the highest temperature ever recorded in that city, which was previously 108 °F (42 °C). Salem then exceeded the previous day's record temperature on June 28, with a maximum temperature of 117 °F (47 °C). However, not all the regions of the mid-Willamette Valley received extreme heat on June 28, especially regions south of South Salem where temperatures only reached the mid-90s Fahrenheit, likely due to the sea breeze in the area. \c\cThe Willamette Valley has also seen extreme overnight temperature drops (twice the size of normal fluctuations) due to cooler air coming from the ocean – Portland cooled a record 52 °F (29 °C) during the night, while Salem almost approached its all-time largest temperature swing, from 117 °F (47 °C) to 61 °F (16 °C). \c\cBetween 1894, when the records in Seattle began, and June 2021, temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C) were only noted three times; however, the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has recorded three consecutive days of temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C). Notably, they rose to 104 °F (40 °C) on June 27, only to be beaten to 108 °F (42 °C) the following day. All of these values have broken the previous June record (96 °F (36 °C), 2017) by a large margin. The suburbs farther from the coast were even hotter – a local radio station in Maple Valley reported temperatures of 118 °F (48 °C). \c\cOn June 26, Port Angeles, Washington, recorded an all-time record high of 95 °F (35 °C). The Quillayute Airport weather station, also on the Olympic Peninsula, on the edge of the Hoh Rainforest and three miles from the Pacific Ocean in Washington, recorded 110 degrees, exceeding its prior record by 11 degrees. \c\cOn Mount Rainier, normally freezing temperatures reached 73 °F (23 °C) degrees above 10,000 feet (3,000 m) on June 27. \c\cEast of the Cascades, on June 27, Spokane and a few other cities measured record-breaking or -tying temperatures, with places such as Ephrata, Washington, measuring temperatures upwards of 109 °F (43 °C), and Spokane with a record high of 102 °F (39 °C) for that date. On June 28, Lewiston, Idaho, and Omak, Washington, reported values of 108 °F (42 °C) and Ephrata registered 113 °F (45 °C), the new maxima ever measured at those places on that date. Along with this, extremely high minimal temperatures were also noted: Ephrata's thermometers did not go lower than 78 °F (26 °C) on June 28 and 82 °F (28 °C) on June 29. The same day, Ephrata, Spokane and Omak all reached their all-time records, at 115 °F (46 °C), 109 °F (43 °C) and 117 °F (47 °C), respectively. These are the hottest temperatures measured since records began for those areas. \c\cThe heat wave is a problem for major cities in the Northwest. Seattle and Portland have respectively the first- and third-lowest percentage of air-conditioned households among certain major metro areas in the United States. In 2015, a U.S. Census Bureau survey found that only 33% of Seattle homes have air conditioning (A/C) units, but that number increased to 44% in the 2019 survey, likely due to the warming trend in that area. The rate of air-conditioned households is even lower in British Columbia despite marked increases over the years – BC Hydro estimated that only 34% of province's residents were using these cooling appliances, though in the interior parts of the province, the rate rose to 72%. For these reasons, authorities have waived COVID-related restrictions for designated cooling shelters in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. \c\cIn British Columbia, 103 more deaths than expected in a four day period were referred to the coroner up to June 29, with the number rising to 321 the following day. The chief coroner of the province also noted that in the five years preceding the event, the province had had only three casualties related to heat. Due to unprecedented emergency call volume, emergency services left behind bodies of victims as the police and ambulances continued to respond to other calls. E-Comm emergency dispatchers answered nearly 15,300 calls on June 26 and 27; this is about 55 percent above normal for the month. From June 25–28, British Columbia Emergency Health Services ambulances responded to 187 heat exhaustion calls and 52 heat stroke calls. \c\cOn June 28, 15 school districts in British Columbia's Lower Mainland, including all districts within Vancouver, closed due to the heat and their lack of sufficient cooling infrastructure; many have also changed, or shortened, Tuesday schedules to avoid the heat. COVID-19 vaccination sites have also endured disruption because of the weather conditions. \c\cThe heat wave caused rapid snowmelt of some of the Rocky Mountains snowcaps, which triggered a week-long evacuation order in the Pemberton Valley due to rising water levels. It has also made electricity demand soar to levels never seen before – BC Hydro reported consumption levels reaching 8,500 MW, while AESO, the Albertan electricity regulator, noted demand inching towards an all-time high (11,721 MW), which prompted the operator to formally ask consumers to conserve energy. Additionally, Beaumont issued a mandatory ban on non-essential water usage, citing drought conditions. \c\cThe extreme heat led to exceptionally dangerous wildfire conditions, which led Mike Flannigan, a University of Alberta wildfire scientist, to say that the summer fire season could be "horrific" if the extreme conditions persisted. At least 19 wildfires ignited between June 27 and 29, but most remained under 5 hectares (12 acres); one fire, however, grew to at least 200 hectares (490 acres) by June 29, prompting evacuations. On June 30, further orders were given, when two large fires spread out of control - the one near Kamloops Lake grew to 50 square kilometres (19 sq mi) as of June 30, and the other one, north of Lillooet, was only slightly smaller. \c\cAgriculture has also seen losses: raspberry farms in the Lower Mainland were reported to be struggling with spoilt crops, while in southern Alberta, the heat has set fire to the wheat fields in some places, which, combined with a severe drought in the province, has put the harvest in jeopardy. \c\cThe heat wave inflicted damage on the infrastructure across the whole Pacific Northwest. Roads, including Interstate 5, began to buckle due to thermal expansion, which led to closures and other inconveniences for drivers. Heat induced rail distortion, called sun kink, on the route of the Amtrak Cascades required operation of the passenger train at a slower than normal speed. \c\cA farm worker in St. Paul, died due to the heat, according to Oregon OSHA. Two individuals in King County, which includes Seattle, died of hyperthermia, according to the county medical examiner's office. Two homeless people died of probable heat-related causes in Bend on June 28. \c\cIn Eugene, where the qualifiers for the 2020 Summer Olympics were held, the heat caused evacuation of the stadium and postponement of some events to the evening hours, as the temperature of the stadium's track exceeded 150 °F (66 °C). It also caused an athlete to withdraw from the race. \c\cSalem recorded at least 30 heat-related injuries throughout the heat wave. 22 of those injuries occurred from June 25 to June 27 and an additional 12 injuries occurred on the afternoon of June 28. Heat-related injuries included symptoms of heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and heat exposure. An increase in heat-related illnesses was also reported statewide throughout Oregon during the heat wave. Two swimmers went missing in the Willamette River. \c\cIn the Portland metropolitan area, TriMet suspended MAX Light Rail and WES Commuter Rail service for part of June 27 and all of June 28 as the cables from which the light rail cars drew electricity had sagged. \c\cIn King County, home to Seattle, thirteen people are known to have died from the heat as of June 30. Three more casualties were reported in Snohomish County and two more in the Spokane area. Most of the deaths occurred among the elderly. At least three people have drowned statewide, trying to escape from the heat. \c\cA public swimming pool in Seattle's Rainier Beach neighborhood was closed due to dangerously high deck temperatures. The city announced it would hose down steel drawbridges with cool water to prevent them from getting stuck due to thermal expansion. In Eastern Washington, power outages were reported in Spokane, some of which were done in order to reduce the load on the electrical systems. \c\c10 million pounds of fruit a day were being harvested in the Pacific Northwest at the time the heat wave struck. Farmers in Eastern Washington facing a loss of the cherry crop sent workers into orchards at night for their health safety. The raspberry crop in Whatcom County, Washington, 85% of the nation's total production, was endangered.
Reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) encompasses five key issues: categories of membership, the question of the veto held by the five permanent members, regional representation, the size of an enlarged Council and its working methods, and the Security Council-General Assembly relationship. The Member States, regional groups and other Member State interest groupings developed different positions and proposals on how to move forward on this contested issue. \c\cAny reform of the Security Council would require the agreement of at least two-thirds of UN member states in a vote in the General Assembly and must be ratified by two-thirds of Member States. All of the permanent members of the UNSC (which have veto rights) must also agree. \c\cThe composition of the Security Council was established in 1945. Since then the geopolitical realities have changed drastically, but the council has changed very little. The victors of World War II shaped the United Nations Charter in their national interests, assigning themselves the permanent seats and associated veto power, among themselves. Any reform of the Security Council would require an amendment to the Charter. Article 108 of the Charter states:\c\cWith the enlargement of the United Nations membership and increasing self-confidence among the new members, going hand in hand with processes of decolonization, old structures and procedures were increasingly challenged. The imbalance between the number of seats in the Security Council and the total number of member States became evident, and the only significant reform of the Security Council occurred in 1965: this included an increase in the non-permanent membership from six to 10 members. With Boutros Boutros-Ghali elected as Secretary-General in 1992, the reform discussions of the UN Security Council were launched again as he started his new term with the first-ever summit of the Security Council and then published "An Agenda for Peace". His motivation was to restructure the composition and arguably anachronistic procedures of the UN organ to recognize the changed world. In the twenty-first century, the mismatch between the structure of the UN Security Council and the global reality the former is supposed to reflect became even more glaring. So much so that demands were raised by many politicians, diplomats and scholars to reform the Council at the earliest so that it reflects the reality of the present times and not the time of its establishment. For example, Indian scholar of diplomacy Rejaul Karim Laskar argues, "for the continued existence and relevance of the UN, it is necessary to ensure that it represents as nearly as possible the reality of the power equation of the twenty-first century world". \c\cBy 1992, Japan and Germany had become the second- and third-largest financial contributors to the United Nations, and started to demand a permanent seat. Also Brazil (fifth largest country in terms of territory) and India (second largest country in terms of population) as the most powerful countries within their regional groups and key players within their regions saw themselves with a permanent seat. This group of four countries formed an interest group later known as the G4. \c\cOn the other hand, their regional rivals were opposed to the G4 becoming permanent members with a veto power. They favored the expansion of the non-permanent category of seats with members to be elected on a regional basis. Italy, Pakistan, Mexico and Egypt started to form an interest group, known as the "Coffee Club" and later "Uniting for Consensus". \c\cSimultaneously, the African Group started to demand two permanent seats for themselves, on the basis of historical injustices and because much of the council's agenda is concentrated in that continent. Those two seats would be permanent African seats, that would rotate between African countries chosen by the African group. \c\cThe existing permanent members, each holding the right of veto on Security Council reform, announced their positions reluctantly. The United States supported the permanent membership of Japan and India, and a small number of additional non-permanent members. The United Kingdom and France essentially supported the G4 position, with the expansion of permanent and non-permanent members and the accession of Germany, Brazil, India, and Japan to permanent-member status, as well as more African countries on the council. China supported the stronger representation of developing countries, voicing support for India. Russia has also endorsed India's candidature for a permanent seat on the Security Council. \c\cThe General Assembly Task Force on Security Council Reform has delivered a report (on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council) recommending a compromise solution for entering intergovernmental negotiations on reform. \c\cThe report builds on existing transitional/intermediary approaches to suggest a "timeline perspective". The "timeline perspective" suggests that Member States begin by identifying the negotiables to be included in short-term intergovernmental negotiations. Crucial to the "timeline perspective" is the scheduling of a mandatory review conference—a forum for discussing changes to any reforms achieved in the near-term, and for revisiting negotiables that cannot be agreed upon now. \c\cOn 21 March 2005, the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on the UN to reach a consensus on expanding the council to 24 members, in a plan referred to as "InLarger Freedom". He gave two alternatives for implementation, but did not specify which proposal he preferred. \c\cThe two options mentioned by Annan are referred to as Plan A and Plan B:\c\cPlan A calls for creating six new permanent members, plus three new nonpermanent members for a total of 24 seats in the council. \c\cPlan B calls for creating eight new seats in a new class of members, who would serve for four years, subject to renewal, plus one nonpermanent seat, also for a total of 24. \c\cIn any case, Annan favored making the decision quickly, stating, "This important issue has been discussed for too long. I believe member states should agree to take a decision on it—preferably by consensus, but in any case before the summit—making use of one or other of the options presented in the report of the High-Level Panel". \c\cThe summit mentioned by Annan is the September 2005 Millennium+5 Summit, a high-level plenary meeting that reviewed Annan's report, the implementation of the 2000 Millennium Declaration, and other UN reform-related issues. \c\cOn 26 July 2005, five UN member countries, Italy, Argentina, Canada, Colombia and Pakistan, representing a larger group of countries called Uniting for Consensus led by Italy, proposed to the General Assembly another project that maintains five permanent members and raises the number of non-permanent members to 20. \c\cIn May 2011, 120 UN members states participated in a Uniting for Consensus meeting in Rome. \c\cOne proposed change is to admit more permanent members. The candidates usually mentioned are Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan. They comprise the group of G4 nations, mutually supporting one another's bids for permanent seats. The United Kingdom, France, Russia and the United States support G4 membership in the U.N. Security Council. This sort of reform has traditionally been opposed by the Uniting for Consensus group, which is composed primarily of nations who are regional rivals and economic competitors of the G4. The group is led by Pakistan (opposing India), Italy and Spain (opposing Germany), Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina (opposing Brazil), and South Korea (opposing Japan), in addition to Turkey, Indonesia and others. Since 1992, Italy and other members of the group have instead proposed semi-permanent seats or the expansion of the number of temporary seats. \c\cMost of the leading candidates for permanent membership are regularly elected onto the Security Council by their respective continental groups: Japan was elected for eleven two-year terms, Brazil for ten terms, and Germany for four terms (as well as West Germany two times, and East Germany once). India has been elected to the council eight times in total, with the most recent successful bid being in 2021-22 after a gap of ten years from 2010 to 2011. \c\cIn 2017, it was reported that the G4 nations were willing to temporarily forgo veto power if granted a permanent UNSC seat. As of 2013, the current P5 members of the Security Council, along with the G4, account for eight of the world's ten largest defence budgets, according to SIPRI. They also account for 9 of the 10 largest economies by both nominal GDP and Purchasing Power Parity GDP. \c\cBrazil is the largest country in Latin America in terms of population, GDP and land area. It has the seventh largest population, ninth largest GDP, eleventh largest defence budget, and has the fifth largest land area in the world. It is one of only five countries that ranks among the top ten globally in terms of physical size, population, and GDP (the others being fellow G4 member India, together with China, Russia and the United States). Furthermore, South America is one of three inhabited continents (the other two being Africa and Oceania) without permanent representation on the Security Council. \c\cBrazil has been elected ten times to the Security Council. It has contributed troops to UN peacekeeping efforts in the Middle East, the former Belgian Congo, Cyprus, Mozambique, Angola, and more recently East Timor and Haiti. Brazil is one of the main contributors to the UN regular budget. \c\cPrior to the UN's founding in 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt lobbied for Brazil to be included on the Security Council, but the UK and the Soviet Union refused. The United States has sent strong indications to Brazil that it was willing to support its membership; albeit, without a veto. In June 2011, the Council on Foreign Relations recommended that the U.S. government fully endorse the inclusion of Brazil as a permanent member of the Security Council. \c\cBrazil has received backing from four of the current permanent members, namely France, Russia, United Kingdom and China. Brazilian elevation to permanent membership is also supported by the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), and Brazil and the other G4 nations mutually support each other in their bids. Other countries that advocate permanent Brazilian membership of the UNSC include Australia, Chile, Finland, Guatemala, Indonesia, the Philippines, Slovenia, South Africa, and Vietnam. \c\cGermany is the third largest contributor to the U.N. regular budgets next to Japan, and as such, argues for a permanent Security Council seat. Germany has been elected to the Security Council as a non-permanent member four times as a unified state, as well as three times when it was divided (twice for the West, once for the East). \c\cFrance has explicitly called for a permanent seat in the UN for its close partner: "Germany's engagement, its ranking as a great power, its international influence—France would like to see them recognized with a permanent seat on the Security Council", French president Jacques Chirac said in a speech in Berlin in 2000. The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany's bid. Former President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines also expressed his country's support for Germany's bid, together with Japan's. Italy and the Netherlands on the contrary, suggest a common European Union seat in the Council instead of Germany becoming the third European member next to France and the United Kingdom. The former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Germany would also accept a common European seat, but as long as there is little sign that France will give up her own seat, Germany should also have a seat. \c\cThe German campaign for a permanent seat was intensified in 2004. Schröder made himself perfectly clear in August 2004: "Germany has the right to a seat." Its bid is supported by Japan, India, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and Russia, among other countries. Current German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had initially been quiet on the issue, re-stated Germany's bid in her address to the UN General Assembly in September 2007. In July 2011, Merkel's trip to Kenya, Angola, and Nigeria was thought to be motivated, in part, by the goal of seeking support from African countries for Germany's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council. \c\cIndia, which joined the U.N. in 1945 (during the British Raj), two years before independence in 1947, is the second-largest and one of the largest constant contributors of troops to the United Nations peacekeeping missions. Foreign Policy magazine states that, "India's international identity has long been shaped by its role in U.N. peacekeeping, with more than 100,000 Indian troops having served in U.N. missions during the past 50 years. Today, India has over 8,500 peacekeepers in the field, more than twice as many as the U.N.'s five big powers combined." In November 2010, then US President Barack Obama publicly supported India's bid for a permanent seat, citing India's "long history as a leading contributor to United Nations peacekeeping missions". India has been elected eight times to the UN Security Council, most recently from 2021 to 2022 after receiving 184 of 192 votes. \c\cThe country currently has the world's second-largest population and is the world's largest liberal democracy. It is also the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and third-largest by purchasing power parity. Currently, India maintains the world's second-largest active armed force (after China) and is a nuclear-weapon state. The International Herald Tribune has stated: "Clearly, a seat for India would make the body more representative and democratic. With India as a member, the Council would be a more legitimate and thus a more effective body." Thomas Friedman of the New York Times said: "Sometimes I wish that the five permanent members of the UN Security Council could be chosen ... with a vote by the fans . ... Then the perm-five would be Russia, China, India, Britain and the United States ... India is the world's largest democracy."\c\cIndia's bid for permanent member of UNSC is now backed by four of the five permanent members, namely France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States. On 15 April 2011, China officially expressed its support for an increased Indian role at the United Nations, without explicitly endorsing India's Security Council ambitions. A few months later, China endorsed Indian candidacy as a permanent UNSC member provided that India revokes its support for Japanese candidacy. \c\cAs part of the G4 nations, India is supported by Brazil, Germany, and Japan for the permanent seat. Other countries that explicitly and openly support India for UNSC permanent seat are – Afghanistan, Armenia, Australia, The Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brunei, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Chile, Comoros, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, Ghana, Greece, Guyana, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Jamaica, Laos, Lesotho Liberia, Libya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Micronesia, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Rwanda, Qatar, Romania, Serbia, Senegal, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Slovakia, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, Zambia and Zimbabwe. As a whole, the African Union also supports India's candidacy for permanent member of the UNSC. \c\cJapan, which joined the UN in 1956, is the third-largest contributor to the UN's regular budget. Its payments had surpassed the sum of those of the United Kingdom, France, China and Russia combined for nearly two decades before 2010. Japan has been one of the largest Official development assistance donor countries. Thus, Japan, along with India, are considered the most likely candidates for two of the new permanent seats. China has stated that it was ready to support India's move for a permanent seat on the UNSC if India did not associate its bid with Japan. This may be contrary to the Indian stand since Japan and India are both members of the G4 and support each other's candidature. Japan has been elected to the Security Council for eleven terms as a non-permanent member. \c\cWhile U.S. Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, speaking at Sophia University in Tokyo, said, "Japan has earned its honorable place among the nations of the world by its own effort and its own character. That's why the United States unambiguously supports a permanent seat for Japan on the United Nations Security Council." Her predecessor, Colin Powell, had objected to Japanese permanent membership because Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution forbids the country from going to war unless in self-defence. \c\cSome other Asian nations have expressed support for Japan's application, including Mongolia, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Vietnam[citation needed]—all major recipients of loan and/or foreign investment from Japan.[citation needed] The other G4 countries—Germany, Brazil, and India, who are also bidding for Security Council seats—along with France and the United Kingdom, also back Japan's bid. Australia, the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu support Japan since Japan agreed to increase financial aid to the region. \c\cFor instance, Katsuyuki Kawai, then secretary for foreign affairs, member of the Japanese parliament, and special envoy to Nepal, was sent to Kathmandu to lobby for the Nepalese government's support for Japanese membership in the UNSC. Kawai met with King Gyanendra and told the press, "If Japan loses its bid this time, Japanese people will think the support Japan has been providing to the world for the last 60 years has been futile." Japan donates significantly to Nepal. \c\cThe UNSC "power of veto" is frequently cited as a major problem within the UN. By wielding their veto power (established by Chapter V of the United Nations Charter), any of the UNSC's five permanent members can prevent the adoption of any (non-"procedural") UNSC draft resolution not to their liking. Even the mere threat of a veto may lead to changes in the text of a resolution, or it being withheld altogether (the so-called "pocket veto"). As a result, the power of veto often prevents the council from acting to address pressing international issues and affords the "P5" great influence within the UN institution as a whole. \c\cFor example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on most major Cold War conflicts, including the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–Afghan War. Resolutions addressing more current problems, such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine or Iran's suspected development of nuclear weapons, are also heavily influenced by the veto, whether its actual use or the threat of its use.[citation needed] Additionally, the veto applies to the selection of the UN's Secretary-General, as well as any amendments to the UN Charter, giving the P5 great influence over these processes. China has exercised its veto several times on India's resolutions to put Masood Azhar on a list of global terrorists. Azhar is the head of Jaish-e-Mohammed, which has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations. \c\cDiscussions on improving the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include reform of the UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting the use of the veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold. \c\cPursuant to United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377 (Uniting for Peace), in cases where the Security Council, "because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures, including in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression the use of armed force when necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security."\c\cIn 2013, France proposed self-regulation by the five permanent members of the Security Council to refrain using against to stop mass atrocities. \c\cAs stated by then President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva at the General Debate of the 63rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly:\c\cAs stated by the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro in a state visit to India:\c\cAs per the official website of India's Permanent Mission to the UN:\c\cAccording to a formal statement by 13th Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh at the General Debate of the 59th Session of the United Nations General Assembly:\c\cAccording to a formal statement by 14th Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi at the General Debate of the 69th Session of the United Nations General Assembly:\c\cAs per the official letter send to president of UN general assembly \c\cby India's Permanent Mission to the UN:\c\cIt also included the common letter send by G4 nations which demands concrete action on UNSC reforms.

Since 1992, Italy and other members of the group have instead proposed semi-permanent seats or the expansion of the number of temporary seats. \c\cMost of the leading candidates for permanent membership are regularly elected onto the Security Council by their respective continental groups: Japan was elected for eleven two-year terms, Brazil for ten terms, and Germany for four terms (as well as West Germany two times, and East Germany once). India has been elected to the council eight times in total, with the most recent successful bid being in 2021-22 after a gap of ten years from 2010 to 2011. \c\cIn 2017, it was reported that the G4 nations were willing to temporarily forgo veto power if granted a permanent UNSC seat. As of 2013, the current P5 members of the Security Council, along with the G4, account for eight of the world's ten largest defence budgets, according to SIPRI. They also account for 9 of the 10 largest economies by both nominal GDP and Purchasing Power Parity GDP. \c\cBrazil is the largest country in Latin America in terms of population, GDP and land area. It has the seventh largest population, ninth largest GDP, eleventh largest defence budget, and has the fifth largest land area in the world. It is one of only five countries that ranks among the top ten globally in terms of physical size, population, and GDP (the others being fellow G4 member India, together with China, Russia and the United States). Furthermore, South America is one of three inhabited continents (the other two being Africa and Oceania) without permanent representation on the Security Council. \c\cBrazil has been elected ten times to the Security Council. It has contributed troops to UN peacekeeping efforts in the Middle East, the former Belgian Congo, Cyprus, Mozambique, Angola, and more recently East Timor and Haiti. Brazil is one of the main contributors to the UN regular budget. \c\cPrior to the UN's founding in 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt lobbied for Brazil to be included on the Security Council, but the UK and the Soviet Union refused. The United States has sent strong indications to Brazil that it was willing to support its membership; albeit, without a veto. In June 2011, the Council on Foreign Relations recommended that the U.S. government fully endorse the inclusion of Brazil as a permanent member of the Security Council. \c\cBrazil has received backing from four of the current permanent members, namely France, Russia, United Kingdom and China. Brazilian elevation to permanent membership is also supported by the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), and Brazil and the other G4 nations mutually support each other in their bids. Other countries that advocate permanent Brazilian membership of the UNSC include Australia, Chile, Finland, Guatemala, Indonesia, the Philippines, Slovenia, South Africa, and Vietnam. \c\cGermany is the third largest contributor to the U.N. regular budgets next to Japan, and as such, argues for a permanent Security Council seat. Germany has been elected to the Security Council as a non-permanent member four times as a unified state, as well as three times when it was divided (twice for the West, once for the East). \c\cFrance has explicitly called for a permanent seat in the UN for its close partner: "Germany's engagement, its ranking as a great power, its international influence—France would like to see them recognized with a permanent seat on the Security Council", French president Jacques Chirac said in a speech in Berlin in 2000. The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany's bid. Former President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines also expressed his country's support for Germany's bid, together with Japan's. Italy and the Netherlands on the contrary, suggest a common European Union seat in the Council instead of Germany becoming the third European member next to France and the United Kingdom. The former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Germany would also accept a common European seat, but as long as there is little sign that France will give up her own seat, Germany should also have a seat. \c\cThe German campaign for a permanent seat was intensified in 2004. Schröder made himself perfectly clear in August 2004: "Germany has the right to a seat." Its bid is supported by Japan, India, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and Russia, among other countries. Current German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had initially been quiet on the issue, re-stated Germany's bid in her address to the UN General Assembly in September 2007. In July 2011, Merkel's trip to Kenya, Angola, and Nigeria was thought to be motivated, in part, by the goal of seeking support from African countries for Germany's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council. \c\cIndia, which joined the U.N. in 1945 (during the British Raj), two years before independence in 1947, is the second-largest and one of the largest constant contributors of troops to the United Nations peacekeeping missions. Foreign Policy magazine states that, "India's international identity has long been shaped by its role in U.N. peacekeeping, with more than 100,000 Indian troops having served in U.N. missions during the past 50 years. Today, India has over 8,500 peacekeepers in the field, more than twice as many as the U.N.'s five big powers combined." In November 2010, then US President Barack Obama publicly supported India's bid for a permanent seat, citing India's "long history as a leading contributor to United Nations peacekeeping missions". India has been elected eight times to the UN Security Council, most recently from 2021 to 2022 after receiving 184 of 192 votes. \c\cThe country currently has the world's second-largest population and is the world's largest liberal democracy. It is also the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and third-largest by purchasing power parity. Currently, India maintains the world's second-largest active armed force (after China) and is a nuclear-weapon state. The International Herald Tribune has stated: "Clearly, a seat for India would make the body more representative and democratic. With India as a member, the Council would be a more legitimate and thus a more effective body." Thomas Friedman of the New York Times said: "Sometimes I wish that the five permanent members of the UN Security Council could be chosen ... with a vote by the fans . ... Then the perm-five would be Russia, China, India, Britain and the United States ... India is the world's largest democracy."\c\cIndia's bid for permanent member of UNSC is now backed by four of the five permanent members, namely France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States. On 15 April 2011, China officially expressed its support for an increased Indian role at the United Nations, without explicitly endorsing India's Security Council ambitions. A few months later, China endorsed Indian candidacy as a permanent UNSC member provided that India revokes its support for Japanese candidacy. \c\cAs part of the G4 nations, India is supported by Brazil, Germany, and Japan for the permanent seat. Other countries that explicitly and openly support India for UNSC permanent seat are – Afghanistan, Armenia, Australia, The Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brunei, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Chile, Comoros, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, Ghana, Greece, Guyana, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Jamaica, Laos, Lesotho Liberia, Libya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Micronesia, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Rwanda, Qatar, Romania, Serbia, Senegal, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Slovakia, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, Zambia and Zimbabwe. As a whole, the African Union also supports India's candidacy for permanent member of the UNSC. \c\cJapan, which joined the UN in 1956, is the third-largest contributor to the UN's regular budget. Its payments had surpassed the sum of those of the United Kingdom, France, China and Russia combined for nearly two decades before 2010. Japan has been one of the largest Official development assistance donor countries. Thus, Japan, along with India, are considered the most likely candidates for two of the new permanent seats. China has stated that it was ready to support India's move for a permanent seat on the UNSC if India did not associate its bid with Japan. This may be contrary to the Indian stand since Japan and India are both members of the G4 and support each other's candidature. Japan has been elected to the Security Council for eleven terms as a non-permanent member. \c\cWhile U.S. Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, speaking at Sophia University in Tokyo, said, "Japan has earned its honorable place among the nations of the world by its own effort and its own character. That's why the United States unambiguously supports a permanent seat for Japan on the United Nations Security Council." Her predecessor, Colin Powell, had objected to Japanese permanent membership because Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution forbids the country from going to war unless in self-defence. \c\cSome other Asian nations have expressed support for Japan's application, including Mongolia, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Vietnam[citation needed]—all major recipients of loan and/or foreign investment from Japan.[citation needed] The other G4 countries—Germany, Brazil, and India, who are also bidding for Security Council seats—along with France and the United Kingdom, also back Japan's bid. Australia, the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu support Japan since Japan agreed to increase financial aid to the region. \c\cFor instance, Katsuyuki Kawai, then secretary for foreign affairs, member of the Japanese parliament, and special envoy to Nepal, was sent to Kathmandu to lobby for the Nepalese government's support for Japanese membership in the UNSC. Kawai met with King Gyanendra and told the press, "If Japan loses its bid this time, Japanese people will think the support Japan has been providing to the world for the last 60 years has been futile." Japan donates significantly to Nepal. \c\cThe UNSC "power of veto" is frequently cited as a major problem within the UN. By wielding their veto power (established by Chapter V of the United Nations Charter), any of the UNSC's five permanent members can prevent the adoption of any (non-"procedural") UNSC draft resolution not to their liking. Even the mere threat of a veto may lead to changes in the text of a resolution, or it being withheld altogether (the so-called "pocket veto"). As a result, the power of veto often prevents the council from acting to address pressing international issues and affords the "P5" great influence within the UN institution as a whole. \c\cFor example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on most major Cold War conflicts, including the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–Afghan War. Resolutions addressing more current problems, such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine or Iran's suspected development of nuclear weapons, are also heavily influenced by the veto, whether its actual use or the threat of its use.[citation needed] Additionally, the veto applies to the selection of the UN's Secretary-General, as well as any amendments to the UN Charter, giving the P5 great influence over these processes. China has exercised its veto several times on India's resolutions to put Masood Azhar on a list of global terrorists. Azhar is the head of Jaish-e-Mohammed, which has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations. \c\cDiscussions on improving the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include reform of the UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting the use of the veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold. \c\cPursuant to United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377 (Uniting for Peace), in cases where the Security Council, "because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures, including in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression the use of armed force when necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security."\c\cIn 2013, France proposed self-regulation by the five permanent members of the Security Council to refrain using against to stop mass atrocities. \c\cAs stated by then President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva at the General Debate of the 63rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly:\c\cAs stated by the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro in a state visit to India:\c\cAs per the official website of India's Permanent Mission to the UN:\c\cAccording to a formal statement by 13th Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh at the General Debate of the 59th Session of the United Nations General Assembly:\c\cAccording to a formal statement by 14th Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi at the General Debate of the 69th Session of the United Nations General Assembly:\c\cAs per the official letter send to president of UN general assembly \c\cby India's Permanent Mission to the UN:\c\cIt also included the common letter send by G4 nations which demands concrete action on UNSC reforms.

The Allied Democratic Forces insurgency is an ongoing conflict waged by the Allied Democratic Forces in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, against the governments of those two countries and the MONUSCO. The insurgency began in 1995, intensifying in 2013, resulting in hundreds of deaths. The ADF is known to currently control a number of hidden camps which are home to about 2,000 people; in these camps, the ADF operates as proto-state with "an internal security service, a prison, health clinics, and an orphanage" as well as schools for boys and girls. \c\cThe ADF was formed by Jamil Mukulu, an ultra conservative Ugandan Muslim, belonging to the Tablighi Jamaat group. Mukulu was born as David Steven and was baptised as a Catholic, later converting to Islam, adopting a Muslim name and becoming radicalised. He reportedly spent the early 1990s in Khartoum, Sudan, coming into personal contact with Osama bin Laden. \c\cADF merged with the remnants of another rebel group, the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU), during the years following the fall of Idi Amin. ADF-NALU's initial goal was to overthrow Ugandan president's Yoweri Museveni government, replacing it with an Islamic fundamentalist state. The group went on to recruit former officers of the Ugandan army, as well as volunteers from Tanzania and Somalia. Funded by the illegal mining and logging industries of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, ADF created 15 well organised camps in the Rwenzori Mountains, located in the DRC-Uganda border areas. The insurgence remained unaffected by government amnesty and talk efforts, as members married local women. \c\cAccording to intelligence sources, ADF has collaborated with al-Shabaab and Lord's Resistance Army. Receiving training and logistic support, with limited direct involvement from al-Shabaab's side. Other alleged sponsors of the faction include Sudanese Islamist politician Hassan al-Turabi and former DRC president Mobutu Sese Seko. \c\cFormed in 1989, ADF carried out its first attacks in 1995. The conflict gradually intensified, culminating in the 1998 Kichwamba Technical College attack, which left 80 people dead, with 80 more being abducted. By 2002, continuous pressure from the Ugandan Army forced ADF to relocate most of its activities into the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. The insurgency continued on a smaller scale until 2013, which marked a resurgence of ADF activity, with the group launching a recruitment campaign along with numerous attacks. \c\cA report of The Congo Research Group at New York University, released in September 2017, indicted the Congolese Army commanders of orchestrating the massacres in Beni from 2014 to 2016. It cited multiple witnesses saying that army commanders, including the former top general in the zone, supported and in some cases organized the killings. Sources told it that during some massacres, soldiers secured the perimeter so that victims could not escape. It stated that the first massacres were orchestrated in 2013 by former leaders of the rebel group Popular Congolese Army (APC), which fought in the Congo War of 1998-2003 to create a new rebellion and undermine confidence in the central government of DRC. These rebels were working with ADF per the report. However, when the massacres began, the army commanders co-opted many of the networks of the local militias to weaken their rivals. \c\cOn 13 November 1996, ADF perpetrated its first large-scale attack on the towns of Bwera and Mpondwe-Lhubiriha in Kasese district, Uganda. Approximately 50 people were killed in the attack. 25,000 people fled the towns, before they were recaptured by Ugandan troops. \c\cOn 20 February 1998, ADF abducted 30 children, in the aftermath of an attack on a Seventh-Day Adventist College in Mitandi, Kasese district. \c\cOn 4 April 1998, 5 people were killed and at least 6 were wounded, when bombs exploded at two restaurants in Kampala. \c\cOn 8 June 1998, ADF rebels killed 80 students of the Kichwamba Technical College in Kabarole District, Uganda. 80 students were abducted in the same raid. \c\cIn June 1998, ADF rebels abducted over 100 school children from a school in Hoima, Uganda. \c\cIn August 1998, 30 people were killed in three separate bus bombings, perpetrated by ADF. \c\cBetween 10 April 1999 - 30 May 1999 ADF carried out seven attacks, resulting in 11 dead and 42 wounded. \c\cOn 9 December 1999, ADF attacked the Katojo prison facility, releasing 360 prisoners held for terrorism. \c\cDuring March 2007, the UPDF engaged ADF groups in multiple firefights, killing at least 46 in Bundibugyo and Mubende districts. The biggest battle occurred on March 27, when the UPDF faced an estimated 60 ADF troops and killed 34, including three senior commanders. The UPDF claimed to have retrieved numerous weapons as well as documents that tie the ADF to the LRA. \c\cOn 13 April 2007, the UPDF and ADF engaged in an intense battle inside the Semuliki National Park, near the upscale Semliki Lodge tourist destination. \c\cCeasefire and amnesty talks between the government of Uganda and the ADF were held in Nairobi starting in May 2008. Negotiations were complicated by the fragmentation of the ADF's leadership. Non-combatant dependents of the ADF were repatriated to Uganda by the IOM. At least 48 ADF fighters surrendered and were given amnesty. As the threat from the LRA in the DRC waned, the UPDF put increasing focus on the ADF as a reason for UPDF personnel to remain in the DRC. \c\cOn 4 December 2007, 200 ADF and NALU militants surrendered to Ugandan authorities. \c\cBetween February 2012 to March 2012, over 60 ADF insurgents were arrested within Uganda. \c\cOn 24 January 2013, insurgents tortured and later executed 13 people who were previously abducted from the city of Oicha, North Kivu. \c\cIn April 2013, it was reported that ADF started a recruitment campaign in Kampala and other parts of the country. Citing a defector from ADF, "allAfrica" reported that some 10 new recruits joined ADF forces every day. \c\cIn July 2013, the ADF renewed its fighting in the Congolese district of Beni. According to the UN Radio Okapi, the ADF together with the NALU, fought a pitched battle with the FARD, briefly taking the towns of Mamundioma and Totolito. On July 11, the ADF attacked the town of Kamango, triggering the flight of over 60,000 refugees across the border into the Ugandan district of Bundibugyo. \c\cEarly in September 2013, regional leaders under the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) asked the recently formed combative Intervention Brigade under MONUSCO to attack positions of foreign negative forces operating in DRC, including the ADF. \c\cOn 23 September 2013, 3 people were killed during an ADF attack in the Watalinga Sector, North Kivu, DRC. \c\cOn 27 September 2013, ADF militants killed five and abducted 30 people in an attack on a health center in the city of Maleki, DRC. \c\cOn 23 October 2013, ADF guerrillas abducted 26 people from the village of Upira, North Kivu, later transferring them to the rebel strongholds of Makembi and Chuchubo. \c\cIn the period between November 2012 and November 2013, ADF carried out 300 kidnappings. \c\cOn 14 December 2013, 13 people were killed, in the aftermath of an ADF attack on the Musuku village, Uganda. \c\cOn 15 December 2013, ADF killed eight people in the Biangolo village, Uganda. \c\cOn 25 December 2013, ADF rebels attacked the city of Kamango, DRC. Over 50 civilians were killed and many buildings were burnt down. The city was retaken by the Congolese army the following day. \c\cOn 29 December 2013, ADF rebels launched another attack on the city of Kamango. The ADF militants beheaded 21 civilians and urged the residents of the city to flee to Uganda. \c\cOn 17 January 2014, the Congolese army drove ADF militants soldiers out of the city of Beni, with the aid of UN's “Intervention Brigade” peace corps. \c\cOn 17 February 2014, a Congolese army spokesman announced that the military had killed 230 ADF rebels in the aftermath of a monthlong offensive, 23 FARDC soldiers were also killed in the operation. \c\cOn 23 March 2014, South African helicopters struck ADF forces for the first time, in support of Operation Sukola 1. \c\cBetween 5–8 October 2014, ADF militants killed 15 people, within the North Kivu province, DRC. \c\cOn 15 October 2014, ADF rebels killed 27 people in an attack on villages, located outside Beni. \c\cOn 18 October 2014, ADF insurgents killed over 20 people, in an attack on the village of Byalos, DRC. \c\cOn 31 October 2014, a crowd stoned to death, burned and then ate a suspected ADF insurgent in the town of Beni. The incident came after a number of ADF raids, that brought the October's civilian death toll to over 100 people. \c\cOn 20 November 2014, rebels disguised as Congolese soldiers killed between 50 and 80 people near Beni. \c\cOn 8 December 2014, militants hacked to death 36 civilians in the vicinity of Beni. \c\cOn 26 December 2014, an ADF attack resulted in the deaths of 11 people, in the village of Ndumi, Ituri. \c\cOn 4 January 2015, a joint MONUSCO - FARDC offensive forced ADF militants out of the Mavure village, North Kivu. One rebel was killed, as government forces seized large amounts of drugs and training materials. \c\cOn 5 February 2015, ADF carried out a night raid on the city of Beni hacking to death 23 people and injuring one. \c\cOn 9 March 2015, ADF rebels killed one and injured two civilians in the area of the Semliki bridge, North Kivu. \c\cOn 15 April 2015, an ADF attack on the villages of Matiba and Kinzika, Beni-Mbau sector, DRC, led to the deaths of 18 people. \c\cOn 23 April 2015, ADF rebels massacred five civilians in the village of Kalongo, 6 km northwest of Oïcha. \c\cOn 30 April 2015, the Ugandan media reported that the ADF's leader, Jamil Mukulu, had been arrested in Tanzania. \c\cOn 8 May 2015, suspected ADF guerrillas attacked the Matembo neighborhood of the town of Mulekere, North Kivu. Seven people were slain in the attack bringing the region's 2015 death toll to over 300 casualties. \c\cIn early December 2015, the ADF seized a MONUSCO base in North Kivu, killing a Malawian UN soldier in doing so. South African UN forces later retook the base, attacking with Rooivalk attack helicopters. \c\c29 February - Thirteen civilians were killed by suspected Ugandan rebels in the Beni territory in eastern DRC. The killings took place in the village of Ntombi, located about 40 km northeast of Beni, an area massacres and recurrent attacks attributed to Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel group opposed to the Ugandan government and is considered a terrorist organisation. \c\c20 March - A priest of the Congregation of Caracholine Nyamilima was shot and critically wounded like his driver and a child present in the same car. The attackers was the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel group opposed to the Ugandan government and is considered a terrorist organisation\c\cIn early May 2016, assailants from the ADF armed with machetes hacked at least 16 civilians to death in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. \c\cAccording to the Congolese military, at least nine people were hacked to death in an ADF attack in a village 30 km north of Beni in July 2016. \c\cThe ADF has been blamed for the Beni massacre. \c\c7 October - ADF fighters ambush a group of state officials near Beni, killing 22. \c\c8 October - The ADF attacks a UN base in Goma, killing two peacekeepers and wounding 12. \c\c8 December - Hundreds of ADF insurgents launch a coordinated attack on a UN base in North Kivu province, killing at least 15 UN peacekeepers and five Congolese soldiers in a protracted, hours-long gun battle before finally withdrawing. 72 insurgents are also killed in the firefight. \c\c15 January - Three Democratic Republic of Congo soldiers were killed while repelling an attack in the eastern Beni region by ADF Ugandan extremist rebels.

More than 15 others were reported missing after the attacks and probably kidnapped by the attackers. \c\c8 September - Muhammad Kirumira, the former police commissioner for Congo's Buyende District, is gunned down by several assassins. A female friend of Kirumira's is also killed in the attack. In 2019, Congolese authorities link the attack to the ADF and arrest two suspects. A third suspect dies in a shootout with police on September 28. \c\c4 October - ADF militants attacked an army outpost in Beni, Democratic Republic of Congo killing at least 6 people. \c\c3 November - Allied Democratic Forces Rebels killed at least 7 people and abducted 15 others including 10 children in raids and attacks in the DRC's North Kivu province. \c\c16 November - An ADF ambush near Beni, DRC, leaves 8 UN peacekeepers and 12 Congolese soldiers dead and 10 peacekeepers wounded.

The controversial bans of recreational boating and travel to vacation homes were removed, while non-medical grade face coverings in public became mandatory starting April 26. Several businesses and sections of stores were allowed to reopen, including those gardening supplies and paint, as well as golf courses, but Airbnb rentals were banned. The next stay-at-home order modified some of the restrictions from previous orders and allowed manufacturing to restart on May 11. On April 27, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order placing several new regulations on restaurant and grocery stores and their employees. \c\cOn May 18, Governor Whitmer announced bars and restaurant dining rooms in the Northern Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula would be allowed to open on May 22. She later announced retail stores and auto dealerships may reopen on May 26 and nonessential medical, dental, and veterinary procedures may begin on May 29. \c\cOn May 22, Governor Whitmer extended the stay-at-home order until June 12 and the state of emergency until June 19. \c\cOn June 1, Governor Whitmer lifted the stay-at-home order, and also announced that restaurants and bars would be allowed to reopen statewide on June 8. \c\cOn July 14, Governor Whitmer extended the state of emergency again until August 11. \c\cA month later Whitmer issued a new order to expire September 4. A later emergency order expired October 27. \c\cFacing a COVID-19 surge in the state in April, Governor Whitmer hoped to avoid more mandatory shutdowns and asked Michigan residents on April 9 to take more "personal responsibility," while asking the White House to send more vaccine doses. The request for vaccines was denied, in large part because the protection provided by vaccines activates only after several weeks while the need to prevent new infections was immediate. On April 12, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky argued that asking for voluntary quarantine would not be enough. She said that Michigan needed "to really close things down, to go back to our basics, to go back to where we were last spring, last summer, and to shut things down."\c\cDuring the week of March 16, 2020, Michigan Medicine started in-house testing for COVID-19, with the capabilities to deliver same-day results. This allowed the hospital to bypass the state's testing system, which was previously the sole provider of testing for the virus. The same week, the health system also launched drive-thru testing services for Michigan Medicine patients at West Ann Arbor Health Center, Brighton Health Center, and Canton Health Center. \c\cSimilarly, Beaumont Health and Henry Ford Health System in Metro Detroit also developed in-house testing methods in an effort to increase overall testing capacity within the state. On March 27, 2020, a regional drive-up testing center opened in Detroit, at the vacant State Fairgrounds site. A partnership between Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties, the city of Detroit, and three regional health systems, the center is able to test up to 400 residents a day, who are referred to the site from their doctor via scheduled appointments. The state restructured reporting procedures and began incorporating private test results in official government case tallies on March 19, 2020. On April 15, 2020, Hurley Medical Center in Flint opened a mobile testing clinic at Atwood Stadium, with capacity for at least 250 people per day. Testing is provided to those with orders from a doctor and is not open to the general public. Similar drive-thru testing facilities opened in Atlanta, Bad Axe, Battle Creek, Bay City, Benton Harbor, Dearborn, Grand Rapids, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Saginaw, and Traverse City. \c\cThe state health department released case counts and death tolls daily and updated recovered cases weekly. Reviews of the outcomes of reported COVID cases led to the discovery of unrecorded deaths on multiple occasions. These deaths were added to the daily toll when discovered, with the result that daily reported deaths did not always indicate the current state of the epidemic. Recovery from the disease was defined simply as surviving 30 days after first symptoms, with no review of actual health or hospitalization status. Starting May 29, 2020, families could get tested together in Kalamazoo. \c\cStarting April 13, 2020, new testing sites opened in Atlanta, Bad Axe, Bay City, Battle Creek, Benton Harbor, Detroit, Flint, Jackson, Kalamazoo, and Traverse City. \c\cMichigan airports received a combined $256 million in federal aid to help ease economic hardship from the coronavirus crisis, funded by the CARES Act. \c\cStarting March 13, 2020, Delta Air Lines, which has a major hub at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said it would cancel all flights to Europe for 30 days, decreasing flights by 40% and grounding 300 planes. Delta had previously indicated it would reduce international flights by 20–25% and domestic flights by 10–15%. On April 28, Delta announced it was suspending flights to and from Flint, Lansing, and Kalamazoo and several other small hub airports across the country after losing $534 million in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic. American Airlines ended service to 15 small airports, including Kalamazoo, starting October 7. \c\cStarting on March 15, 2020, several grocery chains that have stores in Michigan, including Kroger, Meijer, and Walmart, began reducing their business hours for cleaning and restocking in response to the pandemic. Similarly, Michigan-based Meijer reported a plan to hire 40–50 new seasonal employees per store to help meet public demand during the outbreak. Kroger announced that, starting the morning of March 23, all of its Michigan stores would be dedicating the first hour of business on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to seniors, expectant mothers, first responders, and those with compromised immune systems. The following week, Kroger announced it would hire up to 2,000 people in Michigan in response to the pandemic. \c\cThe 2020 North American International Auto Show in Detroit was canceled on March 29, due to the use of its venue TCF Center as a FEMA facility. \c\cMichigan-based automotive manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler announced plans to gradually shut down plants starting March 19 with all plants closed by the end of the month. \c\cOn March 30, Ford announced it will convert its Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti to produce GE/Airon Corporation Model A-E ventilators. It says it will produce 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days. \c\cOn April 1, 2020, General Motors announced it will produce 30,000  V+Pro critical care ventilators for the national stockpile. \c\cOn the morning of March 16, Governor Whitmer announced a temporary order to close all bars and restaurants in the state to sit-down service, effective at 3 pm the same evening until March 30. Carry-out and delivery options were excluded from the order, although restaurants were urged to limit in-building carry-out services to five customers at a time. The order also included fitness centers, theaters, casinos, and other venues that encourage large assemblages of patrons, with several exceptions, such as office buildings. This order is expected to have significant economic impacts on businesses, and it prompted the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association to call for Whitmer to submit paperwork to qualify Michigan for the U.S. Small Business Administration Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. The order also expands unemployment benefits to public health workers who become ill, people who need to take time off to care for children, and others, until April 14. \c\cDomino's Pizza, which is centered in the state, anticipated hiring up to 10,000 people to help meet increased demand for food delivery services due to the pandemic, while Jet's Pizza also prepared to hire "hundreds" of additional delivery drivers for the same reason. \c\cOn June 8, Lansing restaurants reopened for dine-in service for the first time since mid-May. \c\cOn September 21, it was announced three bars in West Michigan lost their liquor licenses temporarily after they allegedly failed to enforce coronavirus mandates. \c\cOn January 22, 2021, at Governor Whitmer announced that starting on February 1, restaurants may re-open at 25% capacity with up to 100 people, tables must be six feet apart with no more than six people per table, and bars and restaurants must close by 10 p.m. Contact information must also be collected from people for contact tracing purposes. \c\cSince December 1, 21 restaurants have received COVID-19 order violations by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Six restaurants had their food license suspended – and five of the six suspensions are still in place. Another 15 businesses were sent cease-and-desist orders, which is a lesser violation. \c\cRestaurants, bars and retail stores were allowed to operate at 50% capacity starting March 5, 2021. \c\cOn March 19, the owner of a pizza restaurant in Holland was criminally charged with allowing indoor dining when it was banned, not enforcing mask rules, and ignoring capacity limits. \c\cOn March 19, the Michigan Strategic Fund unanimously voted to approve a $20 million economic relief program meant to help struggling small businesses affected by the pandemic. The Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) had processed over 1.7 million applications as of May 13, with 1.375 million people receiving benefits. The state has paid $5.62 billion in benefits since the state of emergency was declared two months prior. By June 19, UIA disbursed $11.4 billion to two million people since the coronavirus pandemic reached the state. On August 21, the Federal Emergency Management Administration approved UIA's application for funding that would provide an additional $300 per week payment to Michigan residents receiving unemployment benefits. On October 14, the federal government approved unemployment benefits for 20 more weeks, with up to 59 weeks of benefits for some workers. On October 20, Governor Whitmer signed a bill approving six more weeks of state unemployment aid. \c\cOn March 12, Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training. Four days later, they announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, which affected Michigan's team, the Detroit Tigers. On June 24, two members of the Detroit Tigers organization (later identified as pitcher Daniel Norris and a coach) tested positive for COVID-19. Norris was later cleared to join the Opening Day roster. \c\cOn June 25, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order which allows professional sports to resume in the state. Two days before, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred unilaterally implemented a 60-game season. Players reported to training camps at their regular season home stadiums on July 1 in order to resume spring training, which included inter-squad games only, and prepare for a July 23 or 24 Opening Day (July 24 for the Tigers). In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, teams only played their own division and the opposite league's corresponding geographical division, e.g. the Tigers only played the American League Central (40 games total) and National League Central (20 games total). Games were played behind closed doors, with artificial crowd noise played over loudspeakers. \c\cThe Tigers\' August 3–6 series against the St. Louis Cardinals was postponed several times after 17 of the latter's members tested positive for COVID-19, with two of the games later cancelled outright. \c\cOn March 15, 2021 Governor Whitmer increased the maximum allowed capacity of sports stadiums from 375 people to 1,000, in time for the start of the 2021 Detroit Tigers season. On June 8, Comerica Park was allowed to return to operating at full seating capacity after April and May games this season were limited to 8,000 fans. \c\cAlso on March 12, the National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days, which affected the Detroit Pistons. \c\cOn March 14, Detroit Pistons power forward Christian Wood reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. \c\cThe Pistons\' season officially ended on June 5 when they failed to make the cut for a 22-team restart. \c\cIn their 2020–21 season, the Pistons\' game against the Denver Nuggets on February 1 was postponed due to a positive test on a Detroit player, as well as the February 16 game against the San Antonio Spurs due to an outbreak on the latter team. \c\cIn the National Hockey League, the season was suspended for an indefinite amount of time starting March 12, which affected the Detroit Red Wings. \c\cThe Red Wings\' season officially ended on May 27 when they failed to make a 24-team playoff tournament. \c\cThe NHL's shortened 2020–21 season began on January 13. The regular season ran for 56 games per team, ending on May 8. \c\cOn July 27, National Football League preseason games, which usually take place in August, were cancelled by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell due to the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the Detroit Lions. \c\cSince July 30, the Lions have placed eight players on the injury list after they tested positive for COVID-19. One player's test, quarterback Matthew Stafford, was later revealed to be a false-positive and he was removed from the list on August 4. \c\cMost games in the 2020 season were played behind closed doors, with crowds at some stadiums limited to friends and families of the players, coaches, and staff members. \c\cSeveral members of the Lions coaching staff, including interim head coach Darrell Bevell, sat out the December 26 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers due to an outbreak. \c\cExecutive Order 2020–42, signed April 9, closed golf courses in the state. On April 26, golf courses were allowed to re-open, provided golfers adhere to social distancing guidelines, and stay at least six feet away from people who do not live in their home. Golf carts will not be allowed. \c\cOn May 8, golf carts were allowed back on the Michigan golf courses. \c\cThe FireKeepers Casino Hotel Championship, an LPGA Symetra Tour event, is one of the first pro sports events returning to Michigan, scheduled for July 24–26 at the Battle Creek Country Club. \c\cThe PGA Tour Champions's The Ally Challenge was played at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club in Grand Blanc Township from July 27–August 2, 2020. \c\cOn April 6, IndyCar was forced to cancel the Duel in Detroit at Belle Isle Park which were originally scheduled to be first two races of the season. The NASCAR Cup Series postponed the 2020 FireKeepers Casino 400 at Michigan International Speedway from June 5–7 to August 8. The NASCAR Xfinity Series lost their Michigan date for 2020. \c\cThe NCAA also canceled all of its remaining winter tournaments for the 2019–2020 academic year, including the 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament—whose national semi-finals and championship were scheduled to be hosted by Detroit. All spring 2020 seasons were canceled as well. \c\cOn June 1, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order that allows college teams to begin workouts and practice sessions for fall 2020 sports seasons. It allows "outdoor fitness classes, athletic practices, training sessions or games, provided that coaches, spectators and participants not from the same household maintain six feet of distance from one another at all times". \c\cOn August 8, the Mid-American Conference (MAC), which includes the Central Michigan Chippewas, Eastern Michigan Eagles, and Western Michigan Broncos, canceled all of its fall 2020 sports seasons. On September 25, the MAC reversed its previous decision on its 2020 football season, voting to play a six–game schedule which started on November 4. \c\cOn August 11, the Big Ten Conference, which includes the Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans, postponed their fall 2020 sports seasons. On September 16, however, it was announced the 2020 football season would start on October 24 with an eight-game schedule. \c\cOn August 12, the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, which is made up mostly of schools in Michigan, postponed its fall 2020 and winter 2021 sports seasons. \c\cIn the fall of 2020, the pandemic caused both the Michigan Wolverines football and Michigan State Spartans football teams to cancel their games against the Maryland Terrapins football team due to COVID-19 outbreaks. The Michigan football team's game against their arch-rival, the Ohio State Buckeyes, as well as their game against the Iowa Hawkeyes, were also canceled after an increasing number of Michigan players and staff members became infected. \c\cOn January 23, 2021 the University of Michigan (U of M) shut down all sports for two weeks after the new more infectious UK variant of COVID-19 was discovered in five individuals with ties to the school. As of April 23, 2021, 342 U of M student-athletes and 59 coaches and staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. \c\cAt the high school level, the Michigan High School Athletic Association canceled the remainder of the winter 2019-20 seasons and all of the spring 2020 seasons on April 3, 2020. \c\cOn July 17, MHSAA announced all fall sports will resume as scheduled for the 2020–21 school year with practices starting August 10 for football and August 12 for other sports. However, on July 30, they announced all preseason scrimmages would be canceled and medium and high-risk sports (soccer, volleyball and football) could start practice but a final decision on whether games would be allowed might not be made until August 20. The MHSAA postponed the football season until spring 2021. On August 20, the MHSAA announced it will be allowing soccer, volleyball and swimming to start fall competition in Michigan's region 6 and 8 in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Regions 1-5 and 7 are still pending due to the phases they are in according to the Governor's executive orders on the pandemic. Girl's golf, boys tennis and cross country in both peninsulas are able to start immediately because they are not contact sports. On September 3, the MHSAA approved the return of all fall 2020 sports. \c\cOn November 15, Governor Whitmer announced the MDHHS has ordered all high school sports to suspend activities for three weeks, effective November 18. \c\cOn April 15, a convoy of thousands of motorists drove from all over the state to protest the extension of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order. The protest, known now as Operation Gridlock, involved clogging the streets surrounding on near the Michigan State Capitol, including the Capitol Loop, with their vehicles, drawing national attention. The protest was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, a group with ties to the DeVos family, through Facebook. The Michigan Freedom Fund supported the rally by as an event co-host, spending an estimated $250 to promote the event. The Michigan Conservative Coalition is asking the governor to take a more measured approach that would allow certain parts of work and daily life to start returning to normal. The organizers urged participants to practice social distancing, and not leave their vehicles during the protest. Lt. Darren Green of the Michigan State Police estimated several thousand cars were part of the demonstration, with 100 to 150 people congregating on the Capitol lawn. “They’re doing a pretty good job of maintaining social distance," Green said. "They’re being respectful and not causing any issues at all.” Neither the Michigan State Police nor the Lansing Police Department had reported any arrests. Multiple services have been disrupted as a result of Operation Gridlock, such as the Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA) temporarily suspending their downtown route. Governor Whitmer said the protest was legal per the First Amendment's right to freedom of assembly, and understood the protesters\' anger, but warned them they were endangering their health by not following social distancing guidelines and noticed some people were not wearing personal protective equipment, including children, further adding "(It's) not a political decision, it's about public health. The enemy is the virus, not one another." President Donald Trump supported the protest on April 17 with an all-caps tweet saying "Liberate Michigan". \c\cOn April 30, a second protest occurred when hundreds of protesters, many carrying firearms, gathered at the Michigan Capitol.  Many protesters were able to enter the building.  The demonstration was organized by conservative group Michigan United for Liberty. Governor Whitmer said on April 30 that she found elements of the protest ‘disturbing.’ Also, in an appearance May 3 on CNN’s State of the Union, the governor said the Confederate flags, nooses and Nazi signs displayed were ‘outrageous’ and racist, with some depicting her as Adolf Hitler. On May 14, more armed protesters from Michigan United for Liberty gathered outside the Michigan State Capitol. The organization's Facebook group was deleted over death threats against Governor Whitmer and a fight broke out over a doll tied to a noose carried by a man who also had an axe at the protest. The Michigan Legislature closed its scheduled session to avoid the possibility of another armed confrontation inside the chamber. \c\cOn May 20, the Michigan Conservative Coalition held "Operation Haircut" on the lawn of the Capitol Building, in which barbers gave free haircuts, in support of an Owosso barber who was forced to shut down after continuing to operate until the previous week, violating the executive order closing non-essential businesses that included barbershops and beauty salons resulting in the state suspending his license. Several of the barbers at the demonstration were issued $1,000 citations by the Michigan State Police for disorderly conduct. A week later on May 27, the group from Operation Haircut delivered a letter to the Governor with a layout of safe practices to reopen. The charges against the Owosso barber were eventually dismissed. The charges against the other barbers arrested during the Operation Haircut demonstration were dismissed on February 8, 2021. \c\cA peaceful demonstration of prayers organized by the religious non-profit Transformation Michigan was performed on the Capitol lawn on May 28. \c\cA peaceful protest called "Let MI People Go" by religious group Stand Up Michigan took place on the Capitol lawn on October 8. \c\cOn December 15, a protest took place near the home of Robert Gordon, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, to oppose the new restrictions imposed by the state. \c\cDuring the summer and fall of 2020, Governor Whitmer was targeted with an alleged elaborate kidnapping plot. The plot was revealed when the Federal Bureau of Investigation thwarted it. In October 2020, fourteen members of a right-wing militia group called the Wolverine Watchmen were charged with several federal and state crimes. One of the suspects cited Whitmer's handling of the pandemic as part of their motive to kidnap her. \c\cIn April multiple lawsuits were filed challenging Whitmer's executive orders. The suits were filed by individuals, business owners, recreational fishermen, a conservation organization, and several county prosecutors. They alleged that her orders were overly broad, violated their constitutional rights, harmed businesses, and amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property rights. Governor Whitmer's third stay-at-home order, issued April 24, overturned the restrictions on recreational boating and visits to vacation homes, effectively ending some of the lawsuits. \c\cOn April 29, inmates from various Michigan prisons filed a class action lawsuit against the Michigan Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, claiming the state is violating the Eighth Amendment by subjecting inmates to cruel and unusual punishment by not taking necessary pandemic precautions. \c\cOn May 6, a group of churches sued Governor Whitmer, claiming "Executive Order 2020-70 continues to prohibit gatherings of two or more individuals, including at churches, thereby denying them the ability to hold worship services and otherwise carry out their ministry functions until May 28, 2020" violates their First Amendment right of freedom of religion. 
{"On July 4, 2021, a Lockheed C-130H Hercules aircraft of the Philippine Air Force (PAF) crashed in Sulu, Philippines. 
Bibaa Henry (46) and Nicole Smallman (27) were discovered, stabbed to death, in Fryent Country Park, Brent, London, United Kingdom on 7 June 2020. \c\cBibaa Henry lived in Brent, northwest London, and was a social worker at Buckinghamshire Council. Nicole Smallman lived in Harrow NW London, and worked as a freelance photographer. They were the daughters of Mina Smallman, the Church of England's first non-white female archdeacon. Their killings occurred whilst the UK was in lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The women had been celebrating a birthday with friends in the park the night they were killed. Officers of the Metropolitan Police searched the area for evidence. A search by their family, rather than the police, found the women's bodies. \c\cA man was arrested and charged with two counts of murder. On 11 March 2021, the man pleaded not guilty at the Old Bailey. The trial began on 9 June 2021 at the Old Bailey. \c\cTwo police officers were charged with misconduct for sharing "inappropriate" photographs of the crime scene, which caused distress to the family and general public. The officers had taken 'selfies\' next to sisters\' dead bodies. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an inquiry into the behaviour of the police officers. Images had been shared on a WhatsApp group and a further six officers were investigated for failing to either challenge or report this. The IPOC reported that:\c\cMina Smallman worked to raise awareness of the misconduct of the police and failures in the investigation of her daughters\' deaths. She said that racism ensured that the coverage of these black women's deaths was different from similar instances of stranger killings of white women.
The Tigray War (Tigrinya: ውግእ ትግራይ) is an ongoing armed conflict that began around midnight of 3–4 November 2020 in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. The Special Forces of the Tigray Regional government are fighting the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF), the latter being aided by the Ethiopian Federal Police, regional police, and gendarmerie forces of the neighboring Amhara and Afar Regions with the involvement of the Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF). The Tigrayan Special Forces received reinforcements from defecting ENDF soldiers and civilian volunteers; they were integrated into the Tigray Defense Forces. All sides (but particularly the ENDF and EDF) have committed war crimes during the conflict. \c\cIn 2019, to distance the country from ethnic federalism and ethnic nationalist politics, prime minister Abiy Ahmed merged the ethnic and region-based constituent parties of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition and several opposition parties into his new Prosperity Party. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a politically powerful entity that had dominated Ethiopian politics for 27 years as a repressive regime through a one-party dominant system, refused to join the new party. The TPLF then alleged that Abiy Ahmed became an illegitimate ruler because the general elections scheduled for 29 August 2020 were postponed to 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The TPLF, led by its chairman Debretsion Gebremichael, went ahead with regional elections in Tigray in September 2020 in defiance of the federal government, which then declared the Tigray election illegal. \c\cAfter a long build up of Eritrean and Amhara forces on Tigray's borders, the actual fighting between the TPLF and the Ethiopia-Eritrea-Amhara alliance began with the 4 November attacks on Northern Command bases and headquarters of the ENDF in Tigray Region by TPLF-aligned security forces and with counterattacks by the ENDF in the Tigray Region on the same day, that federal authorities described as a police action. The federal forces captured Mekelle, the capital of Tigray Region, on 28 November, after which Prime Minister Abiy declared the Tigray operation "over". The TPLF stated in late November that it would continue fighting until the "invaders" are out, and on 28 June 2021 the Tigray Defense Forces retook Mekelle. \c\cMass extrajudicial killings of civilians took place during November and December 2020 in and around Adigrat, Hagere Selam, in the Hitsats refugee camp, and in Humera, Mai Kadra Debre Abbay, and Aksum. \c\cPeace and mediation proposals included an early November African Union (AU) mediation proposed by Debretsion and refused by Abiy; an AU trio of former African presidents who visited Ethiopia in late November; an emergency Intergovernmental Authority on Development summit of East African heads of government and state that met in late 20 December 2020 in Djibouti; and peace proposals on 19 February by the TPLF and on 20 February by the National Congress of Great Tigray (Baytona), Tigray Independence Party (TIP) and Salsay Weyane Tigray (SAWET). Due to the onset of the war a deep humanitarian crisis has been feared. \c\cFollowing the end of the Ethiopian Civil War in 1991, Ethiopia became a dominant-party state under the rule of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of ethnically-based parties dominated by the Tigray People's Liberation Front. The founding and most influential member was the TPLF and the chairperson was Meles Zenawi, who was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death in 2012. \c\cOn 2 April 2018, the once powerful TPLF was ousted from power in the federal government owing to a growing discontent within the public, a reaction to 27 years of repression. In a closed door election to chair the EPRDF, executive committee members from Amhara, Oromia and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples\' regions voted for Abiy Ahmed in defiance of the TPLF, which was hoping to get Shiferaw Shigute elected chairman. After losing the election and being ousted from the federal government, TPLF officials relocated to Tigray and continued administering the region for three years frequently clashing with the federal government. In one instance, the regional administration of Tigray is reported to have defied the federal government and refused to allow Ethiopian Federal Police to arrest Getachew Assefa, the former chief of the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) of Ethiopia and executive member of TPLF. \c\cOn 1 December 2019, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed merged the ethnic and region-based parties of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (which had governed Ethiopia for 27 years) and several opposition parties into his new Prosperity Party. The TPLF, a politically powerful entity that had dominated Ethiopian politics during those 27 years, refused to join the new party, and alleged that Abiy Ahmed became an illegitimate ruler by rescheduling the general elections set for 29 August 2020 to an undetermined date in 2021 due to COVID-19. \c\cThe TPLF used to be part of the Ethiopian governing coalition until its 2019 refusal to merge into the Prosperity Party. In 2020, tensions between the government and Tigray escalated in the months before the November Tigray military intervention. Not only the TPLF, but even the Tigray branch of Abiy's own Prosperity Party expressed fears for an Eritrean invasion. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is of Oromo descent, accused the TPLF Party Members in the Tigray Regional Government of undermining his authority. By contrast, the Tigray authorities saw the refusal to recognize the September 2020 election for the Tigray parliament (which, along with all elections in Ethiopia, had been delayed by the federal elections board because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia) as the reason for the outbreak of the conflict. Abiy Ahmed's government considered the September Tigray election to be illegal. Several journalists were barred by the federal government (at Addis Ababa airport) from traveling to cover Tigray's regional election. \c\cThe warming of relations between Abiy Ahmed and Eritrean president Isaias Afwerki, who is poorly regarded in Tigray, was also considered to have fueled the tension. Ethiopian elite units were transported to Gherghera base near Asmara "as part of a security pact" between Abiy and Isaias in a plan to "strike out of existence the TPLF", according to former Eritrean Minister of Defence, Mesfin Hagos. In late October, the Ethiopian Reconciliation Commission stated that it was trying to mediate between the federal and regional governments and the Tigray People's Liberation Front, but that pre-conditions set by all sides were blocking progress. \c\cOpponents of the Tigray People's Liberation Front have described it as a heavily armed ethnic nationalist paramilitary insurgency, terrorist organization, political party, and former ruling authoritarian regime of Ethiopia. \c\cAs tension continued to grow, a general appointed by Abiy was prevented by the Tigrayan government from taking up his military post. The day prior to the TPLF's 4 November Northern Command attacks, the federal parliament of Ethiopia had suggested designating the TPLF as a terrorist organization. \c\cThe 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia states in Article 39.1, "Every Nation, Nationality and People in Ethiopia has an unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession."\c\cArticle 62.9 grants the House of Federation (HoF) the right to "order Federal intervention if any State [government], in violation of [the] Constitution, endangers the constitutional order."\c\cIn late September 2020, the TPLF stated that the constitutional term limit of the HoF, the House of Peoples\' Representatives (HoPR), the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers was 5 October 2020, and that for this reason, it would consider "the incumbent" constitutionally illegitimate after 5 October. TPLF proposed replacing the government by a technocratic caretaker government as detailed in a plan posted on Facebook by the Coalition of Ethiopian Federalist Forces. \c\cOn 4 November 2020, TPLF and Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) soldiers came into conflict during the TPLF attacks on the ENDF Northern Command headquarters in Mekelle, the Fifth Battalion barracks in Dansha, and other Northern Command bases. Several people were killed and the TPLF claimed the attack was carried out in "self-defense."\c\cIn retaliation, an Ethiopian offensive was launched which was accompanied by the declaration of a state of emergency, the creation of the State of Emergency Inquiry Board and a shutdown of government services in Tigray Region. During the subsequent days, skirmishes continued and the Ethiopian parliament declared the creation of an interim government for Tigray. Ethiopian offensives in the north were accompanied with airstrikes and several towns and cities were retaken. \c\cOn the night of 9 to 10 November 600 civilians, mostly Amhara people and Welkait people, were killed in a massacre in the town of Mai Kadra with machetes and knives used by local militias and police loyal to the TPLF, according to preliminary investigations by Amnesty International and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission. While refugees interviewed by the Financial Times and Reuters said it was the Amhara militia who were the perpetrators and Tigrayans who were the victims. Two days later, refugees interviewed by the Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The New York Times stated that Amhara militias, including Fano, and the ENDF carried out beatings and a massacre of 20 Tigrayans in Humera. Humera was shelled from the direction of the Eritrean–Ethiopian border for two days around 9–11 November. The ENDF gained control of Humera on 12 November. \c\cOffensives of joint ENDF-Amhara Region-Eritrean forces into Tigray were facilitated by the intervention of "Pterosaurus" drones, launched by the United Arab Emirates from its base in Assab in Eritrea. The Chinese-made, armed drones bombed Tigrayan towns and defense forces.[dubious  – discuss] \c\cOn 14 November 2020, Tigrayan forces launched rockets at the Eritrean capital of Asmara, but the missiles missed. In the late hours of 13 November 2020 TPLF-affilated forces fired a rocket towards the cities of Bahir Dar and Gondar in the Amhara Region. \c\cOn 17 November 2020, the Ethiopian government accused the TPLF of blowing up four main bridges leading to Mekelle. The TPLF denied the accusations. The TPLF also fired rockets at the Amhara Region in Bahir Dar and Gondar. The TPLF claimed these locations contained military terminals that served as bases to carry out airstrikes. From 17–19 November, Ethiopian forces captured the cities of Shire, Alamata, Raya, Adwa and Axum. In Raya there were an estimated 760 casualties from both forces. While fighting between the TPLF and Ethiopia continued in Zalambessa and Ethiopian forces starting moving towards Adigrat. Fighting between the TPLF and Eritrea took place in Adi Quala, Zalembesa, Taruna, Ali Tina, Wadqomdi, and Bademe. \c\cOn 23 November, Ethiopian forces reached the regional capital of Mekelle and encircled it. A military spokesperson for Ethiopia, Colonel Dejene Tsegaye, announced that Mekelle would be shelled, and told Tigray civilians to flee the city because Ethiopian forces would show no mercy. Many residents of Mekelle had already left the city due to airstrikes in and around the city, but many others still remained in the city. \c\cEven though TPLF leaders, Tigray special forces and militia forces had already left the city, the Ethiopian forces still began their direct assault on Mekelle on the morning of 28 November and started heavy shelling of the city. By the evening Prime Minister Abiy declared Ethiopian forces had taken full control of the city. In total 27 civilians were killed and 100 others were injured. The TPLF vowed to continue fighting. Two days later Prime Minister Abiy claimed no civilians were killed. \c\cAfter Ethiopian forces captured Mekelle and other major cities from forces loyal to the TPLF, the forces loyal to TPLF began to regroup into mountainous areas of Tigray and reorganized under the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF). The TDF forces also began to dig into their positions in rural Tigray. After that TPLF then started a guerrilla campaign against Ethiopian-allied forces from the mountains. This guerrilla insurgency proved unsuccessful, and by mid-December, fighting had reached the places of Hagere Selam, Samre, Dogu’a, Kolla Tembien, May Tsemre, and around Maychew. During this time, a violently enforced curfew was set up by Ethiopian forces along with Eritrean soldiers. In one town over 200 people were killed and the town left deserted. The Ethiopian government denied involvement in the killing. \c\cThe early gains made by the ENDF and Eritrean Defence Forces against the TDF have not led to decisive defeats of the TDF. In late January 2021, the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF) had rallied and were intensifying their insurgency against Ethiopian forces despite initial setbacks and heavy losses. During this time fighting was reported to have taken place around Mekelle and ENDF forces retreated from rural positions towards the Tigray capital of Mekelle. Mutinies were also reported in Mekelle after ENDF forces refused to launch an offensive into the mountains and fight TDF. The most fierce of these clashes to place in mid-February in Samre, a small town 40 km (24.85m) southwest of Mekelle. Thousands of Ethiopian troops supported by artillery, tanks, and airstrikes fought dug in forces loyal to the Tigray regional government. Current control was not stated, but The Guardian reported in late April that there was renewed fighting in the area. \c\cIn April 2021, the TPLF was in control of the rural areas of central and southern Tigray along with parts of eastern and south-eastern Tigray, while the ENDF was in control of the main roads and urban areas. Amhara and Eritrean forces also controled parts of Tigray in the west and north respectfully. Both sides are now preparing for a pro-longed conflict as the war has reached a stalemate. All sides wished to secure a military victory, but they lacked the ability to do so in the near term. The Tigray Defense Forces were engaged in a war of attrition with popular support from the people of Tigray who value the autonomy of the region. This was backed up by the TDF growing in strength in the past few months while being under pressure on all sides. Many Tigrayans also began to support secession from the Ethiopian government which would inflame the Amhara-Tigray territorial disputes. \c\cOn 26 March, Abiy Ahmed announced that Eritrean troops would begin to withdraw from Tigray but for now it remains to be seen if the troops would withdraw or not. Though for now EDF troops can\'t withdraw from Tigray without giving a boost to TDF in its campaign against the government. The withdrawal of EDF and Amhara troops is very difficult thing to achieve as the thing which brought them into the conflict in the first place was the elimination of the TPLF as a political force. \c\cOn 28 and 29 November 2020, witnesses and survivors including refugees in Sudan reported that the Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) carried out the Axum massacre of about 720–800 civilians. The Eritrean government stated that it was angered by Amnesty International's report on the Aksum massacre, that the report was "fallacious" and that the Eritrean government had not been contacted by Amnesty International prior to publication. The Eritrean government also said: "It must be underscored that Amnesty made absolutely no attempt to seek any information from Eritrea. Moreover, the fabricated Axum accusation has mutated over the last month from a \'massacre of Orthodox Christians at St. Mary's Church\' to \'house-to-house\' killing of civilians."\c\cAccording to people who were in Tigray when the war broke out and according to refugees, the EDF would then go on and kill 80–150 in Idaga Hamus on 30 November, and kill 17 in Hadish Hiwot on 2 December after forcing the victims to loot the Goda factory. The EDF would also kill 13 boys aged 12–15 from 1 to 14 December in Tokot.[dubious  – discuss]\c\cOn 26 December 2020, it was reported that Eritrea started withdrawing some of its troops from Tigray. \c\cOn 9 January 2021, Ethiopian TV reported that 300 refugees in Hitsats camp were executed by the TPLF. According to refugees, pro-TPLF forces used Hitsats as a base for several weeks in November 2020, killing several refugees who wanted to leave the camp to get food and, in one incident, killed nine young Eritrean men in revenge for having lost a battle against the EDF. \c\cOn 18 February 2021, unidentified militiamen ambushed a passenger bus in Adi Mesino, killing six and injuring 10. On 20 February, Yemane Niguse, a prominent Tigrayan dissident was assassinated in his birth town of Hewane by unknown assailants. The allegiance of the assassins is unknown. The federal Ethiopian authorities accused the TPLF of responsibility. \c\cOn 1 April 2021, a video surfaced that purports to show Ethiopian troops executing 11 unarmed men before disposing of their bodies near Mahibere Dego. The video has not been dated as of yet. \c\cOn 21 May 2021, Ethiopia’s military prosecutors have convicted 3 soldiers of rape and pressed charges against 28 others suspected of killing civilians in Tigray, 25 other soldiers are charged with rape and other forms of sexual violence, according to the statement by attorney general’s office. The statement also confirmed reports of two massacres in Tigray: It said 229 civilians were killed in the town of Mai Kadra at the beginning of November. Moreover, the Ethiopian government also for the first time accused troops from Eritrea of killing civilians: 110 civilians were killed in the city of Axum on November 27 and 28. \c\cBy 18 November, Abiy claimed that the Ethiopian National Defense Force had captured the cities of Shire and Axum with battles continuing around Mekelle; Ethiopian forces further claimed to have taken some land south of the city. On 23 November, the government issued an ultimatum giving the rebels 72 hours to surrender. On 26 November, after the ultimatum ended, Abiy ordered federal military forces to launch an attack on Mekelle. On 28 November, the Ethiopian government announced that it had taken control of the city, bringing "the last phase of its law enforcement operation" to an end. The TPLF said they would continue fighting. TPLF Chairman, Debretsion Gebremichael, confirmed the TPLF was withdrawing from Mekelle. On 2 December 2020 the United Nations was promised humanitarian access to the territory held by the ENDF in the Tigray Region. The first UN convoy reached Mekelle on 12 December. On 16 December the EU delayed financial aid to Ethiopia citing the Ethiopian government's restrictions against UN humanitarian aid as the reason. \c\cIn February 2021, UN chief coordinator of humanitarian efforts Mark Lowcock said that up to 40% of Tigray was not controlled by Ethiopian troops. He said that much of that area was under the control of Eritrean soldiers pursuing their own objectives independent of Ethiopian command. \c\cRefugees told VICE World News that Eritrea is in control of parts of the northern Maekelay Zone and most likely extending beyond the zone. Different refugees told VICE that not only did Eritreans cross into border areas, but they also took control of the area. One refugee from Maekelay told them “Since the war started, we haven’t seen a single Ethiopian soldier. Only Eritreans, they occupy the rural areas.”\c\cOn 16 June 2021, the Ethiopian ambassador to the UN stated that Eritrean troops in Tigray were to "definitely leave soon". \c\cOn 28 June 2021, the Tigray Defense Forces captured the city of Mekelle. Celebrations erupted in the streets of Mekelle as the TDF took the city.  Ethiopian soldiers, police and administrators were seen leaving the city ahead of the occupation by the TDF.  Shortly after hearing news of the TDF advance the Ethiopian government declared an immediate unilateral ceasefire across the Tigray region.  BBC News reporter Vivienne Nunis characterised the ceasefire as an attempt by Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed to save face, the government having little other option. \c\cOn 29 June 2021, Tigrayan forces vowed to continue their offensive and drive into Eritrea or Amhara if necessary, and said that Mekelle was 100% under control of Tigrayan forces.  By 30 June the rebels had entered the town of Shire, some 140 kilometres (87 mi) north west of Mekelle, after it had been abandoned by Eritrean troops.  The International Crisis Group claimed that the TDF now controlled most of the Tigray region.  The Ethiopian government claimed, on 30 June, that it could re-enter Mekelle in less than three weeks if it wanted to.  In the same announcement the government stated that all Eritrean forces had withdrawn from the region, though this was not confirmed by the Eritrean government. \c\cThousands of people were believed to have been killed in the conflict and around 44,000 fled to Sudan. On 29 November, claims that South Sudan was giving safe haven to Debretsion, led to the Ethiopian ambassador to South Sudan abruptly returning to Ethiopia, and South Sudanese diplomats in Ethiopia allegedly being given 72 hours to leave the country. \c\cOn 15 December, four Sudanese soldiers were killed, and 27 others were injured near the Ethiopia–Sudan border, in what Sudan claimed to be an ambush by Ethiopian forces and militias. A soldier later claimed that Ethiopian forces had launched artillery attacks on them and intruded into the Jebel al-Teyyour area, located 7 kilometers inside Sudan. Other soldiers claimed that the attackers were Amhara Region militias. Ethiopia claimed the clashes were Ethiopia trying to stop a Sudanese militia which had tried to cross into Ethiopian territory and seize farmlands. \c\cIn response to the killings, Sudan started to build-up its military along the border with Ethiopia. Military sources claimed that Sudan had recaptured Jebel Abutiour. Then on 19 December Sudanese army and Rapid Support Forces were reported to have taken areas previously taken by Ethiopia and Amhara Region militias in Al Qadarif. On the same day, 150 civilians were reported to have been killed by Eritrean forces in Edaga Hamus. \c\cOn 7 December heavy fighting broke out between African Union Mission to Somalia and Ethiopian troops in Halgan District, Somalia, when Ethiopian troops tried to disarm Tigrayan troops within their ranks. In total 21 Ethiopian soldiers of Tigrayan origin and 20 other Ethiopian soldiers were killed in the internal military mutiny. \c\cSomalia was involved in the Tigray War according to former head of the Somali National Intelligence and Security Agency, Abdilsalan Guld. \c\cGuld said that the soldiers, aged from 20 to 30 years old, were secretly taken from Mogadishu and sent to Asmara for military training. Guld stated that 370 of the Somali troops trained by Eritrea were killed in Tigray and hundreds of others were wounded. \c\cOn 18 January 2021, the head of Somalia's parliamentary committee on foreign affairs asked the Somali president to investigate claims by family members that their sons had gone off to fight in Ethiopia and are now missing. \c\cOn 19 January 2021, the Somalian government denied the claim that Somali troops had trained in Eritrea and then deployed in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. \c\cAccording to the United Nations (UN), some 2.3 million children have been cut off from desperately needed aid and humanitarian assistance. Since the start of the conflict, the Ethiopian federal government has strictly controlled access to the Tigray region, and the UN has said it is frustrated that talks with the Ethiopian government had not yet secured adequate humanitarian access for "food, including ready-to-use therapeutic food for the treatment of child malnutrition, medicines, water, fuel, and other essentials that are running low" said UNICEF. By 13 March 2021, the UN and its partners reached about 0.9 million people with complete food baskets, and 0.7 million people with clean water. Despite the progress made, many are still hard to reach due to ongoing fighting. About 4.5 million people of are still in need of aid and about 1 million of that are not in accessible areas due to ongoing fighting. \c\cSince the start of the conflict, there has been a limited access to clean water due to hygiene and sanitation services largely being disrupted across Tigray. The Tigray Regional Water Bureau reported that out of 36 villages it assessed, only 4 had partially functioning water sources. Along with that, an estimated 250 motorized water pumping systems have been out of order, and the status of 11,000 hand pumps in rural areas were unknown. Because of this there has been a heightened risk of outbreaks of water-born diseases and COVID-19. \c\cIn February 2021, it was reported by GOAL Ethiopia, IRC, MCMDO, MSF-Spain and World Vision, that nearly one in seven children in 16 woredas and town administrations across Tigray were found to be acutely malnourished. While in Enderta, Abi Adi and Shire, GOAL and IRC reported that 16.6% of children screened had acute malnutrition with 3.5% suffering from severe acute malnutrition. \c\cOut of more than 260 health centers in Tigray before the war, only 31 are fully functional, while 7 are partially functional, according to the Emergency Coordination Center. According to WHO, all of the functioning hospitals and health centers in Tigray had a lack of medical supplies, drugs and equipment. UN partners reported continued looting of health facilities. Only 16% of the health facilities had vaccination services and only 17% had maternal services (antenatal care, birth delivery, etc). \c\cIn November 2020, Amhara Region Special Forces and Amhara militias loyal to the Amhara regional government took control of the western zone of Tigray in order to settle a decades-old land dispute. They claim the area was taken from them by force in 1991 after TPLF forces overthrew the communist PDRE government and divided the country into 9 states. They have also claimed the areas of Welkait, Tegede, Humera, Telemte, and Raya to be theirs. Since then, the area has been under the de facto control of Amhara regional authorities. Their control has been marked by reports of ethnically motivated violence and forced displacement. By February 2020, about 45,000 civilians had been forced to leave the zone due to extrajudical killings, arbitary detentions, and the disappearances of people, especially young men. One refugee interviewed by Reuters said that if they didn\'t leave when they did, they would have been killed by Amhara forces. 41 other refugees interviewed have also described attacks, looting, and threats by Amhara forces. \c\cThe administrator of the disputed zone, Yabsira Eshetie, has denied any claims of violence or forced displacement by Amhara forces. Mulu Nega, the leader of the government-appointed interim Tigray government has stated the contrary. The Amhara government also denies reports of forced displacement and has even asked the Ethiopian government to change the regional border. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there have been acts of ethnic cleansing in Tigray. \c\cPossible COVID-19 outbreaks have been feared as refugees fleeing the Tigray conflict have sheltered in crowded camps. \c\cIn November 2020, the UN warned of “very critical” supply shortages for the nearly 100,000 Eritrean refugees who, prior to the war, were registered in four camps in Tigray region. Later that same month, the UN reported that people in Tigray were fleeing Mekelle. The federal government had warned of "no mercy" if TPLF and residents remained intermingled. \c\cAs of December 2020, the UN estimated more than one million people have been internally displaced by the fighting. More than 50,000 people have fled to Sudan due to the conflict. Communications and travel links were still blocked, and Human Rights Watch warned that "actions that deliberately impede relief supplies" would violate international humanitarian law. \c\cThere have been “deeply distressing reports of sexual and gender-based violence, extrajudicial killings, [and the] widespread destruction and looting of public and private property by all parties” according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. More than 136 cases of rape have also been reported in hospitals in Mekelle, Ayder, Adigrat and Wukro in the east of Tigray region between December 2020 and January 2021, with indications that there are many more such unreported cases. \c\cAs of 2 February 2021, 20,000 of the Eritrean refugees in Tigray, mostly from the Hitsats and Shimelba camps, remained unaccounted for, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \c\cThe fighting has killed thousands, according to International Crisis Group. \c\cThere have been several reported attacks on humanitarian workers, including attacks by Ethiopian government soldiers. The Danish Refugee Council and the International Rescue Committee reported the killings of their staff in early December 2020. An employee of the Committee of the Development of Peoples was killed by a stray bullet in early June. On March 23rd 2021, a driver from Médecins Sans Frontières was beaten by Ethiopian soldiers after witnessing extrajudicial killings by Ethiopian government soldiers. Following the June 23rd bombing of Togoga, there were reports of Ethiopian government soldiers firing on ambulances to prevent them from reaching the injured.  On June 25th 2021, three Médecins Sans Frontières workers were found murdered near their car in Tigray. \c\cClaire Wilmot, writing in The Washington Post, found that a significant number of new, single-issue Twitter accounts were opened in the immediate aftermath of the 4 November attacks. Most appeared to be authentic accounts from people seeking to raise international awareness of the conflict in the midst of a communications blackout in Tigray. The Ethiopian government cited disinformation and hate speech to justify communications blackouts. Researchers suggested that reducing access to information could help to create contexts where misinformation can thrive, because it reduces the ability to verify information. The Ethiopian government tried to control the information environment by positioning itself as the sole provider of reliable information. In February, pro-government groups called on their supporters in Ethiopia and the diaspora to combat what they called "TPLF fake news" online. Pro-government groups used tactics similar to those of pro-TPLF groups to push their narrative of the conflict, though as of 5 February, pro-government campaigns had produced fewer Tweets overall. BBC News showed examples of manipulated photos which misleadingly endorsed both the federal Ethiopian government and the TPLF. Researchers found that groups use tactics such as "copy and paste" campaigns hosted on websites, which include instructions for opening new accounts, copying and pasting pre-written tweets, and tagging influencers. Both campaigns produced disinformation and misinformation, though the majority of content produced was activist in nature. Wilmot suggested that the lines between authentic political activity and deliberate manipulation of online content during the conflict were increasingly blurred. \c\cEthnic profiling against Tigrayans occurred during the Tigray War, with Ethiopians of Tigrayan ethnicity being put on indefinite leave from Ethiopian Airlines or refused permission to board, prevented from overseas travel, and an "order of identifying ethnic Tigrayans from all government agencies and NGOs" being used by federal police to request a list of ethnic Tigrayans from an office of the World Food Programme. Tigrayans\' houses were arbitrarily searched and Tigrayan bank accounts were suspended. Ethnic Tigrayan members of Ethiopian components of United Nations peacekeeping missions were disarmed and some forcibly flown back to Ethiopia, at the risk of torture or execution, according to United Nations officials. The State of Emergency Taskforce stated that the Tigrayan peacepeekers were returned to Ethiopia because of "infiltration of TPLF elements in various entities". \c\cSeveral proposals for peace negotiations and mediation were made involving some of the main groups involved in the war. Around 9 November 2020, Debretsion asked the African Union to stop the war and requested peace negotiations; Abiy refused to negotiate. On 25–27 November, a trio of former African presidents appointed by AU chair Cyril Ramaphosa visited Ethiopia with the aim of mediating; they met Abiy and representatives of the Transitional Government of Tigray that officially replaced the TPLF government. An emergency Intergovernmental Authority on Development summit of East African heads of government and state met on 20 December 2020 in Djibouti, resulting in a statement of support for the Ethiopian constitutional order and humanitarian access to Tigray Region. \c\cOn 19 February 2021, the TPLF expressed its wish for peace negotiations, declaring eight preconditions for the negotiations. On 20 February, the National Congress of Great Tigray (Baytona), Tigray Independence Party (TIP) and Salsay Weyane Tigray (SAWET) published six demands to the international community that closely overlapped with the TPLF's pre-conditions. \c\cOn 11 March 2021, the US ambassador to Ethiopia, Geeta Pasi, announced support for joint humanitarian activities by international partners and the federal government of Ethiopia. \c\cThe Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) condemned the "decision of President Mustafe to portray Somalis in Ethiopia as supporters of the war against Tigray". \c\cOn 12 November 2020, the TPLF chairman Debretsion Gebremichael denied allegations that the TPLF had surrendered, stating that "we are still holding. These people cannot defeat us. We cannot be beaten."\c\cOn 27 November, Ethiopian Attorney General, Gedion Timothewos, pressed by the BBC's Stephen Sackur to clarify if his country was now "sinking into civil war", responded: "If the Prime Minister were to let the TPLF go on with the kind of things they have been doing, if he had let them acquire the heavy weaponry they wanted to acquire by attacking the Northern Command, yes, we would have descended into that kind of situation; but by taking the measures we are taking right now, we will be able to avert that possibility."\c\cWhen Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018, he made significant reforms to the country's judicial system, economy and foreign policy. According to an article by Hailemariam Desalegn, the former prime minister of Ethiopia, TPLF officials were concerned these moves were going to threaten their political and economic position in the country. Thus TPLF officials started defying the orders from the federal government and made overt and covert actions to undermine and delegitimize the Ethiopian parliament, defense forces and the federal government. \c\c Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne called on all parties to show restraint. Champagne also called for a peaceful solution and protection of civilians. \c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, China objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Djiboutian President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh expressed strong support for Abiy, saying that he had chosen to "restore law and order at the federal level, and punish those seeking to break up the country" and dismissed the prospect of negotiations, saying that the TPLF had "structured itself so as to bring the central government to its knees" and that talks could "only lead to the partition of Ethiopia", setting a precedent for secession by other groups in the region. \c\c Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki politically support the actions taken by the Ethiopian national government against Tigray People's Liberation Front.[citation needed]\c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, India objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Japan extended its emergency grant aid of 6.6 million US dollars for people affected by the war. \c\c Kenya, Political Support for the Ethiopian national government. \c\c Minister of Foreign Affairs (Turkey) Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu stated that the Turkish government "understood" the federal Ethiopian government's decision and "expressed his confidence that the operation would end soon and not compromise the safety of civilians."\c\c Norway said it was “deeply concerned by reports of the use of SGBV in Tigray. Norway joins UN Special Rapporteur Pramilla Patten in calling on all parties to commit to a zero-tolerance policy for SGBV. Obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law must be respected.”\c\c The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in response to the massacre in the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, "We strongly condemn the perpetrators of this barbaric crime committed in a place of worship. We expect the Ethiopian authorities to immediately take all possible to clarify its circumstances and punish the perpetrators.” Poland also called "on the parties to the conflict to refrain from violence and respect human rights, to ensure the safety of civilian population, and to properly protect the places of worship and freedom of religion. We appeal for an unimpeded access for humanitarian deliveries to the Tigray province. \c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, Russia objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo politically supports the current military actions taken by the Ethiopian government against Tigray People's Liberation Front. \c\c British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had spoken with Abiy and urged "de-escalation of the Tigray conflict" and further stated that "civilians and humanitarian access must be protected". \c\cBritish House of Lords member, David Alton, called on the British government to investigate the reports of massacres and attacks on refugee camps in Tigray. \c\c U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged de-escalation of the conflict and immediate action to restore peace, and emphasized the importance of protecting civilians. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's foreign policy adviser Antony Blinken expressed deep concern over the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, ethnic violence and threats to peace and security in the area. He called on the TPLF to protect civilians and take steps to end the conflict. \c\cU.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Tibor Nagy condemned the Tigray People's Liberation Front for their rocket attacks against Asmara, Eritrea, calling it an "unjustifiable attacks against Eritrea ... its efforts to internationalize the conflict in Tigray."\c\cOn 27 February 2021, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces and Amhara regional forces from Tigray. He also asked the African Union and regional partners, to work with the U.S. to address the crisis in Tigray. \c\cOn 12 March, the US announced it would be resuming some aid to Ethiopia, which had previously been blocked by the Trump administration over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) dispute, but that security assistance programs would remain suspended due to concerns over the conflict in Tigray. \c\c U.S. President Joe Biden met with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta to discuss the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Tigray and the need to prevent further loss of life and to ensure humanitarian access. \c\c The United Nations (UN) warned of the emergence of a major humanitarian crisis, if a full-scale conflict arose. \c\cUN Security Council: "The UN Security Council on Friday scrapped plans to issue a statement calling for an end to violence in Ethiopia’s Tigray region because of opposition from China and Russia, diplomats said."\c\c The European Commission said it was mobilizing an initial €4 million in emergency aid, in order to assist displaced Ethiopian refugees who had fled to Sudan. The EU plans on cutting aid to and sanctioning other regions of Ethiopia due to the conflict. \c\c The African Union (AU) appealed for cessation of hostilities and protection of civilians. The AU also stated that the European Union and United Nations Security Council should not intervene until an African Union envoy is sent to Ethiopia. \c\cThe Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, made a statement defending the Ethiopian Government by tweeting "In #Ethiopia, the federal govt took bold steps to preserve the unity, stability and respect for the constitutional order of the country; which is legitimate for all states. It cannot be denied, however, that the crisis in #Tigray has provoked large scale displacement. We encourage #IGAD to support #Ethiopia in addressing the humanitarian dimensions. Particular attention should be paid to refugees and displaced people. #IgadSummit."\c\cWorldwide, humanitarian organizations and the scientific community asked for a rapid ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Tigray. \c\cInternational petitions for humanitarian aid to Tigray have been launched, for instance by concerned scientists (Professors Jan Nyssen, Eloi Ficquet, Wolbert Smidt, Jozef Deckers, Istvan Tarrosy, Paolo Billi, Sil Lanckriet, Kjetil Tronvoll and others), and another one on Avaaz. \c\cOn 9 February 2021, when religious leaders started a visit to Mekelle organized by federal authorities to show that the situation was "normal", protestors used stones and burnt tyres to block central parts of the town in objection to the claim that the situation had returned to normality. Soldiers fired at the protestors, killing one.

Indirect presidential elections were held in Israel on 2 June 2021. The President of Israel is elected by members of the Knesset for a single seven-year term. Incumbent President Reuven Rivlin, who had been in office since 24 July 2014, was ineligible for re-election. This was the seventeenth election. \c\cThe presidency is a largely ceremonial position, wielding little real power. The president's main role is meeting the leaders of each party following legislative elections to discuss nominations for prime minister, and giving a mandate to try and form a government to the candidate they deem most likely to succeed. \c\cThe election was notable for several firsts. Namely, neither of the candidates is a sitting member of the Knesset, and both are running as independents. Furthermore, the election of Peretz would have made her the first non-interim female head of state of Israel, while a victory by Herzog made him the first child of a former president to be elected president. \c\cIsaac Herzog was elected the 11th President of Israel with 87 Knesset members voting for him, which was the biggest majority a candidate has ever won. The prior record was 86 votes, which was held by Zalman Shazar (1968), Yitzhak Navon (1978), and Shimon Peres (2007, in the second round). In all three cases, the candidates receiving 86 votes were unopposed (in the case of Peres, his opponents dropped out for the second round). \c\cHerzog was inaugurated as president on 7 July. \c\cOn 9 July 2021, incumbent President Reuven Rivlin is expected to end his seven-year term, and according to section 3 (b) of the Basic Law: President of the State, the President of the State will serve only one term. The date of the election will be determined by the Knesset presidency, in which 120 Knesset members will be required to convene a plenum and elect the eleventh president by secret ballot. According to the law, the election date will be set between thirty and ninety days before the end of the outgoing president's term, but due to the elections to the 24th Knesset being held in close proximity to the date, and due to the law's obligation to announce the election date three weeks earlier, the earliest possible election date is 69 days before the end of Rivlin's term on 27 April. \c\cOn 22 April 2020, MK Merav Michaeli of the Labor Party submitted a bill which states that a criminal suspect or defendant will not be able to run for president. The bill's goal was to ensure that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is accused of crimes, was not able to run for president. However, the law was not adopted. \c\cOn 24 May 2021, the chairman of the organizing committee, MK Karine Elharrar from Yesh Atid, threatened to refuse to schedule the presidential election. The dispute arose after the Knesset speaker blocked all private members\' bills on the floor of the Knesset, fearing that bills targeting Netanyahu, such as the bill preventing someone facing criminal charges from serving as prime minister, may  advance. \c\cLikud refused this request and the two parties remained in a stalemate. Yesh Atid believe that delaying or cancelling the presidential election is the only way to force Likud's hand and to get a vote on their legislation in the Knesset. In the case where there is no election, the speaker, Yariv Levin of the Likud will be appointed as the president on an interim basis. \c\cThe election is conducted in the Knesset, with each member receiving one vote. The election is conducted in a two-round system. If a candidate does not receive a majority in the first round, a runoff is conducted. The ballots are kept secret. \c\cAny Israeli citizen is eligible to run for president. In November 2013, Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein ruled that candidates would be barred from raising funds to finance their campaigns. \c\cOfficial candidacy requires the endorsement of 10 Members of the Knesset. By the deadline of 20 May, only two people had gained the support of 10 or more MKs:\c\cIsaac Herzog: chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, former Leader of the Opposition. Obtained 27 signatures, from MKs from all parties in the Knesset, except the Arab parties. \c\cMiriam Peretz: educator and public speaker. Obtained the support of 11 MKs. \c\cYosef Abramowitz: "solar energy pioneer"[failed verification]\c\cMichael Bar-Zohar: former Member of Knesset for the Alignment and Labor Party. Bar-Zohar dropped out of the race on 19 May and endorsed Herzog. \c\cYehoram Gaon: singer and actor Gaon dropped out of the race on 19 May. \c\cYehudah Glick: former Member of Knesset for Likud. 43rd on the Likud list for the election to the 24th Knesset. Glick dropped out of the race on 19 May. \c\cElham Khazen: pharmacist, former head of Blue and White's Women in Arab Society division and former Labor Party candidate.[failed verification]\c\cAmir Peretz: former leader of the Labor Party and incumbent Minister of Economy. Former Minister of Defence and former mayor of Sderot. Peretz dropped out of the race on 5 May. \c\cShimon Shetreet: first candidate to announce interest in running, professor of law and former Minister and Member of Knesset for the Labor Party.[failed verification] 68th on Labor list in the 2021 elections. \c\cAlthough the public was not able to vote in the election, opinion polls were conducted to determine public support for the candidates. 
The 2020 Summer Olympics (Japanese: 2020年夏季オリンピック, Hepburn: Nisen Nijū-nen Kaki Orinpikku), officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad (第32回オリンピック競技大会, Dai Sanjūni-kai Orinpikku Kyōgi Taikai) and also known as Tokyo 2020 (東京2020), is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to be held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan, likely held under the state of emergency and without spectators. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and will not allow international spectators. Despite being rescheduled for 2021, the event retains the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes. This is the first time that the Olympic Games have been postponed and rescheduled, rather than cancelled. The Summer Paralympics will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021 after the Olympics. \c\cTokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013. The 2020 Games will mark the second time that Japan has hosted the Summer Olympic Games, the first being also in Tokyo in 1964, making this the first city in Asia to host the Summer Games twice. Overall, these will be the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, which also hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972 (Sapporo) and 1998 (Nagano).  Tokyo was also scheduled to host the 1940 Summer Olympics but pulled out in 1938.  The 2020 Games will be the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, the first being in Pyeongchang County, South Korea in 2018, and the next in Beijing, China in 2022. \c\cThe 2020 Games will see the introduction of new competitions including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and madison cycling, as well as further mixed events. Under new IOC policies, which allow the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program to augment the permanent core events, these Games will see karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding make their Olympic debuts, as well as the return of baseball and softball for the first time since 2008. \c\cThe three candidate cities were Tokyo, Istanbul, and Madrid. The applicant cities of Baku and Doha were not promoted to candidate status. A bid from Rome was withdrawn. \c\cThe IOC voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system. None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority. \c\cIn January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Olympic Games. Tokyo organizers insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics. The IOC states that in 2020, their Japanese partners and the prime minister Abe Shinzo "made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest". Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event. Also unlike the case for H1N1 "swine flu" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020. In a February 2020 interview with City A.M., Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate. In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed games in their state, while John Coates the vice president of the International Olympic Committee in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19. \c\cEstimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University note that states of emergency may be required during the Games. The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts\' panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the games were to allow spectators. \c\cConcerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China. The boxing qualification tournament was originally planned to be held in Wuhan, China, the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, from 3 to 14 February, but instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March. The third round of the women's football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia. The European boxing qualification was held in London, United Kingdom, before it was suspended and is set to resume in June 2021 and has moved to Paris, France, affecting travel to the United Kingdom for its completion. Remaining qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and middle of 2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo. \c\cMandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that public health and safety was their topmost priority. The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3 February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the end of the month, and the anti-doping organizations in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced their testing activities by the end of March. \c\cThe Tokyo Organizing Committee (TOCOG) released a statement on 2 March 2020, confirming that preparations for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics were "continuing as planned". The following day, a spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stated that the Games would proceed according to schedule. On 18 March, the IOC repeated its opposition to a delay or cancellation. On 23 March, both Canada and Australia indicated that they would withdraw from the Games if they were not postponed by a year. On the same day, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated he would support a proposed postponement, citing that ensuring athlete safety was "paramount". That same day, veteran IOC member and former vice president Dick Pound told USA Today that he expected the Games to be postponed. \c\cThe IOC and TOCOG released a joint statement on 24 March 2020, announcing that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be rescheduled to a date "beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021". They stated that the Games could "stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times", and that the Olympic flame could become "the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present". Prime Minister Abe stated that IOC president Thomas Bach responded "with 100% agreement" to his proposal to delay the Games. For continuity and marketing purposes, it was agreed that the Games would still be branded as Tokyo 2020 despite the change in scheduling. Although several Olympics were cancelled by world wars, including the 1940 Summer Olympics (which were formerly awarded to Tokyo), this marks the first Olympics to be postponed to a later date instead of being cancelled altogether. \c\cOn 30 March 2020, the IOC and TOCOG announced that they had reached an agreement on the new dates for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which would begin with the opening ceremony on 23 July 2021 and end with the closing ceremony on 8 August 2021. The subsequent Winter Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to begin on 4 February 2022, less than six months later. Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named "Here We Go" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots. \c\cA Tokyo University simulation showed that if the games were to be held after the states of emergency orders lifted in mid-June, a new wave of infections would peak in mid-October. \c\cHealth experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist. In an interview with Japanese sports daily Nikkan Sports, former Organizing Committee president and Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori asserted that the Games would be "scrapped" if they could not go ahead in 2021. On 29 April, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games "must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic". Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview with NBC Sports on 20 May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was "a mammoth task" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021. However, both Bach and Mori expressed optimism about the Games going ahead. Indian Olympic Association president Narinder Batra and World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom also remained optimistic about the event being able to take place in 2021. \c\cA member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored the British Medical Journal's editorial, which states "holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes— ignoring scientific and moral imperatives—is contradictory to Japan’s commitment to global health and human security."\c\cOn 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had "privately concluded" that the Games would have to be cancelled. The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were "categorically untrue". The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19 February that the G7—which also includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US—had given "unanimous" support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled. "President Biden supports Prime Minister Suga's efforts," the White House stated. It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan. Prime Minister Suga dismissed these reports in an April 2021 press conference with President Biden, who continues to support Suga's determination to hold the Games. "We respected the decision to delay the games last summer" and "the President proudly supports U.S. athletes," the White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. \c\cPublic support for the Games in Japan has seen significant decreases amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country. Multiple organisations of medical professionals have voiced oppositions to the Games, while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement. In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games. The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association is calling for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo "have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity" in an open letter to the prime minister. At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games. Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement. A 7 June poll shows 55% for cancellation or postponing, 41% who favour limited or non audience games, and 3% for games without distancing restrictions. \c\cRakuten CEO Hiroshi Mikitani said that it would be a "suicide mission" for the country to host the Olympic Games in 2021. Kenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected over 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to "prioritise life" over the Olympics. Softbank's CEO Masayoshi Son opposes the games, stating, "more than 80% of the people want to postpone or call off the Olympics. Who is going to push for it, with what rights?" Japanese writers Jiro Akagawa and  Fuminori Nakamura also called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled. \c\cOn 26 May, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which is a local sponsor of the Games, published an editorial calling for Prime Minister Suga to "calmly and objectively assess the situation and decide on the cancellation of the event this summer." The Financial Times reported on 4 June that Japanese sponsors have proposed to the organisers for "the Games to be postponed for several months," citing a comment by a corporate sponsor senior executive: "It just makes much, much more sense from our perspective to hold the Games when there are more vaccinated people, the weather is cooler and maybe public opposition is lower."\c\cIn February 2021, the IOC began releasing "playbooks" containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants will be asked to use Japan's COCOA Exposure Notification app and will be tested at least every four days. Athletes who test positive will be unable to compete and may be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway will be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts must also test negative in order to be cleared for competition. As the actions could spread infected droplets, athletes will be discouraged from "excessive" celebrations. The playbooks were criticised in a paper published by the New England Journal of Medicine in May 2021, for lacking "scientifically rigorous risk assessment" and failing to "distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes". \c\cThe IOC is recommending the vaccination of athletes if they are available, but vaccines will not be required, and the IOC is recommending against athletes "jumping the queue" in order to obtain priority over essential populations. On 12 March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they are approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and Sinopharm vaccines for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and purchase two doses for their nation's general public for each vaccinated athlete. On 6 May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo. \c\cApproximately 93,000 athletes and officials are exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving to Japan, provided that they remain in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccines doses allocated for this group, it has led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the games and when teams return to their countries. \c\cDue to international travel restrictions, the organising committee announced that no international guests (including spectators) will be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators will be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting. On 19 June 2021, Governor of Tokyo Yuriko Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead. On 21 June, it was announced that all venues will be capped at a maximum of 10,000 spectators or 50% capacity, whichever is higher. However, on 2 July 2021, Seiko Hashimoto said that due to rising cases of COVID-19 in the country, there could be a reversal of the previous decision and host the Games without public, with Tokyo Governor Koike saying it is her preference. A ban of public during the opening ceremony was also discussed. On 8 July 2021, Prime Minister Suga declared a state of emergency imposed in Tokyo from 12 July and would end on 22 August, includes the duration period between the Olympics and all events might have been held without spectators as possible due to a cases surged by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. \c\cAccording to an estimate conducted by professor emeritus Katsuhiro Miyamoto of Kansai University and reported by the NHK, the cost of delaying the 2020 Olympics by one year will be 640.8 billion yen (US$5.8 billion), taking maintenance expenditures for the unused facilities into account. A complete cancellation would cost Japan ¥4.52 trillion (US$41.5 billion), based on operating expenses and loss of tourism activity. \c\cThe Tokyo Games are protected through the commercial insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London, by global reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re. The IOC takes out around $800 million of insurance for each Summer Olympics, with the total amount of loss insured for the 2020 Games likely to be more than $2 billion. The disruption caused by postponing the Games is covered by the insurance policy; those likely to make claims for their financial losses include local organizers, sponsors, hospitality firms, and travel providers. The total loss amount will not become clear until the Games have actually taken place. \c\cHolders of tickets purchased from overseas prior to postponement will be entitled to refunds for both Olympic and Paralympic ticket purchases except for costs for cancelled hotel bookings. Although about 600,000 Olympic tickets and 300,000 Paralympic tickets will need to be refunded, organisers said that they would not release the costs for refunds. \c\cThe Tokyo Organizing Committee was originally headed by former Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori, but he resigned in February 2021 due to backlash from sexist comments about women in meetings. Seiko Hashimoto was chosen to succeed him. Tamayo Marukawa, Minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, oversees the preparations on behalf of the Japanese government. \c\cThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government has set aside a fund of JP¥400 billion (more than 3.67 billion USD) to cover the cost of hosting the Games. The Japanese government is considering easing airspace restrictions to allow an increased slot capacity at both Haneda and Narita airports. A new railway line is planned to link both airports through an expansion of Tokyo Station, cutting travel time from Tokyo Station to Haneda from 30 minutes to 18 minutes, and from Tokyo Station to Narita from 55 minutes to 36 minutes; funded primarily by private investors, the line would cost ¥400 billion. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East) is also planning a new route near Tamachi to Haneda Airport. \c\cThere are plans to fund the accelerated completion of the Central Circular Route, Tokyo Gaikan Expressway, and Ken-Ō Expressway, and the refurbishment of other major expressways in the area. The Yurikamome automated transit line is also to be extended from its existing terminal at Toyosu Station to a new terminal at Kachidoki Station, passing the site of the Olympic Village, although the line is not expected to have adequate capacity to serve major events in the Odaiba area on its own. \c\cIn June 2020, TOC CEO Toshirō Mutō stated that the committee was exploring options for streamlining the Games to achieve cost savings. On 25 September, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee agreed to a suite of measures to simplify the Games\' logistics, including a cut to non-athlete staff, use of online meetings, and streamlined transport, among others. The committee also outlined areas it would be exploring in order to maintain the health and safety of all participants. \c\cIn February 2012, it was announced that former Tokyo's National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a ¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics. In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and "optimize" the design. \c\cIn June 2015, the government announced it was planning to reduce the new stadium's permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure. The original plans to build a retractable roof were also scrapped. As a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the stadium, which reached ¥252 billion, the government ultimately chose to reject Zaha Hadid's design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma's design has a budget of ¥149 billion. Changes in plans prevented the new stadium from being completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended. National Stadium was inaugurated on 21 December 2019 and will be named Olympic Stadium during 2020 Olympic Games. \c\cIn October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the venues could exceed US$25 billion. \c\cOf the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 are within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed. On 16 October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns. The plans were made official on 1 November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo. \c\cSix venues for eight sports are located within the central business area of Tokyo, northwest of the Olympic Village. Three of these venues were originally constructed for the 1964 Summer Olympics. \c\c*Built on the site of the old National Stadium (used for the 1964 Summer Olympics)\c\c†Originally constructed for the 1964 Summer Olympics\c\cThere are 13 venues planned for 15 sports located in the vicinity of Tokyo Bay, southeast of the Olympic Village, predominantly on Ariake, Odaiba and the surrounding artificial islands. \c\cThere are 16 venues for 16 sports situated farther than 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the Olympic Village. \c\cIn December 2018, the Japanese government chose to ban drones from flying over venues being used for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. A ban was also imposed for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Japan also hosted. \c\cApplications for volunteering at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were accepted beginning on 26 September 2018. By 18 January 2019, a total of 204,680 applications had been received by the Tokyo Organizing Committee. Interviews to select the requisite number of volunteers began in February 2019, with training scheduled to take place in October 2019. The volunteers at the venues are to be known as "Field Cast", and the volunteers in the city are to be known as "City Cast". These names were chosen from a shortlist of four from an original 150 pairs of names; the other three shortlisted names were "Shining Blue" and "Shining Blue Tokyo", "Games Anchor" and "City Anchor", and "Games Force" and "City Force". The names were chosen by the people who had applied to be volunteers at the Games. \c\cIn February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017. A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year. \c\cIn May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base. The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019. \c\cOn 24 July 2019, the designs of the medals were unveiled. The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition. A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively. \c\cThe slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay is "Hope Lights Our Way". \c\cAs determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games, the 2020 Summer Olympics torch is scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent. The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading "Flame of Recovery". After leaving Naraha on 26 March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals. The relay is scheduled to end at Tokyo's new National Stadium, where the torch is to be used to light the Olympic cauldron at the finale of the 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. \c\cAfter the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021. On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia. \c\cOn 20 August 2020, it was announced that the torch relay would begin again in Naraha, Fukushima on 25 March 2021, nearly a year later than originally planned. \c\cThe opening ceremony tickets are expected to range from ¥12,000 to ¥300,000, with a maximum price of ¥130,000 for the finals of the athletics track and field events. The average ticket price is ¥7,700, with half the tickets being sold for up to ¥8,000. A symbolic ticket price of ¥2,020 is expected for families, groups resident in Japan, and in conjunction with a school program. Tickets will be sold through 40,000 shops in Japan and by mail order to Japanese addresses through the Internet. International guests, had they been allowed, would have needed to visit Japan during the sales period, or arrange to buy tickets through a third party such as a travel agent. \c\cTickets went on general sale in Japan in the autumn of 2019 and were expected to be sold globally from June 2020; however, this plan was suspended when the Games were postponed on 24 March 2020. The Tokyo Organizing Committee confirmed that tickets already purchased would remain valid for the same sessions according to the new schedule and that refunds were also being offered. \c\cOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This includes both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders will be refunded. Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system. \c\cThe official program for the 2020 Summer Olympics was approved by the IOC executive board on 9 June 2017. IOC president Thomas Bach stated that the goal for the Tokyo Summer Olympics was to give them a more "youthful" and "urban" appeal, and to increase the number of female participants. \c\cThe Games will feature 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines. Alongside the five new sports that are expected to be introduced in Tokyo, fifteen new events within existing sports are also planned, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and the return of madison cycling, as well as new mixed events in several sports. \c\cIn the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses. \c\cAs part of a goal to control costs and ensure that the Olympics remain "relevant to sports fans of all generations", the IOC assessed the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Olympics, with the remit of dropping one sport and retaining 25 "core" sports to join new entrants golf and rugby sevens at the 2020 Games. This move would bring the total number of sports to 27, one less than the requirement of 28 for the 2020 Olympics program, thus leaving a single vacancy that the IOC would seek to fill from a shortlist containing seven unrepresented sports, as well as the sport that had been dropped from the 2012 program. \c\cOn 12 February 2013, IOC leaders voted to drop wrestling from the "core" program for the 2020 Games; this decision surprised many news outlets, given that the sport's role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original program for the modern Games. The New York Times felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport. Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration. \c\cOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling. The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu. At the 125th IOC Session on 8 September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively. \c\cUnder new IOC policies that shift the Games to use an "event-based" program rather than a "sport-based" program, the host organizing committee can now also propose the addition of sports to the program. This rule is designed to allow sports that are popular in the host country to be added to the program in order to improve local interest. As a result of these changes, a list of eight sports was unveiled on 22 June 2015, consisting of baseball/softball, bowling, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu. On 28 September 2015, the organizers submitted their shortlist of five proposed sports to the IOC: baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding. These five new sports were approved on 3 August 2016 by the IOC during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and are to be included in the sports program for 2020 only, bringing the total number of sports at the 2020 Olympics to 33. \c\cA total of 56 test events are scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games. \c\cIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner "Ready, Steady, Tokyo". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020. \c\cAll test events originally scheduled to take place from 12 March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games. \c\cThe Nippon Festival was initially announced in late 2019, and is expected to feature art and performances that are modern while being tied to Japanese culture, including a hybrid kabuki-opera production. On 5 February 2020, the Japan Sumo Association confirmed that it would participate in the Nippon Festival, with plans to host a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan shortly after the conclusion of the Olympic Games but before the start of the Paralympic Games. The length and format of the exhibition sumo tournament is expected to differ significantly from sumo's traditional 15-day tournaments, which are held six times a year. There are plans to provide simultaneous commentary in English and Japanese to help explain to visitors the customs and traditions of professional sumo, which are deeply rooted in the Shinto religion. \c\cThe Republic of Macedonia has competed under the provisional name "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" in every Summer and Winter Games since its debut in 1996 because of the disputed status of its official name. The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the Prespa agreement, and the country was officially renamed North Macedonia in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games will be North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name. \c\cOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. The title of the neutral banner has yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use "Olympic Athletes from Russia" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. \c\cAfter reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as "Neutral Athlete" or "Neutral Team". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display "Russia" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the "Neutral Athlete/Team" designation. \c\cOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym "ROC" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. Russia would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. \c\cOn 6 April 2021, North Korea announced it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics due to COVID-19 concerns. This will mark North Korea's first absence in the Summer Olympics since 1988. \c\cAs of 4 July 2021[update], the following 205 National Olympic Committees have qualified (including the 101 universality places guaranted in athletics, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification). \c\cAs of 6 July 2021[update]:\c\cThe 2020 schedule by session was approved by the IOC Executive Board on 18 July 2018, with the exception of swimming, diving, and artistic swimming. A more detailed schedule by event was released on 16 April 2019, still omitting a detailed schedule for the boxing events. A detailed boxing schedule was released in late 2019. \c\cThe original schedule was from 22 July to 9 August 2020. To postpone the Olympics until 2021, all events were delayed by 364 days (one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week), giving a new schedule of 21 July to 8 August 2021. \c\cPer the historical precedent of swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, swimming finals are scheduled to be held in the morning to allow live primetime broadcasts in the Americas. NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games, which is one of the IOC's major sources of revenue. Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country. \c\cThe official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design is meant to "express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan". The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Théâtre de Liège in Belgium. The Games\' bid slogan is Discover Tomorrow (Japanese: 未来(あした)をつかもう, romanized: Ashita o tsukamō). While ashita literally means \'tomorrow\', it is intentionally spelled as mirai \'future\'. The official slogan United by Emotion was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan will be used solely in English. \c\cThe official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics is Miraitowa, a figure with blue-checkered patterns inspired by the Games\' official emblem. Its fictional characteristics include the ability to teleport. Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision. The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for "future" and "eternity", and Someity is named after someiyoshino, a type of cherry blossom. Someity's name also refers to the English phrase "so mighty". The mascots are expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandizing and licensing deals. \c\cNaoki Satō composed the music for victory ceremonies at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. \c\cAlongside the main Emblem blue, the five other colors used in the branding of the 2020 Games are   Kurenai red,   Ai blue,   Sakura pink,   Fuji purple, and   Matsuba green. These five traditional colors of Japan are used as sub-colors to create points of difference in the color variations. \c\cOn 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics instead of Istanbul or Madrid. In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games. \c\cSouth Korea asked the International Olympic Committee to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics, because South Korea's ministry of culture, sports and tourism claims the flag is a symbol of Japan's imperialist past and recalls "historic scars and pain" for people of Korea just as the swastika "reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II". Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is quite controversial, as it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions including the Attack on Pearl Harbor. However, the flag has been utilized since before World War II and it is still used by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and a variant by the Japan Self-Defense Forces. South Korea did not formally raise objections against the flag until 2011. \c\cRussian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games\' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan. \c\cPortions of the Games are scheduled for locations that were impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The Olympics torch relay was planned to begin in Fukushima, while Olympic baseball and softball matches are scheduled to be played at Fukushima Stadium, and some football matches are expected to be played in Rifu—an outskirt of Sendai, an area impacted by the earthquake and tsunami. The hosting of events in these locations has been promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions (the rescheduled Games will mark the events\' 10th anniversary), with the Games as a whole sometimes being promoted as the "Recovery Olympics" (Fukkō Gorin (復興五輪)). However, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are currently disputed. Some Tōhoku residents have questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games have slowed recovery efforts, and that the region has lost workers to projects associated with the Games. \c\cIllegal and forced loggings of domestic forests and rainforests among Malaysia and Indonesia have become additional issues, triggering concerns and protests from residents and environmental organizations. \c\cAfter consulting the organisation's Athletes\' Commission on guidelines prohibiting protests at the Olympics, such as protesting against human rights abuses or taking a knee on the podium, the IOC decided to uphold the ban. \c\cIn February 2021, the president of the Tokyo Olympics Committee Yoshiro Mori resigned, facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks. The following president Seiko Hashimoto's previous conducts have also drawn criticisms, leading her to comment "I regret it and think I should be careful" on one of the accusations. In May, a top Japanese government adviser Prof. Yoichi Takahashi resigned following a backlash over his tweets joking about Japan's pandemic "ripple". \c\cThe head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies Hiroshi Sasaki resigned in March, after making demeaning comments about a woman celebrity. \c\cThe logo of the Tokyo Olympics was withdrawn and replaced, following plagiarism accusations. The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his design was plagiarised, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs. \c\cOfficials have said that by early June, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit. "There's no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections," the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said, also stating he doesn\'t believe this will impact the operation of the Games. \c\cThe Nomura Research Institute estimated that cancelling the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021 would cost around 1.81 trillion yen ($17 billion), less than the economic damages projected if another state of emergency is declared, noting that a decision to hold the games "should be made based on the impact on infection risks, not from the standpoint of economic loss."\c\cEmperor Naruhito, Honorary Patron for the Tokyo 2020 Games, is said to be "extremely worried about the current status of coronavirus infections," and "concerned that while there are voices of anxiety among the public, the holding (of the events) may lead to the expansion of infections". \c\cSony and Panasonic are partnering with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics. In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games. Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games. \c\cThe Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to be broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38 billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The USOPC asserts that a "right of abatement" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to "negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams. According to the NBCUniversal Chief Executive Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. \c\cIn Europe, this will be the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics cover almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia. Eurosport plans to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these are set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights. In France, these will be the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France Télévisions. Eurosport is scheduled to debut as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure. \c\cIn Canada, the 2020 Games are scheduled to be shown on CBC/Radio-Canada, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN. In Australia, they will be aired by the Seven Network. In the Indian subcontinent, they will be aired by Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN).
Following torrential rainfall, a landslide was triggered which swept through the Izusan neighbourhood of Atami, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan on 3 July 2021, leaving 4 people dead and 80 more missing. The city received 310 millimetres (12.4 in) of rainfall in a 48-hour period, which prompted authorities to warn residents of "life threatening" conditions. The landslide destroyed a number of houses and left roads covered with debris. Search and rescue operations were underway as of 3 July, with local authorities reporting that they had received approximately ten phone calls from people trapped in their houses. 
The 2021 Afghanistan offensive is an ongoing military offensive led by the Taliban against the Afghan Government and its allies that is simultaneous with the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. \c\cAs of 9 July 2021, Taliban has seized 131 districts from the Afghan Government. \c\cIn the month of May, Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan Government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. \c\cDuring the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cIn the month of June, Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan Government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. Meanwhile the city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban.Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan’s main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway of Afghanistan’s capital city Kabul. \c\cIn terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cOn 19 June, Afghan Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. \c\cDuring the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. \c\cAs of 9 July, Taliban captured 47 districts from the Afghan Government. \c\cAs of 8 July, 161 Afghan National Security Forces and 24 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,163 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. While 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan. \c\cOn 9 July 2021, a Taliban spokesman from Moscow, Russia, said that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan" and pointed that it "was not part of the agreement" with the US not to attack Afghan administrative centers. Russian authorities also reported working with the group to secure the safety of neighboring Tajikistan from any foreign threat. On the other side, the Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. \c\cTurkey offered to order its troops to protect Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \c\cUS President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of US troops saying that the country had not gone to Afghanistan to "nation build". Biden added that he would not "send another generation of Americans to fight there" and pointed to other failed attempts at unifying Afghanistan in the past. He also reassured that the US safety was not at risk with any outcome of the infighting in Afghanistan.

The Taliban insurgency began after the group's fall from power during the 2001 War in Afghanistan. The Taliban forces are fighting against the Afghan government, formerly led by President Hamid Karzai, now led by President Ashraf Ghani, and against the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The insurgency has spread to some degree over the Durand Line border to neighboring Pakistan, in particular Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Taliban conduct warfare against Afghan National Security Forces and their NATO allies, as well as against civilian targets. Regional countries, particularly Pakistan, Iran, China and Russia, are often accused of funding and supporting the insurgent groups. \c\cThe leader of the Taliban is Hibatullah Akhundzada, who heads the Quetta Shura. The allied Haqqani Network, Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, and smaller al-Qaeda groups have also been part of the insurgency. \c\cFollowing the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the Taliban was defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan. In May and June 2003, high Taliban officials proclaimed the Taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel US forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah. Dadullah took charge in Zabul province. \c\cIn late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country". \c\cWhile The Taliban spent several years regrouping, they launched a re-escalation of the insurgency campaign in 2006. \c\cAs of 2017, the Taliban was composed of four different shuras, or representative councils. The first is the Quetta Shura. Two smaller shuras are subordinated to it, the Haqqani network (also known as the Miran Shah Shura) and the Peshawar Shura. The Pehsawar Shura was established in March 2005, and is based in eastern Afghanistan. The majority of its fighters are former members of the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin.  The Haqqani network declared its autonomy from the Quetta Shura in 2007, and rejoined in August 2015.  The Peshawar Shura was autonomous from 2009 until 2016. \c\cThe second autonomous shura is the Shura of the North, based in Badakhshan Province.  The third is the Mashhad Shura, sponsored by Iran, and the fourth is the Rasool Shura, led by Muhammad Rasul and also known as the High Council of the Islamic Emirate. \c\cFollowing the Battle of Tora Bora and Operation Anaconda, The Taliban were defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan, where they began the initial stages of re-grouping. \c\cPamphlets by Taliban and other groups turned up strewn in towns and the countryside in early 2003, urging Islamic faithful to rise up against U.S. forces and other foreign soldiers in holy war. On 27 January 2003, during Operation Mongoose (War in Afghanistan), a band of fighters were assaulted by U.S. forces at the Adi Ghar cave complex 25 km (15 mi) north of Spin Boldak. Eighteen rebels were reported killed with no U.S. casualties. The site was suspected to be a base for supplies and fighters coming from Pakistan. The first isolated attacks by relatively large Taliban bands on Afghan targets also appeared around that time. \c\cIn May 2003, the Taliban Supreme Court's chief justice, Abdul Salam, proclaimed that the Taliban were back, regrouped, rearmed, and ready for guerrilla war to expel U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah, who took charge in Zabul province. \c\cSmall mobile Taliban training camps were established along the border to train recruits in guerrilla warfare, according to senior Taliban warrior Mullah Malang in June 2003. Most were drawn from tribal area madrassas in Pakistan. Bases, a few with as many as 200 fighters, emerged in the tribal areas by the summer of 2003. Pakistani will to prevent infiltration was uncertain, while Pakistani military operations proved of little use. \c\cAs the summer of 2003 continued, Taliban attacks gradually increased in frequency. Dozens of Afghan government soldiers, NGO humanitarian workers, and several U.S. soldiers died in the raids, ambushes and rocket attacks. Besides guerrilla attacks, Taliban fighters began building up forces in the district of Dai Chopan in Zabul Province. The Taliban decided to make a stand there. Over the course of the summer, up to 1,000 guerrillas moved there. Over 220 people, including several dozen Afghan police, were killed in August 2003. \c\cOperation Valiant Strike was a major United States military ground operation in Afghanistan announced on 19 March 2003 that involved 2nd and 3rd battalions of 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Romanian and Afghan troops. The combined forces moved through Kandahar and parts of Southern Afghanistan with the objective of eliminating Taliban enemy forces and weapons caches while also attempting to gather intelligence on Taliban activity in the area. At the conclusion of the operation on 24 March 2003, coalition forces had detained 13 suspected Taliban fighters and confiscated more than 170 rocket-propelled grenades, 180 land mines, 20 automatic rifles and machine guns, as well as many rockets, rifles, and launchers. \c\cUnited States led-coalition forces carried out Operation Asbury Park on June 2, 2004, and June 17, 2004, of taskforce 1/6 BLT of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit engaged in fighting with Taliban and other anti-coalition forces in both Oruzgan Province and Zabul Province culminating in the Dai Chopan region of Afghanistan. This operation was characterized by atypical fighting on the side of the tactics of the Taliban and the other guerillas encountered. culminating in a large battle on June 8. During Asbury Park, the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit was faced with an opponent that frequently would dig in and engage the Marine forces, rather than the traditional hit and run (or "asymmetric attack") methods. As such, Marines, with the aid of B-1B Lancer, A-10 Warthog, and AH-64 Apache aircraft, engaged in "pitched battles each day," culminating in a large battle on June 8. The last of the fighting which took place near Dai Chopan on June 8 was decisive in that enemy forces were depleted to such an extent that no further contact was made with the enemy for the duration of the operation. What was meant by the enemy to be a three pronged attack June 8, 2004 resulted in over eighty-five confirmed kills, with estimates well in excess of 100 enemy dead, an estimated 200–300 wounded, with dozens captured. While throughout the entire operation a "handful" of US forces and Afghan Militia were injured. \c\cIn late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country". \c\cIn late June through mid-July 2005, United States Navy Seals carried out Operation Red Wings as a combined / joint military operation in the Pech District of Afghanistan's Kunar Province, on the slopes of a mountain named Sawtalo Sar, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Kunar's provincial capital of Asadabad, . Operation Red Wings was intended to disrupt local Taliban anti-coalition militia (ACM) activity, thus contributing to regional stability and thereby facilitating the Afghan Parliament elections scheduled for September 2005. At the time, Taliban anti-coalition militia activity in the region was carried out most notably by a small group, led by a local man from Nangarhar Province, Ahmad Shah, who had aspirations of regional Islamic fundamentalist prominence. He and his small group were among the primary targets of the operation. \c\cIn between August 13 and August 18 2005, United States Marine Corps carried out a military operation, called Operation Whalers that took place in Afghanistan's Kunar Province, just weeks after the disastrous Operation Red Wings. Like Operation Red Wings, the objective of Operation Whalers was the disruption of Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) activity in the region in support of further stabilizing the region for unencumbered voter turnout for the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections. Operation Whalers was planned and executed by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment (2/3). The emphasis of the operation was an Anti-Coalition Militia cell led by Ahmad Shah, which was one of 22 identified ACM groups operating in the region at that time, and was the most active. Ahmad Shah's cell was responsible for the Navy SEAL ambush and subsequent MH-47 shootdown that killed, in total, 19 U.S. special operations personnel during Operation Red Wings. Operation Whalers, named after the Hartford / New England Whalers professional hockey team, was the "sequel" to Operation Red Wings in that it was aimed at furthering stabilization of the security situation in the restive Kunar Province of Eastern Afghanistan, a long-term goal of American and coalition forces operating in the area at that time. Operation Whalers, conducted by a number of Marine infantry companies of 2/3 with attached Afghan National Army soldiers and supported by conventional Army aviation, intelligence, and combat arms forces units and U.S. Air Force aviation assets, proved a success. Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia activity dropped substantially and subsequent human intelligence and signals intelligence revealed that Ahmad Shah had been seriously wounded. Shah, who sought to disrupt the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections, was not able to undertake any significant Taliban Anti-Coalition operations subsequent to Operation Whalers in Kunar or neighboring provinces. \c\cIn 2006, Afghanistan began facing a wave of attacks by improvised explosives and suicide bombers, particularly after NATO took command of the fight against insurgents in spring 2006. \c\cAfghan President Hamid Karzai publicly condemned the methods used by the western powers. In June 2006 he said:\c\cInsurgents were also criticized for their conduct. According to Human Rights Watch, bombing and other attacks on Afghan civilians by the Taliban (and to a lesser extent Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin), are reported to have "sharply escalated in 2006" with "at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects." 131 of insurgent attacks were suicide attacks which killed 212 civilians (732 wounded), 46 Afghan army and police members (101 wounded), and 12 foreign soldiers (63 wounded). \c\cThe United Nations estimated that for the first half of 2011, the civilian deaths rose by 15% and reached 1462, which is the worst death toll since the beginning of the war and despite the surge of foreign troops. \c\cJune:\c\c6 June: A roadside bombing leaves 2 American soldiers killed, the attack took place in the province of Nangarhar. Also a separate suicide bombing in Khost leaves three US soldiers wounded. \c\c15 June: A bus carrying workers to an American base explodes killing 10 and wounding 15. The explosives were placed on the bus. \c\cJuly:\c\c1 July: 2 British soldiers are killed when their base came under small arms fire including rocket propelled grenades. \c\cAugust:\c\c8 August: 4 Canadian NATO soldiers are killed in two separate attacks. And a suicide bomber targeting a NATO convoy detonated, killing 21 people. \c\c20 August: 3 American soldiers are killed and another 3 are wounded in a battle with Taliban militants after a roadside bomb hit an American patrol. \c\cSeptember:\c\c8 September: A major suicide car bombing near the US embassy in Kabul kills 18 including 2 US soldiers. \c\c10 September: The governor of Afghanistan's southeastern Paktia province is killed alongside his bodyguard and nephew when a suicide bomber detonates himself beside the governor's car. \c\cOctober:\c\c14 October: A suicide attack in Kandahar city leaves 8 dead including one NATO soldier. \c\c15 October: 2 Canadian soldiers were killed when Taliban militants attacked NATO troops using small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades. \c\cDecember:\c\c6 December: A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a security contractor's office killing 7 including 2 Americans, the attack took place south of Afghanistan in Kandahar. \c\c19 December: Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Osmani, reportedly number 4 in the Taliban shura, is killed by an American airstrike in southern Afghanistan. \c\cThe Taliban continued to favor suicide bombing as a tactic. \c\cIn 2007 Afghanistan saw 140 more suicide bombings – more than in the past five years combined – that killed more than 300 people, many civilians. \c\cA UN report said the perpetrators were poorly educated, disaffected young men who were recruited by Taliban leaders in Pakistani madrassas. \c\cWestern analysts estimated that the Taliban can field about 10,000 fighters at any given time, according to a 30 October report in The New York Times. Of that number, "only 2,000 to 3,000 are highly motivated, full-time insurgents", the Times reported. The rest are part-timers, made up of alienated, young Afghan men angry at bombing raids or fighting in order to get money. In 2007, more foreign fighters were showing up in Afghanistan than ever before, according to Afghan and United States officials. An estimated 100 to 300 full-time combatants are foreigners, usually from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Chechnya, various Arab countries and perhaps even Turkey and western China. They tend to be more fanatical and violent, and they often bring skills such as the ability to post more sophisticated videos on the Internet or bombmaking expertise. It has also been reported that the Taliban now control up to 54% of Afghanistan. \c\cOn 15 April, the Afghan Government promised to end all hostage deals with the Taliban after two Afghan kidnapped victims were executed in an agreement to free an Italian journalist. \c\cJanuary:\c\c23 January: A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a US base in eastern Afghanistan killing 10 people who were waiting outside the base. \c\cFebruary:\c\c2 February: Taliban forces raided a southern Afghan town destroying the government center and briefly holding some elders captive. \c\c19 February: The Taliban briefly seized a small town in western Afghanistan after police fled the town, the Taliban forces moved in for 30 minutes and seized three vehicles. \c\c20 February: A suicide bomber blew himself up during an opening hospital ceremony injuring 2 NATO soldiers and a hospital worker. \c\c27 February: 23 people are killed when a suicide bomber attacks an American military base, Bagram Airfield (BAF) in Bagram District, Parwan Province. The attack took place while US vice president Dick Cheney was in the compound. Cheney was unhurt in the attack and was the intended target of the attack as claimed by the Taliban. The dead included an American soldier, a Korean soldier, and an American contractor. \c\cMarch:\c\c4 March: A suicide bomber attacks an American convoy which leaves 16 civilians dead in the aftermath as the American convey begins to sporadically fire at civilian cars around them.

He noted that the Afghan Taliban are "always welcome" in Afghanistan, although foreign militants are not. \c\c9 April: Six Canadian soldiers were killed in southern Afghanistan when they struck a roadside bomb. A separate roadside bombing, also in south Afghanistan, left another NATO soldier dead and one wounded. In another incident, a statement from the Taliban's spokesperson claimed that they had beheaded a translator for a kidnapped Italian journalist. \c\c15 April: A suicide bomber struck a US-private security firm, killing four Afghans working for the company. \c\c16 April: A suicide bomber ran onto a police training field and detonating his explosive device, killed 10 police officers and wounded dozens of others.

A roadside bomb also hit an Afghan intelligence service vehicle, killing all four who were inside. \c\c30 April: Hundreds of Afghans took to the streets in western Afghanistan, accusing US soldiers of killing scores of civilians in fighting which the coalition said killed 136 Taliban in a three-week operation. \c\cMay:\c\c13 May: Mullah Dadullah, the Taliban's top military commander in Afghanistan, is killed in fighting in the south. \c\c23 May: The Taliban's newly named top field commander, Mullah Bakht Mohammed, brother and replacement of deceased field commander Mullah Dadullah, makes his first public statement, saying the Taliban will "pursue holy war until the occupying countries leave."\c\cJuly:\c\c19 July: The South Korean hostage crisis involved the hostage taking of twenty-three South Korean Christian aid workers in the Ghazni Province which resulted in the death of two. The crisis ended on 30 August with the release of the remaining hostages as part of a deal with the South Korean diplomats of government. \c\cAugust:\c\c31 August: A suicide bomber detonated his explosive-laden vehicle after ramming three military vehicles at the military gate of the Kabul International Airport. Two Afghan soldiers were killed and ten people were injured. \c\cSeptember:\c\c29 September: In an effort to reach a compromise with the Taliban leaders, the president, Hamid Karzai would make a quid quo pro by allowing militants to have a place in government if they stopped fighting. Taliban leaders replied by saying there would be no compromise unless intervening forces such as NATO and the U.S. left. \c\cNovember:\c\c2 November: Mawlawi Abdul Manan, an important Taliban figure, is killed by Afghan Security forces. His death is confirmed by the Taliban. \c\cThe U.S. warned that in 2008 the Taliban has "coalesced into a resilient insurgency", and would "maintain or even increase the scope and pace of its terrorist attacks". Attacks by Taliban insurgents in eastern Afghanistan increased by 40% when compared to the same period in 2007. \c\cFebruary\c\c24 February: Poor military intelligence leads to conflicted reports of a possible Taliban spring offensive. \c\cAugust\c\c19 August: Taliban forces kill 9 French troops (with a 10th death in an accident) near Kabul. \c\cOctober\c\c6 October: CNN reported that, via Saudi intermediaries, the Taliban is negotiating to end the conflict in Afghanistan, and that the Taliban has split from Al Qaeda. \c\cDecember:\c\c7 December: 200 Taliban armed with RPGs and automatic weapons attack two NATO supply depots outside of Peshawar destroying 100 vehicles packed with supplies intended to support the NATO effort in Afghanistan. \c\c8 December: 200 Taliban armed with RPGs and automatic weapons attack a NATO supply depot outside of Peshawar destroying 53 container trucks packed with supplies intended to support the NATO effort in Afghanistan. \c\cDuring 2009 the Taliban regained control over the countryside of several Afghan provinces. In August 2009, Taliban commanders in the province of Helmand started issuing "visa" from the "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan" in order to allow travel to and from the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah. \c\cJune:\c\c30 June: US Army Private First Class soldier Bowe R. Bergdahl is captured by the Taliban in Southern Afghanistan. \c\cJuly:\c\c18 July: The Taliban release a video showing Bergdahl being interviewed by one of his captors. \c\cAugust:\c\c12 August: Taliban spokesmen threaten the public not to vote in the upcoming presidential elections. \c\c15 August: 2009 NATO Afghanistan headquarters bombing:\c\cA suicide car bomb explodes outside NATO headquarters in Kabul, killing at least seven and wounding almost 100. ISAF troops were reported among the wounded. \c\c25 August: A massive car bomb shakes Kandahar, killing at least 30 and wounding dozens as buildings collapse in the city's center. The attack comes after the first results of the presidential elections were announced. Four U.S. soldiers die in an IED explosion in southern Afghanistan bringing ISAF losses to 295, eclipsing 2008's coalition death toll of 294. \c\cSeptember:\c\c4 September: U.S. airstrike on two fuel tankers kill at least 70 people in Farah Province after it was hijacked by Taliban militants. Angry relatives of those killed claim civilians were collecting fuel from the tankers when the airstrike came. \c\cDecember:\c\cOn 1 December, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops to help battle the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban reacted to the President's speech by saying they will step up their fight in Afghanistan. A Taliban commander told the BBC that if more US troops came, more would die. \c\cAfter his disputed re-election, President Hamid Karzai announced to move ahead with a plan for a Loya Jirga to discuss the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban would be invited to take part in this Jirga. \c\cDuring 2010, the Taliban were ousted from parts of Helmand Province by the ISAF Operation Moshtarak that started in February 2010. In the meantime the Taliban insurgency spread to the northern provinces of the country. The new policy of the Taliban was to shift militants from the south to the north, to show they exist "everywhere", according to Faryab Province Governor Abdul Haq Shafaq. With most Afghan and NATO troops stationed in the southern and eastern provinces, villagers in the once-peaceful north found themselves confronted with a rapid deterioration of security, as insurgents seized new territory in provinces such as Kunduz and Baghlan, and even infiltrated the mountains of Badakhshan Province in the northeast. \c\cJanuary:\c\c17 January: "Kabul's day of terror":\c\cOn this day, gunbattles near the presidential palace and other government buildings paralyzed the Afghan capital for hours. \c\cAs President Karzai was swearing in his new cabinet ministers inside the presidential palace, militants performed attacks on multiple locations in Kabul, including shopping malls, a cinema and the central bank. A team of gunmen launched a spectacular assault in "commando style" with two men detonating suicide bombs and the rest fighting to the death near the gates of the presidential palace, an operation by insurgents to terrorize the Afghan capital, further demoralizing the population and lending to the impression that virtually no part of the country could be safe. The Taliban said it had deployed 20 suicide bombers in explosive vests who were also armed with heavy and light weaponry\c\cA western security official estimated there is a security incident in Kabul, on average, every seven to 10 days. \c\cFebruary:\c\c26 February: Militants target hotels and guest houses in Kabul. Up to nine Indians, an Italian diplomat and a French film maker were among the dead in the worst assault on the Afghan capital for several months. A four-hour battle began with a car bombing and included suicide bombers and Taliban fighters throwing grenades. The attacks appeared to be aimed at Indian government officials and medical workers. Three Afghan police were killed, and six more officers were among the 38 people wounded in what was described as a well-planned and co-ordinated attack. \c\cJune:\c\c2–4 June: Main article: Afghan Peace Jirga 2010\c\cThe Karzai administration organized the Afghan Peace Jirga in Kabul that was announced after the 2009 presidential elections. The Taliban were not invited. \c\cJuly:\c\c20–29 July: International Conference on Afghanistan in Kabul\c\cAugust:\c\c6 August: killing of 10 members of a Christian charity's medical team in the mountains of Badakhshan.Main article: 2010 Badakhshan massacre\c\c10 August: Amnesty International states that the International Criminal Court should open a formal investigation into crimes committed by the Taliban and other insurgent groups in Afghanistan. \c\cThe insurgency continued strongly in 2011. \c\cThe Taliban continued attacking and ambushing NATO and Afghan troops as well as the targeted assassination of government officials. \c\cJanuary:\c\c29 January: The deputy governor of Kandahar was killed in a suicide attack. Three months later, on 15 April the Kandahar chief police, General Khan Mohammed Mujahid was killed. \c\cApril:\c\cIt was reported that in 2011, the United States was spending 2 billion dollars per week fighting in Afghanistan against the Taliban. In a 2011 forecast the war in Afghanistan was estimated at 108 billion dollars for the year, while the Iraqi War was estimated at 50 billion. \c\cMay:\c\c28 May: The Taliban assassinated one of their main opponents, Mohammed Daud Daud, in a bomb attack. Six others were also killed. He was the chief of the police for the northern of Afghanistan. \c\cJuly:\c\c18 July: President Karzai's advisor, Jan Mohammad Khan, was assassinated in Kabul by the Taliban in an attack that also killed an Afghan deputy. \c\cAs of 18 July, coalition forces started their plan of transition by handing power of several areas to the Afghan authority following their plan of future pull out of the country. A Taliban militant who had infiltrated the Afghan police force killed seven other policemen in Lashkar Gah. The same day the police chief of Registaan district and three other policemen were killed in bomb attacks. \c\cAs of 22 July 325 coalition fighters were killed, more than 55% of the deaths caused by IED's. \c\c19 July: ISAF General Chief David Petraeus left his position with mixed results. During his time as the head of ISAF, 3775 insurgents were killed or captured in 2832 raids while 713 NATO soldiers were killed. Overall the level of violence in the country increased. He was replaced by General John Allen. \c\cBetween 20 and 22 July, NATO troops killed 50 Haqquani fighters in an attack on their camp. \c\c24 July: A US military investigation discovered that a portion of the 2 billion dollars in funds given by the United States in contracts had fallen in the hands of the insurgency. \c\c27 July: The mayor of Kandahar, Ghulam Haidar Hameedi, was killed in a suicide attack. \c\c28 July: Suicide bombers and snipers attacked the police headquarters of Tarin Kowt in a large-scale attack which killed more than 21 people including Afghan reporter Ahmed Omed Khpulwak. According to the Afghan interior minister, for the 2-year period between 19 March 2009 and 19 March 2011, 2770 Afghan policemen were killed and 4785 wounded while 1052 Afghan soldiers were killed and 2413 wounded. \c\c31 July: 10 Afghan policemen were killed in a suicide attack in Lashkar Gah where Afghan security forces had taken over from NATO a week before. The same day, 10 Afghan guards who were protecting a NATO supplies convoy were killed in the attack. One day before, 5 Afghans soldiers and 2 NATO soldiers were killed in a bomb attack on their patrol. \c\cAugust:\c\c6 August: 31 American Special Forces soldiers were killed in the crash of their helicopter probably shot down during a fight with the Taliban. Seven Afghan soldiers were also killed. This was the biggest death toll for NATO troops in the whole war. Most of the American soldiers killed were Navy SEALs. \c\c7 August: 4 NATO soldiers were killed, including two French Foreign Legion members, and 5 others were wounded. \c\cThe Taliban insurgency continued into 2012. \c\cAugust:\c\c27 August:\c\cTaliban insurgents in the Taliban-controlled southern Helmand area killed 17 civilians – fifteen men and two women – who were attending a party. A government official said that the victims were beheaded for celebrating with music and mixgender dancing in the Musa Qala district of Helmand, which ran contrary to the Taliban's extreme brand of Islam. Later, however, a provincial government official said that the 17 people killed were due to a fight between two Taliban commanders over two women (who were also killed). The civilians were either beheaded or had their throats cut, but some showed signs of gunshot wounds or beatings. \c\cThe attacks were condemned by Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, who ordered an investigation into the attack, the leader of the NATO coalition led by the United States, the United Nations, and the European Union. However, the Taliban has denied responsibility for the attack, saying that no Taliban members have ever killed civilians. \c\cThe attack occurred on the same day when two United States troops were killed by an Afghan soldier. \c\c10 Afghan soldiers were killed by the Taliban, also in the Helmand province. \c\cOn 3 April, Taliban gunmen and bombers attacked Farah, killing 34 civilians and 10 members of the security forces. Nine attackers were killed. \c\cIn Kabul in June, a Taliban suicide car bomber killed 16 people on the 11th. Gunmen and bombers killed three security guards on the 25th; eight attackers were killed. \c\cOn 13 September, Taliban gunmen and bombers killed eight security guards and a policeman in Herat. All seven attackers were killed. \c\cAs the American troops began to depart, and the number of Taliban attacks increased, there was speculation that the Taliban were waiting for an American withdrawal before launching a major offensive. \c\c25 July - Afghan insurgents killed 17 Shia civilians travelling from Kabul. \c\c13 December -  Assassination of Atiqullah Raufi. \c\c2015 saw the Taliban make various gains in Afghanistan in an attempt to fracture the fledgling Afghan government with successes not seen since NATO intervened in 2001. The Taliban has increased suicide attacks and has made multiple territorial gains across the country. \c\cBeginning in April, the Taliban fought for the city of Kunduz in the northern Kunduz Province with them capturing the city by September. Afghan Armed Forces recaptured the city in October but local sources dispute this claim. The quick fall of the city resulted in calls by some government officials for President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Abdullah Abdullah to resign. \c\cIn December, the Taliban made more territorial gains by besieging Afghan forces in the cities of Lashkar Gah, Sangin and outlying towns in the Helmand Province in Southern Afghanistan. By late December, most of Sangin was captured by the Taliban with local Afghan forces surrounded and forced to rely on airlifts for ammunition and food. \c\cThe gains made by the Taliban have hampered peace talks between them and the government and made rifts appear in the Taliban over negotiations. In response to the new offensives, it was reported that the United States would slow down their withdrawal of troops to help in counter-insurgency operations. \c\c14 April: Taliban attacking Kunduz;\c\c31 May: kidnapping a bus with 220 people, killing 10;\c\c1 June storming a court in Ghazni, 5 dead Taliban and 5 dead others;\c\cJune: Taliban have 25,000 fighters in Helmand, Kandahar and Uruzgan, according to US sources;\c\c18 July attacking Qalai Zal, unsuccessfully;\c\cJuly: 20% of Afghanistan is in Taliban hands, said Time magazine;\c\cDecember: Taliban controls 10% of Afghanistan, said the US military. \c\cThroughout most of the year, the US government maintained high-level talks with the Taliban, in an effort to secure a peace deal with the insurgency. However, a suicide bombing in Kabul on 7 September 2019 which killed 11 people and one American soldier prompted the US President to break-off peace talks with the Taliban. In mid September, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged that the Taliban had suffered more than 1,000 war casualties in the space of only one week since the US broke off peace negotiations with the Taliban. \c\cOn 29 February, the United-States reached an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, in Doha, Qatar. The agreement calls for the withdrawal of all 13,000 U.S. and allied troops over the next 14 months, on the condition that the Taliban continues with the peace process. The first withdrawal, of around 5,000 personnel, will occur within the next 135 days. \c\cThe peace deal stipulates that the Taliban not allow terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda “to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.” If successful, the peace deal will bring an end to 18-years of conflict. Only days after signing the historic deal, US forces conducted airstrikes on Taliban soldiers as a "defensive" measure, as Taliban fighters were "actively attacking" an Afghan government checkpoint. \c\cOn 2 May, the US revealed that the agreement included an informal commitment for both sides to cut violence by 80%. Since the agreement was signed, attacks on cities and coalition forces had decreased, but overall attacks had increased 70% compared with the same period in 2019, according to Reuters. The Taliban claim that attacks have fallen since the agreement was signed. \c\cOn 14 May, a Taliban suicide truck bomber killed five civilians in Gardez, Paktia Province. On 18 May, the Taliban killed nine people in a similar attack in Ghazni Province.[citation needed]\c\cOn 29 May, it was revealed that numerous Taliban and Taliban-aligned Haqqani Network leaders were infected with COVID-19. This resulted in the late founder Mullah Mohammad Omar's son Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob being made the entire organization's acting leader. \c\cIn 2021, the United States forces and allies started to withdraw from Afghanistan which allowed the Taliban to intensify their insurgency. \c\cOn 29 June, intense fighting between Taliban insurgents and government forces killed 28 civilians and injured another 290 during the past week, according to the head of a hospital in Kunduz, with the majority of the dead being children, women and elderly people. The Taliban had moved beyond its southern strongholds and had intensified the fighting in the north, according to military experts. \c\cOn 2 July, U.S. troops fully left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces as the coalition, including the U.S., prepared to leave Afghanistan after 20 years. Meanwhile, fighting continued between the Taliban and government forces, with analysts said that the Taliban would be "at the door of Kabul". Afterwards, Bagram Airfield was looted by locals following the sudden American withdrawal from the airbase, which was conducted without any coordination with local officials. Afghan troops later cleared the airbase of looters and secured control of it. \c\cHowever, it was reported that, during June, the Taliban captured 700 Humvees as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems from the Afghan National Army as more districts fall under the group's control during their offensive in the north. \c\cOn 4 July, the Taliban took control of several further districts overnight as Afghan troops abandoned their posts and fled into neighboring Tajikistan via Badakhshan Province. The State Committee for National Security of Tajikistan reported that more than 300 Afghan troops crossed the Tajik border as Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed that most of the territory gaining occurred without a fight. \c\cWhile the pre-2001 Taliban suppressed opium production, the current insurgency "relies on opium revenues to purchase weapons, train its members, and buy support." In 2001, Afghanistan produced only 11% of the world's opium. Today it produces 93% of the global crop, and the drug trade accounts for half of Afghanistan's GDP. \c\cOn 28 July 2009, Richard Holbrooke, the United States special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that money transfers from Western Europe and the Gulf States exceeded the drug trade earnings and that a new task force had been formed to shut down this source of funds. \c\cThe United States Agency for International Development is investigating the possibility that kickbacks from its contracts are being funneled to the Taliban. \c\cA report by the London School of Economics (LSE) claimed to provide the most concrete evidence yet that the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI is providing funding, training and sanctuary to the Taliban on a scale much larger than previously thought. The report's author Matt Waldman spoke to nine Taliban field commanders in Afghanistan and concluded that Pakistan's relationship with the insurgents ran far deeper than previously realized. Some of those interviewed suggested that the organization even attended meetings of the Taliban's supreme council, the Quetta Shura. A spokesman for the Pakistani military dismissed the report, describing it as "malicious".
The Taliban insurgency began after the group's fall from power during the 2001 War in Afghanistan. The Taliban forces are fighting against the Afghan government, formerly led by President Hamid Karzai, now led by President Ashraf Ghani, and against the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The insurgency has spread to some degree over the Durand Line border to neighboring Pakistan, in particular Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Taliban conduct warfare against Afghan National Security Forces and their NATO allies, as well as against civilian targets. Regional countries, particularly Pakistan, Iran, China and Russia, are often accused of funding and supporting the insurgent groups. \c\cThe leader of the Taliban is Hibatullah Akhundzada, who heads the Quetta Shura. The allied Haqqani Network, Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, and smaller al-Qaeda groups have also been part of the insurgency. \c\cFollowing the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the Taliban was defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan. In May and June 2003, high Taliban officials proclaimed the Taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel US forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah. Dadullah took charge in Zabul province. \c\cIn late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country". \c\cWhile The Taliban spent several years regrouping, they launched a re-escalation of the insurgency campaign in 2006. \c\cAs of 2017, the Taliban was composed of four different shuras, or representative councils. The first is the Quetta Shura. Two smaller shuras are subordinated to it, the Haqqani network (also known as the Miran Shah Shura) and the Peshawar Shura. The Pehsawar Shura was established in March 2005, and is based in eastern Afghanistan. The majority of its fighters are former members of the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin.  The Haqqani network declared its autonomy from the Quetta Shura in 2007, and rejoined in August 2015.  The Peshawar Shura was autonomous from 2009 until 2016. \c\cThe second autonomous shura is the Shura of the North, based in Badakhshan Province.  The third is the Mashhad Shura, sponsored by Iran, and the fourth is the Rasool Shura, led by Muhammad Rasul and also known as the High Council of the Islamic Emirate. \c\cFollowing the Battle of Tora Bora and Operation Anaconda, The Taliban were defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan, where they began the initial stages of re-grouping. \c\cPamphlets by Taliban and other groups turned up strewn in towns and the countryside in early 2003, urging Islamic faithful to rise up against U.S. forces and other foreign soldiers in holy war. On 27 January 2003, during Operation Mongoose (War in Afghanistan), a band of fighters were assaulted by U.S. forces at the Adi Ghar cave complex 25 km (15 mi) north of Spin Boldak. Eighteen rebels were reported killed with no U.S. casualties. The site was suspected to be a base for supplies and fighters coming from Pakistan. The first isolated attacks by relatively large Taliban bands on Afghan targets also appeared around that time. \c\cIn May 2003, the Taliban Supreme Court's chief justice, Abdul Salam, proclaimed that the Taliban were back, regrouped, rearmed, and ready for guerrilla war to expel U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah, who took charge in Zabul province. \c\cSmall mobile Taliban training camps were established along the border to train recruits in guerrilla warfare, according to senior Taliban warrior Mullah Malang in June 2003. Most were drawn from tribal area madrassas in Pakistan. Bases, a few with as many as 200 fighters, emerged in the tribal areas by the summer of 2003. Pakistani will to prevent infiltration was uncertain, while Pakistani military operations proved of little use. \c\cAs the summer of 2003 continued, Taliban attacks gradually increased in frequency. Dozens of Afghan government soldiers, NGO humanitarian workers, and several U.S. soldiers died in the raids, ambushes and rocket attacks. Besides guerrilla attacks, Taliban fighters began building up forces in the district of Dai Chopan in Zabul Province. The Taliban decided to make a stand there. Over the course of the summer, up to 1,000 guerrillas moved there. Over 220 people, including several dozen Afghan police, were killed in August 2003. \c\cOperation Valiant Strike was a major United States military ground operation in Afghanistan announced on 19 March 2003 that involved 2nd and 3rd battalions of 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Romanian and Afghan troops. The combined forces moved through Kandahar and parts of Southern Afghanistan with the objective of eliminating Taliban enemy forces and weapons caches while also attempting to gather intelligence on Taliban activity in the area. At the conclusion of the operation on 24 March 2003, coalition forces had detained 13 suspected Taliban fighters and confiscated more than 170 rocket-propelled grenades, 180 land mines, 20 automatic rifles and machine guns, as well as many rockets, rifles, and launchers. \c\cUnited States led-coalition forces carried out Operation Asbury Park on June 2, 2004, and June 17, 2004, of taskforce 1/6 BLT of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit engaged in fighting with Taliban and other anti-coalition forces in both Oruzgan Province and Zabul Province culminating in the Dai Chopan region of Afghanistan. This operation was characterized by atypical fighting on the side of the tactics of the Taliban and the other guerillas encountered. culminating in a large battle on June 8. During Asbury Park, the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit was faced with an opponent that frequently would dig in and engage the Marine forces, rather than the traditional hit and run (or "asymmetric attack") methods. As such, Marines, with the aid of B-1B Lancer, A-10 Warthog, and AH-64 Apache aircraft, engaged in "pitched battles each day," culminating in a large battle on June 8. The last of the fighting which took place near Dai Chopan on June 8 was decisive in that enemy forces were depleted to such an extent that no further contact was made with the enemy for the duration of the operation. What was meant by the enemy to be a three pronged attack June 8, 2004 resulted in over eighty-five confirmed kills, with estimates well in excess of 100 enemy dead, an estimated 200–300 wounded, with dozens captured. While throughout the entire operation a "handful" of US forces and Afghan Militia were injured. \c\cIn late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country". \c\cIn late June through mid-July 2005, United States Navy Seals carried out Operation Red Wings as a combined / joint military operation in the Pech District of Afghanistan's Kunar Province, on the slopes of a mountain named Sawtalo Sar, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Kunar's provincial capital of Asadabad, . Operation Red Wings was intended to disrupt local Taliban anti-coalition militia (ACM) activity, thus contributing to regional stability and thereby facilitating the Afghan Parliament elections scheduled for September 2005. At the time, Taliban anti-coalition militia activity in the region was carried out most notably by a small group, led by a local man from Nangarhar Province, Ahmad Shah, who had aspirations of regional Islamic fundamentalist prominence. He and his small group were among the primary targets of the operation. \c\cIn between August 13 and August 18 2005, United States Marine Corps carried out a military operation, called Operation Whalers that took place in Afghanistan's Kunar Province, just weeks after the disastrous Operation Red Wings. Like Operation Red Wings, the objective of Operation Whalers was the disruption of Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) activity in the region in support of further stabilizing the region for unencumbered voter turnout for the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections. Operation Whalers was planned and executed by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment (2/3). The emphasis of the operation was an Anti-Coalition Militia cell led by Ahmad Shah, which was one of 22 identified ACM groups operating in the region at that time, and was the most active. Ahmad Shah's cell was responsible for the Navy SEAL ambush and subsequent MH-47 shootdown that killed, in total, 19 U.S. special operations personnel during Operation Red Wings. Operation Whalers, named after the Hartford / New England Whalers professional hockey team, was the "sequel" to Operation Red Wings in that it was aimed at furthering stabilization of the security situation in the restive Kunar Province of Eastern Afghanistan, a long-term goal of American and coalition forces operating in the area at that time. Operation Whalers, conducted by a number of Marine infantry companies of 2/3 with attached Afghan National Army soldiers and supported by conventional Army aviation, intelligence, and combat arms forces units and U.S. Air Force aviation assets, proved a success. Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia activity dropped substantially and subsequent human intelligence and signals intelligence revealed that Ahmad Shah had been seriously wounded. Shah, who sought to disrupt the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections, was not able to undertake any significant Taliban Anti-Coalition operations subsequent to Operation Whalers in Kunar or neighboring provinces. \c\cIn 2006, Afghanistan began facing a wave of attacks by improvised explosives and suicide bombers, particularly after NATO took command of the fight against insurgents in spring 2006. \c\cAfghan President Hamid Karzai publicly condemned the methods used by the western powers. In June 2006 he said:\c\cInsurgents were also criticized for their conduct. According to Human Rights Watch, bombing and other attacks on Afghan civilians by the Taliban (and to a lesser extent Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin), are reported to have "sharply escalated in 2006" with "at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects." 131 of insurgent attacks were suicide attacks which killed 212 civilians (732 wounded), 46 Afghan army and police members (101 wounded), and 12 foreign soldiers (63 wounded). \c\cThe United Nations estimated that for the first half of 2011, the civilian deaths rose by 15% and reached 1462, which is the worst death toll since the beginning of the war and despite the surge of foreign troops. \c\cJune:\c\c6 June: A roadside bombing leaves 2 American soldiers killed, the attack took place in the province of Nangarhar. Also a separate suicide bombing in Khost leaves three US soldiers wounded. \c\c15 June: A bus carrying workers to an American base explodes killing 10 and wounding 15. The explosives were placed on the bus. \c\cJuly:\c\c1 July: 2 British soldiers are killed when their base came under small arms fire including rocket propelled grenades. \c\cAugust:\c\c8 August: 4 Canadian NATO soldiers are killed in two separate attacks. And a suicide bomber targeting a NATO convoy detonated, killing 21 people. \c\c20 August: 3 American soldiers are killed and another 3 are wounded in a battle with Taliban militants after a roadside bomb hit an American patrol. \c\cSeptember:\c\c8 September: A major suicide car bombing near the US embassy in Kabul kills 18 including 2 US soldiers. \c\c10 September: The governor of Afghanistan's southeastern Paktia province is killed alongside his bodyguard and nephew when a suicide bomber detonates himself beside the governor's car. \c\cOctober:\c\c14 October: A suicide attack in Kandahar city leaves 8 dead including one NATO soldier. \c\c15 October: 2 Canadian soldiers were killed when Taliban militants attacked NATO troops using small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades. \c\cDecember:\c\c6 December: A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a security contractor's office killing 7 including 2 Americans, the attack took place south of Afghanistan in Kandahar. \c\c19 December: Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Osmani, reportedly number 4 in the Taliban shura, is killed by an American airstrike in southern Afghanistan. \c\cThe Taliban continued to favor suicide bombing as a tactic. \c\cIn 2007 Afghanistan saw 140 more suicide bombings – more than in the past five years combined – that killed more than 300 people, many civilians. \c\cA UN report said the perpetrators were poorly educated, disaffected young men who were recruited by Taliban leaders in Pakistani madrassas. \c\cWestern analysts estimated that the Taliban can field about 10,000 fighters at any given time, according to a 30 October report in The New York Times. Of that number, "only 2,000 to 3,000 are highly motivated, full-time insurgents", the Times reported. The rest are part-timers, made up of alienated, young Afghan men angry at bombing raids or fighting in order to get money. In 2007, more foreign fighters were showing up in Afghanistan than ever before, according to Afghan and United States officials. An estimated 100 to 300 full-time combatants are foreigners, usually from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Chechnya, various Arab countries and perhaps even Turkey and western China. They tend to be more fanatical and violent, and they often bring skills such as the ability to post more sophisticated videos on the Internet or bombmaking expertise. It has also been reported that the Taliban now control up to 54% of Afghanistan. \c\cOn 15 April, the Afghan Government promised to end all hostage deals with the Taliban after two Afghan kidnapped victims were executed in an agreement to free an Italian journalist. \c\cJanuary:\c\c23 January: A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a US base in eastern Afghanistan killing 10 people who were waiting outside the base. \c\cFebruary:\c\c2 February: Taliban forces raided a southern Afghan town destroying the government center and briefly holding some elders captive. \c\c19 February: The Taliban briefly seized a small town in western Afghanistan after police fled the town, the Taliban forces moved in for 30 minutes and seized three vehicles. \c\c20 February: A suicide bomber blew himself up during an opening hospital ceremony injuring 2 NATO soldiers and a hospital worker. \c\c27 February: 23 people are killed when a suicide bomber attacks an American military base, Bagram Airfield (BAF) in Bagram District, Parwan Province. The attack took place while US vice president Dick Cheney was in the compound. Cheney was unhurt in the attack and was the intended target of the attack as claimed by the Taliban. The dead included an American soldier, a Korean soldier, and an American contractor. \c\cMarch:\c\c4 March: A suicide bomber attacks an American convoy which leaves 16 civilians dead in the aftermath as the American convey begins to sporadically fire at civilian cars around them.

He noted that the Afghan Taliban are "always welcome" in Afghanistan, although foreign militants are not. \c\c9 April: Six Canadian soldiers were killed in southern Afghanistan when they struck a roadside bomb. A separate roadside bombing, also in south Afghanistan, left another NATO soldier dead and one wounded. In another incident, a statement from the Taliban's spokesperson claimed that they had beheaded a translator for a kidnapped Italian journalist. \c\c15 April: A suicide bomber struck a US-private security firm, killing four Afghans working for the company. \c\c16 April: A suicide bomber ran onto a police training field and detonating his explosive device, killed 10 police officers and wounded dozens of others.

A roadside bomb also hit an Afghan intelligence service vehicle, killing all four who were inside. \c\c30 April: Hundreds of Afghans took to the streets in western Afghanistan, accusing US soldiers of killing scores of civilians in fighting which the coalition said killed 136 Taliban in a three-week operation. \c\cMay:\c\c13 May: Mullah Dadullah, the Taliban's top military commander in Afghanistan, is killed in fighting in the south. \c\c23 May: The Taliban's newly named top field commander, Mullah Bakht Mohammed, brother and replacement of deceased field commander Mullah Dadullah, makes his first public statement, saying the Taliban will "pursue holy war until the occupying countries leave."\c\cJuly:\c\c19 July: The South Korean hostage crisis involved the hostage taking of twenty-three South Korean Christian aid workers in the Ghazni Province which resulted in the death of two. The crisis ended on 30 August with the release of the remaining hostages as part of a deal with the South Korean diplomats of government. \c\cAugust:\c\c31 August: A suicide bomber detonated his explosive-laden vehicle after ramming three military vehicles at the military gate of the Kabul International Airport. Two Afghan soldiers were killed and ten people were injured. \c\cSeptember:\c\c29 September: In an effort to reach a compromise with the Taliban leaders, the president, Hamid Karzai would make a quid quo pro by allowing militants to have a place in government if they stopped fighting. Taliban leaders replied by saying there would be no compromise unless intervening forces such as NATO and the U.S. left. \c\cNovember:\c\c2 November: Mawlawi Abdul Manan, an important Taliban figure, is killed by Afghan Security forces. His death is confirmed by the Taliban. \c\cThe U.S. warned that in 2008 the Taliban has "coalesced into a resilient insurgency", and would "maintain or even increase the scope and pace of its terrorist attacks". Attacks by Taliban insurgents in eastern Afghanistan increased by 40% when compared to the same period in 2007. \c\cFebruary\c\c24 February: Poor military intelligence leads to conflicted reports of a possible Taliban spring offensive. \c\cAugust\c\c19 August: Taliban forces kill 9 French troops (with a 10th death in an accident) near Kabul. \c\cOctober\c\c6 October: CNN reported that, via Saudi intermediaries, the Taliban is negotiating to end the conflict in Afghanistan, and that the Taliban has split from Al Qaeda. \c\cDecember:\c\c7 December: 200 Taliban armed with RPGs and automatic weapons attack two NATO supply depots outside of Peshawar destroying 100 vehicles packed with supplies intended to support the NATO effort in Afghanistan. \c\c8 December: 200 Taliban armed with RPGs and automatic weapons attack a NATO supply depot outside of Peshawar destroying 53 container trucks packed with supplies intended to support the NATO effort in Afghanistan. \c\cDuring 2009 the Taliban regained control over the countryside of several Afghan provinces. In August 2009, Taliban commanders in the province of Helmand started issuing "visa" from the "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan" in order to allow travel to and from the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah. \c\cJune:\c\c30 June: US Army Private First Class soldier Bowe R. Bergdahl is captured by the Taliban in Southern Afghanistan. \c\cJuly:\c\c18 July: The Taliban release a video showing Bergdahl being interviewed by one of his captors. \c\cAugust:\c\c12 August: Taliban spokesmen threaten the public not to vote in the upcoming presidential elections. \c\c15 August: 2009 NATO Afghanistan headquarters bombing:\c\cA suicide car bomb explodes outside NATO headquarters in Kabul, killing at least seven and wounding almost 100.

Angry relatives of those killed claim civilians were collecting fuel from the tankers when the airstrike came. \c\cDecember:\c\cOn 1 December, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops to help battle the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban reacted to the President's speech by saying they will step up their fight in Afghanistan. A Taliban commander told the BBC that if more US troops came, more would die. \c\cAfter his disputed re-election, President Hamid Karzai announced to move ahead with a plan for a Loya Jirga to discuss the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban would be invited to take part in this Jirga. \c\cDuring 2010, the Taliban were ousted from parts of Helmand Province by the ISAF Operation Moshtarak that started in February 2010. In the meantime the Taliban insurgency spread to the northern provinces of the country. The new policy of the Taliban was to shift militants from the south to the north, to show they exist "everywhere", according to Faryab Province Governor Abdul Haq Shafaq. With most Afghan and NATO troops stationed in the southern and eastern provinces, villagers in the once-peaceful north found themselves confronted with a rapid deterioration of security, as insurgents seized new territory in provinces such as Kunduz and Baghlan, and even infiltrated the mountains of Badakhshan Province in the northeast. \c\cJanuary:\c\c17 January: "Kabul's day of terror":\c\cOn this day, gunbattles near the presidential palace and other government buildings paralyzed the Afghan capital for hours. \c\cAs President Karzai was swearing in his new cabinet ministers inside the presidential palace, militants performed attacks on multiple locations in Kabul, including shopping malls, a cinema and the central bank. A team of gunmen launched a spectacular assault in "commando style" with two men detonating suicide bombs and the rest fighting to the death near the gates of the presidential palace, an operation by insurgents to terrorize the Afghan capital, further demoralizing the population and lending to the impression that virtually no part of the country could be safe. The Taliban said it had deployed 20 suicide bombers in explosive vests who were also armed with heavy and light weaponry\c\cA western security official estimated there is a security incident in Kabul, on average, every seven to 10 days. \c\cFebruary:\c\c26 February: Militants target hotels and guest houses in Kabul. Up to nine Indians, an Italian diplomat and a French film maker were among the dead in the worst assault on the Afghan capital for several months. A four-hour battle began with a car bombing and included suicide bombers and Taliban fighters throwing grenades. The attacks appeared to be aimed at Indian government officials and medical workers. Three Afghan police were killed, and six more officers were among the 38 people wounded in what was described as a well-planned and co-ordinated attack. \c\cJune:\c\c2–4 June: Main article: Afghan Peace Jirga 2010\c\cThe Karzai administration organized the Afghan Peace Jirga in Kabul that was announced after the 2009 presidential elections. The Taliban were not invited. \c\cJuly:\c\c20–29 July: International Conference on Afghanistan in Kabul\c\cAugust:\c\c6 August: killing of 10 members of a Christian charity's medical team in the mountains of Badakhshan.Main article: 2010 Badakhshan massacre\c\c10 August: Amnesty International states that the International Criminal Court should open a formal investigation into crimes committed by the Taliban and other insurgent groups in Afghanistan. \c\cThe insurgency continued strongly in 2011. \c\cThe Taliban continued attacking and ambushing NATO and Afghan troops as well as the targeted assassination of government officials. \c\cJanuary:\c\c29 January: The deputy governor of Kandahar was killed in a suicide attack. Three months later, on 15 April the Kandahar chief police, General Khan Mohammed Mujahid was killed. \c\cApril:\c\cIt was reported that in 2011, the United States was spending 2 billion dollars per week fighting in Afghanistan against the Taliban. In a 2011 forecast the war in Afghanistan was estimated at 108 billion dollars for the year, while the Iraqi War was estimated at 50 billion. \c\cMay:\c\c28 May: The Taliban assassinated one of their main opponents, Mohammed Daud Daud, in a bomb attack. Six others were also killed. He was the chief of the police for the northern of Afghanistan. \c\cJuly:\c\c18 July: President Karzai's advisor, Jan Mohammad Khan, was assassinated in Kabul by the Taliban in an attack that also killed an Afghan deputy. \c\cAs of 18 July, coalition forces started their plan of transition by handing power of several areas to the Afghan authority following their plan of future pull out of the country. A Taliban militant who had infiltrated the Afghan police force killed seven other policemen in Lashkar Gah. The same day the police chief of Registaan district and three other policemen were killed in bomb attacks. \c\cAs of 22 July 325 coalition fighters were killed, more than 55% of the deaths caused by IED's. \c\c19 July: ISAF General Chief David Petraeus left his position with mixed results. During his time as the head of ISAF, 3775 insurgents were killed or captured in 2832 raids while 713 NATO soldiers were killed. Overall the level of violence in the country increased. He was replaced by General John Allen. \c\cBetween 20 and 22 July, NATO troops killed 50 Haqquani fighters in an attack on their camp. \c\c24 July: A US military investigation discovered that a portion of the 2 billion dollars in funds given by the United States in contracts had fallen in the hands of the insurgency. \c\c27 July: The mayor of Kandahar, Ghulam Haidar Hameedi, was killed in a suicide attack. \c\c28 July: Suicide bombers and snipers attacked the police headquarters of Tarin Kowt in a large-scale attack which killed more than 21 people including Afghan reporter Ahmed Omed Khpulwak. According to the Afghan interior minister, for the 2-year period between 19 March 2009 and 19 March 2011, 2770 Afghan policemen were killed and 4785 wounded while 1052 Afghan soldiers were killed and 2413 wounded. \c\c31 July: 10 Afghan policemen were killed in a suicide attack in Lashkar Gah where Afghan security forces had taken over from NATO a week before. The same day, 10 Afghan guards who were protecting a NATO supplies convoy were killed in the attack. One day before, 5 Afghans soldiers and 2 NATO soldiers were killed in a bomb attack on their patrol. \c\cAugust:\c\c6 August: 31 American Special Forces soldiers were killed in the crash of their helicopter probably shot down during a fight with the Taliban. Seven Afghan soldiers were also killed. This was the biggest death toll for NATO troops in the whole war. Most of the American soldiers killed were Navy SEALs. \c\c7 August: 4 NATO soldiers were killed, including two French Foreign Legion members, and 5 others were wounded. \c\cThe Taliban insurgency continued into 2012. \c\cAugust:\c\c27 August:\c\cTaliban insurgents in the Taliban-controlled southern Helmand area killed 17 civilians – fifteen men and two women – who were attending a party. A government official said that the victims were beheaded for celebrating with music and mixgender dancing in the Musa Qala district of Helmand, which ran contrary to the Taliban's extreme brand of Islam. Later, however, a provincial government official said that the 17 people killed were due to a fight between two Taliban commanders over two women (who were also killed). The civilians were either beheaded or had their throats cut, but some showed signs of gunshot wounds or beatings. \c\cThe attacks were condemned by Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, who ordered an investigation into the attack, the leader of the NATO coalition led by the United States, the United Nations, and the European Union. However, the Taliban has denied responsibility for the attack, saying that no Taliban members have ever killed civilians. \c\cThe attack occurred on the same day when two United States troops were killed by an Afghan soldier. \c\c10 Afghan soldiers were killed by the Taliban, also in the Helmand province. \c\cOn 3 April, Taliban gunmen and bombers attacked Farah, killing 34 civilians and 10 members of the security forces. Nine attackers were killed. \c\cIn Kabul in June, a Taliban suicide car bomber killed 16 people on the 11th. Gunmen and bombers killed three security guards on the 25th; eight attackers were killed. \c\cOn 13 September, Taliban gunmen and bombers killed eight security guards and a policeman in Herat. All seven attackers were killed. \c\cAs the American troops began to depart, and the number of Taliban attacks increased, there was speculation that the Taliban were waiting for an American withdrawal before launching a major offensive. \c\c25 July - Afghan insurgents killed 17 Shia civilians travelling from Kabul. \c\c13 December -  Assassination of Atiqullah Raufi. \c\c2015 saw the Taliban make various gains in Afghanistan in an attempt to fracture the fledgling Afghan government with successes not seen since NATO intervened in 2001. The Taliban has increased suicide attacks and has made multiple territorial gains across the country. \c\cBeginning in April, the Taliban fought for the city of Kunduz in the northern Kunduz Province with them capturing the city by September. Afghan Armed Forces recaptured the city in October but local sources dispute this claim. The quick fall of the city resulted in calls by some government officials for President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Abdullah Abdullah to resign. \c\cIn December, the Taliban made more territorial gains by besieging Afghan forces in the cities of Lashkar Gah, Sangin and outlying towns in the Helmand Province in Southern Afghanistan. By late December, most of Sangin was captured by the Taliban with local Afghan forces surrounded and forced to rely on airlifts for ammunition and food. \c\cThe gains made by the Taliban have hampered peace talks between them and the government and made rifts appear in the Taliban over negotiations. In response to the new offensives, it was reported that the United States would slow down their withdrawal of troops to help in counter-insurgency operations. \c\c14 April: Taliban attacking Kunduz;\c\c31 May: kidnapping a bus with 220 people, killing 10;\c\c1 June storming a court in Ghazni, 5 dead Taliban and 5 dead others;\c\cJune: Taliban have 25,000 fighters in Helmand, Kandahar and Uruzgan, according to US sources;\c\c18 July attacking Qalai Zal, unsuccessfully;\c\cJuly: 20% of Afghanistan is in Taliban hands, said Time magazine;\c\cDecember: Taliban controls 10% of Afghanistan, said the US military. \c\cThroughout most of the year, the US government maintained high-level talks with the Taliban, in an effort to secure a peace deal with the insurgency. However, a suicide bombing in Kabul on 7 September 2019 which killed 11 people and one American soldier prompted the US President to break-off peace talks with the Taliban. In mid September, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged that the Taliban had suffered more than 1,000 war casualties in the space of only one week since the US broke off peace negotiations with the Taliban. \c\cOn 29 February, the United-States reached an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, in Doha, Qatar. The agreement calls for the withdrawal of all 13,000 U.S. and allied troops over the next 14 months, on the condition that the Taliban continues with the peace process. The first withdrawal, of around 5,000 personnel, will occur within the next 135 days. \c\cThe peace deal stipulates that the Taliban not allow terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda “to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.” If successful, the peace deal will bring an end to 18-years of conflict. Only days after signing the historic deal, US forces conducted airstrikes on Taliban soldiers as a "defensive" measure, as Taliban fighters were "actively attacking" an Afghan government checkpoint. \c\cOn 2 May, the US revealed that the agreement included an informal commitment for both sides to cut violence by 80%. Since the agreement was signed, attacks on cities and coalition forces had decreased, but overall attacks had increased 70% compared with the same period in 2019, according to Reuters. The Taliban claim that attacks have fallen since the agreement was signed. \c\cOn 14 May, a Taliban suicide truck bomber killed five civilians in Gardez, Paktia Province. On 18 May, the Taliban killed nine people in a similar attack in Ghazni Province.[citation needed]\c\cOn 29 May, it was revealed that numerous Taliban and Taliban-aligned Haqqani Network leaders were infected with COVID-19. This resulted in the late founder Mullah Mohammad Omar's son Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob being made the entire organization's acting leader. \c\cIn 2021, the United States forces and allies started to withdraw from Afghanistan which allowed the Taliban to intensify their insurgency. \c\cOn 29 June, intense fighting between Taliban insurgents and government forces killed 28 civilians and injured another 290 during the past week, according to the head of a hospital in Kunduz, with the majority of the dead being children, women and elderly people. The Taliban had moved beyond its southern strongholds and had intensified the fighting in the north, according to military experts. \c\cOn 2 July, U.S. troops fully left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces as the coalition, including the U.S., prepared to leave Afghanistan after 20 years. Meanwhile, fighting continued between the Taliban and government forces, with analysts said that the Taliban would be "at the door of Kabul". Afterwards, Bagram Airfield was looted by locals following the sudden American withdrawal from the airbase, which was conducted without any coordination with local officials. Afghan troops later cleared the airbase of looters and secured control of it. \c\cHowever, it was reported that, during June, the Taliban captured 700 Humvees as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems from the Afghan National Army as more districts fall under the group's control during their offensive in the north. \c\cOn 4 July, the Taliban took control of several further districts overnight as Afghan troops abandoned their posts and fled into neighboring Tajikistan via Badakhshan Province. The State Committee for National Security of Tajikistan reported that more than 300 Afghan troops crossed the Tajik border as Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed that most of the territory gaining occurred without a fight. \c\cWhile the pre-2001 Taliban suppressed opium production, the current insurgency "relies on opium revenues to purchase weapons, train its members, and buy support." In 2001, Afghanistan produced only 11% of the world's opium. Today it produces 93% of the global crop, and the drug trade accounts for half of Afghanistan's GDP. \c\cOn 28 July 2009, Richard Holbrooke, the United States special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that money transfers from Western Europe and the Gulf States exceeded the drug trade earnings and that a new task force had been formed to shut down this source of funds. \c\cThe United States Agency for International Development is investigating the possibility that kickbacks from its contracts are being funneled to the Taliban. \c\cA report by the London School of Economics (LSE) claimed to provide the most concrete evidence yet that the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI is providing funding, training and sanctuary to the Taliban on a scale much larger than previously thought. The report's author Matt Waldman spoke to nine Taliban field commanders in Afghanistan and concluded that Pakistan's relationship with the insurgents ran far deeper than previously realized. Some of those interviewed suggested that the organization even attended meetings of the Taliban's supreme council, the Quetta Shura. A spokesman for the Pakistani military dismissed the report, describing it as "malicious".
The Taliban insurgency began after the group's fall from power during the 2001 War in Afghanistan. The Taliban forces are fighting against the Afghan government, formerly led by President Hamid Karzai, now led by President Ashraf Ghani, and against the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The insurgency has spread to some degree over the Durand Line border to neighboring Pakistan, in particular Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Taliban conduct warfare against Afghan National Security Forces and their NATO allies, as well as against civilian targets. Regional countries, particularly Pakistan, Iran, China and Russia, are often accused of funding and supporting the insurgent groups. \c\cThe leader of the Taliban is Hibatullah Akhundzada, who heads the Quetta Shura. The allied Haqqani Network, Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, and smaller al-Qaeda groups have also been part of the insurgency. \c\cFollowing the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the Taliban was defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan. In May and June 2003, high Taliban officials proclaimed the Taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel US forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah. Dadullah took charge in Zabul province. \c\cIn late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country". \c\cWhile The Taliban spent several years regrouping, they launched a re-escalation of the insurgency campaign in 2006. \c\cAs of 2017, the Taliban was composed of four different shuras, or representative councils. The first is the Quetta Shura. Two smaller shuras are subordinated to it, the Haqqani network (also known as the Miran Shah Shura) and the Peshawar Shura. The Pehsawar Shura was established in March 2005, and is based in eastern Afghanistan. The majority of its fighters are former members of the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin.  The Haqqani network declared its autonomy from the Quetta Shura in 2007, and rejoined in August 2015.  The Peshawar Shura was autonomous from 2009 until 2016. \c\cThe second autonomous shura is the Shura of the North, based in Badakhshan Province.  The third is the Mashhad Shura, sponsored by Iran, and the fourth is the Rasool Shura, led by Muhammad Rasul and also known as the High Council of the Islamic Emirate. \c\cFollowing the Battle of Tora Bora and Operation Anaconda, The Taliban were defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan, where they began the initial stages of re-grouping. \c\cPamphlets by Taliban and other groups turned up strewn in towns and the countryside in early 2003, urging Islamic faithful to rise up against U.S. forces and other foreign soldiers in holy war. On 27 January 2003, during Operation Mongoose (War in Afghanistan), a band of fighters were assaulted by U.S. forces at the Adi Ghar cave complex 25 km (15 mi) north of Spin Boldak. Eighteen rebels were reported killed with no U.S. casualties. The site was suspected to be a base for supplies and fighters coming from Pakistan. The first isolated attacks by relatively large Taliban bands on Afghan targets also appeared around that time. \c\cIn May 2003, the Taliban Supreme Court's chief justice, Abdul Salam, proclaimed that the Taliban were back, regrouped, rearmed, and ready for guerrilla war to expel U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah, who took charge in Zabul province. \c\cSmall mobile Taliban training camps were established along the border to train recruits in guerrilla warfare, according to senior Taliban warrior Mullah Malang in June 2003. Most were drawn from tribal area madrassas in Pakistan. Bases, a few with as many as 200 fighters, emerged in the tribal areas by the summer of 2003. Pakistani will to prevent infiltration was uncertain, while Pakistani military operations proved of little use. \c\cAs the summer of 2003 continued, Taliban attacks gradually increased in frequency. Dozens of Afghan government soldiers, NGO humanitarian workers, and several U.S. soldiers died in the raids, ambushes and rocket attacks. Besides guerrilla attacks, Taliban fighters began building up forces in the district of Dai Chopan in Zabul Province. The Taliban decided to make a stand there. Over the course of the summer, up to 1,000 guerrillas moved there. Over 220 people, including several dozen Afghan police, were killed in August 2003. \c\cOperation Valiant Strike was a major United States military ground operation in Afghanistan announced on 19 March 2003 that involved 2nd and 3rd battalions of 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Romanian and Afghan troops. The combined forces moved through Kandahar and parts of Southern Afghanistan with the objective of eliminating Taliban enemy forces and weapons caches while also attempting to gather intelligence on Taliban activity in the area. At the conclusion of the operation on 24 March 2003, coalition forces had detained 13 suspected Taliban fighters and confiscated more than 170 rocket-propelled grenades, 180 land mines, 20 automatic rifles and machine guns, as well as many rockets, rifles, and launchers. \c\cUnited States led-coalition forces carried out Operation Asbury Park on June 2, 2004, and June 17, 2004, of taskforce 1/6 BLT of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit engaged in fighting with Taliban and other anti-coalition forces in both Oruzgan Province and Zabul Province culminating in the Dai Chopan region of Afghanistan. This operation was characterized by atypical fighting on the side of the tactics of the Taliban and the other guerillas encountered. culminating in a large battle on June 8. During Asbury Park, the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit was faced with an opponent that frequently would dig in and engage the Marine forces, rather than the traditional hit and run (or "asymmetric attack") methods. As such, Marines, with the aid of B-1B Lancer, A-10 Warthog, and AH-64 Apache aircraft, engaged in "pitched battles each day," culminating in a large battle on June 8. The last of the fighting which took place near Dai Chopan on June 8 was decisive in that enemy forces were depleted to such an extent that no further contact was made with the enemy for the duration of the operation. What was meant by the enemy to be a three pronged attack June 8, 2004 resulted in over eighty-five confirmed kills, with estimates well in excess of 100 enemy dead, an estimated 200–300 wounded, with dozens captured. While throughout the entire operation a "handful" of US forces and Afghan Militia were injured. \c\cIn late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country". \c\cIn late June through mid-July 2005, United States Navy Seals carried out Operation Red Wings as a combined / joint military operation in the Pech District of Afghanistan's Kunar Province, on the slopes of a mountain named Sawtalo Sar, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Kunar's provincial capital of Asadabad, . Operation Red Wings was intended to disrupt local Taliban anti-coalition militia (ACM) activity, thus contributing to regional stability and thereby facilitating the Afghan Parliament elections scheduled for September 2005. At the time, Taliban anti-coalition militia activity in the region was carried out most notably by a small group, led by a local man from Nangarhar Province, Ahmad Shah, who had aspirations of regional Islamic fundamentalist prominence. He and his small group were among the primary targets of the operation. \c\cIn between August 13 and August 18 2005, United States Marine Corps carried out a military operation, called Operation Whalers that took place in Afghanistan's Kunar Province, just weeks after the disastrous Operation Red Wings. Like Operation Red Wings, the objective of Operation Whalers was the disruption of Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) activity in the region in support of further stabilizing the region for unencumbered voter turnout for the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections. Operation Whalers was planned and executed by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment (2/3). The emphasis of the operation was an Anti-Coalition Militia cell led by Ahmad Shah, which was one of 22 identified ACM groups operating in the region at that time, and was the most active. Ahmad Shah's cell was responsible for the Navy SEAL ambush and subsequent MH-47 shootdown that killed, in total, 19 U.S. special operations personnel during Operation Red Wings. Operation Whalers, named after the Hartford / New England Whalers professional hockey team, was the "sequel" to Operation Red Wings in that it was aimed at furthering stabilization of the security situation in the restive Kunar Province of Eastern Afghanistan, a long-term goal of American and coalition forces operating in the area at that time. Operation Whalers, conducted by a number of Marine infantry companies of 2/3 with attached Afghan National Army soldiers and supported by conventional Army aviation, intelligence, and combat arms forces units and U.S. Air Force aviation assets, proved a success. Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia activity dropped substantially and subsequent human intelligence and signals intelligence revealed that Ahmad Shah had been seriously wounded. Shah, who sought to disrupt the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections, was not able to undertake any significant Taliban Anti-Coalition operations subsequent to Operation Whalers in Kunar or neighboring provinces. \c\cIn 2006, Afghanistan began facing a wave of attacks by improvised explosives and suicide bombers, particularly after NATO took command of the fight against insurgents in spring 2006. \c\cAfghan President Hamid Karzai publicly condemned the methods used by the western powers. In June 2006 he said:\c\cInsurgents were also criticized for their conduct. According to Human Rights Watch, bombing and other attacks on Afghan civilians by the Taliban (and to a lesser extent Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin), are reported to have "sharply escalated in 2006" with "at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects." 131 of insurgent attacks were suicide attacks which killed 212 civilians (732 wounded), 46 Afghan army and police members (101 wounded), and 12 foreign soldiers (63 wounded). \c\cThe United Nations estimated that for the first half of 2011, the civilian deaths rose by 15% and reached 1462, which is the worst death toll since the beginning of the war and despite the surge of foreign troops. \c\cJune:\c\c6 June: A roadside bombing leaves 2 American soldiers killed, the attack took place in the province of Nangarhar. Also a separate suicide bombing in Khost leaves three US soldiers wounded. \c\c15 June: A bus carrying workers to an American base explodes killing 10 and wounding 15. The explosives were placed on the bus. \c\cJuly:\c\c1 July: 2 British soldiers are killed when their base came under small arms fire including rocket propelled grenades. \c\cAugust:\c\c8 August: 4 Canadian NATO soldiers are killed in two separate attacks. And a suicide bomber targeting a NATO convoy detonated, killing 21 people. \c\c20 August: 3 American soldiers are killed and another 3 are wounded in a battle with Taliban militants after a roadside bomb hit an American patrol. \c\cSeptember:\c\c8 September: A major suicide car bombing near the US embassy in Kabul kills 18 including 2 US soldiers. \c\c10 September: The governor of Afghanistan's southeastern Paktia province is killed alongside his bodyguard and nephew when a suicide bomber detonates himself beside the governor's car. \c\cOctober:\c\c14 October: A suicide attack in Kandahar city leaves 8 dead including one NATO soldier. \c\c15 October: 2 Canadian soldiers were killed when Taliban militants attacked NATO troops using small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades. \c\cDecember:\c\c6 December: A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a security contractor's office killing 7 including 2 Americans, the attack took place south of Afghanistan in Kandahar. \c\c19 December: Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Osmani, reportedly number 4 in the Taliban shura, is killed by an American airstrike in southern Afghanistan. \c\cThe Taliban continued to favor suicide bombing as a tactic. \c\cIn 2007 Afghanistan saw 140 more suicide bombings – more than in the past five years combined – that killed more than 300 people, many civilians. \c\cA UN report said the perpetrators were poorly educated, disaffected young men who were recruited by Taliban leaders in Pakistani madrassas. \c\cWestern analysts estimated that the Taliban can field about 10,000 fighters at any given time, according to a 30 October report in The New York Times. Of that number, "only 2,000 to 3,000 are highly motivated, full-time insurgents", the Times reported. The rest are part-timers, made up of alienated, young Afghan men angry at bombing raids or fighting in order to get money. In 2007, more foreign fighters were showing up in Afghanistan than ever before, according to Afghan and United States officials. An estimated 100 to 300 full-time combatants are foreigners, usually from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Chechnya, various Arab countries and perhaps even Turkey and western China. They tend to be more fanatical and violent, and they often bring skills such as the ability to post more sophisticated videos on the Internet or bombmaking expertise. It has also been reported that the Taliban now control up to 54% of Afghanistan. \c\cOn 15 April, the Afghan Government promised to end all hostage deals with the Taliban after two Afghan kidnapped victims were executed in an agreement to free an Italian journalist. \c\cJanuary:\c\c23 January: A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a US base in eastern Afghanistan killing 10 people who were waiting outside the base. \c\cFebruary:\c\c2 February: Taliban forces raided a southern Afghan town destroying the government center and briefly holding some elders captive. \c\c19 February: The Taliban briefly seized a small town in western Afghanistan after police fled the town, the Taliban forces moved in for 30 minutes and seized three vehicles. \c\c20 February: A suicide bomber blew himself up during an opening hospital ceremony injuring 2 NATO soldiers and a hospital worker. \c\c27 February: 23 people are killed when a suicide bomber attacks an American military base, Bagram Airfield (BAF) in Bagram District, Parwan Province. The attack took place while US vice president Dick Cheney was in the compound. Cheney was unhurt in the attack and was the intended target of the attack as claimed by the Taliban. The dead included an American soldier, a Korean soldier, and an American contractor. \c\cMarch:\c\c4 March: A suicide bomber attacks an American convoy which leaves 16 civilians dead in the aftermath as the American convey begins to sporadically fire at civilian cars around them.

He noted that the Afghan Taliban are "always welcome" in Afghanistan, although foreign militants are not. \c\c9 April: Six Canadian soldiers were killed in southern Afghanistan when they struck a roadside bomb. A separate roadside bombing, also in south Afghanistan, left another NATO soldier dead and one wounded. In another incident, a statement from the Taliban's spokesperson claimed that they had beheaded a translator for a kidnapped Italian journalist. \c\c15 April: A suicide bomber struck a US-private security firm, killing four Afghans working for the company. \c\c16 April: A suicide bomber ran onto a police training field and detonating his explosive device, killed 10 police officers and wounded dozens of others.

The crisis ended on 30 August with the release of the remaining hostages as part of a deal with the South Korean diplomats of government. \c\cAugust:\c\c31 August: A suicide bomber detonated his explosive-laden vehicle after ramming three military vehicles at the military gate of the Kabul International Airport. Two Afghan soldiers were killed and ten people were injured. \c\cSeptember:\c\c29 September: In an effort to reach a compromise with the Taliban leaders, the president, Hamid Karzai would make a quid quo pro by allowing militants to have a place in government if they stopped fighting. Taliban leaders replied by saying there would be no compromise unless intervening forces such as NATO and the U.S. left. \c\cNovember:\c\c2 November: Mawlawi Abdul Manan, an important Taliban figure, is killed by Afghan Security forces. His death is confirmed by the Taliban. \c\cThe U.S. warned that in 2008 the Taliban has "coalesced into a resilient insurgency", and would "maintain or even increase the scope and pace of its terrorist attacks". Attacks by Taliban insurgents in eastern Afghanistan increased by 40% when compared to the same period in 2007. \c\cFebruary\c\c24 February: Poor military intelligence leads to conflicted reports of a possible Taliban spring offensive. \c\cAugust\c\c19 August: Taliban forces kill 9 French troops (with a 10th death in an accident) near Kabul. \c\cOctober\c\c6 October: CNN reported that, via Saudi intermediaries, the Taliban is negotiating to end the conflict in Afghanistan, and that the Taliban has split from Al Qaeda. \c\cDecember:\c\c7 December: 200 Taliban armed with RPGs and automatic weapons attack two NATO supply depots outside of Peshawar destroying 100 vehicles packed with supplies intended to support the NATO effort in Afghanistan. \c\c8 December: 200 Taliban armed with RPGs and automatic weapons attack a NATO supply depot outside of Peshawar destroying 53 container trucks packed with supplies intended to support the NATO effort in Afghanistan. \c\cDuring 2009 the Taliban regained control over the countryside of several Afghan provinces. In August 2009, Taliban commanders in the province of Helmand started issuing "visa" from the "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan" in order to allow travel to and from the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah. \c\cJune:\c\c30 June: US Army Private First Class soldier Bowe R.

Angry relatives of those killed claim civilians were collecting fuel from the tankers when the airstrike came. \c\cDecember:\c\cOn 1 December, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops to help battle the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban reacted to the President's speech by saying they will step up their fight in Afghanistan. A Taliban commander told the BBC that if more US troops came, more would die. \c\cAfter his disputed re-election, President Hamid Karzai announced to move ahead with a plan for a Loya Jirga to discuss the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban would be invited to take part in this Jirga. \c\cDuring 2010, the Taliban were ousted from parts of Helmand Province by the ISAF Operation Moshtarak that started in February 2010. In the meantime the Taliban insurgency spread to the northern provinces of the country. The new policy of the Taliban was to shift militants from the south to the north, to show they exist "everywhere", according to Faryab Province Governor Abdul Haq Shafaq. With most Afghan and NATO troops stationed in the southern and eastern provinces, villagers in the once-peaceful north found themselves confronted with a rapid deterioration of security, as insurgents seized new territory in provinces such as Kunduz and Baghlan, and even infiltrated the mountains of Badakhshan Province in the northeast. \c\cJanuary:\c\c17 January: "Kabul's day of terror":\c\cOn this day, gunbattles near the presidential palace and other government buildings paralyzed the Afghan capital for hours. \c\cAs President Karzai was swearing in his new cabinet ministers inside the presidential palace, militants performed attacks on multiple locations in Kabul, including shopping malls, a cinema and the central bank. A team of gunmen launched a spectacular assault in "commando style" with two men detonating suicide bombs and the rest fighting to the death near the gates of the presidential palace, an operation by insurgents to terrorize the Afghan capital, further demoralizing the population and lending to the impression that virtually no part of the country could be safe. The Taliban said it had deployed 20 suicide bombers in explosive vests who were also armed with heavy and light weaponry\c\cA western security official estimated there is a security incident in Kabul, on average, every seven to 10 days. \c\cFebruary:\c\c26 February: Militants target hotels and guest houses in Kabul. Up to nine Indians, an Italian diplomat and a French film maker were among the dead in the worst assault on the Afghan capital for several months. A four-hour battle began with a car bombing and included suicide bombers and Taliban fighters throwing grenades. The attacks appeared to be aimed at Indian government officials and medical workers. Three Afghan police were killed, and six more officers were among the 38 people wounded in what was described as a well-planned and co-ordinated attack. \c\cJune:\c\c2–4 June: Main article: Afghan Peace Jirga 2010\c\cThe Karzai administration organized the Afghan Peace Jirga in Kabul that was announced after the 2009 presidential elections. The Taliban were not invited. \c\cJuly:\c\c20–29 July: International Conference on Afghanistan in Kabul\c\cAugust:\c\c6 August: killing of 10 members of a Christian charity's medical team in the mountains of Badakhshan.Main article: 2010 Badakhshan massacre\c\c10 August: Amnesty International states that the International Criminal Court should open a formal investigation into crimes committed by the Taliban and other insurgent groups in Afghanistan. \c\cThe insurgency continued strongly in 2011. \c\cThe Taliban continued attacking and ambushing NATO and Afghan troops as well as the targeted assassination of government officials. \c\cJanuary:\c\c29 January: The deputy governor of Kandahar was killed in a suicide attack. Three months later, on 15 April the Kandahar chief police, General Khan Mohammed Mujahid was killed. \c\cApril:\c\cIt was reported that in 2011, the United States was spending 2 billion dollars per week fighting in Afghanistan against the Taliban. In a 2011 forecast the war in Afghanistan was estimated at 108 billion dollars for the year, while the Iraqi War was estimated at 50 billion. \c\cMay:\c\c28 May: The Taliban assassinated one of their main opponents, Mohammed Daud Daud, in a bomb attack. Six others were also killed. He was the chief of the police for the northern of Afghanistan. \c\cJuly:\c\c18 July: President Karzai's advisor, Jan Mohammad Khan, was assassinated in Kabul by the Taliban in an attack that also killed an Afghan deputy. \c\cAs of 18 July, coalition forces started their plan of transition by handing power of several areas to the Afghan authority following their plan of future pull out of the country. A Taliban militant who had infiltrated the Afghan police force killed seven other policemen in Lashkar Gah. The same day the police chief of Registaan district and three other policemen were killed in bomb attacks. \c\cAs of 22 July 325 coalition fighters were killed, more than 55% of the deaths caused by IED's. \c\c19 July: ISAF General Chief David Petraeus left his position with mixed results. During his time as the head of ISAF, 3775 insurgents were killed or captured in 2832 raids while 713 NATO soldiers were killed. Overall the level of violence in the country increased. He was replaced by General John Allen. \c\cBetween 20 and 22 July, NATO troops killed 50 Haqquani fighters in an attack on their camp. \c\c24 July: A US military investigation discovered that a portion of the 2 billion dollars in funds given by the United States in contracts had fallen in the hands of the insurgency. \c\c27 July: The mayor of Kandahar, Ghulam Haidar Hameedi, was killed in a suicide attack. \c\c28 July: Suicide bombers and snipers attacked the police headquarters of Tarin Kowt in a large-scale attack which killed more than 21 people including Afghan reporter Ahmed Omed Khpulwak. According to the Afghan interior minister, for the 2-year period between 19 March 2009 and 19 March 2011, 2770 Afghan policemen were killed and 4785 wounded while 1052 Afghan soldiers were killed and 2413 wounded. \c\c31 July: 10 Afghan policemen were killed in a suicide attack in Lashkar Gah where Afghan security forces had taken over from NATO a week before. The same day, 10 Afghan guards who were protecting a NATO supplies convoy were killed in the attack. One day before, 5 Afghans soldiers and 2 NATO soldiers were killed in a bomb attack on their patrol. \c\cAugust:\c\c6 August: 31 American Special Forces soldiers were killed in the crash of their helicopter probably shot down during a fight with the Taliban. Seven Afghan soldiers were also killed. This was the biggest death toll for NATO troops in the whole war. Most of the American soldiers killed were Navy SEALs. \c\c7 August: 4 NATO soldiers were killed, including two French Foreign Legion members, and 5 others were wounded. \c\cThe Taliban insurgency continued into 2012. \c\cAugust:\c\c27 August:\c\cTaliban insurgents in the Taliban-controlled southern Helmand area killed 17 civilians – fifteen men and two women – who were attending a party. A government official said that the victims were beheaded for celebrating with music and mixgender dancing in the Musa Qala district of Helmand, which ran contrary to the Taliban's extreme brand of Islam. Later, however, a provincial government official said that the 17 people killed were due to a fight between two Taliban commanders over two women (who were also killed). The civilians were either beheaded or had their throats cut, but some showed signs of gunshot wounds or beatings. \c\cThe attacks were condemned by Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, who ordered an investigation into the attack, the leader of the NATO coalition led by the United States, the United Nations, and the European Union. However, the Taliban has denied responsibility for the attack, saying that no Taliban members have ever killed civilians. \c\cThe attack occurred on the same day when two United States troops were killed by an Afghan soldier. \c\c10 Afghan soldiers were killed by the Taliban, also in the Helmand province. \c\cOn 3 April, Taliban gunmen and bombers attacked Farah, killing 34 civilians and 10 members of the security forces. Nine attackers were killed. \c\cIn Kabul in June, a Taliban suicide car bomber killed 16 people on the 11th. Gunmen and bombers killed three security guards on the 25th; eight attackers were killed. \c\cOn 13 September, Taliban gunmen and bombers killed eight security guards and a policeman in Herat. All seven attackers were killed. \c\cAs the American troops began to depart, and the number of Taliban attacks increased, there was speculation that the Taliban were waiting for an American withdrawal before launching a major offensive. \c\c25 July - Afghan insurgents killed 17 Shia civilians travelling from Kabul. \c\c13 December -  Assassination of Atiqullah Raufi. \c\c2015 saw the Taliban make various gains in Afghanistan in an attempt to fracture the fledgling Afghan government with successes not seen since NATO intervened in 2001. The Taliban has increased suicide attacks and has made multiple territorial gains across the country. \c\cBeginning in April, the Taliban fought for the city of Kunduz in the northern Kunduz Province with them capturing the city by September. Afghan Armed Forces recaptured the city in October but local sources dispute this claim. The quick fall of the city resulted in calls by some government officials for President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Abdullah Abdullah to resign. \c\cIn December, the Taliban made more territorial gains by besieging Afghan forces in the cities of Lashkar Gah, Sangin and outlying towns in the Helmand Province in Southern Afghanistan. By late December, most of Sangin was captured by the Taliban with local Afghan forces surrounded and forced to rely on airlifts for ammunition and food. \c\cThe gains made by the Taliban have hampered peace talks between them and the government and made rifts appear in the Taliban over negotiations. In response to the new offensives, it was reported that the United States would slow down their withdrawal of troops to help in counter-insurgency operations. \c\c14 April: Taliban attacking Kunduz;\c\c31 May: kidnapping a bus with 220 people, killing 10;\c\c1 June storming a court in Ghazni, 5 dead Taliban and 5 dead others;\c\cJune: Taliban have 25,000 fighters in Helmand, Kandahar and Uruzgan, according to US sources;\c\c18 July attacking Qalai Zal, unsuccessfully;\c\cJuly: 20% of Afghanistan is in Taliban hands, said Time magazine;\c\cDecember: Taliban controls 10% of Afghanistan, said the US military. \c\cThroughout most of the year, the US government maintained high-level talks with the Taliban, in an effort to secure a peace deal with the insurgency. However, a suicide bombing in Kabul on 7 September 2019 which killed 11 people and one American soldier prompted the US President to break-off peace talks with the Taliban. In mid September, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged that the Taliban had suffered more than 1,000 war casualties in the space of only one week since the US broke off peace negotiations with the Taliban. \c\cOn 29 February, the United-States reached an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, in Doha, Qatar. The agreement calls for the withdrawal of all 13,000 U.S. and allied troops over the next 14 months, on the condition that the Taliban continues with the peace process. The first withdrawal, of around 5,000 personnel, will occur within the next 135 days. \c\cThe peace deal stipulates that the Taliban not allow terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda “to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.” If successful, the peace deal will bring an end to 18-years of conflict. Only days after signing the historic deal, US forces conducted airstrikes on Taliban soldiers as a "defensive" measure, as Taliban fighters were "actively attacking" an Afghan government checkpoint. \c\cOn 2 May, the US revealed that the agreement included an informal commitment for both sides to cut violence by 80%. Since the agreement was signed, attacks on cities and coalition forces had decreased, but overall attacks had increased 70% compared with the same period in 2019, according to Reuters. The Taliban claim that attacks have fallen since the agreement was signed. \c\cOn 14 May, a Taliban suicide truck bomber killed five civilians in Gardez, Paktia Province. On 18 May, the Taliban killed nine people in a similar attack in Ghazni Province.[citation needed]\c\cOn 29 May, it was revealed that numerous Taliban and Taliban-aligned Haqqani Network leaders were infected with COVID-19. This resulted in the late founder Mullah Mohammad Omar's son Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob being made the entire organization's acting leader. \c\cIn 2021, the United States forces and allies started to withdraw from Afghanistan which allowed the Taliban to intensify their insurgency. \c\cOn 29 June, intense fighting between Taliban insurgents and government forces killed 28 civilians and injured another 290 during the past week, according to the head of a hospital in Kunduz, with the majority of the dead being children, women and elderly people. The Taliban had moved beyond its southern strongholds and had intensified the fighting in the north, according to military experts. \c\cOn 2 July, U.S. troops fully left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces as the coalition, including the U.S., prepared to leave Afghanistan after 20 years. Meanwhile, fighting continued between the Taliban and government forces, with analysts said that the Taliban would be "at the door of Kabul". Afterwards, Bagram Airfield was looted by locals following the sudden American withdrawal from the airbase, which was conducted without any coordination with local officials. Afghan troops later cleared the airbase of looters and secured control of it. \c\cHowever, it was reported that, during June, the Taliban captured 700 Humvees as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems from the Afghan National Army as more districts fall under the group's control during their offensive in the north. \c\cOn 4 July, the Taliban took control of several further districts overnight as Afghan troops abandoned their posts and fled into neighboring Tajikistan via Badakhshan Province. The State Committee for National Security of Tajikistan reported that more than 300 Afghan troops crossed the Tajik border as Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed that most of the territory gaining occurred without a fight. \c\cWhile the pre-2001 Taliban suppressed opium production, the current insurgency "relies on opium revenues to purchase weapons, train its members, and buy support." In 2001, Afghanistan produced only 11% of the world's opium. Today it produces 93% of the global crop, and the drug trade accounts for half of Afghanistan's GDP. \c\cOn 28 July 2009, Richard Holbrooke, the United States special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that money transfers from Western Europe and the Gulf States exceeded the drug trade earnings and that a new task force had been formed to shut down this source of funds. \c\cThe United States Agency for International Development is investigating the possibility that kickbacks from its contracts are being funneled to the Taliban. \c\cA report by the London School of Economics (LSE) claimed to provide the most concrete evidence yet that the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI is providing funding, training and sanctuary to the Taliban on a scale much larger than previously thought. The report's author Matt Waldman spoke to nine Taliban field commanders in Afghanistan and concluded that Pakistan's relationship with the insurgents ran far deeper than previously realized. Some of those interviewed suggested that the organization even attended meetings of the Taliban's supreme council, the Quetta Shura. A spokesman for the Pakistani military dismissed the report, describing it as "malicious".
On the evening of 3 March 2021, Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, disappeared in South London, England, as she was walking home to Brixton Hill from a friend's house near Clapham Common. \c\cOn 9 March 2021, Wayne Couzens, a Metropolitan Police officer with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection unit, was arrested in Deal, Kent, firstly on suspicion of Everard's kidnapping and later on suspicion of her murder. On 10 March, her remains were discovered in woodland near Ashford, Kent. Couzens was charged with kidnapping and murder two days later, following identification of the remains as those of Everard. \c\cVigils were held for Everard on the evening of Saturday 13 March. The largest vigil, on Clapham Common near where she had disappeared, led to a controversial police response and four arrests for breaches of COVID-19 regulations. \c\cSarah Everard was born in Surrey in 1987. She grew up in York, where she attended Fulford School. She read Human Geography at St Cuthbert's Society, Durham University, from 2005 to 2008. At the time of her death, Everard lived in the Brixton Hill area and worked as a marketing executive for a digital media agency. \c\cAt around 21:00 GMT on 3 March 2021, Everard left the house of a friend near Clapham Junction, west of Clapham Common. She walked across the common, along the A205 South Circular Road, en route to her home. She spoke to her boyfriend on her mobile phone for about fifteen minutes and agreed to meet him the next day. At 21:28, she was seen on doorbell camera footage on Poynders Road and four minutes later on the dashcam of a passing police car. CCTV footage from a bus passing her route at 21:35 also assisted the investigation. Everard's boyfriend contacted the police on 4 March after she did not meet him. \c\cAt 16:20 on 10 March, police searching Hoad's Wood near Ashford, Kent, found human remains in a large builder's bag. They also searched a garage linked to a suspect at the top of the white cliffs, next to St Martin's Battery, overlooking Dover Harbour. On 12 March, Everard's body was identified through dental records. Two days later, police cordoned off a section of The Rope Walk in Sandwich, Kent, in relation to the investigation; the Mayor of Sandwich, Jeff Franklin, estimated that 1 square mile (2.6 km2) of the town was restricted by the cordon. On 16 March, police continued to comb woodland in Kent and specialist divers searched underwater for Everard's mobile phone. \c\cOn 1 June 2021, it was reported that a post-mortem declared that she died from "compression of the neck". \c\cOn 9 March, Kent Police arrested Wayne Couzens, a 48-year-old Metropolitan Police constable and firearms officer, at his home in Deal, on suspicion of kidnapping. Couzens joined the Metropolitan Police in September 2018 and was assigned to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection branch, which is responsible for uniformed protection of government and diplomatic premises. A woman in her thirties was also arrested at the address on suspicion of assisting an offender but subsequently released without charge. \c\cOn 10 March, the day Everard's remains were discovered, Couzens was re-arrested on suspicion of murder. On 11 March, Couzens was hospitalised following a head injury sustained in custody; he was again briefly hospitalised the following day after a similar injury. After the incident on 11 March, police said the injury was sustained while he was alone in his cell. \c\cCouzens was charged with Everard's kidnapping and murder on 12 March, following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service. He appeared at Westminster Magistrates\' Court on 13 March and was remanded in custody before appearing at the Old Bailey via video link from Belmarsh Prison on 16 March. \c\cOn 8 June, Couzens pleaded guilty to kidnap and rape, and admitted responsibility for Everard's death. Pending medical reports into his mental health at the time of Everard's death, Couzens was not asked to enter a plea for the murder charge. The plea hearing and provisional trial are set for 9 July and 25 October 2021 respectively. \c\cOn 11 March, Home Secretary Priti Patel released a statement saying that "every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence", and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan stated that London streets are not safe for women or girls. Patel announced that new laws are being considered to protect women against sexual harassment in public, including the potential of making public harassment a specifically defined crime. \c\cThe Metropolitan Police asked the Independent Office for Police Conduct to conduct an investigation into whether two officers had responded appropriately to a report from 28 February that Couzens had indecently exposed himself at a fast-food restaurant in south London; he was being questioned in connection with that crime when he was accused of murder. \c\cCountry-wide vigils to be held on Saturday 13 March were organised by a newly formed campaign group, Reclaim These Streets. The day before the vigils were due to take place, a message was sent to all police chiefs that made it clear that, because of the COVID risk, Patel wanted them to stop people gathering at vigils; she also promised she would personally urge people not to gather. Talks between organisers and police broke down; The police had advised the organisers that it would be considered an illegal gathering under COVID‐19 pandemic restrictions and the court refused a request to intervene in the police decision. Events planned for Edinburgh and Cardiff were officially cancelled in favour of online events. Cambridge also was scheduled to go online. \c\cVigils still took place in several British cities, including Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Nottingham, Liverpool and Sheffield. Small gatherings also took place at locations in London. One on Highbury Fields attracted about 50 participants. Another in Russell Square, although also officially cancelled, saw a few people lighting candles. Councillor Angela Mason and others criticised the police handling of this small vigil, which included asking attendees and a local journalist to leave to comply with COVID-19 mass-gathering regulations. \c\cA vigil for Everard took place on Clapham Common on 13 March. Throughout the early part of the day, hundreds of people attended to pay their respects. Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attended, with Kensington Palace releasing a statement saying that the Duchess "remembers what it was like to walk around London at night before she was married". She was later reported to have sent a personal letter to Everard's family to express "her sadness and sympathy". \c\cThe direct action group Sisters Uncut encouraged people to attend "with your sadness and your rage". By 18:00, a crowd of several hundred had congregated at the park's bandstand to hear speeches from Sisters Uncut. Four people were arrested for public-order offences and for breaching the Coronavirus Act 2020. \c\cThe Metropolitan Police's decision to break up the crowd, and their behaviour in forcibly arresting attendees and walking over the flowers laid by them, prompted public anger. Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, called the police response "deeply disturbing"; Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was "deeply concerned" by footage of the events. Mayor Khan called the police actions and arrests "neither appropriate nor proportionate". Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, called for Dame Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, to resign. Dick declined to resign and dismissed criticism of the police response. Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said the action was necessary because "hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting COVID-19", and the Metropolitan Police Federation said that 26 police officers were assaulted. \c\cKhan and Patel directed Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), which oversees the police, to conduct a review of the policing of the vigil and lessons learned. The review, published on 30 March, found that the police had "reacted appropriately and were not heavy handed" and were "justified" in their stance with respect to the COVID regulations, saying that the risks of transmission were "too great to ignore". The HMICFRS report also said "Condemnation of the Met's actions within mere hours of the vigil – including from people in positions of responsibility – was unwarranted, showed a lack of respect for public servants facing a complex situation, and undermined public confidence in policing based on very limited evidence." They also said that the police response was a "public relations disaster" with a "materially adverse effect on public confidence in policing"; the review added, "We acknowledge that a more conciliatory response might have served the force's interests better." HMICFRS also concluded that the Met had incorrectly interpreted coronavirus-related restrictions due to legal confusion, and that not all demonstrations during a Tier 4 lockdown are unlawful. A whistleblower alleged that the reviewers had demonstrated a pro-police and anti-protestor bias while compiling the report, with the reviewing panel composed almost entirely of police officers. \c\cOn 14 March, more than 1,000 people marched from New Scotland Yard to Parliament Square. The police response was described as "hands-off" and "markedly different" to that on 13 March.
COVID-19 vaccination began in Fiji on the first quarter of 2021 and will continue throughout the year with the goal of vaccinating all eligible Fijians. The government has made it mandatory for all eligible individuals to take the COVID-19 vaccines. \c\cIn early June 2020, the Government of Australia ensured Fiji's access to a COVID-19 vaccine through GAVI at an affordable price. Australia also invested in $500 million in the next three years to ensure that the countries of the Pacific including Fiji will be able to achieve full immunization coverage. Attorney General Aiyaz Sayed Khaiyum said that the government is working with International Agencies to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are not commercialized. \c\cIn January 2021, Australia and Fiji discussed vaccine options with the Australian Government indicating that if 80% of Fiji's population are vaccinated, chances of a travel bubble are high between the two nations. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services trained its staff for COVID-19 vaccination as the country is working to register all receivers planned for the first phase of vaccination. Vaccination are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2021 and throughout the year. \c\cIn February 2021, Fiji approved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine with the COVAX Facility committed in providing over 100,000 doses. \c\cIn early March 2021, Fiji became the first Pacific country to receive the first batch of vaccines from the World Health Organization's COVAX initiative. Fiji received 12,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with the first six thousand earmarked for frontline and essential workers. On 7 March, Fiji received its first stocks of the AstraZeneca vaccines. \c\cOn 19 April 2021, Fiji received its second batch of the AstraZeneca vaccines. \c\cBy 5 July, 54% of the target population of 650,000 had received one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine while nine percent were now fully vaccinated. \c\cOn 6 July 2021, the Suva City Council along with the Ministry of Health launched its first ever drive-through vaccination at Albert Park. \c\cOn 8 July 2021, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama in a video address announced that taking the COVID-19 vaccines will be mandatory to all eligible Fijians adding that "Fiji had taken an oath of no jab, no job."\c\cAs of 4 July 2021, 317,461 Fijians (54% of the targeted population of 587,651 individuals) have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine while 52,001 individuals have been fully vaccinated (two doses). \c\cA complaint was lodged to the Fiji Police Force regarding the legality of the COVID-19 vaccination. The complainant who is an assistant lecturer in the College of Medicine, Nursing, and Health Sciences for FNU uploaded a video on social media claiming that "there is no virus except for what is in the vaccine". The Fiji National University responded by taking immediate and appropriate action against the individual stating that the "Curriculum content must always be based on full facts" adding that the university reject all misinformation, unfounded conspiracy theories, and fake news. \c\cThe Fiji Police Force also investigated a viral video involving police officers in uniform claiming that the vaccines contained a metallic chip which attracted magnets. The Ministry of Health and the Fiji Medical Association debunked those claims stating that the vaccine dose is too small to have the chip.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Fiji is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in Fiji was reported on 19 March 2020 in Lautoka. As of 8 July 2021[update], the country has had a total of 8,661 cases as of which 7,138 are currently active and 48 deaths, with all cases recorded in the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. A total of 19 COVID-19 patients have died from pre-existing non-COVID-19 related illnesses. In March 2021 Fiji became the first Pacific island country to receive the COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX initiative with frontline workers and first responders the first to be vaccinated. Out of the target population of 587,651, more than 330,000 Fijians have received their first jab of the AstraZeneca vaccine. \c\cIn the early stages of the pandemic, Fiji imposed travel bans on highly affected countries. As the pandemic worsen, Fiji closed all borders and ports to non residents. Ports were closed on 16 March 2020 and the main international airport in Nadi was closed on 26 March 2020. Returning citizens were required to self isolate at a government funded facility for 14 days, supervised by Health Officials and the Military. Domestically, the government responded by imposing a national curfew, restricting large gatherings and closing down schools and non essential services. The government imposed lockdowns in the two largest cities of Lautoka and Suva and developed a contact tracing app named careFIJI. The government established a Centre for Disease Control for COVID-19 testing and built fever clinics nationwide for temperature checks. Such measures has helped eliminate local transmissions of the virus for more than a year. \c\cFrom July 2020 to April 2021, Fiji has only recorded cases from managed quarantine facilities at the border as repatriation flights brought stranded citizens back home. This has allowed the country to relax its COVID-19 restrictions to boost its economic recovery however on 19 April 2021, Fiji confirmed its first community case as a result of a breach in protocol. In response, the township of Nadi and the city of Lautoka went into a lockdown and previous health restrictions were re-imposed all over the country with the national curfew revised. As local transmission cases soared exacerbated by the Delta variant, the Government sealed off Viti Levu establishing Suva, Lautoka, Nadi, Nausori, Rakiraki and Lami as containment areas and activating the Fiji Emergency Medical Assistance Team (FEMAT). The virus penetrated prominent hospitals of Fiji including the Fiji CDC and the headquarters of the Ministry of Health which prompted senior health officials to go into self isolation. High number of cases were recorded from the Western and Central division with the highest number of cases being from the containment of Suva, Nausori and Lami alone. Despite continuous records of new cases, the government has ruled out any possibility of a nationwide lockdown adding that their directive would be on targeted lockdowns instead. \c\cThe pandemic forced Fiji to reduce its interest rate. The country's economy is expected to contract after decades of economic growth due to the pandemic's impact on tourism, retail, manufacturing and trade. The International Labour Organisation and the Asian Development Bank issued reports about workers being affected and warned about the rising youth unemployment rate and child labour. The impacts has also prompted residents to leave the country for short term employment overseas. There were even reported incidents of racism and xenophobia against Chinese people or to those perceived as such. Misinformation and conspiracy theories surfaced about the COVID-19 vaccines, the origin of the virus and the government's response to the pandemic. Domestic violence and assault cases against women also increased as a result of lockdowns. \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cCompared to SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19  has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cOn 19 March, Fiji confirmed its first case, a 27 year old Fijian citizen and flight attendant of Fiji Airways. He had arrived from San Francisco returning via Nadi on 16 March. On 17 March, he had travelled from Nadi to Auckland and a return from Auckland to Nadi on the same day. He was admitted to Lautoka Hospital. \c\cOn 21 March, Fiji confirmed its second case and the first local transmission case through household contact. She is the mother of the first patient and was admitted in Nadi Hospital. Other family members remained in quarantine and being monitored. \c\cOn 23 March, Fiji confirmed its third case, a one-year-old nephew of the first patient. \c\cOn 24 March, Fiji confirmed its fourth case, a 28-year-old Fijian citizen, who had returned from Sydney over the weekend and was not related to the first three cases.

It is believed that he contracted the disease while attending the Tablighi Jamaat in India. An eighth case was confirmed in Lautoka, a 39-year-old female from Natowaqa. She is admitted at Lautoka Hospital. A tenth case was confirmed in Nadi, a 20-year-old Fijian citizen from Nadovi with travel history to Auckland.

The UEFA Euro 2020 Final was a football match that took place on 11 July 2021 at Wembley Stadium in London, England, to determine the winners of UEFA Euro 2020. Originally scheduled for 12 July 2020 and later postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the match was the 16th final of the UEFA European Championship, a quadrennial tournament contested by the Union of European Football Association members’ men's national teams to decide the European champions. The match was contested by Italy and England. \c\cItaly won the final 3–2 on penalties following a 1–1 draw after extra time. Italy won the European Championship for the first time since 1968. \c\cThe final was held at Wembley Stadium in London, England, located in Wembley of the borough of Brent. On 6 December 2012, UEFA announced the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament, with no host teams qualifying automatically. Wembley was chosen as the semi-final and final venue of the tournament by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014, having been selected by acclamation after the finals package bid of the Allianz Arena in Munich was withdrawn. After winning the hosting rights, London's standard package bid for group stage matches and an earlier knockout match was withdrawn. However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium. The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to London, leaving Wembley with seven tournament matches. This was later increased to eight matches, as Dublin were removed as a host city on 23 April 2021, not being able to ensure spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with their round of 16 fixture reallocated to Wembley. \c\cThe current incarnation of Wembley Stadium opened in 2007 on the site of the original stadium, which was demolished from 2002 to 2003. The stadium is owned by The Football Association and serves as the national stadium of the England national team. The original stadium, formerly known as the Empire Stadium, was opened in 1923 and hosted several matches at the 1966 FIFA World Cup, including the final which saw hosts England beat West Germany 4–2 after extra time, and at UEFA Euro 1996, including the final in which Germany defeated the Czech Republic 2–1 after extra time via the now defunct golden goal rule. Wembley has also hosted every final of the FA Cup since the White Horse Final of 1923 (excluding 2001–06, when the stadium was being rebuilt). Wembley's hosting of both the semi finals and the final remained subject to UEFA and the UK government reaching an agreement over quarantine rules for fans and VIPs. The Puskás Aréna in Budapest was seen as the prime candidate to replace Wembley, should it not be able to host the final. Despite this, UEFA remained confident that Wembley could host the final. On 22 June, the UK government altered the COVID-19 limitations in London to allow 75% of the stadium's capacity to be used, meaning that 60,000 spectators are expected to be present at the final as long as they show proof of having been tested or fully vaccinated. Special permission was also granted for up to 1,000 fans to fly in from Italy to watch the game. Special conditions, including being tested for COVID-19 before arrival, not being in the country for more than 12 hours, using dedicated transport and being in segregated seating at Wembley applied to the supporters from Italy. \c\cBefore the start of the tournament, England and Italy were considered two of the favourites to win the tournament. They were ranked fourth and seventh respectively in the FIFA World Rankings released before the start of the tournament. Both are FIFA World Cup champions, with Italy winning four times, the last time in 2006, and England winning it once in 1966 on home soil. Italy won the European Championship in 1968 on home soil, while England has only reached the semi-finals twice. Despite the final taking place in London, Italy were the "home team" for administrative purposes. \c\cItaly had previously played in three European Championship finals; they won against Yugoslavia in 1968 on home soil after a replay, lost via a golden goal against France in the Netherlands in 2000, and lost against Spain in Ukraine in 2012. They entered the final on a 33-match unbeaten run, the third-longest in international football history behind the 35-match streak of Brazil (1993–1996) and Spain (2007–2009), having last lost 1–0 to Portugal in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League on 10 September 2018. Italy were also on a 27-match unbeaten run in competitive fixtures, only behind the 29-match streak of Spain from 2010 to 2013. \c\cEngland made their debut in the final of the European Championship, having previously been eliminated in the semi-finals on two occasions, in 1968 (by Yugoslavia), and in 1996 (by Germany) as hosts. The final was England's first at a major tournament since winning the 1966 FIFA World Cup as hosts, the only other final they have reached. England also become the third nation of the 21st century, after Portugal in 2004 and France in 2016, to play in a European Championship final on home soil; however, both previous hosts lost their respective finals, against Greece in 2004 and Portugal in 2016. Apart from Italy's aforementioned win as hosts in 1968, the only other two occasions where a team played the final on home soil (Spain in 1964 and France in 1984) saw victory for the hosting side. Italy sought to win a major tournament for the first time in fifteen years, their last major triumph being victory in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final at the Olympiastadion in Berlin on penalties against France. This tournament success follows Italy's failure to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the Azzurri's first absence at a major tournament since the 1958 FIFA World Cup. \c\cThe two teams had previously met 27 times, with their first encounter taking place in 1933, a 1–1 draw in Rome. Before the final, Italy had won ten of these meetings, England eight, and nine draws. Their last meeting was a 2018 friendly in London, also a 1–1 draw. All four of their previous competitive meetings at major tournaments resulted in Italian victories: winning in the group stage of the UEFA Euro 1980, the third place play-off of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, the quarter-finals of the UEFA Euro 2012 (on penalties) and the group stage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. \c\cItaly qualified for the tournament as Group J winners with a perfect record of ten wins out of ten, and were drawn in Group A, along with Switzerland, Turkey and Wales; being one of the host nations, Italy played all three group games at home at Rome's Stadio Olimpico. Italy opened the tournament with a 3–0 win over Turkey, with Turkish defender Merih Demiral scoring an own goal to give the Italians the lead in the 53rd minute, before Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne netted two further attempts. Italy then managed to overcome a highly defensive Switzerland with another 3–0 triumph, with Manuel Locatelli scoring twice and Ciro Immobile netting the last goal to seal a place into the round of sixteen with a game to spare, despite captain Giorgio Chiellini suffering an injury. Having already secured a place in the knockout phase, Italy beat Wales 1–0 with a heavily rotated squad, with Matteo Pessina scoring the only goal in the first half to ensure the side finished with a perfect record in the group stage. \c\cIn the round of sixteen played at Wembley Stadium, Italy struggled against a very motivated and disciplined Austria, who had finished second in Group C. Austria's Marko Arnautović had a goal in the 67th minute ruled out for offside, and it was only in the first period of extra time that Italian substitutes Federico Chiesa and Pessina each delivered a goal to give Italy a 2–0 lead. Despite substitute Saša Kalajdžić salvaging a goal for Austria in the second half of extra time (the first goal conceded by the Italians at the tournament), Italy held on to reach the quarter-finals. \c\cItaly's quarter-final encounter against FIFA top-ranked Belgium, played in Munich's Allianz Arena, saw strong Italian domination, as Nicolò Barella beat Thibaut Courtois to score in the 31st minute, before Insigne doubled Italy's lead in the 44th minute with a powerful strike; Belgium's Romelu Lukaku then converted a successful penalty during stoppage time of the first half. Despite an achilles injury in the second half to Leonardo Spinazzola that ruled him out for the rest of the tournament, Italy once again held the scoreline to eliminate the Belgians. \c\cItaly then returned to Wembley to face Spain in the semi-finals, the fourth consecutive European Championship where the two sides met. In a tight game dominated by possession football, Italy got the breakthrough from Chiesa after sixty minutes; however, twenty minutes later Álvaro Morata equalised for Spain to level the match at 1–1. No further goals were scored in extra time, resulting in a penalty shoot-out; both Locatelli and Dani Olmo failed to score the first penalties for their respective sides, before Gianluigi Donnarumma saved Spain's fourth kick from Morata. Jorginho then scored the subsequent penalty to take Italy to their first European final since 2012. \c\cEngland qualified by topping Group A, winning seven and losing just one of their eight qualification matches. They were drawn into Group D, and like Italy, also played their three group matches at their home stadium, Wembley. Drawn together with England in Group D were co-hosts Scotland, qualification rivals Czech Republic and 2018 FIFA World Cup finalists Croatia, who had eliminated England at the aforementioned tournament. England started with a difficult 1–0 win over Croatia, Raheem Sterling being the difference with his goal in the 57th minute giving England their first three points; it was the first time that England had won the opening game of the group stage at a European Championship. In their second match, England were frustrated by old rivals Scotland to a goalless draw despite plenty of opportunities to finish the game; despite this, England were guaranteed a place in the last sixteen before their final group match due to other group results. England then confirmed top spot in the group by beating the Czech Republic 1–0, with a goal from Sterling early in the game. Acquiring seven points in the process, England knew they would remain at Wembley for the round of sixteen but would be facing a difficult tie with the runners-up from Group F. \c\cEngland faced Germany at Wembley in the second round, another chapter in the two sides\' long-running rivalry, where Sterling once again broke the deadlock, after 75 minutes. England then survived a scare when Germany's Thomas Müller ran through on goal but shot inches wide, before Harry Kane became the second player to score for England in the tournament to seal a historic 2–0 win, the first for the team against a German national side in the knockout stages of an international tournament since the 1966 World Cup final. \c\cEngland's quarter-final, played at Rome's Stadio Olimpico (their only match outside of Wembley in the entire tournament), saw the side outplay dark horse Ukraine in a 4–0 win, with Kane scoring twice and Harry Maguire and Jordan Henderson (with his first international goal) netting the others to give England their biggest ever victory at the European Championship finals. \c\cIn the semi-finals, England hosted Denmark at Wembley, and conceded their first goal of the tournament after thirty minutes, when Mikkel Damsgaard netted with a thunderous free kick that Jordan Pickford failed to keep out. Efforts to equalise by England eventually paid off less than ten minutes later with an own goal by Simon Kjær, but both sides failed to find another goal in normal time. In extra time, a penalty for a foul on Sterling was given to England in the first period. Harry Kane took the spot kick, scoring his fourth goal of the tournament from the rebound after his initial effort was saved by Kasper Schmeichel, to put England in a 2–1 lead. His side would hold on for the remainder of extra time, ending Denmark's dream run to see England qualify for a first-ever European final, and a first final overall since 1966, when they hosted the World Cup. Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the president of The Football Association Prince William, Duke of Cambridge all congratulated the England team on their run in the tournament, wishing them good luck in the final. \c\cOn 8 July 2021, the UEFA Referees Committee announced the officiating team for the final, led by 48-year-old Dutch referee Björn Kuipers of the Royal Dutch Football Association. He was joined be three of his compatriots, with Sander van Roekel and Erwin Zeinstra as assistant referees, and Pol van Boekel as one of the assistant VAR officials. Spaniard Carlos del Cerro Grande was chosen as the fourth official, with his fellow countryman Juan Carlos Yuste Jiménez as the reserve assistant referee. Bastian Dankert of Germany was selected as the video assistant referee for the match, the first use of the technology in the final of the European Championship, and was joined by fellow countrymen Christian Gittelmann and Marco Fritz as the remaining assistant VAR officials. Kuipers had been a FIFA referee since 2006, and was the first Dutch referee to officiate a European Championship final. UEFA Euro 2020 was his fifth major international tournament, after the European Championship in 2012 and 2016, and the FIFA World Cup in 2014 and 2018. He officiated three prior matches in the tournament: Denmark vs Belgium and Slovakia vs Spain in the group stage, as well as the Czech Republic vs Denmark quarter-final fixture. The match was the ninth international final for Kuipers, having officiated the finals of various UEFA youth competitions as well as the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2013–14 UEFA Champions League, 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup and 2017–18 UEFA Europa League. Domestically, he officiated the KNVB Cup finals in 2013, 2016, 2018 and 2021, as well as the Johan Cruyff Shield in 2009 and 2012. The final was the fourth match Kuipers has officiated of Italy (one win, one draw and two losses) and the third of England (two wins and one loss), which includes the group stage meeting between the two sides at the 2014 World Cup, won 2–1 by Italy. \c\cItaly had nearly all of their squad avaliable with the exception of defender Leonardo Spinazzola, who suffered an achilles injury in Italy's quarter final triumph against Belgium. For England, their midfielder Phil Foden was a doubt with a minor foot injury, having missed England's final training session on 10 July. He was assessed further by England's medical staff prior to the match to see whether he could participate. \c\cThousands of England fans gathered at Wembley Stadium throughout the morning and afternoon, which prompted the police to urge anyone without tickets to not travel there. Two hours before the final, footage showed hundreds of fans fighting with stewards and police as they attempted to force their way past barriers to get into the stadium. Huge crowds gathered in Leicester Square throwing bottles and other objects, and Trafalgar Square, where a ticketed fan zone was set up. The violence and disorder resulted in 45 people being arrested by police. \c\cThe closing ceremony was held prior to the start of the match at 19:45. \c\cFollowing England's loss in penalty shootouts, online racial abuse was directed at the three black England players who missed penalties – Rashford, Sancho and Saka. The FA and the England team released a statement strongly condemning the abuse. The Metropolitan Police said it was "totally unacceptable" and said they were investigating the incidents. \c\cITV and the BBC both broadcasted the game live in the UK. ITV planned to show a film, The Italian Job, ahead of the game. ITV's coverage of the game began at 18:30 British Summer Time and was presented by Mark Pougatch with punditry from Roy Keane, Ian Wright and Gary Neville, and pitchside analysis from Ashley Cole and Emma Hayes. ITV's commentators for the match were Sam Matterface and Lee Dixon. The BBC planned to begin its television coverage 10 minutes earlier than ITV, and announced Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard as its game analysts, alongside presenter Gary Lineker; commentators Guy Mowbray and Jermaine Jenas were supported by pitchside analysis from Jürgen Klinsmann and Alex Scott. The UK's Channel 4, which did not have rights to broadcast the tournament, instead aired, in a British television premiere, the full 1966 FIFA World Cup Final in colour the day before the game. In Italy, the final was covered by state broadcaster RAI and Sky Italia.
The 2020 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Euro 2020, or simply Euro 2020, was the 16th UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international men's football championship of Europe organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). \c\cThe tournament, held in 11 cities in 11 UEFA countries, was originally scheduled from 12 June to 12 July 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and rescheduled for 11 June to 11 July 2021. It retained the name UEFA Euro 2020. Portugal were the defending champions, having won the 2016 competition in France, but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Belgium. The video assistant referee (VAR) system was introduced at the European Championship in this tournament. \c\cUEFA President Michel Platini said in 2012 that the tournament was to be hosted in several nations as a "romantic" one-off event to celebrate the 60th "birthday" of the European Championship competition. Having the largest capacity of any of the stadiums entered for the competition, Wembley Stadium in London hosted the semi-finals and final for the second time, having done so before at the 1996 tournament in the stadium's former incarnation. The Stadio Olimpico in Rome was chosen to host the opening match, between Turkey and Italy. Originally to be played at 13 venues, two hosts were later removed: Brussels in December 2017 after the building of the city's Eurostadium was abandoned, and Dublin in April 2021, because there was no guarantee that spectators could attend. Spain also changed their host city from Bilbao to Seville to allow for spectators at matches. \c\cItaly won the final on penalties against England following a 1–1 draw after extra time. \c\cWhile some countries had already expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament, then-UEFA President Michel Platini suggested at a press conference on 30 June 2012, a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, that instead of having one host country (or joint hosting by multiple countries), the tournament could be spread over "12 or 13 cities" across the continent. At the time, UEFA already used a similar system for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship's Elite Round, where each of the seven groups is hosted by a different country. \c\cOn 6 December 2012, UEFA announced the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament. The selection of the host cities did not guarantee an automatic qualifying berth to the national team of that country. \c\cUEFA reasoned that the pan-European staging of the tournament was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty across Europe. Reaction to UEFA's plan was mixed across Europe. Critics have cited the expanded format (from 31 matches featuring 16 nations to 51 featuring 24) and its associated additional costs as the decisive factor for only one nation (Turkey) having put forward a serious bid. \c\cThe final list of bids was published by UEFA on 26 April 2014, with a decision on the hosts being made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014. There were two bids for the Finals Package (of which one was successful, marked with dark green for semi-finals and final) and 19 bids for the Standard Package (of which 12 were initially successful, marked with light green for quarter-finals and group stage, and yellow for round of 16 and group stage); Brussels, marked with red, were initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 7 December 2017. Dublin, marked in red, were initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 23 April 2021. On the same day, UEFA also announced the matches in Spain would be moved from Bilbao to Seville. \c\cIn early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe triggered concerns regarding its potential impact on players, staff and visitors to the twelve host cities of the tournament. At the UEFA Congress in early March, UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin said the organisation was confident that the situation could be dealt with, while general secretary Theodore Theodoridis stated that UEFA was maintaining contact with the World Health Organization and national governments regarding the coronavirus. The impact on football grew later that month, as numerous domestic and UEFA competition matches began taking place behind closed doors. By 13 March 2020, upcoming UEFA competition fixtures were postponed, while major European leagues were suspended, including the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, Premier League and Serie A. \c\cUEFA held a videoconference on 17 March 2020 with representatives of its 55 member associations, along with a FIFPro representative and the boards of the European Club Association and European Leagues, to discuss the response to the outbreak for domestic and European competitions, including Euro 2020. At the meeting, UEFA announced that the tournament would be postponed to the following year, proposing that it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The postponement allowed for pressure to be reduced on the public services in affected countries, while also providing space in the calendar for domestic European leagues that had been suspended to complete their seasons. On the following day, the Bureau of the FIFA Council approved the date change in the FIFA International Match Calendar. As a result, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup, due to take place in June and July 2021, was postponed. On 23 April 2020, UEFA confirmed that the tournament would still be known as UEFA Euro 2020. \c\cIn May 2020, Čeferin stated that in principle the tournament would take place in the twelve selected host cities. However, he did not rule out the possibility of reducing the number of cities, as three hosts were unsure if matches could be held under the new schedule. The tournament venues and match schedule was reviewed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 17 June 2020. At the meeting, UEFA confirmed that all twelve original host venues would remain as hosts for the tournament in 2021, and approved the revised match schedule. However, Čeferin stated in October 2020 that it was still possible that the tournament could be played in fewer than the planned twelve host countries. The following month, UEFA stated that it "intends to hold Euro 2020 in the format and the venues confirmed earlier this year and we are working closely with all host cities on preparations". It was also announced that each host was discussing with UEFA and local health authorities on whether the venue could host matches at full capacity, between 100% and 50% capacity, at 33% capacity or behind closed doors. Each host city was asked to draw up two or three plans from the four options. The restrictions could also involve only local spectators to be permitted at matches. A final decision on which scenario will be applied individually at each venue was originally to be made on 5 March 2021. In October 2020, it was announced that UEFA matches would be suspended from taking place in Armenia and Azerbaijan until further notice due to the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. However, this did not affect the planning of Euro 2020 matches to be held in Baku. This restriction was lifted in December 2020 following a ceasefire agreement between the countries. \c\cIn a New Year's interview, Čeferin said, "Vaccination has started and I think we will be able to have full stands in the summer. For now, the plan is to play in all twelve countries. Of course, there are backup options in case a country has a problem. We are ready to organise competitions in eleven, ten or nine cities... and even only in one country, if necessary. However, I am 99.9 percent sure that we will have the European Championship in all twelve cities, as planned." On 27 January 2021, UEFA met with the host associations to discuss operational matters, and reaffirmed the tournament would be held across twelve cities. The deadline for hosts to submit their venue capacity plans was moved to 7 April 2021, with a final decision on host cities and spectators to originally be made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 April 2021. UEFA announced on the following day that Daniel Koch, the former head of communicable diseases at Switzerland's Federal Office of Public Health, would serve as the tournament's medical advisor on matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, the Israel Football Association offered to stage some tournament matches in the country, which had a high rate of vaccination. However, this was turned down by UEFA, who reiterated their commitment to the twelve host cities. In a March 2021 interview, Čeferin said, "We have several scenarios, but the one guarantee we can make is that the option of playing any Euro 2020 match in an empty stadium is off the table. Every host must guarantee there will be fans at their games." UEFA subsequently stated that no host city would be automatically dropped should they decide to play matches behind closed doors. However, UEFA would need to consider whether it would make sense to play matches without spectators, or if these matches should be reallocated to other venues. That same month, British prime minister Boris Johnson offered UEFA to host additional tournament matches in England should any venues need to be reassigned. \c\cOn 9 April 2021, UEFA announced that eight of the original twelve tournament hosts confirmed their spectator plans, with stadium capacities ranging from 25% to 100%. Only Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome had yet to submit their plans, with each host originally given an extension until 19 April 2021 to submit their venue capacities. On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had guaranteed spectators for the tournament, and was therefore confirmed as a venue. On 19 April, it was announced that another extension was given to the three remaining hosts until 23 April, when UEFA would make its final decision. Due to the need to finalise ticketing details, host cities would have until 28 April to decide on whether to leave their spectator limits unchanged, or to upscale their allowed capacities. \c\cOn 23 April, UEFA announced that Seville would replace Bilbao as tournament host, while the matches of Dublin would be reallocated to Saint Petersburg for the group stage and London for the round of 16. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland was unable to receive assurances from the Government of Ireland and the Dublin City Council to allow spectators into the stadium. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said the sanitary conditions imposed by the Basque Government to host matches in Bilbao were "impossible to comply with", and thus would not allow for spectators to be present. After being removed as hosts, the Bilbao City Council stated they held UEFA and RFEF "directly responsible for us not staging this sporting event and the unilateral cancellation of our contractual relationships", and threatened legal action for financial compensation. \c\cAlso on 23 April, UEFA announced that local authorities had guaranteed "a minimum of 14,500 spectators" for the matches scheduled in Munich, which was therefore confirmed as host of four games. However, both the regional government of Bavaria and the German interior ministry subsequently reiterated their position that there was no such guarantee, and admittance of spectators would depend on the actual pandemic situation at the time of the tournament. A few days later, UEFA president Čeferin backtracked in an interview with a German newspaper, denying that UEFA had demanded guarantees for games with spectators, and conceding that "the local authorities will decide before the games whether spectators will be admitted or not."\c\cWembley Stadium's hosting of both the semi-finals and the final was threatened over quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom that fans and 2,500 VIPs would be subject to. The Puskás Aréna in Budapest was considered as an alternative venue, as Hungary would have no entry restrictions for travel within the Schengen Area and could host the matches at full capacity. A spokesman for the Hungarian Football Federation said the organisation was "ready to host any high-level football event". However, UEFA remained confident that Wembley could host the final, as the organisation and the UK government discussed quarantine exemptions, but did not rule out a change in venue. Minister Kit Malthouse said the government was doing "as much as we possibly can" to host the final, while prime minister Boris Johnson stated they would try to make "sensible accommodations" for UEFA while still prioritising public health. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the final should be held in Rome due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom. The following week, it was reported that officials and executives travelling for the matches would not need to self-isolate, though they would be subject to restrictions and required to remain in "football bubbles". \c\cOn 31 March 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of a maximum of five substitutions in matches at the tournament (with a sixth allowed in extra time). However, each team are only given three opportunities to make substitutions, with a fourth opportunity allowed in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time. The use of five substitutes has been permitted by IFAB during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resulting fixture congestion, which has created a greater burden on players. \c\cAt the start of April 2021, UEFA also said they were considering allowing tournament squads to be expanded from the usual 23 players, following calls from national team managers in case of a possible COVID outbreak in a team, as well as to reduce player fatigue caused by the fixture congestion of the prior season. On 27 April, it was reported that the UEFA National Team Competitions Committee had approved the expansion of squads to 26 players, subject to confirmation by the UEFA Executive Committee. On 4 May 2021, the executive committee confirmed the use of 26-player squads. However, teams still may only name a maximum of 23 players on the match sheet for each tournament fixture (of which 12 are substitutes), in line with the Laws of the Game. These 23 must include three goalkeepers. It was also announced that after each team's first match, goalkeepers may still be replaced due to physical incapacity, even if the other goalkeepers from the squad are still available. \c\cWater breaks were permitted so that players could drink from their own personal bottles. Cooling breaks, first seen at the 2014 FIFA World Cup were also permitted for games played in higher temperatures. \c\cOn 4 May 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved special rules for the final tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe:\c\cIf a group of players of a team were placed into mandatory quarantine or self-isolation following a decision from national or local health officials due to positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, the match will go ahead as scheduled as long as the team had at least 13 players available (including at least one goalkeeper). \c\cIf a team cannot field the minimum required number of players due to positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, the match may be rescheduled within the next 48 hours of the original date of the match by the UEFA administration, subject to viable rescheduling options being available. Additionally, UEFA may reassign the rescheduled match to an alternative venue if deemed appropriate. \c\cIf the match cannot be rescheduled, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will decide on the matter. The team responsible for the match not taking place are considered to have forfeited the match and lost 3–0. \c\cIf any member of the appointed referee team has to be replaced due to positive SARS-CoV-2 test, UEFA can exceptionally appoint a match official of the same nationality as one of the teams or not on the FIFA list. \c\cThere was no automatic qualifying berth, and all 55 UEFA national teams, including the 12 national teams whose countries were selected to stage matches, had to compete in the qualifiers for the 24 places at the finals tournament. As the host cities were appointed by UEFA in September 2014, before the qualifiers, it was possible for the national teams from the host cities to fail to qualify for the finals tournament. \c\cThe qualifying draw was held on 2 December 2018 at the Convention Centre Dublin in Dublin, Ireland. \c\cThe main qualifying process started in March 2019, instead of immediately in September 2018 following the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and ended in November 2019. The format remained largely the same, although only 20 of the 24 spots for the finals tournament were decided from the main qualifying process, leaving four spots still to be decided. Following the admission of Kosovo to UEFA in May 2016, it was announced that the 55 members at the time would be drawn into ten groups after the completion of the UEFA Nations League (five groups of five teams and five groups of six teams, with the four participants of the UEFA Nations League Finals guaranteed to be drawn into groups of five teams), with the top two teams in each group qualifying. The qualifiers were played on double matchdays in March, June, September, October and November 2019. \c\cWith the creation of the UEFA Nations League starting in 2018, the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League was linked with Euro qualifying, providing teams another chance to qualify for the tournament. Four teams from each division that had not already qualified for the European Championship competed in the play-offs for each division. The winners of the play-offs for each division, which were decided by two one-off semi-finals (the best-ranked team vs. the lowest-ranked team, and the second-best-ranked team vs. the third-best-ranked team, played at home of higher-ranked teams) and a one-off final (with the venue drawn in advance between the two semi-finals winners), joined the twenty teams that had already qualified for the tournament. \c\cOf the 24 teams that qualified for the tournament, 19 were returning from the 2016 edition. Among them are Belgium and Italy, who both had recorded flawless qualifying campaigns (10 wins in 10 matches), defending European champions Portugal and world champions France, with Germany also qualifying for a record 13th straight European Championship. Finland and North Macedonia made their European Championship debuts, having never previously qualified for a major tournament. Scotland, a co-host of the tournament, qualified for their first major international tournament since the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and their first European Championship since 1996. The Netherlands and Denmark returned after missing out in 2016, with the Dutch featuring in a major tournament for the first time since the 2014 FIFA World Cup. For the first time, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Wales reached successive European Championship tournaments. Greece, winners in 2004, were the only former champions that failed to qualify, missing their second straight European Championship and third consecutive major tournament. Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Romania failed to qualify after appearing in the 2016 finals. \c\cOf the 11 host countries, seven managed to qualify directly for the tournament, while Hungary and Scotland qualified via the play-offs. Romania were eliminated in the semi-finals of the play-offs, and Azerbaijan were eliminated following the qualifying group stage. The Republic of Ireland, originally selected as a tournament host, were also eliminated in the semi-finals of the play-offs, but were later stripped of their hosting rights. \c\cThe 13 original venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014. However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of Eurostadium. The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to Wembley Stadium in London. On 23 April 2021, UEFA announced that due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Aviva Stadium in Dublin was removed as a tournament host. Their four matches were reallocated to Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg for the three group stage matches, and Wembley Stadium in London for the round of 16 fixture. Similarly, UEFA reassigned the four matches in Spain elsewhere in the country, with La Cartuja in Seville replacing San Mamés in Bilbao. \c\cOn 7 December 2017, it was also announced that the opening match would take place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, chosen ahead of Amsterdam, Glasgow and Saint Petersburg. UEFA decided that, if they qualified, the opening match would feature Italy. \c\cOf the eleven selected cities and countries, seven cities and six countries had never hosted a European Championship finals match before. Seville was not a venue when Spain hosted the 1964 European Nations\' Cup, and none of Azerbaijan, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, Russia or Scotland had hosted the tournament previously. Of the eleven selected stadiums, only two had hosted a European Championship match before: the Stadio Olimpico (1968 and 1980) and the Johan Cruyff Arena (2000). The original Wembley stadium hosted games and the final in UEFA Euro 1996, but although it stands on the same site, this is classified as a different stadium to the current Wembley Stadium. \c\cEach city hosted three group stage matches and one match in the round of 16 or quarter-finals, with the exception of Saint Petersburg, which hosted six group stage matches, and London, which hosted host two matches in the round of 16. The match allocation for the eleven stadiums is as follows:\c\cGroup stage, round of 16, semi-finals and final: London (England)\c\cGroup stage and quarter-finals: Baku (Azerbaijan), Munich (Germany), Rome (Italy), Saint Petersburg (Russia)\c\cGroup stage and round of 16: Amsterdam (Netherlands), Bucharest (Romania), Budapest (Hungary), Copenhagen (Denmark), Glasgow (Scotland), Seville (Spain)\c\cThe host cities were divided into six pairings, established on the basis of sporting strength (assuming all host teams qualify), geographical considerations and security/political constraints. The pairings were allocated to groups by means of a random draw on 7 December 2017. Each qualified host country played a minimum of two matches at home. The following group venue pairings were announced:\c\cGroup A: Rome (Italy) and Baku (Azerbaijan)\c\cGroup B: Saint Petersburg (Russia) and Copenhagen (Denmark)\c\cGroup C: Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Bucharest (Romania)\c\cGroup D: London (England) and Glasgow (Scotland)\c\cGroup E: Originally Bilbao (Spain) and Dublin (Republic of Ireland)\c\cLater changed to Seville (Spain) and Saint Petersburg (Russia)\c\cGroup F: Munich (Germany) and Budapest (Hungary)\c\cThe following criteria apply to define the home matches of host teams within the same group:\c\cIf both host teams qualified directly or both advanced to the play-offs, a draw would determine which team would play all three group stage matches at home (i.e. which would host the head-to-head match), and which one would play only two matches at home. \c\cIf one host team qualified directly, and the other failed to also directly qualify, the directly qualified host team would play all three group stage matches at home, and the other host, if qualified, would play only two. \c\cIf one host team advances to the play-offs, and the other is eliminated entirely, the host team in the play-offs, if qualified, would play all three group stage matches at home. \c\cNo action was necessary should both host teams fail to qualify. \c\cIf a host team in the play-offs failed to qualify, the path winner would take the spot of the host in the match schedule and therefore would play the two or three matches based on the above criteria in the host city of the respective host that failed to qualify. The draw took place on 22 November 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland (along with the draw for the play-offs). In the draw, which was only necessary for Group B (Denmark and Russia), two balls were prepared, with the first drawn hosting the three matches. \c\cDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions on public gatherings, many of the venues at the tournament are unable to operate at full capacity. UEFA asked each host to devise a spectator plan in conjunction with their local/national government and health authorities. The hosts were given a deadline of 7 April 2021 to communicate their plans with UEFA. On 9 April, UEFA announced that eight of the tournament hosts had confirmed their stadium capacities, ranging from 25% to 100%. The remaining four hosts (Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome) were given an extension until 23 April to submit their venue capacities. On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had also confirmed its venue capacity. On 23 April, the venue capacity for Munich was also confirmed, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville, which could guarantee spectators. In addition, Dublin was removed as a host, as it was unable to ensure spectators could attend. \c\cMany of the matches did not see stadiums filled to their allowed capacity so far, with only Netherlands group stage matches that were played at the Johan Cruyff Arena seeing the stadium come within less than a thousand seats of being full. The match between England and Croatia saw an attendance of 18,497, compared to the allowed capacity of 22,500, with UEFA suggesting quarantine restrictions as the cause for the smaller attendance. \c\cEach team chose a "team base camp" for its stay between the matches. The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases. Unlike previous tournaments, each team can set up their base camp anywhere due to the pan-European format, without any obligation of staying in any of the host countries. \c\cThe base camps selected by the twenty directly qualified teams were announced by UEFA on 27 January 2020. The base camps of the remaining teams qualified via the play-offs were announced in 2021. \c\cThe draw for the final tournament was held on 30 November 2019, 18:00 CET (19:00 local time, EET) at Romexpo in Bucharest, Romania. The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four. The identity of the four play-off teams were not known at the time of the draw and were identified as play-off winners A to D. Should there have been groups that could not be finalised at the time of the final tournament draw, another draw would have been held after the play-offs on 1 April 2020, but UEFA confirmed the additional draw was not necessary after the identity of the 20 directly qualified teams and the 16 play-offs teams was known. \c\cThe teams were seeded in accordance with the European Qualifiers overall ranking based on their results in UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying. The following was the standard composition of the draw pots:\c\cPot 1: Group winners ranked 1–6\c\cPot 2: Group winners ranked 7–10, group runners-up ranked 1–2 (11–12 overall)\c\cPot 3: Group runners-up ranked 3–8 (13–18 overall)\c\cPot 4: Group runners-up ranked 9–10 (19–20 overall), play-off winners A–D (identity unknown at the time of the draw)\c\cAs two host teams from the same group could not be in the same seeding pot, the UEFA Emergency Panel would have either switched one host team with the lowest-ranked team of the higher pot, or switched one host team with the highest-ranked team of the lower pot (based on the principle that the move would have minimal impact on the original seeding). However, no seeding adjustments were necessary. \c\cThe draw started with Pot 1 and completed with Pot 4, from where a team was drawn and assigned to the first available group. The position in the group (for the determination of the match schedule) was then drawn. In the draw, the following conditions applied (including for teams that could still qualify via the play-offs):\c\cAutomatic group assignments: Host teams were automatically assigned to their group based on the host city pairings. \c\cProhibited clashes: For political reasons, UEFA set pairs of teams that were considered prohibited clashes. In addition to being unable to be drawn into the same group, non-host teams were prevented from being drawn into a group hosted by a country they clash with, even should the host not qualify. Only one prohibited clash, Russia / Ukraine, applied during the group stage draw. Other prohibited clashes among qualified and play-off teams were Kosovo / Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo / Serbia, but the teams in these pairs were all in the play-offs and in Pot 4 for the draw, and would not be in the same group; Kosovo / Russia was also prohibited, but they also would not be in the same group due to play-off path pairings necessary for host allocation. However, these prohibited clashes are not excluded for the knockout phase. \c\cDue to the format of the play-offs, which made anticipating all possible scenarios impossible, the UEFA administration had to wait to solve issues relating to the final tournament draw until the completion of the qualifying group stage. It was not possible for UEFA to prevent one of the play-off paths from containing two host teams, resulting in Romania (Group C hosts) and Hungary (Group F hosts) being drawn together in Path A. Therefore, the winner of this play-off path needed to be assigned two groups in the final tournament draw. To allow for this, Path A was paired with Path D (which does not contain a host), therefore providing a clear scenario for each possible qualified team. A draw took place on 22 November 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland (along with the draw for the play-offs), which decided on the order of priority for the allocation of Path A to the final tournament groups. \c\cTwo balls were prepared containing the names of the two groups hosted by the teams in question (Group C and Group F for Romania and Hungary, respectively). The first ball drawn determined the group ("priority group") that was allocated to Path A, with the exception of the host team of the second ball drawn ("non-priority group") winning Path A. In the draw, Group F was selected as the priority group, resulting in the following possible outcomes:\c\cPath A is won by Bulgaria, Hungary or Iceland: The winner of Path A will enter Group F, and the winner of Path D will enter Group C. (As Romania lost in the semi-finals of the play-offs, this was the resulting group assignment.)\c\cPath A is won by Romania: Romania will enter Group C, and the winner of Path D will enter Group F. \c\cThe following was the composition of the pots:\c\cThe draw resulted in the following groups (teams in italics are play-off winners whose identity was not known at the time of the draw):\c\cThe fixtures for the group stage were decided based on the draw results, as follows:\c\cNote: Positions for scheduling did not use the seeding pots, and instead used the draw positions, e.g. Team 1 was not necessarily the team from Pot 1 in the draw. \c\cTo lessen the load on players due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in case of an outbreak within a team, squad sizes were increased from 23 (used at every European Championship since 2004) to 26. However, the maximum number of players permitted on the match sheet for each tournament fixture will remain 23. Each nation's squad, which must include three goalkeepers, was submitted at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament (by 1 June 2021). If a player becomes injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he can be replaced by another player. However, goalkeepers may still be replaced after his team's first match due to physical incapacity. \c\cOn 27 September 2018, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) system for the first time at the UEFA European Championship. On 12 February 2020, UEFA and CONMEBOL signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance collaboration, including the possibility of a team of South American match officials appointed for the group stage of the tournament. \c\cOn 21 April 2021, UEFA announced the 19 refereeing teams for the tournament. This includes Argentine referee Fernando Rapallini and his assistants, who are the first South American officials to be selected for the European Championship as part of UEFA's referee exchange programme with CONMEBOL. A group of Spanish officials were similarly selected for the 2021 Copa América. \c\cA refereeing team of nine officials is appointed for each match. The team of five at the stadium consists of a referee, two assistant referees, a fourth official and a reserve assistant referee. In addition, four video match officials are located at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. This team consists of a video assistant referee (the lead video official who is the main point of contact with the referee), an assistant video assistant referee (AVAR 1, who concentrates on following the match), an offside VAR (AVAR 2, who reviews all potential offside situations) and a support VAR (AVAR 3, who acts in a coordination capacity). The tournament uses the 2021 Laws of the Game, which come into force on 1 July but can be introduced in competitions that begin immediately beforehand. \c\cIn addition, UEFA announced 22 video match officials and 12 support match officials (who acts as fourth official or reserve assistant referee). This includes support referee Stéphanie Frappart, the first female official at the UEFA European Championship finals. \c\cThe opening ceremony took place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy, on 11 June 2021 at 20:35 (CEST) prior to the first match of the tournament. Italian opera tenor Andrea Bocelli performed the song "Nessun dorma". Martin Garrix, Bono and the Edge also featured, performing the tournament's official anthem, "We Are the People". The performance was a virtual one amid the COVID-19 pandemic and was filmed at motion-control studios in London and at the Stadio Olimpico to recreate the stadium environment in 3D. \c\cUEFA announced the original tournament schedule on 24 May 2018, which only included kick-off times for the opening match and quarter-finals onward. The kick-off times of the remaining group stage and round of 16 matches were announced on 30 November 2019 following the final draw. On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced the revised match schedule for the tournament in 2021. All match dates, kick-off times and venues remained identical, but shifted one day earlier so matches would remain on the same day of the week (i.e. from 12 to 11 June for the opening match to remain on a Friday). On 23 April 2021, UEFA revised the venue assignments of the match schedule after one stadium was removed from the tournament and another was replaced. \c\cGroup winners, runners-up, and the best four third-placed teams advance to the round of 16. \c\cTimes are CEST (UTC+2), as listed by UEFA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given. \c\cIf two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria are applied:\c\cHigher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\c\cSuperior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;\c\cHigher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\c\cIf, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who are still level to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 10 apply;\c\cSuperior goal difference in all group matches;\c\cHigher number of goals scored in all group matches;\c\cHigher number of wins in all group matches;\c\cIf on the last round of the group stage, two teams are facing each other and each has the same number of points, as well as the same number of goals scored and conceded, and the score finishes level in their match, their ranking is determined by a penalty shoot-out. (This criterion is not used if more than two teams have the same number of points.);\c\cLower disciplinary points total in all group matches (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card, 4 points for a yellow card followed by a direct red card);\c\cHigher position in the European Qualifiers overall ranking. \c\cNotes\c\cIn the knockout phase, if a match is level at the end of normal playing time, extra time is played (two periods of 15 minutes each), with each team being allowed to make a sixth substitution. If still tied after extra time, the match is decided by a penalty shoot-out. \c\cAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there is no third place play-off. \c\cTimes are CEST (UTC+2), as listed by UEFA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given. \c\cThere were 142 goals scored in 51 matches, for an average of 2.78 goals per match. \c\cThe tournament had the highest goal average since UEFA Euro 1976, prior to the introduction of the group stage. Eleven own goals were scored in the tournament, two more than at all the previous tournaments combined. With his goals in this tournament, Cristiano Ronaldo became the top goalscorer at the European Championship with 14 goals. \c\c5 goals\c\c4 goals\c\c3 goals\c\c2 goals\c\c1 goal\c\c1 own goal\c\cSource: UEFA\c\cPlayer of the Tournament\c\c Gianluigi Donnarumma\c\cThe Player of the Tournament award was given to Gianluigi Donnarumma, the first goalkeeper to win the award, who was chosen by UEFA's technical observers. \c\cYoung Player of the Tournament\c\c Pedri –  (2002-11-25)25 November 2002 (aged 18)\c\cThe Young Player of the Tournament award, open to players born on or after 1 January 1998, was given to Pedri, as chosen by UEFA's technical observers. \c\cTop Scorer\c\cThe "Alipay Top Scorer Trophy", given to the top scorer of the tournament, was awarded to Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored five goals and recorded one assist. The ranking was determined using the following criteria: 1) goals, 2) assists, 3) fewest minutes played, 4) goals in qualifying. \c\cThe prize money was finalised in February 2018. Each team received a participation fee of €9.25 million, with the winner able to earn a maximum of €34 million. \c\cA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:\c\cReceiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)\c\cReceiving two yellow cards in two different matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\c\cThe following offences warranted a suspension during the tournament:\c\cThe official logo was unveiled on 21 September 2016, during a ceremony at the City Hall in London. The logo depicts the Henri Delaunay Trophy surrounded by celebrating fans on a bridge, which, according to UEFA, represents how football connects and unifies people. \c\cEach individual host city also has their own unique logo. The rectangular logos feature the text "UEFA EURO 2020" on the top, the city name above the text "host city" on the bottom (all in uppercase), the main tournament logo on the left and a local bridge on the right. Each logo exists in English, along with variations in the local language when applicable. The logos were unveiled from September 2016 to January 2017. \c\cThe official slogan of the tournament is "Live It. For Real." The slogan is meant to encourage fans to see the matches live in the stadiums across Europe. \c\cOn 6 November 2019, UEFA announced that the "Uniforia" by Adidas would be the tournament's official match ball. Predominantly white, the ball features black strokes with blue, neon and pink stripes, and has coordinates of 12 cities which has hosted the finals (Including Dublin and Bilbao, which was later removed as the host cities). The name is derived from a portmanteau of "unity" and "euphoria". \c\cA special variation named "Uniforia Finale" was launched on 5 July 2021, to be used in both semifinals and final match. The ball has silver base, different colors arrangement, and has London's coordinate (51° 33′ 21,5′′ N , 0° 16′ 46,4′′ W) written on the ball. \c\cThe official mascot of the tournament, Skillzy, was unveiled on 24 March 2019. The character is inspired by freestyle football, street football and panna culture. \c\cOn 19 October 2019, Dutch DJ and music producer Martin Garrix was announced as the official music artist of the tournament. He produced the official song of the tournament, as well as the walkout music preceding matches and the television broadcast music. The official song, "We Are the People", features Bono and the Edge from Irish rock band U2 and was released on 14 May 2021. It was first performed in full at a virtual opening ceremony at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. \c\cThe game was released by Konami as a free DLC on eFootball PES 2020 in June 2020, and on the 2021 Season Update on launch day. It includes the official kits and player likenesses for all 55 officially licensed UEFA teams. The update also includes five out of eleven venues of the tournament, as well as the official match ball. \c\cUEFA has the following "partners":\c\c"National Team Football Official Sponsors": Alipay, Booking Holdings, FedEx, Gazprom, Hisense, and Volkswagen. \c\c"EURO 2020 Official Sponsors": Coca-Cola, Heineken, Qatar Airways, Takeaway.com, TikTok, and Vivo Mobile. \c\c"EURO 2020 Official Licensees": Adidas, Hublot, IMG, Konami, and Panini. \c\cThe International Broadcast Centre (IBC) is located at the Expo Haarlemmermeer in Vijfhuizen, Netherlands. \c\cThe team of Ukraine presented its shirt for the championship, decorated with a map of national borders, including Crimea. The peninsula was annexed by the Russian Federation in 2014 but is still considered part of its territory by Ukraine. Also on the shirt there was the slogan "Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the slogan was nationalist and imitated a Nazi slogan. Russian MP Dmitry Svishchev called UEFA to intervene because the shirt was "totally inappropriate". The UEFA said there was no dispute for the map of Ukraine, as it reflected the borders recognized by the United Nations, while it ordered the removal of the phrase, as "specific combination of the two slogans is deemed to be clearly political in nature, having historic and militaristic significance". \c\cThe Denmark vs Finland match in Group B was suspended minutes prior to half-time after Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen collapsed on the pitch due to a sudden cardiac arrest. He was transferred to Rigshospitalet and stabilised, with the match resuming by the decision of the Danish team later that evening. Following the match, the Danish team stated that it was unfair they had to decide to continue playing the match. Former international Peter Schmeichel claimed the Danish team had been given three options by UEFA: to finish the game that same day, to finish the game the next day at 12pm, or to forfeit the game and lose 3–0. UEFA denied that either team had been threatened with a forfeit. \c\cBritish broadcaster BBC received over 6,000 complaints over the UEFA video-feed broadcasting live images of Eriksen receiving CPR on the pitch. \c\cIn Austria's match against North Macedonia on 13 June 2021, Austrian player Marko Arnautović insulted Macedonian player Ezgjan Alioski and his family after his goal to make it 3–1. Arnautović is of Serbian descent, and Alioski is of Albanian descent; both countries have been in political conflict due to Kosovo for decades. The Football Federation of Macedonia lodged a complaint with UEFA after the game, demanding a clear penalty. The UEFA Control Committee then opened an investigation. As a result, Arnautović was banned from the next game by UEFA for "insulting another player" and therefore unable to play in Austria's second group game against the Netherlands. \c\cAt a press conference before Portugal's first game on 14 June 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo removed Coca-Cola bottles from the table and then held a water bottle in front of the camera to highlight that water, healthier than Coca-Cola or soda drink, is his ideal drink; it was thought that Ronaldo's actions were behind the collapse of Coca-Cola market value, but it was later found it had nothing to do with it. After France's first game against Germany, Paul Pogba moved bottles of non-alcoholic Heineken beer from the table at a press conference. After these two actions, UEFA spoke with each team participating in the European Championship, in which it pointed out the importance of sponsors. UEFA also said that if it happened again, then punishments would be given out to those players. \c\cIn the run-up to the match between Germany and France on 15 June 2021 in Munich, a man with a paramotor got stuck on a fixed rope during a flight over the Allianz Arena, fell into a descent, grazed the spectator stands, and landed on the pitch. In the action planned as a protest by Greenpeace against car manufacturer Volkswagen, in which only a large ball with a label was supposed to be thrown onto the field, two people in the stands suffered head injuries and had to receive medical care. The campaign provoked strong criticism due to the endangerment of viewers; UEFA criticised it as a "reckless and dangerous action" that could have had serious consequences for many people. The German Football Association (DFB), the Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder, and other politicians made similar statements, and Greenpeace apologised. A total flight ban has been issued over the Allianz Arena for the duration of the European Championship. The Munich police are investigating the paramotor pilot for dangerous bodily harm, trespassing, and violation of the Aviation Act. \c\cIn connection with Pride Month, the German team used related symbolism. Team captain Manuel Neuer wore a captain's armband in rainbow colours in a friendly against Latvia on 7 June and continued to wear the armband in Germany's subsequent games. An investigation by UEFA followed during the group stage of the tournament. They assessed the armband as a "team symbol for diversity", and thus as a "good cause." UEFA decided not to impose a penalty because of the rule broken by Neuer, which obliges team captains to wear UEFA captains\' armbands. \c\cBefore the group stage match between Germany and Hungary on 23 June 2021, Munich City Council applied to UEFA to have the façade of the stadium illuminated in rainbow colours as a sign of diversity and tolerance. Since the project was understood as a protest against a law passed by the Hungarian Parliament that restricts the information rights of young people with regard to homosexuality and gender transitioning, UEFA rejected the application with reference to its status as a politically and religiously neutral organisation. After initially approving the illumination of the stadium in rainbow colours, the German Football Association joined the UEFA position. The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter criticised these decisions and described the illumination not as a political measure but as a sign of humanity and a symbol for the acceptance of equality between people. In contrast, the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Péter Szijjártó welcomed UEFA's decision "not to be involved in a political provocation against Hungary."\c\cNumerous reactions from almost all German political parties condemned the ban by UEFA. Nationwide, other football stadiums, such as those in Cologne, Augsburg, Frankfurt, Wolfsburg, Berlin, and Darmstadt, were to be illuminated in the rainbow colours. Munich illuminated the Town Hall, Olympiaturm, and the wind turbine right next to the football arena. In the Netherlands, the Erasmusbrug, Ziggo Dome, tower in Alphen aan den Rijn and several town halls were illuminated. In protest against the UEFA ban, large corporations are also dipping their company logos on social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, in rainbow colours, including BMW, Volkswagen, Deutsche Telekom, Siemens, Sparkasse, and HypoVereinsbank. Amnesty International and CSD Germany announced that they would be distributing up to 11,000 flags, 5,000 cardboard boxes, and 4,500 stickers with the words "Don\'t Kick LGBTIQ Rights" to fans in front of the stadium. On 23 June, UEFA itself also changed their logo in social media to include a rainbow background, with a statement that "the rainbow is not a political symbol, but a sign of our firm commitment to a more diverse and inclusive society." As a counter-action, Gábor Kubatov, president of the Hungarian club Ferencváros and vice-president of Fidesz, has called for stadiums in Hungary to be illuminated in the Hungarian national colours. In addition, Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán cancelled a visit to Munich in protest. \c\cOn 3 July 2021, UEFA began an investigation after two fans had a rainbow flag confiscated during the quarter-final match between the Czech Republic and Denmark at the Baku Olympic Stadium in Azerbaijan. Photos emerged while the match was being played, showing two stewards taking a rainbow flag, waved in support of the LGBT community, being taken. In a statement, UEFA said: "UEFA never instructed stewards in Baku – or in any other stadium – to confiscate rainbow flags. We are currently investigating what happened and we will of course contact the UEFA delegate, UEFA security officer and local authorities to clear this up. The rainbow flag is a symbol that embodies UEFA core values, promoting everything that we believe in – a more just and egalitarian society, tolerant of everyone and UEFA has ensured that the flag was returned to the supporter."\c\cIn the 104th minute in the semi-final match between England and Denmark, on-field referee Danny Makkelie awarded a penalty kick to England after adjudging Danish defender Joakim Mæhle to have fouled English player Raheem Sterling in the penalty area. Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel stopped Harry Kane's penalty kick, but Kane was able to score from the rebound. In a press conference shortly after the match, Danish coach Kasper Hjulmand expressed his dissatisfaction with the penalty decision, as well as the fact that there were two balls on the pitch when the foul was given. Non-English commentators such as Arsène Wenger, José Mourinho and Dietmar Hamann criticised the penalty decision during and after the match, arguing that the penalty should not have been awarded when checked by VAR, while Roy Keane described it as "very, very soft". Former England forward Alan Shearer also described the penalty decision as "soft" and said he would be "pretty angry if that penalty was given against England", while former England full-back Gary Neville said "If we\'re being fair, you\'d be absolutely devastated if you lost to a penalty like that" and match official Mark Clattenburg (who refereed the 2016 final) said he would not have awarded a penalty kick for a tackle of this sort "in such a key moment". \c\cThe Birmingham Mail claimed Denmark disrupted the English wall during a critical free kick that led to the opening goal of the match, and that Denmark's goal should have been disallowed as a result. According to the FIFA Laws of the Game, during a free kick, attackers must be within one metre from the defending team's wall, a rule that was violated by the Danish players who were accused of blocking goalkeeper Jordan Pickford's vision. \c\cOn 8 July 2021, a day after the match, UEFA opened a disciplinary case against the English Football Association over a laser pointed at Danish goalkeeper Schmeichel just before the decisive penalty, booing when the Danish national anthem was played, and use of pyrotechnics. The laser pointer first came to the notice of both the Football Association and UEFA in the first half of extra time but a search for the culprit was unsuccessful. The Football Association were fined £25,630 (€30,000) for the three offences. \c\cOn the day of the final between Italy and England, thousands of England fans gathered at Wembley Stadium throughout the morning and afternoon, which prompted the police to urge anyone without tickets to not travel there. Two hours before the final, footage showed hundreds of fans fighting with stewards and police as they attempted to force their way past barriers to get into the stadium. Huge crowds gathered in Leicester Square throwing bottles and other objects, and Trafalgar Square, where a ticketed fan zone was set up. The violence and disorder resulted in 45 people being arrested by police. \c\cEngland football players Bukayo Saka, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford were subjected to racist abuse online after missing penalties in England's Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy. The three football players took the last three penalties – two of which were saved by Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma – during England's 3–2 loss on penalties on Sunday 11 July 2021, and were all immediately targeted with racist language and emojis on their social media accounts. The Football Association condemned the racist abuse and said it was "appalled by the online racism" aimed at some players on social media. In a statement, it said: \c\cThe Metropolitan Police began investigating the abuse and said on Twitter that the abuse was "totally unacceptable" and it would not be tolerated. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the president of the FA Prince William, Duke of Cambridge also condemned the racist abuse.
A fire occurred at a Al-Hussein Teaching Hospital for COVID-19 isolation ward in Nasiriyah, Iraq. The fire left at least 66 people dead and another 100 were injured.
The 2021 Taliban offensive is an ongoing military offensive led by the Taliban against the government of Afghanistan and its allies that is simultaneous with the withdrawal of most US troops from Afghanistan. \c\cAs of 12 July 2021, the Taliban has seized 139 districts from the Afghan government. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War of 1996–2001, resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north in 2021 may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cIn the month of May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. \c\cDuring the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cIn the month of June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. Meanwhile the city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan’s main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway of Afghanistan’s capital city Kabul. \c\cIn terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cOn 19 June, Afghan Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. \c\cDuring the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. \c\cAs of 8 July, 161 Afghan National Security Forces and 24 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,434 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. \c\cAs of 12 July, the Taliban captured 55 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second-largest city of Afghanistan, Kandahar. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled to Iran to escape the Taliban. On 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. \c\cOn 12 July, Austin Miller stepped down from his post as commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. \c\c Afghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahideen, Ismail Khan declared the formation of "People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan" to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. \c\c Taliban: On 9 July, a Taliban spokesman from Moscow, Russia, said that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan" and pointed that it "was not part of the agreement" with the US not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\c Russia: Russian authorities said they were working with the Tajik government to protect it from any foreign threat under the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). \c\c Tajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon ordered 20,000 reserve servicemen of the country's Ground Forces to be sent to the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. \c\c Turkey: The country offered to order its troops to protect Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \c\c Turkmenistan: On July 12, 2021, it's reported that Turkmen military forces are being assigned to the Afghan-Turkmen border due to security concerns. \c\c United States: US President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of US troops saying that the country had not gone to Afghanistan to "nation build". Biden added that he would not "send another generation of Americans to fight there" and pointed to other failed attempts at unifying Afghanistan in the past. He also reassured that the US safety was not at risk with any outcome of the infighting in Afghanistan.
The 2021 Cuban protests are a series of ongoing protests against the Cuban government and the ruling Communist Party of Cuba that began on 11 July 2021, triggered by shortages of food and medicine and the government's response to the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba. The protests have been described as the largest anti-government protests since the Maleconazo in 1994. \c\cIn 2020, the economic situation in Cuba worsened due to inefficiency and red tape while Donald Trump-era sanctions reduced remittances from the US; government detractors have also named the Soviet-style one-party system as a cause. A monetary reform resulted in inflation and lines for food began to appear. The government chose to develop its own COVID-19 vaccine instead of purchasing foreign vaccines though the process was delayed on multiple occasions. As COVID-19 cases began to spread through Cuba, they increased more in the province of Matanzas; a situation that was further aggravated by the shortage of medicines and food. The government responded by deploying more doctors to the province. \c\cDue to the evolving crises, a campaign using the hashtags #SOSCUBA and #SOSMATANZAS was initiated on social media to collect money, medical materials, food and other supplies to be sent to the affected places. Various international figures such as Don Omar, Ricardo Montaner, Alejandro Sanz, Nicky Jam, J Balvin, Daddy Yankee, Becky G and Mia Khalifa joined the request. The Cuban government recognized the crisis describing it as "very complex" but rejected a proposed humanitarian corridor and described the campaign as an attempt to misrepresent the situation. Cuba set up a bank account to receive aid and said that it was open to receive donations though the designated account is in a Cuban bank under United States sanctions. Historically, the government has refused or seized aid coming from Cuban exiles. \c\cOn 11 July 2021, at least two spontaneous demonstrations emerged in San Antonio de los Baños, near Havana, and Palma Soriano, in the province of Santiago de Cuba, singing the song "Patria y Vida" which has become iconic for the opposition of Castroism. Videos of protesters singing slogans of "Freedom", "Down with communism" and "We are not afraid" were broadcast on social networks in addition to protesters demanding vaccines. Opposition media such as Martí Noticias have published social media videos of protests on the Malecón in Havana, Santiago, Santa Clara, Ciego de Ávila, Camagüey, Bayamo, Guantánamo, San José de las Lajas, Holguín, Cárdenas. According to Orlando Gutiérrez, an exiled dissident of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, there were protests in more than 15 cities and towns in Cuba. Gutiérrez asked the United States government to lead an international intervention to prevent protesters from being "victims of a bloodbath". The San Isidro Movement called on the people to march to Malecón in Havana. \c\cCuban president and Communist Party first secretary Díaz-Canel said that the United States\' embargo against Cuba and economic sanctions were responsible for the situation leading to the unrest. He urged his supporters to take to the streets in response to the demonstrations, saying "The order to fight is given, the revolutionaries to the streets" in a special television broadcast. The Cuban government called the protests "counterrevolutionary". Younger Cubans comprised the majority of protesters while older generations responded to demonstrations, assisting Cuban authorities. \c\cFollowing First Secretary Díaz-Canel's statements, about 300 government supporters arrived at El Capitolio with one Associated Press (AP) cameraman being assaulted by these supporters while a separate AP photographer was injured by police. AP photographer Ramon Espinosa was detained by authorities as well. San Antonio residents reported that the police repressed protesters and detained certain participants. In videos circulated on social media, people were seen throwing stones at police while reports of authorities beating demonstrators were heard. By the evening, protests had dissipated. \c\cCuban journalist Yoani Sánchez reported that after the protests on 11 July some were  injured and there were hundreds of detentions. \c\cOn 12 July, newer protests were reported in Cuba. A journalist from the Spanish newspaper ABC was arrested and a group of protesters destroyed a painting with the image of Fidel Castro. Internet watchdog NetBlocks reported that social media platforms in Cuba began to be censored on 12 July 2021 though VPN networks were able to bypass government blockages and with a police presence in the streets of Havana. Dozens of women gathered in front of police stations to inquire about the whereabouts of their husbands, children and relatives arrested or disappeared during the events of the previous day. Faced with the accusations of missing persons, Díaz-Canel stated: "They have already come up with the fact that in Cuba we repress, we murder Where are the Cuban murders? Where is the Cuban repression? Where are the disappeared in Cuba?"\c\cA meeting of the top leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba including former First Secretary Raúl Castro was held where the issue of the protests was addressed and it was concluded that "the provocations orchestrated by counterrevolutionary elements, organized and financed from the United States with destabilizing purposes, were analyzed". \c\cDíaz-Canel also concluded the day accusing the United States of having a policy of "economic asphyxiation [to] cause social unrest" in Cuba. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla labeled the protesters as "vandals". \c\cDuring interview with Spanish television program Todo es mentira, Cuban YouTuber and activist Dina Stars was detained on live by Cuban security officers. \c\c President Alberto Fernández said that he did not know what was happening in Cuba and blamed the humanitarian crisis on the United States embargo against Cuba. \c\c President Luis Arce expressed his support for the Cuban people who "fight against destabilizing actions". Former President Evo Morales accused the United States of launching a new Operation Condor. \c\c President Jair Bolsonaro commented that it was a sad day for Cuba because people requested freedom and received shots, attacks and prison instead. He said that there are people in Brazil who support Cuba, Venezuela and "those kinds of people". \c\c The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement condemning the repression in order "to silence protesters who peacefully claim greater freedom, better health system and better quality of life". It also highlighted that "freedom of expression and peaceful assembly must be guaranteed."\c\c President Andrés Manuel López Obrador urged foreign governments not to intervene in the internal affairs of Cuba and stated that it is the Cubans who solve their problems. In addition to this, he also said that if they want to help, they should help end the blockade. \c\c President Daniel Ortega sent his expressions of support to Miguel Díaz-Canel, condemning the "permanent blockade, destabilization and aggression" against Cuba. \c\c Maria Zakharova, Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, stated that they "consider it unacceptable for there to be outside interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state or any destructive actions that would encourage the destabilization of the situation on the island."\c\c Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a statement was issued recognizing the right of Cubans "to demonstrate freely and peacefully" and that "forms of aid that could alleviate the situation" will be studied. \c\c Julie J. Chung, Acting Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs for the United States Department of State, stated "We are deeply concerned by \'calls to combat\' in Cuba. We stand by the Cuban people’s right for peaceful assembly. We call for calm and condemn any violence." President Joe Biden said that he supports the Cuban people and their "clarion call for freedom and relief". \c\c President Luis Lacalle Pou expressed his support for the opposition protesters, saying they had "commendable courage."\c\c President Nicolás Maduro expressed "all the support to the Cuban revolutionary government" [...] as expressed support on a phone call to president Miguel Díaz-Canel. \c\c EU foreign relations chief Josep Borrell said that "the Cuban people have a right to express their opinion" and that he would "personally call on the government there to allow peaceful demonstrations and to listen to the voice of discontent from demonstrators". \c\c Secretary General Luis Almagro condemned the "Cuban dictatorial regime for calling on civilians to repress and confronting those who exercise their rights to protest". \c\cÉrika Guevara-Rosas, director of Amnesty International for the Americas, declared that internet cuts were reported in places where people had gone to protest, and called on the government of Díaz-Canel to respect the right of peaceful assembly. \c\cRepublican Senator from Florida Marco Rubio demanded President Joe Biden to call on Cuba's military to support protesters while Democratic Senator from New Jersey Bob Menendez said the United States should "stand in solidarity with the brave people of Cuba that are risking their lives today for change in their country and a future of Patria y Vida". \c\cFormer U.S. President Donald Trump in a statement expressed support for Cuban protesters, urging Biden to "stand against communism" and criticizing former President Barack Obama for "playing baseball while the Castros imprisoned people". \c\cFormer Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva condemned the US embargo on Cuba and expressed solidarity with the Cuban government. \c\cThe ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV in Spanish) expressed its support towards the Cuban government and president Miguel Díaz-Canel. \c\cCubans residing in Chile marched to the Cuban consulate in Santiago in support of the protests. Protests in Miami urging United States to provide aid for the protests in Cuba have taken place. Mayor of Miami Francis X. Suarez, a Cuban American, said it was time for a US-led international intervention in Cuba, saying "We are asking the federal government to do everything possible and not waste this moment" and that "this moment can mean freedom to so many in the hemisphere, from Nicaraguans to those who suffer under the Maduro regime in Venezuela". Demonstrations also took place at the Puerta del Sol in Madrid, Spain. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, a protest took place in front of the Cuban embassy in Buenos Aires with protesters holding placards with the phrases "Homeland and life" and others with the slogan "S.O.S. Cuba". In São Paulo, Brazil, political parties and social movements staged a protest in favor of the Cuban government and "in defense of sovereignty" in front of the Consulate General of Cuba.
An exoplanet (extrasolar planet) is a planet located outside the Solar System. The first evidence of an exoplanet was noted as early as 1917, but was not recognized as such until 2016. No planet discovery has yet come from that evidence. However, the first scientific detection of an exoplanet began in 1988. Afterwards, the first confirmed detection came in 1992, with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. The first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star was made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby star 51 Pegasi. Some exoplanets have been imaged directly by telescopes, but the vast majority have been detected through indirect methods, such as the transit method and the radial-velocity method. As of 1 April 2022, there are 4,984 confirmed exoplanets in 3,673 planetary systems, with 815 systems having more than one planet. This is a list of the most notable discoveries. \c\cGamma Cephei Ab: The radial velocity variations of the star Gamma Cephei were announced in 1989, consistent with a planet in a 2.5-year orbit. However, misclassification of the star as a giant combined with an underestimation of the orbit of the Gamma Cephei binary, which implied the planet's orbit would be unstable, led some astronomers to suspect the variations were merely due to stellar rotation. The existence of the planet was finally confirmed in 2002. \c\cHD 114762 b: This object has a minimum mass 11 times the mass of Jupiter and has an 89-day orbit. At the time of its discovery it was regarded as a probable brown dwarf, although subsequently it has been included in catalogues of extrasolar planets. It was found to be indeed a brown dwarf or red dwarf star (and not an exoplanet) in 2019. \c\cPSR B1257+12: The first confirmed discovery of extrasolar planets was made in 1992 when a system of terrestrial-mass planets was announced to be present around the millisecond pulsar PSR B1257+12. \c\c51 Pegasi b: In 1995 this became the first exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star to have its existence confirmed. It is a hot Jupiter with a 4.2-day orbit. \c\c47 Ursae Majoris b: In 1996 this Jupiter-like planet was the first long-period planet discovered, orbiting at 2.11 AU from the star with the eccentricity of 0.049. There is a second companion that orbits at 3.39 AU with the eccentricity of 0.220 ± 0.028 and a period of 2190 ± 460 days. \c\cGliese 876 b: In 1998, the first planet was found that orbits around a red dwarf star (Gliese 876). It is closer to its star than Mercury is to the Sun. More planets have subsequently been discovered even closer to the star. \c\cUpsilon Andromedae: The first multiple-planetary system to be discovered around a main sequence star. It contains three planets, all of which are Jupiter-like. Planets b, c, d were announced in 1996, 1999, and 1999 respectively. Their masses are 0.687, 1.97, and 3.93 MJ; they orbit at 0.0595, 0.830, and 2.54 AU respectively. In 2007 their inclinations were determined as non-coplanar. \c\cHD 209458 b: After being originally discovered with the radial-velocity method, this became the first exoplanet to be seen transiting its parent star. The transit detection conclusively confirmed the existence of the planets suspected to be responsible for the radial velocity measurements. \c\cHD 209458 b: Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope announced that they had detected the atmosphere of HD 209458 b. They found the spectroscopic signature of sodium in the atmosphere, but at a smaller intensity than expected, suggesting that high clouds obscure the lower atmospheric layers. In 2008 the albedo of its cloud layer was measured, and its structure modeled as stratospheric. \c\cIota Draconis b: The first planet discovered around the giant star Iota Draconis, an orange giant. This provides evidence for the survival and behavior of planetary systems around giant stars. Giant stars have pulsations that can mimic the presence of planets. The planet is very massive and has a very eccentric orbit. It orbits on average 27.5% further from its star than Earth does from the Sun. In 2008 the system's origin would be traced to the Hyades cluster, alongside Epsilon Tauri. \c\cPSR B1620-26 b: On July 10, using information obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, a team of scientists led by Steinn Sigurðsson confirmed the oldest extrasolar planet yet. The planet is located in the globular star cluster M4, about 5,600 light years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius. This is one of only three planets known to orbit around a stellar binary; one of the stars in the binary is a pulsar and the other is a white dwarf. The planet has a mass twice that of Jupiter, and is estimated to be 12.7 billion years old. \c\cMu Arae c: In August, a planet orbiting Mu Arae with a mass of approximately 14 times that of the Earth was discovered with the European Southern Observatory's HARPS spectrograph. Depending on its composition, it is the first published "hot Neptune" or "super-Earth". \c\c2M1207 b: The first planet found around a brown dwarf. The planet is also the first to be directly imaged (in infrared). According to an early estimate, it has a mass 5 times that of Jupiter; other estimates give slightly lower masses. It was originally estimated to orbit at 55 AU from the brown dwarf. The brown dwarf is only 25 times as massive as Jupiter. The temperature of the gas giant planet is very high (1250 K), mostly due to gravitational contraction. In late 2005, the parameters were revised to orbital radius 41 AU and mass of 3.3 Jupiters, because it was found that the system is closer to Earth than was originally believed. In 2006, a dust disk was found around 2M1207, providing evidence for active planet formation. \c\cTrES-1 and HD 209458b: On March 22, two groups announced the first direct detection of light emitted by exoplanets, achieved with the Spitzer Space Telescope. These studies permitted the direct study of the temperature and structure of the planetary atmospheres. \c\cGliese 876 d: On June 13, a third planet orbiting the red dwarf star Gliese 876 was announced. With a mass estimated at 7.5 times that of Earth, it may be rocky in composition. The planet orbits at 0.021 AU with a period of 1.94 days. \c\cHD 149026 b: This planet was announced on July 1. Its unusually high density indicated that it was a giant planet with a large core, the largest one yet known. The mass of the core was estimated at 70 Earth masses (as of 2008, 80–110), accounting for at least two-thirds of the planet's total mass. \c\cOGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb: This planet, announced on January 25, was detected using the gravitational microlensing method. It orbits a red dwarf star around 21,500 light years from Earth, toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy. As of April 2010, it remains the most distant known exoplanet. Its mass is estimated to be 5.5 times that of Earth. Prior to this discovery, the few known exoplanets with comparably low masses had only been discovered in orbits very close to their parent stars, but this planet is estimated to have a relatively wide separation of 2.6 AU from its parent star. Due to that wide separation and due to the inherent dimness of the star, the planet is probably the coldest exoplanet known. \c\cHD 69830: Has a planetary system with three Neptune-mass planets. It is the first triple planetary system without any Jupiter-like planets discovered around a Sun-like star. All three planets were announced on May 18 by Lovis. All three orbit within 1 AU. The planets b, c and d have masses of 10, 12 and 18 times that of Earth, respectively. The outermost planet, d, appears to be in the habitable zone, shepherding a thick asteroid belt. \c\cHD 209458 b and HD 189733 b: These became the first extrasolar planets to have their atmospheric spectra directly observed. The announcement was made on February 21, by two groups of researchers who had worked independently. One group, led by Jeremy Richardson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, observed the atmosphere of HD 209458 b over a wavelength range from 7.5 to 13.2 micrometres. The results were surprising in several ways. The 10-micrometre spectral peak of water vapor was absent. An unpredicted peak was observed at 9.65 micrometres, which the investigators attributed to clouds of silicate dust. Another peak, at 7.78 micrometres, remained unexplained. The other group, led by Carl Grillmair of NASA's Spitzer Science Center, observed HD 189733 b. They also failed to detect the spectroscopic signature of water vapor. Later in the year, yet another group of researchers using a somewhat different technique succeeded in detecting water vapor in the planet's atmosphere, the first time such a detection had been made. \c\cGliese 581 c: A team of astronomers led by Stephane Udry used the HARPS instrument on the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-meter telescope to discover this exoplanet by means of the radial velocity method. The team calculated that the planet could support liquid water and possibly life. However, subsequent habitability studies indicate that the planet likely suffers from a runaway greenhouse effect similar to Venus, rendering the presence of liquid water impossible. These studies suggest that the third planet in the system, Gliese 581 d, is more likely to be habitable. Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer with the SETI institute, stated that two unsuccessful searches had already been made for radio signals from extraterrestrial intelligence in the Gliese 581 system. \c\cGliese 436 b: This planet was one of the first Neptune-mass planets discovered, in August 2004. In May 2007, a transit was found, revealed as the smallest and least massive transiting planet yet at 22 times that of Earth. Its density is consistent with a large core of an exotic form of solid water called "hot ice", which would exist, despite the planet's high temperatures, because the planet's gravity causes water to be extremely dense. \c\cTrES-4: The largest-diameter and lowest-density exoplanet to date, TrES-4 is 1.7 times Jupiter's diameter but only 0.84 times its mass, giving it a density of just 0.2 grams per cubic centimeter—about the same as balsa wood. It orbits its primary closely and is therefore quite hot, but stellar heating alone does not appear to explain its large size. \c\cOGLE-2006-BLG-109Lb and OGLE-2006-BLG-109Lc: On February 14, the discovery of a planetary system was announced that is the most similar one known to the Jupiter-Saturn pair within the Solar System in terms of mass ratio and orbital parameters. The presence of planets with such parameters has implications for possible life in a solar system as Jupiter and Saturn have a stabilizing effect to the habitable zone by sweeping away large asteroids from the habitable zone. \c\cHD 189733 b: On March 20, follow-up studies to the first spectral analyses of an extrasolar planet were published in the scientific journal Nature, announcing evidence of an organic molecule found on an extrasolar planet for the first time. The analysis showed not only water vapor, but also methane existing in the atmosphere of the giant gas planet. Although conditions on there are too harsh to harbor life, it still is the first time a key molecule for organic life was found on an extrasolar planet. \c\cHD 40307: On June 16, Michel Mayor announced a planetary system with three super-Earths orbiting this K-type star. The planets have masses ranging from 4 to 9 Earth masses and periods ranging from 4 to 20 days. It was suggested this might be the first multi-planet system without any known gas giants. However, a subsequent study of the system's orbital stability found that tidal interactions have had little effect on evolution of the planets\' orbits. That, in turn, suggests that the planets experience relatively low tidal dissipation and hence are of primarily gaseous composition. All three were discovered by the HARPS spectrograph in La Silla, Chile. \c\c1RXS J160929.1−210524: In September, an object was imaged in the infrared at a separation of 330AU from this star. Later, in June 2010, the object was confirmed to be a companion planet to the star rather than a background object aligned by chance. \c\cFomalhaut b: On November 13, NASA and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced the discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting just inside the debris ring of the A-class star Fomalhaut (Alpha Piscis Austrini). This was the first extrasolar planet to be directly imaged by an optical telescope. Its mass is estimated to be three times that of Jupiter. Based on the planet's unexpected brightness at visible wavelengths, the discovery team suspects it is surrounded by its own large disk or ring that may be a satellite system in the process of formation. \c\cHR 8799: Also on November 13, the discovery of three planets orbiting HR 8799 was announced. This was the first direct image of multiple planets. Christian Marois of the National Research Council of Canada's Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics and his team used the Keck and Gemini telescopes in Hawaii. The Gemini images allowed the international team to make the initial discovery of two of the planets with data obtained on October 17, 2007. Then, in July through September 2008, the team confirmed this discovery and found a third planet orbiting even closer to the star with images obtained at the Keck II telescope. A review of older data taken in 2004 with the Keck II telescope revealed that the outer 2 planets were visible on these images. Their masses and separations are approximately 7 MJ at 24 AU, 7 MJ at 38 AU, and 5 MJ at 68 AU. \c\cCOROT-7b: On February 3, the European Space Agency announced the discovery of a planet orbiting the star COROT-7. Although the planet orbits its star at a distance less than 0.02 AU, its diameter is estimated to be around 1.7 times that of Earth, making it the smallest super-Earth yet measured. Due to its extreme closeness to its parent star, it is believed to have a molten surface at a temperature of 1000–1500 °C. It was discovered by the French COROT satellite. \c\cGliese 581 e: On April 21, the European Southern Observatory announced the discovery of a fourth planet orbiting the star Gliese 581. The planet orbits its parent star at a distance of less than 0.03 AU and has a minimum mass estimated at 1.9 times that of Earth. As of January 2010, this is the lightest known extrasolar planet to orbit a main-sequence star. \c\c30 planets: On October 19, it was announced that 30 new planets were discovered, all were detected by the radial velocity method. It is the most planets ever announced in a single day during the exoplanet era[clarification needed]. October 2009 now holds the most planets discovered in a month, breaking the record set in June 2002 and August 2009, during which 17 planets were discovered. \c\c61 Virginis and HD 1461: On December 14, three planets (one is super-Earth and two are Neptune-mass planets) were discovered. Also, a super-Earth planet and two unconfirmed planets around HD 1461 were discovered. These discoveries indicated that low-mass planets that orbit around nearby stars are very common. 61 Virginis is the first star like the Sun to host the super-Earth planets. \c\cGJ 1214 b: On December 16, a super-Earth planet was discovered by transit. The determination of density from mass and radius suggest that this planet may be an ocean planet composed of 75% water and 25% rock. Some of the water on this planet should be in the exotic form of ice VII. This is the first planet discovered by MEarth Project, which is used to look for transits of super-Earth planets crossing the face of M-type stars. \c\c47 Ursae Majoris d: On March 6, a gas giant like Jupiter with the longest known orbital period for any exoplanet was detected via radial velocity. It orbits its parent star at a distance similar to Saturn in the Solar System with its orbital period lasting about 38 Earth years. \c\cCOROT-9b: On March 17, the first known temperate transiting planet was announced. Discovered by the COROT satellite, it has an orbital period of 95 days and a periastron distance of 0.36 AU, by far the largest of any exoplanet whose transit has been observed. The temperature of the planet is estimated at between 250 K and 430 K (between −20 °C and 160 °C). \c\cBeta Pictoris b: On June 10, for the first time astronomers have been able to directly follow the motion of an exoplanet as it moves to the other side of its host star. The planet has the smallest orbit so far of all directly imaged exoplanets, lying as close to its host star as Saturn is to the Sun. \c\cHD 209458 b: On June 23, astronomers announced they have measured a superstorm for the first time in the atmosphere of HD 209458 b. The very high-precision observations done by ESO’s Very Large Telescope and its powerful CRIRES spectrograph of carbon monoxide gas show that it is streaming at enormous speed from the extremely hot day side to the cooler night side of the planet. The observations also allow another exciting “first” — measuring the orbital speed of the exoplanet itself, providing a direct determination of its mass. \c\cHD 10180: On August 24, astronomers using ESO's HARPS instrument announced the discovery of a planetary system with up to seven planets orbiting a Sun-like star with five confirmed Neptune-mass planets and evidence of two other planets, one of which could have the lowest mass of any planet found to date orbiting a main-sequence star, and the other of which may be a long-period Saturnian planet. Additionally, there is evidence that the distances of the planets from their star follow a regular pattern, as seen in the Solar System. \c\cKepler 11: On February 3, astronomers using NASA's Kepler Mission announced the discovery of 6 transiting planets orbiting the star Kepler 11. Masses were confirmed using a new method called Transit Timing Variations. The architecture of the system is unique with 6 low mass, low-density planets all packed in tight orbits around their host star. The 5 inner planets all orbit inside that of Mercury in the Solar System. It is believed that these planets formed out past the snow line and migrated into their current position. \c\c55 Cancri e: On April 27, 2011, the super-earth 55 Cancri e was found to transit its host star using the MOST satellite. This planet has the shortest known orbital period of any extrasolar planet at .73 days. It is also the first time a super-earth has been detected transiting a naked eye star (less than 6th magnitude in V band). The high density calculated suggests that the planet has a "rock-iron composition supplemented by a significant mass of water, gas, or other light elements". \c\cAlpha Centauri Bb: On 16 October 2012, the discovery was announced of an Earth-mass planet in orbit around Alpha Centauri B. The discovery was published online on the 17 of October, in the scientific journal Nature, and the lead author of the paper was Xavier Dumusque, a graduate student at the Centro de Astrofísica da Universidade do Porto (Centre for Astrophysics of the University of Porto). The discovery of a planet in the closest star system to Earth received widespread media attention and was seen as an important landmark in exoplanet research. However, the planet was later shown not to exist. \c\cPH2 b: On 3 January 2013, the discovery of a "Jupiter-size" extrasolar planet that could "potentially be habitable" was announced. The exoplanet was discovered by amateur astronomers from the Planet Hunters project of amateur astronomers using data from the Kepler Mission space observatory and confirmed, with 99.9 percent confidence, by observations at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. PH2 b is the second confirmed planet discovered by PlanetHunters.org (the first being PH1). \c\cKepler-69c (formerly KOI-172.02): On 7 January 2013, the discovery of an unconfirmed (Kepler Object of Interest) candidate exoplanet was announced by astronomers affiliated with the Kepler Mission space observatory. The candidate object, a Super-Earth, has a radius 1.54 times that of Earth. Kepler-69c orbits a sun-like star, named Kepler-69, within the "habitable zone" a zone where liquid water could exist on the surface of the planet. Scientists claim the exoplanet, if confirmed, could be a "prime candidate to host alien life". \c\cOn 18 April 2013, NASA announced the discovery of three new Earth-like exoplanets – Kepler-62e, Kepler-62f, and Kepler-69c (now confirmed) – in the habitable zones of their respective host stars, Kepler-62 and Kepler-69. The new exoplanets, which are considered prime candidates for possessing liquid water and thus potentially life, were identified using the Kepler space observatory. \c\cWASP-76b, an exotic planet was discovered that has a 100% chance of having hot liquid iron; its dayside temperatures reach 2,400 °C (4,350 °F), on the other hand, its nightside is 1,000 °C (1,800 °F) cooler, allowing its metals to condense and rain out. \c\cOn 26 February 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called "verification by multiplicity". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water. \c\cIn November 2014, the Planet Hunters group discovered the exoplanet PH3 c. This exoplanet is 700 parsecs away from Earth, is a low density planet and is four times as massive as Earth. \c\cIn July, 2014, NASA announced the determination of the most precise measurement so far attained for the size of an exoplanet (Kepler-93b); the discovery of an exoplanet (Kepler-421b) that has the longest known year (704 days) of any transiting planet found so far; and, finding very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b) orbiting sun-like stars. \c\cOn 6 January 2015, NASA announced the 1000th confirmed exoplanet discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope. Three of the newly confirmed exoplanets were found to orbit within habitable zones of their host stars: two of the three, Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, are near-Earth-size and likely rocky; the third, Kepler-440b, is a super-Earth. Similar confirmed small exoplanets in habitable zones found earlier by Kepler include: Kepler-62e, Kepler-62f, Kepler-186f, Kepler296e and Kepler-296f. \c\cOn 23 July 2015, NASA announced the release of the Seventh Kepler Candidate Catalog, bringing the total number of confirmed exoplanets to 1030 and the number of exoplanet candidates to 4,696. This announcement also included the first report of Kepler-452b, a near-Earth-size planet orbiting the habitable zone of a G2-type star, as well as eleven other "small habitable zone candidate planets". \c\cOn 30 July 2015, NASA confirmed the discovery of the nearest rocky planet outside the Solar System, larger than Earth, 21 light-years away. HD 219134 b is the closest exoplanet to Earth to be detected transiting in front of its star. The planet has a mass 4.5 times that of Earth, a radius about 1.6 times that of Earth, with a three-day orbit around its star. Combining the size and mass gives it a density of 6 g/cm3, confirming that it is a rocky planet. \c\cIn September 2015, astronomers reported the unusual light fluctuations of KIC 8462852, an F-type main-sequence star in the constellation Cygnus, as detected by the Kepler space telescope, while searching for exoplanets. Various explanations have been presented, including those based on comets, asteroids, as well as, an alien civilization. \c\cOn August 24, 2016, the Pale Red Dot campaign announced the discovery of Proxima b. Orbiting the closest star to the solar system, Proxima Centauri, the 1.3 Earth-mass exoplanet orbits within the star's habitable zone. The planet was discovered by the HARPS and UVES instruments on telescopes at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, after signs of a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri were first found in 2013. \c\cOn 22 February 2017, several scientists working at the California Institute of Technology for NASA, using the Spitzer Space Telescope, announced the discovery of seven potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting TRAPPIST-1, a star about 40 light-years away. Three of these planets are said to be located within the habitable zone of the TRAPPIST-1 solar system and have the potential to harbor liquid water on their surface and possibly sustain life. The discovery sets a new record for the greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside the Solar System. TRAPPIST-1 is a red dwarf, which raises the likelihood of the exoplanets orbiting TRAPPIST-1 being tidally locked with the parent star. \c\cRoss 128 b is a confirmed Earth-sized exoplanet, likely rocky, orbiting within the inner habitable zone of the red dwarf Ross 128. It is the second-closest potentially habitable exoplanet found, at a distance of about 11 light-years; only Proxima Centauri b is closer. The planet is only 35% more massive than Earth, receives only 38% more sunlight, and is expected to be a temperature suitable for liquid water to exist on the surface, if it has an atmosphere. \c\cAnalyses show that K2-155d may fall into the habitable zone and support liquid water. \c\cWASP-104b, a Hot Jupiter exoplanet, has been considered by researchers to be one of the darkest exoplanets ever discovered. \c\cHelium has been detected for the first time in the atmosphere of an exoplanet by scientists observing WASP-107b. \c\cOn 7 June, scientists working at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) for ISRO, using the PRL Advance Radial-velocity Abu-Sky Search (Paras) spectrograph integrated with a telescope at the Mount Abu InfraRed Observatory, announced the discovery of host star EPIC 211945201 or K2-236 and exoplanet EPIC 211945201b or K2-236b. Located at a distance of 600 light-years from Earth, the exoplanet has a mass 27 times heavier than that of Earth and is 6 times its radius. K2-236b has a surface temperature of 600 °C. \c\cGJ 357 d, a planet which is considered to be a "Super-Earth" within the circumstellar habitable zone of its parent star. \c\cLTT 1445Ab, a rocky planet which takes only five days to go once around its star, its surface temperature reaches 320 °F (160 °C). \c\cDS Tucanae Ab, a Neptune-like exoplanet that orbits a G-type star, it takes 8.1 days to complete one orbit of its star. \c\cLHS 1815b, a thick-disk planet outside the Galactic plane, discovered by TESS. \c\cKepler-1649c, an Earth-size exoplanet in the habitable zone. \c\cTOI-700 d, in January 2020, scientists announced the discovery of TOI 700 d, the first Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone detected by TESS. \c\cKOI-456.04, a planet in the habitable zone of Kepler-160. \c\cGJ 3470 c, the first exoplanet candidate fully discovered by amateur astronomers. \c\cWASP-189b, a ultra-Hot Jupiter observed by CHEOPS in September 2020. \c\cOGLE-2016-BLG-1928, found by brief gravitational lensing. An Earth-mass strong candidate rogue planet being more than 8 AU from any star, in our galaxy. \c\cHD 110082 b, a sub-Neptune exoplanet that orbits the star HD 110082.
A series of ongoing protests against the Cuban government and the ruling Communist Party of Cuba began on 11 July 2021, triggered by the shortage of food and medicine and the government's response to the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba. The protests have been described as the largest anti-government demonstrations since the Maleconazo in 1994. As of 14 July, one person has died during a clash between protesters and police, while other estimates include up to five deaths. \c\cIn 2020, the economic situation in Cuba worsened. The Cuban economy contracted by 10.9% in 2020, and by 2% in the first six months of 2021. The economic crises emerged from a combination of factors, including reduced financial support (subsidized fuel) from Cuba's ally Venezuela; the US embargo and US sanctions against Cuba; and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the country's tourism industry and led to a decrease in remittances from Cubans abroad. The situation has also been exacerbated by inefficiencies. The embargo, however, does not currently block the acquisition of food and medicines. Deteriorating economic conditions led to reductions in Cubans\' standard of living, shortages of food and other basic products, a shortage in hard currency, and persistent power outages. \c\cThe government refused to receive COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX initiative or buy foreign ones, opting to develop its own one instead, the Soberana 02. The process was delayed, and vaccine rollout was slow, which angered some Cubans and prompted their calls for more vaccines. At the time the protests had broken out, about 15% of the Cuban population was fully vaccinated. In 2021, COVID-19 cases began to surge in Cuba especially in the province of Matanzas; a situation that was further aggravated by the shortage of medicines and food. The government responded by deploying more doctors to the province. \c\cThe protests were also fuelled by dissatisfaction with Cuba's government, with the Washington Post describing it as a "police state". The government's curbs on Cubans\' civil liberties has prompted resentment. \c\cDue to the evolving crises, a social media campaign using the hashtags #SOSCUBA and #SOSMATANZAS was initiated to collect money, medical materials, food and other supplies to be sent to Cuba. Various international figures such as Don Omar, Ricardo Montaner, Alejandro Sanz, Nicky Jam, J Balvin, Daddy Yankee, Becky G, and Mia Khalifa joined the request. The Cuban government recognized the crisis describing it as "very complex" but rejected a proposed humanitarian corridor and described the campaign as an attempt to misrepresent the situation. Cuba set up a bank account to receive aid and said that it was open to receive donations, though the designated account is in a Cuban bank under United States sanctions. According to Miami Herald, historically, the government has refused or seized aid coming from Cuban exiles. \c\cOn 11 July 2021, at least two demonstrations emerged in San Antonio de los Baños, near Havana, and Palma Soriano, in the province of Santiago de Cuba, singing the song "Patria y Vida" (Homeland and Life). The song's name is an inversion of the Cuban Revolution motto "Patria o Muerte" (Homeland or Death). Videos of protesters singing slogans of "Freedom", "Down with communism", and "We are not afraid" were broadcast on social networks in addition to protesters demanding vaccines. Opposition media outlets such as Martí Noticias have published social media videos of protests on the Malecón in Havana, Santiago, Santa Clara, Ciego de Ávila, Camagüey, Bayamo, Guantánamo, San José de las Lajas, Holguín, Cárdenas. According to Orlando Gutiérrez, an exiled dissident of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, there were protests in more than fifteen cities and towns in Cuba. Gutiérrez asked the United States government to lead an international intervention to prevent protesters from being "victims of a bloodbath". The San Isidro Movement called on the protesters to march to Malecón in Havana. \c\cCuban president and Communist Party first secretary Díaz-Canel said that the United States\' embargo against Cuba and economic sanctions were responsible for the conditions that led to the unrest. He urged loyal Cubans to take to the streets in counter-protest to respond to the demonstrations, saying "The order to fight is given, the revolutionaries to the streets" in a special television broadcast. The Cuban government called the protests "counterrevolutionary". Younger Cubans comprised the majority of protesters, while some members of older generations responded to demonstrations, assisting Cuban authorities. \c\cFollowing First Secretary Díaz-Canel's statements, about 300 government supporters arrived at El Capitolio; Miami Herald reported that one Associated Press (AP) cameraman was assaulted by these counter-protesters while a separate AP photographer was injured by police. AP photographer Ramon Espinosa was detained by authorities as well. San Antonio residents reported that the police repressed protesters and detained certain participants. In videos circulated on social media, people were seen throwing stones at police while reports of authorities beating demonstrators were heard. By the evening, protests had dissipated. \c\cCuban journalist Yoani Sánchez reported that after the protests on 11 July some were injured and there were hundreds of detentions. \c\cOn 12 July, more protests were reported in Cuba. A journalist from the Spanish newspaper ABC was arrested. Internet watchdog NetBlocks reported that social media platforms in Cuba were censored beginning on 12 July 2021 though virtual private networks were able to bypass government blockages and with a police presence in the streets of Havana. Dozens of women gathered in front of police stations to inquire about the whereabouts of their husbands, children and relatives arrested or disappeared during the events of the previous day. Faced with the accusations of missing persons, Díaz-Canel stated: "They have already come up with the fact that in Cuba we repress, we murder Where are the Cuban murders? Where is the Cuban repression? Where are the disappeared in Cuba?"\c\cA meeting of the top leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba including former First Secretary Raúl Castro was held where the issue of the protests was addressed, releasing a statement that "the provocations orchestrated by counterrevolutionary elements, organized and financed from the United States with destabilizing purposes, were analyzed". \c\cDíaz-Canel accused the United States of using a policy of "economic asphyxiation [to] cause social unrest" in Cuba. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla labeled the protesters as "vandals". \c\cAuthorities blocked access to social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook and Instagram. \c\cThe non-governmental organization Cuba Decide estimated a toll of five deaths during the protests. \c\cDuring a live interview with the Spanish television program Todo es mentira, Cuban YouTuber and activist Dina Stars was detained by Cuban security officers. \c\cIn Miami, Florida, US, protesters temporarily blocked the Palmetto Expressway in both directions in order to show support for the Cuban protesters. Some newspapers reported that the protesters were in violation of a Florida anti-riot law; however, none of the protesters have been charged and Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis said he did not think the law applied. \c\cThe webpage CiberCuba released a video where a group of "Black Berets", the Cuban police, break into the house of a demonstrator and fire at him immediately, in front of his wife and children. \c\cAccording to the lawyers\' group Cubalex, over 200 people have been detained and many remain in detention as of 15 July. \c\cDeputy Minister of the Interior of Cuba Jesús Manuel Burón Tabit, resigned after questioning decision-making within the ministry and the Security Council, as well as what he called the excessive use of police force to repress the demonstrations. \c\cIn order to deal with the shortages, the Cuban Chamber of Commerce has lifted customs restrictions that limited imports of hygiene products, medicine and food until December 31, 2021, which one of the protesters demanded the government should do. In addition, state-owned enterprises can determine salaries beyond regulations, as well as the improvement of small private businesses. The government also announced it would be improving on the electricity system, and internet was also restored. \c\cIn a national address on Wednesday evening, Miguel Diaz-Canal called on Cubans not to "act with hate", but also admitted some failures by the state, explaining that "We have to gain experience from the disturbances. We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition". \c\cCubans residing in Chile marched to the Cuban consulate in Santiago in support of the protests. Protests in Miami urging United States to provide aid for the protests in Cuba have taken place. Mayor of Miami Francis X. Suarez, a Cuban American, said it was time for a US-led international intervention in Cuba, saying "We are asking the federal government to do everything possible and not waste this moment" and that "this moment can mean freedom to so many in the hemisphere, from Nicaraguans to those who suffer under the Maduro regime in Venezuela". Demonstrations also took place at the Puerta del Sol in Madrid, Spain. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, a protest took place in front of the Cuban embassy in Buenos Aires with protesters holding placards with the phrases "Patria y vida" and others with the slogan "S.O.S. Cuba". In São Paulo, Brazil, political parties and social movements staged a protest in favor of the Cuban government and "in defense of sovereignty" in front of the Consulate General of Cuba. \c\c President Alberto Fernández said that he did not know what was happening in Cuba and blamed the humanitarian crisis on the United States embargo against Cuba. \c\c President Luis Arce expressed his support for the Cuban people who "fight against destabilizing actions". Former President Evo Morales accused the United States of launching a new Operation Condor. \c\c President Jair Bolsonaro commented that it was a sad day for Cuba because people requested freedom and received shots, attacks, and prison instead. He said that there are people in Brazil who support Cuba, Venezuela and "those kinds of people". \c\c The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement condemning the repression in order "to silence protesters who peacefully claim greater freedom, better health system and better quality of life". It also added that "freedom of expression and peaceful assembly must be guaranteed."\c\c China's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian called for the lifting of the US embargo on Cuba which he said was responsible for shortage of medicine and energy in the country. \c\c President Andrés Manuel López Obrador urged foreign governments not to intervene in the internal affairs of Cuba and stated that it is the Cubans who solve their problems. In addition to this, he also said that if they want to help, they should help end the blockade. \c\c President Daniel Ortega sent his expressions of support to Miguel Díaz-Canel, condemning the "permanent blockade, destabilization and aggression" against Cuba. \c\c Interim President Francisco Sagasti supported the protesters to "express freely and peacefully" and invoked the Cuban authorities to "consider their requirements in a democratic spirit". \c\c Maria Zakharova, Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, stated that they "consider it unacceptable for there to be outside interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state or any destructive actions that would encourage the destabilization of the situation on the island."\c\c Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a statement was issued recognizing the right of Cubans "to demonstrate freely and peacefully" and that "forms of aid that could alleviate the situation" will be studied. In Spain, the Cuban protests provoked debate and political controversy, as Spanish right-wing politicians demanded a more serious condemnation of the Cuban rgovernment from the Spanish authorities, that the Spanish government qualify it as a dictatorship and that Spain make the European Union (EU) adopt an active opposition policy towards it. When asked if Cuba was a dictatorship, left-wing President of Spain Pedro Sánchez did not answer the question, limiting himself to say "It is evident that Cuba is not a democracy". These acts from right-wing politicians have received criticism, being accused of using the protests as an opposition tactic against the current left-wing government. The lack of such harsh condemnation against events in other countries such as Colombia by the political right was also criticized. \c\c President Joe Biden said that he supports the Cuban people and their "clarion call for freedom and relief". Julie J. Chung, Acting Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs for the United States Department of State, stated: "We are deeply concerned by \'calls to combat\' in Cuba. We stand by the Cuban people’s right for peaceful assembly. We call for calm and condemn any violence."\c\c President Luis Lacalle Pou expressed his support for the opposition protesters, saying they had "commendable courage."\c\c President Nicolás Maduro expressed "all the support to the Cuban revolutionary government" on a phone call to president Miguel Díaz-Canel. \c\c EU foreign relations chief Josep Borrell said that "the Cuban people have a right to express their opinion" and that he would "personally call on the government there to allow peaceful demonstrations and to listen to the voice of discontent from demonstrators". \c\c Organization of American States Secretary General Luis Almagro condemned the "Cuban dictatorial regime for calling on civilians to repress and confronting those who exercise their rights to protest". \c\cÉrika Guevara-Rosas, director of Amnesty International for the Americas, said that "Amnesty International received with alarm reports of internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force – including police firing on demonstrators – and reports that there is a long list of missing persons." Amnesty called on the government of Díaz-Canel to respect the right of peaceful assembly. \c\cRepublican Senator from Florida Marco Rubio demanded President Joe Biden to call on Cuba's military to support protesters while Democratic Senator from New Jersey Bob Menendez said the United States should "stand in solidarity with the brave people of Cuba that are risking their lives today for change in their country and a future of Patria y Vida". Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, argued that the U.S. embargo against Cuba hadn\'t worked and instead had empowered the Cuban regime. \c\cMauricio Macri, former president of Argentina, distanced himself from Alberto Fernández and gave his full support to the demonstrators: "I want to support the Cuban people in the streets requesting the end of the dictatorship and an improvement of their life conditions. Let them know that all the people in the continent and the world who share the value of liberty are with them". Similar messages were delivered by Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, mayor of Buenos Aires, and María Eugenia Vidal, former governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Macri also signed a letter of IDEA (Democratic Initiative of Spain and the Americas), alongside other former presidents. \c\cOpposite to Argentina's Macri, former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said during a candidacy for president event next year in Brazil, that if Cuba did not have a blockade by the US, "[Cuba] could be Holland", and said that the blockade was a form of "killing human beings without being at war".
The 2021 Taliban offensive is an ongoing military offensive by the Taliban against the government of Afghanistan and its allies that began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most US troops from Afghanistan. Al Jazeera reports that, as of 15 July 2021, over a third of Afghanistan’s 421 districts were controlled by Taliban. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War of 1996–2001, resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north in 2021 may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cIn the month of May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Spain, Sweden, Slovenia and Portugal had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn the month of June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan’s main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway of Afghanistan’s capital city Kabul. In terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. \c\cOn 19 June, Afghan Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the United States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cAs of 8 July, 161 Afghan National Security Forces and 24 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,892 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. On 4 July, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 11 July, Australian Defense Minister announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. \c\cAs of 12 July, the Taliban captured 55 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second-largest city of Afghanistan, Kandahar. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban.

In response, the Uzbek government erected a tent city for migrants in the city of Termez.
The 2021 European floods began in Western and Central Europe on 14 July 2021. \c\cFloods began in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland on July 14, 2021. They are primarily in Wallonia (Liège Province) and in the Eifel region in Western Germany. They were caused by heavy rains. At least 23 people are confirmed to have been killed, twenty-one of whom died in Germany. and two more in Belgium.
The 2021 Taliban offensive is an ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies that began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As of 15 July 2021, over a third of Afghanistan's 421 districts were controlled by Taliban. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north in 2021 may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan’s main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway of Afghanistan's capital city Kabul. In terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the Britain, Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander.  Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July 2021, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force. \c\cAs of 15 July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second-largest city of Afghanistan, Kandahar. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban.

Since 12 July 2021, several European countries have been affected by catastrophic floods, causing deaths and widespread damage. The floods have affected several river basins, first in the United Kingdom and later across northern and central Europe including Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy. At least 191 people have died in the floods, including 159 in Germany, 31 in Belgium and 1 in Italy. In addition to the confirmed fatalities, damage to infrastructure was especially severe in Germany. During the aftermath of the floods, scientists, activists and reporters all highlighted the connection to more extreme weather, especially extreme rain events, caused by climate change. \c\cOn 12–15 July 2021, heavy rain fell across the United Kingdom, western Germany, and neighbouring Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. A storm complex moved east from France into Germany and stalled over the region for two days. Precipitation was intense in the East of Belgium, with 271.5 mm of rain over 48 hours in Jalhay and 217 mm over 48 hours in Spa. Heavy rainfall was also seen in the North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany where accumulations averaged 100 to 150 mm (3.9 to 5.9 in) in 24 hours, equivalent to more than a month's worth of rain. In Reifferscheid, 207 mm (8.1 in) fell within a nine-hour period while Cologne observed 154 mm (6.1 in) in 24 hours. Some of the affected regions have not seen rainfall of this magnitude in the last 1,000 years. Floods began in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland on 14 July 2021 after record rainfall in western Europe, causing multiple rivers to burst their banks. \c\cOn 17 July, a flash flood swept through Hallein, a town close to the German border. Rescue workers in the states of Salzburg and Tyrol were placed on high alert for flooding, and Chancellor Sebastian Kurz tweeted "heavy rains and storms are unfortunately causing severe damage in several places in Austria."\c\cOn 15 July, all residents of the city of Liège, the third-largest urban area in Belgium with a population of approximately 200,000, were urged to evacuate amidst fears that the River Meuse could burst its banks and that a dam bridge could collapse. No vehicles were allowed into the city centre of Liège; traffic was only allowed to leave as part of the evacuation. By 16 July, several smaller municipalities in Limburg Province were also given the order to evacuate. In addition, due to the heavy flooding and because tens of home fuel tanks had broken loose and started leaking into rivers, a number of municipalities in Liège and Namur provinces were left without potable tap water. Around 41,000 households were left without electricity in Wallonia. Foundations of buildings near rivers became eroded and buildings collapsed. In the town of Pepinster on the banks of the river Vesder, at least 20 houses collapsed and 23 of the 31 casualties in Belgium as of 18th July were found. Also the town of Verviers was badly affected. \c\cPrecipitation was most intense in the East of Belgium, with 271.5 mm of rain over 48 hours in the municipality of Jalhay, in the province of Liège -- an absolute record for Belgium and almost three times the average rainfall over one month in this location for July. In the town of Spa, also in Liège, 217 mm of rain fell over 48 hours. Large parts of the province of Luxembourg saw between 150 mm and 200 mm over 48 hours. In Flanders, the maximum rainfall was 77 mm over 48 hours at Ransberg. In Dilsen-Stokkem, the river Maas (Meuse) reached a flux of 3300 m3/s on 16th July, equalling the maximum flow that the local dykes are designed for. \c\cAn empty passenger train derailed at Grupont when the trackbed was washed out by floodwater, with debris strewn across the track. The Charleroi–Namur–Liège line, and all railway lines in Belgium south west of that line, were closed. The overall damage to the rail network was estimated to take several weeks to repair. Early estimates also pointed to severe damage to the agricultural sector of the country, including long-term effects like soil erosion. During the flooding itself, farms and livestock had to be evacuated and many fields were damaged and crops destroyed by inundation. The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps suffered damage to access roads and its digital safety infrastructure. The circuit is due to hold the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix on 29 August. \c\cBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo declared 20 July a national day of mourning. \c\cThe Grand-Est region has been affected by floods, but the Hauts-de-France and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté regions have also been affected by local floods. Communities such as Bar-le-Duc and Arbois were flooded and residents were invited to stay at home. Between the Saône-et-Loire department and the Jura department, the Seille river and the Brenne river have reached the stage of fifty-year flood. \c\cAccording to Météo-France, between Monday 12 July, 8:00 and Friday 16 July, 12:00, it fell 199mm of rain in Châtel-de-Joux (Jura), 160mm in Plainfaing (Vosges), 159mm in le Fied (Jura) and 158mm in Villiers-la-Chèvre (Meurthe-et-Moselle). \c\cNo deaths were reported at this time. \c\cWith at least 157 deaths, the floods are the deadliest natural disaster in Germany since the North Sea flood of 1962. As of 16 July 2021[update], at least 1,300 people were still missing, but mostly due to mobile networks being down in some regions which made it difficult to call people. It was considered unlikely that the number of deaths would rise that high. Some 15,000 police, soldiers and emergency service workers have been deployed in Germany to help with the search and rescue. \c\cIn Germany, at least 110 people died in Rhineland-Palatinate (all of whom in the district of Ahrweiler), 45 in North Rhine-Westphalia, one in Baden-Württemberg and one in Bavaria. Four firefighters are among the dead. Westnetz, Germany's biggest power distribution grid, stated on 15 July that 200,000 properties in the North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate regions were without power, and that it would be impossible to repair substations until roads were cleared. On 16 July, around 102,000 people were still without power. The Deutscher Wetterdienst reported that the quantity of rain in some areas of Germany was the highest in over 100 years, possibly higher than any seen in the last 1,000 years. They reported that some areas had received a month's average rainfall in one day. \c\cSome of the worst damage from the flood was in the district of Ahrweiler, Rhineland-Palatinate, where the river Ahr rose, destroying many buildings and causing at least 110 deaths. The topography of Ahr valley in western Germany, with some sections resembling gorges, may have exacerbated the effects of the heavy rainfall. On 14 July, the city of Hagen declared a state of emergency, after the Volme river started overflowing its banks. The village of Kordel in Trier-Saarburg, which has around 2,000 residents, has been completely cut off. \c\cOn 15 July, Thalys train services to Germany were suspended, and Deutsche Bahn stated that many rail services in North Rhine-Westphalia were also cancelled. Deutsche Bahn reported that over 600 kilometres (370 mi) of track was affected in North Rhine-Westphalia. The Cologne–Wuppertal–Hagen–Dortmund and Cologne–Bonn Hauptbahnhof–Koblenz lines were closed. The Cologne–Bonn Beuel–Koblenz line remained open, but trains were subject to delay and cancellation. Customers were asked to avoid travel within and to North Rhine-Westphalia by train. The train connection from Dresden to Prague was also suspended after mudslides buried the tracks. \c\cIn Blessem [de], a Stadtteil of Erftstadt, floodwaters of the Erft river inundated a quarry on 16 July, leading to a major landslide with several people possibly dead. Several buildings collapsed including parts of Burg Blessem [de]. Around 40 meters of the nearby Bundesautobahn 1 broke away and fell into the Erft, but no cars were on the highway since it was closed. Experts voiced concerns on 15 July that the Steinbachtal Dam was unstable and could burst, and 4,500 people were preemptively evacuated from parts of Euskirchen, and later several thousand more from parts of Rheinbach and Swisttal. Drones were deployed to inspect the dam; while no cracks were found, local politicians said the situation as of 16 July[update] remained "critical". Several other dams in North Rhine-Westphalia, such as the Rur Dam, were also overflowing, but there were no concerns about their structural integrity. Regardless, on 16 July a dam of the Rur burst near Wassenberg, prompting the evacuation of Ophoven [de]. Around 360 inmates had to be evacuated from a prison near Euskirchen due to a failing supply of water and electricity. \c\cStrong rainfall also led to flooding in the states of Baden-Württemberg and Saxony. Near Heilbronn, a man fell into the river Jagst and was found dead later. As of 15 July, one person in Saxony remains missing. \c\cFurther strong rainfall on 17 July caused flooding in Saxony and Bavaria, where at least one person died. \c\cThe storms also reached Northeastern Italy and caused damage to agricultural crops. In Trentino-Alto Adige, a fallen tree damaged a cable car and several roads were interrupted, and in Veneto one person died. \c\cIn Luxembourg, 2,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Echternach and Rosport.[failed verification] Many homes in Mersch, Beringen and Rollingen lost electricity supply. The camping ground in Rosport had to be evacuated as a matter of urgency early on Thursday morning. Six people were brought to an emergency shelter in Osweiler cultural centre. Rosport sports centre was also used as emergency accommodation for people made to leave their homes. Mayor Romain Osweiler of Rosport explained the two buildings had been selected because they were accessible to people across the municipality. \c\cIn the Netherlands, the River Maas in Limburg reached its highest summertime level in over 100 years, according to authorities, and was expected as of 15 July[update] to surpass the winter records set in 1993 and 1995. On 14 July, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute gave a code red highest warning for Limburg. It was lowered to a yellow warning at around 03:50 local time on 15 July. Much of the rest of the Netherlands had a yellow warning for rain on 15 July. Over 400 houses in Limburg lost power according to electricity company Enexis. As of 16 July 2021[update], mass evacuations started in Limburg and 300 military personnel were deployed. \c\cOn 16 July, a dyke on the Juliana Canal broke, leading to the evacuation of several villages in Limburg. The Dutch government declared the flooding to be an official disaster. More than 10,000 people were evacuated in Venlo and the neighbouring communities Belfeld, Steyl and Arcen on the same evening. The main hospital in Venlo was also evacuated as a precaution against flooding from the Maas. Rainfall was in excess of 100 millimetres (3.9 in) in a day and 200 millimetres (7.9 in) over three days, said to be a once-in-a-millennium event. \c\cOn 15 July, Switzerland's weather service warned that flooding in the country would worsen over the next few days, potentially equalling the levels of the 2005 "flood of the century" and that there was a particularly high risk of flooding on Lake Biel, Lake Thun and Lake Lucerne, as well as a risk of landslides. That day, the water level in Lake Lucerne reached the highest warning level. \c\cThe cut-off low that caused the severe flooding across western Europe first moved over the United Kingdom on 12 July, resulting in more than the average monthly rainfall total to be recorded in a 24-hour period across parts of the country. Particularly severe flash flooding was reported in the London area, where 47.8 mm (1.88 in) of rainfall was recorded on 12 July at Kew, marking the third-wettest day on record for that weather station and the wettest since 6 July 1983. Both Putney in London and Chipstead in Surrey recorded more than 31 mm (1.2 in) of rainfall in a one-hour period, while other areas of London recorded over 76.2 mm (3.00 in) of rain in 90 minutes. The London Fire Brigade received more than 1,000 calls relating to flooding incidents, as houses were evacuated and cars were submerged by quickly rising floodwaters. \c\cHeavy rainfall caused sewer systems to overflow, unable to handle the sudden intensity of the rainfall, resulting in streets and buildings being flooded by raw sewage. Thames Water received more than 2,500 calls relating to overflowing sewage, stating that the rainfall had surpassed the design capability of their sewage system; the heaviest rainfall occurred close to high tide, resulting in sewers that empty into the River Thames being unable to do so. In Notting Hill, floodwaters rose by 1.5 ft (0.46 m) in less than five minutes. \c\cSloane Square tube station was closed after floodwater from street level surged down stairways into the underground station; Chalk Farm, Hampstead and Wimbledon stations were also closed due to flooding. There was also a reduced level of service at Euston railway station, the London terminus of the West Coast Main Line and across the London Overground and Thameslink networks. \c\cOvernight into 13 July, more than 120 residents of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea were placed into emergency accommodation due to severe flooding in the borough. Elsewhere in England, flooding was reported in the city of Southampton, blocking roads and railway lines. By 14 July, the low pressure system responsible for the United Kingdom floods had moved over mainland Europe.[citation needed]\c\cGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was "shocked by the catastrophe that so many people in the flood areas have to endure" and that her "sympathy goes out to the families of the dead and missing." On 16 July, the German Ministry of Defence declared a state of emergency in the parts of the country that were most affected. \c\cMalu Dreyer, the minister-president of the Rhineland-Palatinate state, told the regional parliament: "There are people dead, there are people missing, there are many who are still in danger. We have never seen such a disaster. It's really devastating." On 15 July, the Belgian royal couple King Philippe and Queen Mathilde traveled to Chaudfontaine, which had been particularly badly hit by the flooding. \c\cThe President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, the EU Council President Charles Michel and the European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič all quickly provided statements of condolence for the victims and that the European Union was ready to help. After a Belgian request, the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism was activated on 14 July, and a helicopter and a flood rescue team was sent from France to Belgium immediately after this. The EU also provided satellite mapping of affected areas. \c\cBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said the UK was ready to provide assistance while Italy and Austria offered to send flood rescue teams to affected areas in Belgium. Pope Francis sent condolences, and was praying for those injured and missing, as well as those who had lost their livelihoods. \c\cThe Italian firefighters sent to Belgium to rescue the victims of the flood that hit Central Europe rescued at least 40 people in Tilff, an area south of Liège. Firefighters evacuated people who were stranded in their homes and in a nursing home. \c\cThe floods followed unprecedented heat waves in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Europe, prompting scientists to evaluate a possible connection to climate change. Prior to the floods, scientists had warned that the extreme weather events would become more common as a consequence of climate change. Examples of such extreme events would include heavy rainfalls; hypothetically, an increase in the atmosphere's temperature would allow it to absorb more water vapor, resulting in more precipitation. Climate change might also have resulted in the jet stream becoming more erratic, which could lead to more frequent extreme weather phenomena. Further research and analysis are needed to understand the extent of climate change's role in the floods. \c\cMichael E. Mann from Penn State University studied the jet stream and concluded that a phenomenon dubbed "wave resonance" was "locking weather systems in place", but it was too early to tell whether the flooding in Europe was a result of that. Hayley Fowler of Newcastle University and Kai Kornhuber of Columbia University also pointed to a slowing in the jet stream as a possible explanation, and Carl-Friedrich Schleussner of Humboldt-Universität Berlin said the question wasn\'t whether climate change had contributed to the event, but rather "how much". Dieter Gerten, a researcher from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, characterized the magnitude of the floods and other extreme weather events as exceeding predictions from current climate change models, noting that the abrupt increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather may indicate that a tipping point has been crossed. Stefan Rahmstorf of the University of Potsdam warned that further losses of arctic ice would likely result in a weaker jet stream and more extreme weather, saying "we should not play with this sensitive climate system". Antonio Navarra, climatologist at the University of Bologna and president of the Euro-Mediterranean Center foundation on Climate Change said that there is a clear correlation between the increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and the frequency and intensity of floods, heat waves and drought periods. \c\cIn the aftermath of the flooding, a spokesman of the World Meteorological Organization called for more action against climate change.
General elections were held in Peru on 11 April 2021. The presidential election, which determined the president and the vice presidents, required a run-off between the two top finishers on 6 June 2021. The congressional elections determined the composition of the Congress of Peru, with all 130 seats contested. \c\cEighteen candidates participated in the presidential election, the highest number of candidates since the 2006 Peruvian general election. Pedro Castillo, a member of the left-wing Free Peru party, received the most votes in the first round. He faced Keiko Fujimori, the leader of the right-wing Popular Force who had previously lost the run-offs of the 2011 and the 2016 elections. The official count of the second round by the National Office of Electoral Processes indicated that Castillo won 50.13% of valid votes, a lead of 44,263 over Fujimori, but the declaration of an official outcome certifying the result by the National Jury of Elections was delayed following accusations of electoral fraud by opposition politicians. Castillo was named president-elect by the National Jury of Elections on 19 July and is due to be inaugurated on 28 July. \c\cThe President is elected using the two-round system. The first round voting was held on 11 April and allows eligible voters to vote for any viable presidential candidate. The top two candidates who receive a plurality of the vote proceed to the run-off election, which took place on 6 June. The winner of the run-off election and the presidential election is the candidate who receives a plurality of the popular vote. However, if in the first round the candidate who is in the first place already gets more than 50% of the popular vote, that candidate will automatically win the election and a run-off election will no longer be needed. \c\cThe 130 members of Congress are elected in 27 multi-member constituencies using open list proportional representation. To enter Congress, parties must either cross the 5% electoral threshold at the national level, or win at least seven seats in one constituency. Seats are allocated using the D\'Hondt method. \c\cPeru has 5 places in the Andean Parliament and are elected using a common constituency by open-list. \c\cPresident Martín Vizcarra initially presented legislation that would set the conditions for a snap election in 2020. If successful, Vizcarra would not be eligible for re-election. The 2020 proposed Peruvian general election would be held on 11 April 2020, to elect a new President of the Republic of Peru, along with 130 congressmen of the Congress of Peru. It was eventually decided to be held on 26 January 2020. Opposition lawmakers condemned Vizcarra's proposal, defending the practice of five-year terms. This constitutional reform was rejected. \c\cThe 2021 Peruvian general election were held on 11 April 2021, to elect the president of the Republic of Peru, two vice presidents of the same party, 130 congressmen of the Congress of Peru and 5 Andean parliamentarians for a five-year term from 2021 to 2026. \c\cOn 11 April 130 congressmen were elected in 27 electoral districts, corresponding to the 24 departments, the Province of Lima, the Constitutional Province of Callao and residents living abroad. \c\cThe elected congressmen will be sworn in and assume office no later than 27 July 2021; the constitutional president of the Republic and his elected vice presidents will do so on 28 July 2021. \c\cGeorge Forsyth is a former football player who played as goalkeeper throughout his sports career. The son of diplomat Harold Forsyth, he entered politics as councilman of La Victoria District in 2010, and as the district's mayor from 2019 until his resignation in October 2020 to run for the presidency. Previously not-affiliated to party politics, he reached an agreement with National Restoration for his presidential run. Upon his registration, the party filed a name-change to be reorganized into National Victory for the general election. During his campaign, he was accused of having offered a position to one of his friends in La Victoria District with an excessive remunerations; the Public Ministry opened an investigation of the situation. \c\cPedro Castillo is Free Peru's nominee and schoolteacher from Cajamarca. He is a former Ronda Campesina that defended rural areas from the Shining Path in the 1980s, and a politician with the centre-left party Possible Peru from 2002 to 2017. Castillo gained attention in 2017, as he led multiple teacher strikes in five regions against Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's administration. Controversy arose after he participated in a campaign of several virtual meeting with MOVADEF members. Castillo has called for the renegotiation of government contracts with large businesses and to rewrite the constitution to protect Peruvians from foreign control. \c\cKeiko Fujimori is the leader of the conservative and far-right Popular Force. The daughter of former president Alberto Fujimori, she still remains a polarizing figure in Peruvian politics since her last presidential run in 2016, but with lower support due to her parliamentary caucus's obstructionist role during the presidencies of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Martín Vizcarra. She continues to be viewed unfavorably by a number of people who oppose Fujimori for human rights abuses and corrupt practices, mostly from the left-wing spectrum, and who fear that her victory would mark a return of Fujimorismo. In addition, she has been involved in the Odebrecht scandal, for which she has served in pretrial detention since 2018 with conditional release in 2020. Among her first campaign appearances, she has vowed to pardon her father if winning the presidency in her third run. \c\cYonhy Lescano is Popular Action's (AP) nominee. Serving in the Peruvian Congress from 2001 to 2019 representing the constituency of Puno then, Lima, he attained the nomination under a left-wing platform in a competitive primary against the more conservative Alfredo Barnechea.[failed verification] His support is based in the highlands, more punctually in Puno and surrounding rural areas. He opposed several times to the decisions of his party, as when Congress was dissolved in 2019, he supported Martín Vizcarra's measure and did not attend to the inauguration of Vice President Mercedes Araoz. His party was politically affected after Vizcarra's impeachment and the sudden rise to power of party member Manuel Merino, who held the position only for five days and promptly resigning after the a series of protests. \c\cVerónika Mendoza is Together for Peru's (JPP) nominee and leader of the democratic socialist New Peru movement. Since she could not register her own party on time for the election, she sealed a political accord with JPP for her presidential run. Her left-wing platform has remained controversial since her first presidential stint in 2016, in which she placed third and was key in Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's run-off victory by endorsing him to prevent Keiko Fujimori to win. She previously served in the Peruvian Congress from 2011 to 2016, representing the constituency of Cuzco. \c\cRafael López Aliaga is the leader of Popular Renewal. A businessman with no relevant political experience, he gained political traction due to his ultraconservative rhetoric, adding to his self-proclamation as "the Peruvian Bolsonaro" due to his religious views and far-right policies similar to the Brazilian president. His campaign runs under a fully right wing platform opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. His collaboration with Fujimorists and the Popular Force party of Keiko Fujimori has also been documented. During the campaign his businesses were accused of having a large debt with the SUNAT and of not paying personal debts to the state. \c\cHernando de Soto is Go on Country's nominee. A free-market economist specialized in informal economy and on the importance of business and property rights, he was a main advisor for President Alberto Fujimori, assisting him with establishing macroeconomic stability for Peru in the aftermath of the Lost Decade. In addition, he has served as an economic advisor to world-leaders since the foundation of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), an economic development think-tank based in Lima. In the public sector, he briefly served as a member of the board of directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, in 1979. In previous elections, he supported Keiko Fujimori's candidacies, serving as one of her advisors. His party has been described as a mere electoral vehicle by analysts due to his technical profile. \c\cJulio Guzmán is the founder and leader of the Purple Party. A former public administrator, he first ran for the presidency in 2016 for All for Peru, but was disqualified due to irregularities in the nomination process. His party is currently in government with Francisco Sagasti as President of Peru following the removal of Martín Vizcarra and resignation of Manuel Merino, which has affected negatively his campaign due to the government's management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. In addition, a scandal involving him escaping from a fire in an apartment during a lunch with a supposed mistress revealed in early 2020 further damaged his public image. \c\cDaniel Urresti is a former army general who first attained popularity as Interior Minister in the presidency of Ollanta Humala. Elected to the Peruvian Congress with the highest-vote count in 2020 with Podemos Perú, he attained the party's presidential nomination as the only candidate. He previously ran for the presidency for Peruvian Nationalist Party in 2016, although the party withdrew his ticket from the race, and placed second for mayor of Lima at the 2018 municipal election with Podemos Perú. He is currently under investigation for the murder of a journalist during his years in the Peruvian Army, which has proved negative to his campaign, in addition to his wry media exposure from years prior to Congress. \c\cOllanta Humala is the leader of the Peruvian Nationalist Party and the only former President of Peru running for a second non-consecutive term. A former army lieutenant colonel, he remained unpopular throughout his presidency due to the few advances his government made, despite its economic stability, in addition to serving a short pre-trial detention from 2017 to 2018 for allegedly receiving bribes from Odebrecht, for which he continues to be under investigation alongside his wife, Nadine Heredia. \c\cDaniel Salaverry is We Are Peru's nominee. An architect from La Libertad, he started a career in politics for mayor of Trujillo with the Peruvian Aprista Party in 2010, and Popular Force in 2014. With the latter, he was elected to the Peruvian Congress in 2016. As a member of the majority caucus, he was elected President of Congress in 2018, but quit the caucus as he supposedly received pressure from the Fujimorist leadership to undermine Martín Vizcarra's presidency. As part of his campaign, Vizcarra remains his main political asset for his presidential run due to the former president's congressional candidacy for the constituency of Lima. As of 2021 he had an open investigation in the Public Ministry after being accused of falsifying his reports during his tenure as congressman. \c\cCésar Acuña is the founder and leader of Alliance for Progress. An entrepreneur in the field of education, he entered politics in 2000 when elected to the Peruvian Congress, in which he served until 2006. Subsequently, he served as mayor of Trujillo from 2007 to 2014, and as governor of La Libertad in 2015. He initially ran for the presidency in the 2016, but was disqualified for alleged vote buying in a campaign trail. In addition, his popularity has diminished due to his party's recent voting records in Congress, thus contradicting his campaign rhetoric, although at first leading the congressional polling after impressively attaining the second largest number of seats at the 2020 parliamentary election. \c\cAlberto Beingolea is the leader of the centre-right Christian People's Party. He previously served in the Peruvian Congress from 2011 to 2016. Prior to entering politics, he had a successful career as a sports journalist. Most recently, he ran for mayor of Lima in the 2018 municipal election, in which he placed fourth. \c\cMarco Arana is the leader of the Broad Front, a left-wing informal coalition of parties and unions. A former bishop from Cajamarca, he ran unsuccessfully for the vice presidency in 2016 with Verónika Mendoza as the party's presidential nominee. He served in the Peruvian Congress from 2016 to 2019.[citation needed]\c\cRafael Santos is Peru Secure Homeland's nominee. A businessman in the agrarian exportation area, he entered politics when he successfully ran for mayor of Pueblo Libre in 2006. He was reelected in 2010, but failed to attain a third term in 2014. He was previously a member of the Christian People's Party. \c\cJosé Vega is the leader of Union for Peru. A congressman for the constituency of Lima, he further radicalized his party following his accord with the imprisoned military revolt leader, Antauro Humala, the brother of former president Ollanta Humala. He previously served a full term in the Peruvian Congress from 2006 to 2011.[citation needed]\c\cCiro Gálvez is the leader of the National United Renaissance. A lawyer and notary based in Junín, his platform remains conservative, declaring to be in opposition to LGBT rights. For the election, his ticket includes former pastor and businessman Claudio Zolla as his first running-mate, due to a political accord with the New Peru Liberal Party, a libertarian movement led by Zolla. \c\cAndrés Alcántara is the leader of Direct Democracy. A left-wing populist, he presides the FONAVI housing pensioners association, for which he campaigned strongly since early 2000s until 2010 for the government's full pension devolution, which was achieved following via referendum. His campaign platform is poised in reforming and eventually replacing the Constitution of Peru. He ran for the vice presidency in the last three general elections. \c\cMultiple candidates called for constitutional reform or an entirely new constitution to reduce corruption and to bring more prosperity to Peru. Constitutional changes in Peru are overseen by the Congress of Peru. To hold a constitutional referendum, a majority vote from congress is required to approve the election. All proposed constitutional reforms would also have to be approved by congress. Following the first round elections and the divided legislators from numerous different parties voted into congress, chances of candidates changing the constitution were limited. \c\cCorruption in Peru has been pervasive and was recently brought to attention during the Odebrecht scandal, which involved Odebrecht paying politicians to receive contracts for public works projects. BBC News wrote in 2019 that "Peru is perhaps where [Odebrecht] has caused the most severe crisis" and that "[t]he scandal has discredited virtually the entire political elite of the country, as all major parties and players have been implicated." The Odebrecht scandal led to several incidents in Peruvian politics; the suicide of former president Alan García, the order for the arrest of former president Alejandro Toledo as well as the first impeachment process against Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and later his resignation from the presidency. Two candidates in the 2021 elections, Keiko Fujimori and Julio Guzmán, were also under investigation regarding alleged bribes from Odebrecht during their earlier electoral campaigns. Kuczynski's successor Martín Vizcarra reacted to the Odebrecht scandal with multiple anti-corruption initiatives, although Vizcarra was controversially removed from office for his own alleged involvement in corruption and was replaced with President of Congress Manuel Merino. Vizcarra's removal was very unfavorable with Peruvians and resulted with the 2020 Peruvian protests. Merino would be president for only five days and would later be replaced by Francisco Sagasti following a vote from congress. \c\cPedro Castillo proposed to elect a constituent assembly to replace the constitution inherited from Alberto Fujimori's regime, with Castillo saying "it serves to defend corruption at macro scale" and that he would respect the rule of law by calling for a constitutional referendum to determine whether a constituent assembly should be formed or not. Veronika Mendoza also embraced calls for a new constitution instead of amendments, stating "Our current national institutional framework, enshrined in the Constitution, establishes that education, health care, and housing are for-profit enterprises, and that life itself is a commodity to be bought and sold. What this means is that political power is concentrated in the hands of those with money, and not with the Peruvian people."\c\cGeorge Forsyth, the initial frontrunner in the campaign, benefitted from his celebrity fame and not being involved with the traditional political parties being investigated for corruption. Forsyth called for constitutional amendments instead of a new constitution, supporting an amendment that would declare corruption a crime against humanity. \c\cOne of the few candidates to support the existing constitution was Keiko Fujimori. Fujimori has stated that she would keep the 1993 constitution of her father Alberto Fujimori in place, instead advocating for the use of a "heavy hand" if elected president, stating: "Democracy cannot be weak. It must be supported by a solid principle of authority."\c\cPeru is one of the worst-affected nations in the world from the COVID-19 pandemic, with at least 0.5% of the population dying during the pandemic. The crisis became so intense by January 2021 due to a second wave of infections that ICU bed occupancy in Peru rose to 90%, with medical workers beginning to participate in strikes due to their harsh work conditions. \c\cForsyth criticized the COVID-19 lockdowns of the Peruvian government, saying that they caused economic distress and that the National Emergency Operations Center (COEN) should be activated for a civil-military partnership to combat further infection. Mendoza was also critical of how lockdowns were initiated, saying that the government should provide support for families affected by lockdowns, promoted a partnership with Argentina to acquire the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and denounced the potential commercialization of the COVID-19 vaccine in Peru. \c\cOn 24 February 2021, following an approach to advise Francisco Sagasti on the COVID-19 pandemic management in Peru, Hernando de Soto announced the first shadow cabinet in Peruvian history. Mainly composed of his campaign technical team, the main purpose of the opposition cabinet is to offer an alternative for the government to concur and apply De Soto's proposals during the crisis. \c\cAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Peru's gross domestic product fell 30.2 percent in the second quarter of 2020, the largest decline of all major economies, with many small service businesses that represent the majority of businesses of Peru's economy going bankrupt during the crisis. Medical experts commented that the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in Peru can be explained at least in part due to existing socioeconomic circumstances; nearly one-third of Peruvians lived in overcrowded homes, 72% had informal jobs requiring daily work and many needed to travel daily to markets to purchase food since only 49% of households own refrigerators or freezers; even in urban areas it is only 61%. \c\cPolitical scientist Paula Muñoz of the Universidad del Pacífico described Forsyth as "a pro-business guy", while Americas Quarterly wrote "his views on big economic issues are less clear." Forsyth and Fujimori both shared his support for the privatization of public utilities and the deregulation of the economy, with the two saying that government intervention hinders growth. Fujimori also stated that she wanted to make "the State the main partner of entrepreneurs." In contrast, Mendoza criticized the neoliberal policies instituted in Peru since the 1990s, demanded "the decommodification of goods like health, education, and housing", and promoted the government funding of sustainable agricultural and energy projects, all while protecting the environment. \c\cAs a result of the Venezuelan refugee crisis, Peru was home to over one million Venezuelans in February 2021. At that time, the Peruvian Armed Forces were deployed in a joint operation with Ecuadorian counterparts to the Ecuador-Peru border to prevent the entry of illegal migrants, with the armed forces stating that it was to prevent further introduction of COVID-19 in Peru. Human rights organizations criticized the militarization of the border, saying that they are not properly trained for border enforcement and that it violates the human rights of migrants. Xenophobia towards Venezuelans in Peru has also increased, as some politicians have blamed increased crime on the migrants, although the Brookings Institution and Migration Policy Institute found that Venezuelan participate in less crime in Peru than native Peruvians. \c\cOn the immigration topic, George Forsyth's responses varied; he stated that "Peru is a generous country that opens its doors to foreigners" while he also supported deploying more authorities to control the border, stating that migrants "have humiliated our National Police" and "We need the principle of authority in the country. [...] We need an empowered police to defend all of us Peruvians." Regarding her position on immigration, Mendoza stated: "Migration must be considered on humanitarian criteria. Peruvians have also migrated." Although some controls should be instituted to prevent criminals from entering, she promoted migrants as "people who can contribute to the country." Keiko Fujimori supported increased border security, promoting the use of police and the Peruvian Armed Forces for guarding the border. \c\cLeftist candidate Pedro Castillo called on Maduro to take Venezuelan refugees back to their native country, saying that Venezuelans arrived in Peru "to commit crimes." Castillo described the Venezuelan refugee crisis as an issue of "human trafficking", and said that he would give Venezuelans who commit crimes seventy-two hours to leave Peru. \c\cPolitical parties in Peru have been controlled by individuals seeking their own benefits, usually financial compensation. According to The Economist, political graft was the largest challenge facing Peru instead of the ideological battles in the press. Due to the large divisions of parties in congress, with over eleven parties elected into the Congress of Peru, whoever was elected into the presidency was expected to be weak due to the fractured congress. Political analyst Giovanna Peñaflor agreed with the theory of a weak presidency, saying that the fragmented congress would leave the executive vulnerable to legislators. \c\cWhen discussing the state of party politics during the election, especially among congress, political scientist Adriana Urrutia said: "Political parties are no longer a vehicle for representation of the citizenry." Urrutia explained that traditional parties are known among Peruvians to represent groups related to corruption in Peru, including lucrative private universities, illegal logging, and illegal mining, among others. \c\cRegarding the first round of presidential elections, Javier Puente, assistant professor of Latin American Studies at Smith College in the North American Congress on Latin America wrote: "With a baffling number of candidates – 18 in total – the 2021 presidential ballot included convicted felons, presumed money launderers, xenophobes, a fascist billionaire, an overrated and outdated economist, a retired mediocre footballer, a person accused of murdering a journalist, and other colorful figures. The vast majority of candidates represented the continuation of the neoliberal economic model that has been responsible for decades of meager financial performance and unequal growth." Puente stated that only three leftist candidates proposed alternatives to the neoliberal politicians (Veronika Mendoza, Marco Arana, and Pedro Castillo), describing Castillo as "far from being a \'comrade\' who will champion leftist demands, Castillo is the new face of an anti-system impulse. [...] Only in a neoliberal system that outcasts any form of market dissent as radical would a figure like Castillo acquire a role as a leftist."\c\cDue to the internal conflict in Peru involving far-left guerrilla groups attacking Peru's institutions which mainly occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, sentiments towards left-wing political parties have a negative stigma skewed against them. While campaigning occurred during the elections, right-wing politicians would often baselessly characterize left-wing politicians as terrorists, or terrucos in Peruvian Spanish, with the attacks being so common that they were given the term terruqueo. The Americas Quarterly argues that such behavior may result in less support for the leftist candidate Verónika Mendoza and promote political polarization within Peru. With the ongoing political crisis that saw in the span of two years the dissolution of the Congress of Peru and the removal of three presidents (Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Martín Vizcarra, and Manuel Merino), concerns were raised among analysts about the increased political polarization's relationship with Peru's democratic stability. Lead researcher of pollster Institute of Peruvian Studies, Patricia Zárate, stated: "I think the scenario that's coming is really frightening."\c\cSome scholars have recognized the similarities of Fujimori and Castillo; both are cultural conservatives opposing same-sex marriage and abortion, as campaigning for the second round of elections began. Olga González, associate dean of the Kofi Annan Institute for Global Citizenship at Macalester College, stated that the situation is more complex than "binaries" between social classes, although she acknowledged that such dichotomies "speak to how polarized the country is."\c\cRegarding the second round of presidential elections, Peruvian Nobel Prize laureate and writer Mario Vargas Llosa said that the candidate Castillo would undermine democracy, ruin Peru's economy and leave the country "with all the characteristics of a communist society" and that "Peruvians should vote for Keiko Fujimori because she represents the lesser of two evils and, if she's in power, there are more possibilities of saving our democracy." Vargas Llosa urged Fujimori to respect freedom of expression, presidential term limits, and rule out a pardon for Vladimiro Montesinos, who served as Alberto Fujimori's head of intelligence service. \c\cPolitical scientist professor Farid Kahhat of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru stated that "Vargas Llosa has a habit of issuing categorical judgments that later make him look ridiculous. ... Frankly, any Peruvian who has followed Vargas Llosa’s career realizes that he is not worth taking seriously." Vargas Llosa ran and lost against Alberto Fujimori in Peru's 1990 elections, and had previously criticized Fujimori, making statements such as "the worst option is that of Keiko Fujimori because it means the legitimation of one of the worst dictatorships that Peru has had in its history" and that "Keiko is the daughter of a murderer and a thief who is imprisoned, tried by civil courts with international observers, sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder and theft. I do not want her to win the elections." Argentine newspaper Página/12 criticized Vargas Llosa, noting his reversal on previous statements, stating that "the neoliberal right is allied with authoritarian Fujimori", and arguing that Vargas Llosa was "betting on fear and resuscitating an anti-communist coalition."\c\cIn democratic elections since 1919, eleven of eighteen presidents of Peru were from Lima, even as many Peruvians in rural areas were not able to vote until 1979 when the constitution allowed illiterate individuals to vote. Although economic statistics show improved economic data in Peru in recent decades, the wealth earned between 1990 and 2020 was not distributed throughout the country; living standards showed disparities between the more-developed capital city of Lima and similar coastal regions while rural provinces remained impoverished. The COVID-19 pandemic exasperated these disparities even further. Kahhat stated that "market reforms in Peru have yielded positive results in terms of reducing poverty ... But what the pandemic has laid bare, particularly in Peru, is that poverty was reduced while leaving the miserable state of public services unaltered – most clearly in the case of health services."\c\cLeading to the election, opinion polls showed wealthy Peruvians favored Keiko while the poor supported Castillo, with the latter demographic representing a larger portion of voters. This divide was further exacerbated following the election according to the New York Times, especially as Fujimori grew closer to Peru's elite and European classes. Castillo's candidacy brought attention to this divide with much of his support being earned in the exterior portions of the country. In May 2021, Americas Quarterly wrote: "Life expectancy in Huancavelica, for example, the region where Castillo received his highest share of the vote in the first round, is seven years shorter than in Lima. In Puno, where Castillo received over 47% of the vote, the infant mortality rate is almost three times that of Lima's."\c\cAccording to historian José Ragas of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, although Castillo was accused of being linked to communist terrorism, "in places where terrorism caused the most bloodshed, Castillo won by a lot." The separation of Lima and rural Peru also led to the underestimation of Castillo's performance in first-round elections. Castillo received a majority vote in all but one of Peru's mining provinces, with researcher Hugo Ñopo of the Lima-based GRADE stating: "The regions that provide those minerals that make Peru rich do not improve the living standards of the local communities, ... Many people perceive that the winners of these three decades are not them, but are the people in Lima and the big cities." Sociologist Maritza Paredes of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru shared similar thoughts, saying: "People see that all the natural resources are in the countryside but all the benefits are concentrated in Lima." In contrast, Fujimori received support from Lima's elite, according to Kahhat. Kahhat said that evangelical Christians, businesses, media organizations, and the armed forces supported Fujimori, with the nation's largest media organization El Comercio group openly advocating for her election. \c\cDuring the intense periods of internal conflict in Peru in the 1980s and 1990s, the government, military, and media in Peru described any individual who was left on the political spectrum as being a threat to the nation, with many students, professors, union members, and peasants being jailed or killed for their political beliefs. According to some international media agencies, the right-wing elite and media organizations in Peru collaborated with Fujimori's campaign by appealing to fear when discussing political opponents. Reuters wrote that El Comercio, one of the largest media organizations in South America, supported Fujimori during the election. \c\cIn the second round of elections, Peru's major media networks were accused of aligning with Fujimori to discredit Castillo. Some news media allegedly disseminated fake news against Castillo according to the Guardian. International media also said that Peruvian news organizations polished Fujimori's image and praised her, as well as assisting her media campaign tactic which included attacks accusing Castillo of being linked to armed communist groups. The Guardian described accusations linking Castillo to Shining Path as "incorrect", while the Associated Press said that allegations by Peruvian media of links to Shining Path were "unsupported."\c\cColombian journalist Clara Elvira Ospina of Grupo who was the journalistic director of La República's América Televisión and El Comercio's Canal N was removed from her position on 24 April 2021 after having served in the position for a total of nine years. Grupo La República shareholder Gustavo Mohme Seminario said that the firing occurred shortly after Ospina had a conversation with Keiko Fujimori and other news editors. One anonymous individual said that Ospina allegedly told Fujimori that the journalistic direction of the media organizations would not favor her or Castillo, instead using impartiality during their coverage. \c\cMohme criticized the dismissal of Ospina, saying: "I do not want to be a silent troupe of these legal shenanigans that seeks to arbitrarily impose who will assume the reins of the main television channel in the country." Mohme resigned from the editorial council. The Knight Center for Specialized Journalism wrote that Mohme described the incident as self-censorship. Diego Salazar, former editor of Peru21, said that the dismissal was "an obvious sign that you are seeking to intervene in the electoral campaign in a way that is not journalistic." Members of Cuarto Poder, an investigative journalism program on América TV, had their letter to the board of directors leaked in May 2021 where they said that Ospina's dismissal "represented serious damage to the work we do and to the image of the program", and accused her replacement, Gilberto Hume, of having an agenda against Castillo and in favor of Fujimori, writing: "Within that conversation it was implicit that (Hume) asked us to support the candidate of Fuerza Popular to the detriment of the candidate of Free Peru." Luis Galarreta, Fujimori's pick for first vice president, said that the meeting with Ospina was discussing debates and "nothing more", adding that "nobody thinks of influencing a medium."\c\cShortly after polls closed on 6 June, the journalists of Cuarto Poder who sent a letter criticizing alleged censorship were fired by La República's América Televisión and El Comercio's Canal N. \c\cComrade Vilma, with close ties to Comrade José, head of the Militarized Communist Party of Peru (MPCP), a communist organization that split from Shining Path at least ten years before the San Miguel del Ene attack, called for a boycott of elections on 14 May. During the second round of elections, Vilma called on voters not to vote for Fujimori, stating that anyone who voted for her would be the "accomplice of genociders and the corrupt."\c\cOn 23 May, a mass killing of eighteen people occurred in San Miguel del Ene, a rural area in the Vizcatán del Ene District of Satipo Province. Along with the corpses, some of which were burned, leaflets signed by the MPCP were found, featuring the hammer and sickle and defining the attack as a social cleansing operation. The leaflets also called for a boycott of the 6 June elections and accused those who voted for Keiko Fujimori and her Popular Force party of treason. The military quickly accused Shining Path of the attack, although they were allegedly referring to the MCPC. However, no formal investigation had been performed before the links to Shining Path were claimed. OjoPúblico described the media release by the military as "an inaccurate reference to the Shining Path."\c\cThe attack and subsequent media coverage would provide increased support for Fujimori, whose rhetoric aligned Castillo with armed communists. The Fujimori campaign used the attack as a springboard for support, pointing to alleged ties between MOVADEF, a Shining Path political group, and Castillo, attempting to align him to the attack. Fujimori expressed condemnation against the attack during a press conference in Tarapoto as well as regret that "bloody acts" still happened in the country and her condolences to the relatives of the victims. Pedro Castillo also condemned the killings during a rally in Huánuco, expressing solidarity towards the relatives of the victims and also urging the National Police to investigate the attack to clarify the events. Vladimir Cerrón, Secretary General of Free Peru, stated that "the right-wing needed [Shining] Path to win"; Cerrón deleted the tweet moments later while condemning any act of terrorism. Prime Minister Nuria Esparch, who held the position of the Ministry of Defense, condemned the attack and guaranteed that the electoral process would take place normally. \c\cThe first round was held on 11 April. The first exit polls published indicated that underdog nominee Pedro Castillo of Free Peru had placed first in the first round of voting with approximately 16.1% of the vote, with Hernando de Soto and Keiko Fujimori tying with 11.9% each. Yonhy Lescano, Rafael López Aliaga, Verónika Mendoza, George Forsyth followed, with each receiving 11.0%, 10.5%, 8.8%, and 6.4%, respectively. César Acuña and Daniel Urresti received 5.8% and 5.0%, respectively, while the rest of the nominees attained less than 3% of the popular vote. \c\cIn the second round, Castillo defeated Fujimori by just 44,263 votes, winning by 50.13% to 49.87%, although an official outcome is yet to be declared by the National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE). \c\cThe Popular Action, the largest party in the previous legislature, lost some of its seats, and previous parliamentary parties like Union for Peru (UPP) and the Broad Front (FA) had their worst results ever while attaining no representation. The Peruvian Nationalist Party of former President Ollanta Humala and National Victory of George Forsyth (who led polling for the presidential election earlier in the year) failed to win seats as well. New or previously minor parties such as Free Peru, Go on Country and Together for Peru and Popular Renewal, the successor of National Solidarity, had good results, with Free Peru becoming the largest party in Congress. Contigo, the successor to former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's Peruvians for Change party, failed to win a seat once again and received less than 1% of the vote. \c\cFollowing reports of Castillo's apparent victory, Fujimori made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and made efforts to overturn the election with support of wealthy citizens of Lima. Those among the more affluent, including former military officers and wealthy families, demanded new elections, promoted calls for a military coup and utilized classist or racist rhetoric to support their allegations of fraud. According to analysts, Peru was more susceptible to unrest as a result of Fujimori's narrative since democratic institutions are weaker in the nation. Senior fellow of the Washington Office on Latin America Jo Marie Burt described the overturn attempts as "a slow-motion conspiracy to prevent Castillo from becoming president", with The Guardian reporting that if Castillo was prevented from becoming president by 28 July 2021, a new election would be initiated. \c\cFujimori's statements about possibly overturning the election were also described as being inspired by the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election by former U.S. president Donald Trump. According to Cornell University professor of Latin American politics Kenneth Roberts, "[w]hen the credibility is called into question the way it has been by Trump and the Republicans in the U.S., it creates a bad example that other leaders and countries can follow, providing a template to change results they don\'t like."\c\cOn 18 June, former Supreme Court President Javier Villa Stein filed a complaint for protection by describing the ballot vote as "questioned", arguing an alleged "electoral process flawed by various acts that undermine the popular will" and asking the judiciary branch to "declare the election void". Lawyer Renán Galindo Peralta requested that it be rejected outright considering it inadmissible because it did not fall under the Organic Law of Elections and because the judicial branch lacked the powers to annul elections. \c\cTo avoid the questions of election legitimacy, election authorities in Peru approved the use of election monitoring. In total, one hundred and fifty observers (ninety-nine in Peru and fifty-one abroad) were approved to observe elections throughout Peru. The origin of the observers were from twenty-two different countries, with thirty-five observers from the Organization of American States, while others were from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Spain, Switzerland, the United States, and Uruguay. Observer approval required providing election authorities observation plans; these plans included protocols to inform authorities of crimes, violations of electoral law or any complaints they collected. Observers were then responsible with providing an official, final report to authorities. According to OjoPúblico, "the observers carry out the review of the activities of election day, ranging from the installation of the voting tables, the conditioning of the secret chambers, the conformity of the ballots, the minutes, the amphorae and any other electoral material, to the counting, the counting of the vote and the transfer of the electoral records at the end of the day."\c\cAfter Castillo took the lead during the ballot-counting process, Fujimori promoted unproven claims of electoral fraud. In a media event following election day, Fujimori alleged that a "series of irregularities" had occurred, presenting photographs and videos in an attempt to support her allegations, while also accusing Free Peru of attempting to "distort and delay" the election process. Fujimori argued that it consisted in the challenge of polling stations where Fujimori would register a greater number of votes than his opponent, previous training talks by Free Peru in which they ask their representatives to arrive early at the polling stations to ensure control of the polling stations where titular members did not attend and irregularities in the vote count. To support the complaints, Keiko's running mate, Luis Galarreta, assured that Free Peru did a "high number of challenges" to electoral acts in which Keiko was favoured so they could not be counted to the final estimate until they were evaluated first by the National Jury of Elections. According to the complaint, over 1 300 voting acts were challenged by Free Peru. \c\cHowever, the first claims were rebutted by national electoral entities. After the resolution of the challenged votes and the acts observed by the Special Electoral Juries, the National Office of Electoral Processes published the total results on 15 June, in which Pedro Castillo surpassed Keiko Fujimori in number of votes. \c\cAccording to The Guardian, various international observers countered Fujimori's claims, stating that the election process was conducted in accordance with international standards. Observers from the Inter-American Union of Electoral Organizations, the Organization of American States, and the Progressive International denied any instances of widespread fraud and praised the accuracy of the elections. The Guardian also reported that analysts and political observers criticized Fujimori's remarks, noting that it made her appear desperate after losing her third presidential run in a ten-year period. Fernando Tuesta, political scientist from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, stated: "It's extremely regrettable that when the result is not favourable, that the candidate talks about fraud. It's terrible, ... They have been talking about fraud because they don\'t want to respect the result." On 9 June, Fujimori sought to have around 200,000 votes annulled and for 300,000 votes to be reviewed. \c\cOn 10 June, the Peruvian Prosecution asked for the detention of Keiko on charges of violating the conditional liberty that she was granted during the open criminal process against her. \c\cOn 17 June, Fujimori repeated claims of voter fraud. On 28 June, Fujimori traveled to the Government Palace and personally delivered demands to President Francisco Sagasti to initiate an audit of the results by international entities. On 30 June, several members of the Popular Force party traveled to the OAS Building in Washington, D.C., to publicize the voter fraud claims, with sociologist Francesca Emanuele condemning them as "coup plotters" during a press conference. On 2 July, Sagasti rejected a request to audit the second round of the election, and Fujimori accused Sagasti of abdicating his "great responsibility to ensure fair elections."\c\cRumors spread of a possible coup d\'état against Castillo, if he were declared the official winner of the presidential election. A letter signed by almost one-hundred retired officers of the Peruvian armed forces was written calling on current military leaders in Peru to refuse recognizing the election of Castillo into the presidency. President Sagasti condemned the letter, stating: "They want to incite top commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air force to break the rule of law."\c\cOn 25 June, former 2001 and 2016 presidential candidate Fernando Olivera revealed audio tapes, alleging that Vladimiro Montesinos, who was the right hand man to former President Alberto Fujimori currently serving a prison sentence for crimes committed during the Fujimori period, was behind the attempts for Keiko Fujimori to be declared as the winner of the second round against Castillo, including through the payment of bribes to electoral officials and influencing the National Jury of Elections. The National Penitentiary Institute and Peruvian Navy announced an investigation, confirming that Montesinos made two phone calls from Callao Naval Base where he is jailed, on 10 and 23 June to unauthorised persons coordinating the effort to overturn the election. Further reports showed that Montesinos allegedly was able to make seventeen phone calls from a landline phone to retired military officer Pedro Rejas, reportedly suggesting to Rejas that bribes needed to be paid and that Fujimori's husband, an American, go to the United States embassy in Lima to present "documentation of the fraud" to the Office of Regional Affairs and Central Intelligence Agency. According to IDL-Reporteros, Montesinos suggests that the documentation would reach President Joe Biden and that his administration would condemn the election as interference from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, subsequently giving Fujimori's claims of fraud more weight. \c\cLourdes Flores, leader of the Christian People's Party, which supported Fujimori in the election, argued carrying out her own analysis of certain electoral acts, concluding that there was a mechanism to "improperly incline the vote" in favor of Pedro Castillo. Rafael López Aliaga, former presidential candidate for Popular Renewal who supported Fujimori as well, argued that the second round or ballot should be repeated because "there is a fraud that cannot be covered up anymore". Alfredo Barnechea, former candidate for Popular Action, affirmed that the irregularities detected were "massive" and that therefore the ballot should be repeated with international observation or else whoever is elected "will not have any legitimacy."\c\cFormer Prime Minister Salvador del Solar declared that "there is no legal basis to denounce fraud nor to request new elections. The Secretary General of the Transparency Civil Association, Iván Lanegra, declared that "there is no indication of fraud" in the Peruvian elections. Verónika Mendoza, former candidate who endorsed Castillo, described Popular Will's annulment requests as attempts to dismiss the electoral results and "hit democracy." Journalist César Hildebrandt said that by dismissing the election results, "what Keiko Fujimori is doing is equivalent to a soft coup", describing the allegations of Fujimori's alleged fraud as "Andean Trumpism."\c\cOn 23 June, Luis Arce, a judge on the National Jury of Elections (JNE), resigned and alleged bias on the jury which had rejected ten Fujimori requests to annul Castillo votes. On its Twitter account, JNE rejected Arce's allegation of bias as "offensive", and said its judges were not allowed to resign in the middle of reviews of cases, so he would be suspended instead, and a provisional replacement found "to avoid delaying our work." Castillo's Free Peru party said the resignation was aimed at "preventing the proclamation of Pedro Castillo, thereby ignoring the popular vote, breaking democracy and installing a coup d\'état with silk gloves." In the wake of Arce's resignation, a lawyer representing Fujimori said that the government should consider asking the Organization of American States (OAS) to audit the electoral process, as was done during the 2019 Bolivian political crisis. The OAS stated that its mission to the country had not found any issues in the conduct of the election. Former candidate George Forsyth attributed it as part of the preparation of a "coup d\'etat" and that Arce himself was "attacking democracy."\c\cLeftist leaders in Latin America congratulated Castillo shortly after preliminary results were tallied. President of Argentina Alberto Fernández tweeted that he had spoken to the "President-elect" Castillo and that he wished to cooperate with him. President of Bolivia Luis Arce tweeted that "Bolivia joins the celebration of the Peruvian people", calling Castillo his "brother", and stating that the two would "continue the struggle for a tomorrow with justice and equality for the people." Evo Morales and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, former presidents of Bolivia and Brazil, respectively, also congratulated Castillo. \c\cNed Price, Spokesperson for the United States Department of State, described the elections as "a model of democracy", while also stating: "We congratulate the Peruvian authorities for safely administering another round of free, fair, accessible and peaceful elections, even amid the significant challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.", agreeing that it was necessary to give time to the electoral authorities to publish the results according to Peruvian law. The European Union described the election as "free and democratic."\c\cAndrés Pastrana, former President of Colombia and member of the international forum IDEA (Spanish: Iniciativa Democrática de España y las Américas), declared that there are "serious indications that Venezuela has its hands in the Peruvian electoral system", suggesting an international audit of the electoral results. The claim was rejected by the Peruvian National Office of Electoral Processes, which assured that the vote count was done transparently. \c\cPeruvian Nobel laureate residing in Spain Mario Vargas Llosa expressed his support for electoral authorities to carefully review the contested acts, saying that what is important is to have a president "that the majority of Peruvian voters has chosen and not a fraudulent president. \c\cColombian President Iván Duque and Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso congratulated Castillo on July for his proclamation. \c\cAfter exit polls gave the victory to Keiko Fujimori over Pedro Castillo, supporters of Free Peru mobilized to the offices of the ONPE to protest against a possible fraud against their candidate, bringing banners saying "no to the fraud". From Tacabamba, Cajamarca, Castillo called upon his followers and supporters on Twitter to "defend the votes" and go to the streets to "defend democracy". Protests against Fujimori and an alleged fraud took place in cities such as Juliaca, Puno and Ilave. \c\cAfter the publication of the quick count and the first official results, protests by supporters of both Free Peru and Popular Force took place. Amid the fraud accusations and the final vote count, there were nearly daily protests and marches, mostly in the capital Lima. Besides Fujimori supporters, groups opposed to Castillo, mobilized by the fear of communism or aversion to the left wing, mobilized asking for the annulment of the elections. Among the opposition groups there were anti-communists, far-right followers and neonazi groups, including Acción Legionaria (Legionary Action). During a mobilization in the San Martín Square in Lima, rondas campesinas supportive of Castillo carried machetes with them. \c\cOn 14 July, several pro-Fujimori protesters gathered at the Government Palace demanding an audit of the election. Protesters clashed with the National Police of Peru, and Health Minister Óscar Ugarte and Housing Minister Solangel Fernández were attacked during the protests. On 15 July, Sagasti reaffirmed that there was no evidence of voter fraud. \c\cIn late June, an IEP poll showed that thirty-one percent of participants believed in Fujimori's claims of fraud. A statistical analysis of the company Ipsos Peru on the results published by the National Office of Electoral Processes did not find evidence of an atypical distribution of votes to any candidate, neither in certain geographical areas nor for a particular candidate. In a survey carried out by Datum Internacional, 65% of respondents (both Pedro Castillo and Keiko Fujimori voters) believed that there were "signs" of fraud in the elections. However, a survey by the Institute of Peruvian Studies showed that 66% of participants considered that Pedro Castillo had won the election.
Since July 17, 2021, Henan province has been affected by large amounts of rain. The rainfall broke the record of the largest single-day rainfall ever recorded in many parts of Henan. Twelve people have been killed. \c\cFrom 8:00 on July 19 to 8:00 on July 20, rainfall monitoring stations in Henan Province monitored a large amount of rainfall, including five Chinese national monitoring stations, Songshan (364.6 mm), Xinmi (254.9 mm), Xinzheng (196 mm), Dengfeng (192.8 mm), Yanshi (183.3 mm). Zhengzhou encountered extremely rare heavy rainfall from 16:00 to 17:00 on the 20th. The rainfall in one hour was as high as 201.9 mm, causing serious waterlogging. 13 reservoirs in Henan Province have reached the flood control limit. \c\cAccording to the China Meteorological Administration, the main reasons for the torrential rains are the Typhoon In-fa that are 1,000 kilometers away from Henan Province and the continuous subtropical high pressure that continuously guides a large amount of water vapor to the land, and is affected by the uplift of the Taihang Mountains and other topographical areas. This caused a flood of heavy rainfall in Henan. \c\cOn July 16, Zhengzhou began to experience heavy rain. On July 20 alone, the average precipitation on that day had reached 253 mm. Among them, from 16:00 to 17:00 on July 20, the rainfall in one hour reached 201.9mm; and from 20:00 on July 17 to 20:00 on July 20, the rainfall reached 617.1mm in the course of three days. The torrential rain was so strong that many cars on a road near the Danshi Subdistrict in Nanlong Lake were washed up by the rain. The Zhengzhou Meteorological Observatory issued a red warning signal for rainstorms, and the Zhengzhou Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters upgraded the emergency response of flood control level II to level I. The hourly precipitation and single-day precipitation in Zhengzhou have broken the historical record of 60 years since the station was established in 1951. \c\cOn the evening of July 19, Kaifeng was attacked by heavy rainfall. By the morning of the 20th, the heavy rain escalated to torrential rain. Kaifeng issued a red rainstorm warning accordingly, and upgraded to an orange rainstorm warning in the afternoon of the 20th.

The 2021 Taliban offensive is an ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies that began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As of 15 July 2021, over a third of Afghanistan's 421 districts were controlled by the Taliban. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north in 2021 may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan’s main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway of Afghanistan's capital city Kabul. In terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the Britain, Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander.  Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves - with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "[w]omen will never pick up guns against us." During this wekkend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July 2021 Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployemnt of 20.000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July 2021 Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7.000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. \c\cOn 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July 2021, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force. \c\cOn 12 July Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cAs of 15 July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second-largest city of Afghanistan, Kandahar. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. As of this date, 233 Afghan National Security Forces and 114 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,100 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. The following day, Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed while covering the fighting in Spin Boldak. \c\c Afghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahideen Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. \c\c Taliban: On 9 July, a Taliban spokesman from Moscow, Russia, said that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and pointed that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\c China: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has criticized the withdrawal of American-led NATO forces and has urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\c India: Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that India would be consulting all important parts in the conflict, including China, and that India was pushing for "conciliation in Afghanistan."\c\c Iran: Influential Shia cleric, lawmaker, and politician Mojtaba Zonnour said that the Taliban is an "an undeniable part of the reality in Afghanistan", and that it should not be equated to Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIL or al-Qaeda. \c\c Kazakhstan: Representatives from the country participated in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Kyrgyzstan Representatives from the country participated in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Pakistan: Keeping in view the advancements of Taliban, DG ISPR issued a statement that "Pakistan should be seen as facilitator, not guarantor in Afghan peace process."\c\c Russia: Russian authorities said they were working with the Tajik government to protect it from any foreign threat under the Collective Security Treaty Organization. \c\c Tajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon ordered 20,000 reserve servicemen of the country's Ground Forces to be sent to the Afghan–Tajik border. \c\c Turkey: The country offered to order its troops to protect Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \c\c Turkmenistan: Turkmen military forces were assigned to the Afghan–Turkmen border due to security concerns. \c\c United States: President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying that the country had not gone to Afghanistan to "nation build." Biden added that he would not "send another generation of Americans to fight there" and pointed to other failed attempts at unifying Afghanistan in the past. He also reassured that the U.S. safety was not at risk with any outcome of the infighting in Afghanistan. \c\c Uzbekistan: The government raised concerns of a possible migratory crisis due to the infighting in Afghanistan and reported that U.S. authorities had contacted Uzbek officials to confirm if Uzbekistan could safeguard Afghans who collaborated with the U.S., fleeing from the country. In response, the Uzbek government erected a tent city for migrants in the city of Termez.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland is part of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus reached the country in late February 2020 and within three weeks, cases had been confirmed in all counties. The pandemic affected many aspects of society. The government shut all schools, colleges, childcare facilities and cultural institutions on 12 March 2020. All large gatherings were cancelled, including St Patrick's Day festivities two years running. On 24 March 2020, almost all businesses, venues and amenities were shut, and on 27 March, the first stay-at-home order banned all non-essential travel and contact with other people. The elderly and those with certain illnesses were told to cocoon. People were made to keep apart in public. The Oireachtas passed an emergency act giving the state power to detain people, restrict travel and keep people in their homes to control the virus's spread. Further emergency law passed the following week. The Garda Síochána were given power to enforce the lockdown, which was repeatedly extended until late May. \c\cThe Republic's first lockdown was the longest in Europe, especially for hospitality and retail. It caused a severe recession and an unprecedented rise in unemployment. A Pandemic Unemployment Payment and a Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme were set up. School exams were cancelled. The Health Service Executive (HSE) launched a recruitment campaign, asking all current and former healthcare workers to "be on call for Ireland". By mid-April, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported that the pandemic's growth rate had been driven "as low as it needs to be", and the curve had flattened. \c\cDaily cases and deaths dropped to low levels by June and restrictions were gradually lifted, while schools remained closed for summer break. Pubs remained shut, the longest such closure in Europe. In August, a three-week regional lockdown was imposed in three counties following a spike in cases linked to meat processing plants. Schools re-opened in September. This was followed by a surge in cases, and in October another statewide lockdown was imposed, excluding schools. In early December, Ireland's infection rate was the lowest in the European Union, and restrictions were eased. \c\cThere was another surge in late December, and on 24 December (Christmas Eve), another statewide lockdown was imposed. This was soon tightened to include schools, and was one of the strictest in the world. On St Stephen's Day, the first shipment of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived, and vaccinations began on 29 December. In February 2021, the government imposed testing and quarantine rules on all incoming travellers for the first time. Serious cases fell sharply, and schools re-opened in March. The lockdown began to be gradually lifted from May, although unlike most of Europe, indoor hospitality remained shut. \c\cBy 20 July 2021, the Department of Health had confirmed 286,691 cases and 5,018 deaths. More than 90% of those who have died were aged over 65, and 93% had underlying conditions or lived in care homes with a median age of death at 82 years old. As of 20 July 2021, 2,989,341 people had received the first dose of a vaccine, 2,296,255 had received their second dose and 166,953 had received a single dose, bringing the total of vaccines administered to 5,285,596. \c\cThe surveillance of COVID-19 cases has been integrated into the existing national Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system since COVID-19 was made a notifiable disease on 20 February 2020. CIDR is the information system used to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland, both at regional and national level. Daily epidemiological reports on COVID-19 are prepared by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) for the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). Additional information, including the actual dates of the backlogged cases announced on 10 April 2020, is provided by the Health Service Executive in its daily operations updates. \c\cBy 20 July 2021, the Department of Health had confirmed 286,691 cases and 5,018 deaths. \c\cThe National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), a group within the Department of Health, began monitoring the spread of the virus before it was confirmed to have reached Ireland. According to The Irish Times, the NPHET for COVID-19 was created on 27 January 2020. The Coronavirus Expert Advisory Group—a subgroup of NPHET chaired by Dr Cillian de Gascun, the UCD-based Director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory – met for the first time on 5 February in Dublin. \c\cIn late February, the Department of Health stated that Ireland was in the Containment Phase of its strategy against the virus, though media briefings with such figures with Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan were already underway. \c\cOn 27 February, the first case on the island of Ireland was announced—a woman from Belfast who had travelled from Northern Italy through Dublin Airport. Two days later, on 29 February, the first confirmed case in the Republic of Ireland was announced involving a male student from the east of the country, who had arrived there from Northern Italy. Authorities shut a secondary school linked to the case as a precautionary measure. The State did not name the school involved, but—shortly afterwards—the Irish Examiner's Political Editor, Daniel McConnell, tweeted a copy of the letter it had sent to parents informing them it would close. NPHET continued to meet after the virus had arrived in Ireland to co-ordinate the national response to the pandemic. \c\cOn 11 March, an elderly patient in Naas General Hospital in County Kildare (south-west of the country's capital city, Dublin) became Ireland's first fatality from the virus. \c\cOn 12 March, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the closure of all schools, colleges and childcare facilities until 29 March. The announcement, which came one day after the World Health Organization formally declared that the outbreak was a pandemic, also marked Ireland's movement from the Containment Phase in its strategy to combat the spread of the virus (a strategy which the Department of the Taoiseach had reaffirmed just three days earlier) towards the Delay Phase. \c\cOn 15 March, the Government of Ireland ordered bars and public houses to close and advised against house parties. \c\cOn 18 March, detailed information about hospital statistics, age range affected, how COVID-19 was spreading, healthcare workers and cases by county was published by the National Public Health Emergency Team starting on this day. It showed that the virus was present in 23 of the 26 counties, with Laois, Leitrim and Monaghan the only three yet to record a case. \c\cOn 26 March, 255 cases and 10 deaths were confirmed, bringing the totals to 1,819 cases and 19 deaths, more than double the previous day's total. According to Chief Medical Officer Holohan, most of the deaths occurred in "institutional settings", i.e. hospitals and nursing homes. At this point, deaths began to increase rapidly. \c\cOn 27 March, 302 new cases as well as 3 new deaths brought the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 2,121 and 22, respectively. Among the deaths was the country's first healthcare worker fatality, who was based in the east of the country. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced a national stay-at-home order with a series of measures which he summed up as: "Stay at Home". Merrion Street described it as "a more intensive phase in our response to COVID-19". The measures, which coincided with an escalating death toll, were also a response to increased reliance on intensive care units (ICUs) to treat critically ill patients, and an attempt to lower this number before capacity was reached. \c\cOn 1 April, it was announced that Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan, who displayed signs of illness during the previous evening's news conference, had entered hospital for non-COVID reasons; Ronan Glynn (Deputy Chief Medical Officer and Head of the Department of Health's Health Protection Unit) took charge. \c\cOn 10 April, it was reported that there was a discrepancy between the number of cases confirmed by Ireland's Department of Health and the ECDC, due to swab tests sent to Germany for analysis to clear the backlog and testing in Ireland. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced that measures introduced on 27 March would be extended until at least 5 May. \c\cOn 14 April, Minister for Health Simon Harris said between 25,000 and 30,000 tests had been sent to Germany and "well over" half of the results had been returned, with the remainder due back by next week. The National Public Health Emergency Team said there would be a "real danger" of a second wave of virus cases, if the changing of restrictions was not done correctly. \c\cOn 15 April, a further 657 cases, together with an additional 411 cases from the backlog of tests at the laboratory in Germany, and 38 deaths were reported, bringing the totals to 12,547 cases and 444 deaths.

He also announced that the curve had flattened and that no peak would be coming. \c\cOn 29 April, a further 376 cases and 31 deaths were reported, bringing the end of April totals to 20,253 cases and 1,190 deaths. Holohan said, "We estimate that as of Saturday 25th April 12,222 COVID-19 cases (64%) in the community have recovered. 1,164 cases (6%) have been discharged from hospital which gives us a total recovery rate of 70%."\c\cOn 1 May, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the extension of the current restrictions to 18 May at the earliest. A roadmap to easing restrictions in Ireland that includes five stages was adopted by the government and subsequently published online. \c\cOn 15 May, Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan announced seven children in Ireland had been identified with links to paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a new illness temporarily associated with COVID-19.

Two days later on 25 December (Christmas Day), Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan officially confirmed that the new UK variant of COVID-19 had been detected in the Republic of Ireland by whole genome sequencing at the National Virus Reference Laboratory in University College Dublin. By week 2 of 2021, the variant had become the dominant strain in Ireland. \c\cOn 30 December, the Government of Ireland agreed to move the entire country to full Level 5 lockdown restrictions from midnight until 31 January 2021 at the earliest. \c\cUnder additional Level 5 restrictions:\c\cAll schools to remain closed after the Christmas break until 11 January 2021.

A further 612 cases and 6 deaths were reported, bringing the end of February totals to 219,592 cases and 4,319 deaths. \c\cOn 30 March, the Government of Ireland announced a phased easing of Level 5 restrictions from Monday 12 April, with people allowed to travel within their county, two households allowed to meet socially outdoors, people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 allowed to meet other fully vaccinated people indoors, and the resumption of all residential construction projects from that date. \c\cFrom 19 April:\c\cElite-level senior GAA matches and training could resume\c\cFrom 26 April:\c\cOutdoor sports facilities (such as pitches, golf courses and tennis courts) could reopen\c\cOutdoor visitor attractions (such as zoos, open pet farms, heritage sites) could reopen\c\cMaximum attendance at funerals would increase from 10 to 25 on compassionate grounds\c\cFrom 4 May:\c\cFull reopening of construction activity\c\cPhased reopening of non-essential retail and personal services\c\cReligious services, museums and galleries could reopen and resume\c\cOn 31 March, a further 411 cases and 6 deaths were reported, bringing the end of March totals to 235,854 cases and 4,687 deaths. \c\cOn 19 April, the Director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory Cillian de Gascun confirmed that three cases of the B.1.617 variant of COVID-19, first identified in India, had been detected in the Republic of Ireland. \c\cOn 30 April, a further 545 cases and 4 deaths were reported, bringing the end of April totals to 248,870 cases and 4,903 deaths. \c\cOn 29 April, the Government of Ireland announced a reopening plan for the country throughout May and June from 10 May, with inter-county travel allowed, the reopening of all hairdressers, libraries, museums and galleries, up to 50 people allowed to attend religious services, the resumption of click-and-collect services and the allowances of three households to meet outdoors (including in private gardens) and a vaccinated household to meet an unvaccinated household indoors from that date. \c\cFrom 17 May\c\cAll retail could reopen\c\cFrom 2 June\c\cHotels, B&Bs, self-catering and hostels could reopen but services must be restricted to overnight guests and residents\c\cFrom 7 June\c\cOutdoor sports matches could recommence with no spectators permitted\c\cGyms, swimming pools and leisure centres could reopen for individual training only\c\cOutdoor services in restaurants and bars could recommence, with groups limited to a maximum of 6 people\c\cThe numbers of guests attending wedding celebrations/receptions could increase to 25\c\cVisitors from one other household could be permitted in private homes\c\cOn 28 May,  the Government announced a further reopening plan for the country throughout June, July and August, with the reopening of all hotels from 2 June, outdoor hospitality, cinemas, swimming pools, gyms from 7 June, and indoor hospitality from 5 July. \c\cFrom 2 June:\c\cReopening of accommodation services including hotels, B&Bs, self-catering and hostels\c\cFrom 7 June:\c\cThe numbers permitted at organised outdoor events could increase to a maximum of 100 for the majority of venues, with a maximum of 200 for outdoor venues with a minimum accredited capacity of 5,000\c\cReopening of all cinemas, theatres, gyms, swimming pools and leisure centres\c\cReopening of outdoor amusement parks, theme parks and funfairs\c\cResumption of outdoor services in restaurants and pubs\c\cVisiting indoors in private homes\c\cPartial reopening of Driver Theory Test Services\c\cResumption of outdoor sports matches\c\cFrom 5 July:\c\cUp to three households permitted to meet indoors in private homes in line with Level 2\c\cResumption of organised indoor events\c\cThe numbers permitted at outdoor organised events could further increase to a maximum of 200 for the majority of venues, with a maximum of 500 for outdoor stadia/venues with a minimum accredited capacity of 5,000\c\cReopening of bowling alleys, snooker halls, amusement arcades, ice-skating/roller skating rinks and indoor waterparks\c\cFrom 19 July:\c\cInternational non-essential travel would be allowed with the EU Digital COVID-19 Certificate for travel coming into force in Ireland\c\cResumption of indoor services in restaurants and pubs for vaccinated persons only (proposed)\c\cOn 31 May, a further 378 cases were reported, however data relating to the number of COVID-19 deaths and total number of cases were not available due to the Health Service Executive cyberattack. \c\cOn 2 June, the Director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory Cillian de Gascun confirmed that there had been 115 cases of the Delta variant of COVID-19 detected in Ireland. On 17 June, HSE Chief Clinical Officer Colm Henry confirmed that there had been 180 cases of the Delta variant detected. On 24 June, 210 cases of the Delta variant had been detected in Ireland. \c\cOn 29 June, due to the rapidly increasing incidence of the Delta variant, the Government of Ireland announced that the planned reopening of indoor dining and drinking in restaurants and pubs on 5 July would be delayed until at least 19 July when a system to verify vaccination or immunity would be implemented, while 50 guests would be permitted to attend wedding celebrations as an exception from July. \c\cOn 30 June, a further 452 cases and 9 deaths were reported, bringing the end of June totals to 271,908 cases and 4,998 deaths. \c\cOn 1 July, Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan announced that a fourth wave of COVID-19 was beginning in Ireland following an increase in cases caused by the Delta variant. \c\cOn 16 July 2021, the Department of Health reported 1,173 cases. People who were awaiting full vaccination were urged to "take every precaution", with the highest cases among the 16–34 age cohorts, a significant shift from previous waves. In a statement, Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan stated that cases of COVID-19 were rapidly increasing, with the majority of cases occurring in people who had not been fully vaccinated. On 17 July, a further 1,377 cases were reported, the highest recorded in six months. \c\cDespite the increasing cases, the Government agreed that indoor dining in pubs and restaurants could resume on Monday 26 July for fully vaccinated and COVID-19 recovered people, after President Michael D. Higgins signed the legislation underpinning new guidelines into law. \c\cCOVID-19 vaccination in the Republic of Ireland began on 29 December 2020. Annie Lynch, a 79-year-old woman, became the first person in the Republic of Ireland to receive the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and received the second dose three weeks later on Tuesday 19 January 2021. \c\cMaura Byrne, a 95-year-old woman, became the first nursing home resident in the Republic of Ireland to receive the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 5 January 2021, while Dr Eavan Muldoon, an infectious diseases consultant, became the first healthcare worker in the Mater University Hospital to receive the vaccine. \c\cBy the end of January, three effective vaccines of Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford–AstraZeneca were in use in Ireland. \c\cOn 14 March, the administration of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was suspended in Ireland as a precautionary measure following concerns over serious blood clots in Norway. On 19 March, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended that the vaccine could continue to be used in Ireland following approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 18 March. \c\cIreland reached the milestones of half a million COVID-19 vaccines administered on 6 March 2021, one million on 8 April, and one million first doses on 25 April. \c\cAs of 20 July 2021, 2,989,341 people had received the first dose of a vaccine, 2,296,255 had received their second dose and 166,953 had received a single dose, bringing the total of vaccines administered to 5,285,596. \c\cThe developing and delivering of testing of Ireland was led by the staff in the National Virus Reference Laboratory. With the acquisition of the sequence of the virus, they used this to develop and validate in-house assays in advance of obtaining any commercial diagnostic kits. The NVRL played a vital role in the early detection of COVID-19 cases in Ireland, and began playing a vital role in the detection of new variants of COVID-19 in 2021. \c\cLike most countries in the world,  the pandemic's emergence and the lockdowns it led to deeply impacted the Irish economy, causing it to plunge into a recession. While there were job losses in all sectors primarily due to stay-at-home orders, individuals working in tourism, hospitality, food and retail were most likely to be affected. \c\cA COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and a Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme were set up. \c\cThe social impact of the pandemic had far-reaching consequences in the country that went beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it, including political, religious, educational, artistic and sporting. \c\cThe 2020 Leaving Certificate, 2020–2021 Junior Certificate and all 2020–2021 Irish language summer courses in the Gaeltacht were cancelled. The 2020 Dublin Horse Show was cancelled, the first time since 1940 that the event did not occur. The Tidy Towns competition was cancelled for the first time in its 62-year history. The Rose of Tralee was cancelled for the first time in its 61-year history. The 2020 National Ploughing Championships and Ballinasloe Horse Fair also went. The All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship were completed in December in between the second and third waves of the virus to hit Ireland, maintaining their record of having been held annually since 1887. \c\cShop door showing social distancing measures. \c\cIrish butcher implementing ad hoc social distancing measures. \c\cSupermarket: a one-way system, instructions on social distancing, disposable gloves, trolley cleaning supplies. \c\cTemporary protection for employees deployed in a grocery store during the pandemic. \c\cPharmacy where the door has been replaced with a hatch for exchanging goods. \c\cPeople queueing at an Irish supermarket; strips of black tape on the ground to demarcate 2-metre gaps. \c\cA grandson visits his grandmother who is "cocooning" in her home. \c\cTwo-metre marking for visitors to Bram Stoker Park in Marino, Dublin. \c\cAn Irish paramedic en route to a so-called "query case" during the pandemic in Ireland. \c\cTwo pints of stout delivered fresh from a pub.

The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on 25 January 2020 with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne, Australia. It has since spread elsewhere in the region, although many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. Three Oceania sovereign states have yet to report a case: Nauru, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Australia and New Zealand have been praised for their handling of the pandemic compared to other western nations, with both New Zealand and each of Australia's states wiping out all community transmission of the virus several times even after being re-introduced into the community. \c\cOn 25 January 2020, the first case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported, that of a Chinese citizen who arrived from Guangzhou on 19 January. The patient received treatment in Melbourne. On the same day, three other patients tested positive in Sydney after returning from Wuhan. \c\cOn 1 March 2020, a 78-year-old man from Western Australia, who had been a passenger on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, became the first person to die from coronavirus in Australia. He died in a hospital in Perth. \c\cAustralian borders were closed to all non-residents from 20 March 2020; all returning travellers are required to undergo two weeks\' quarantine in hotels. From March onwards, many states and territories also closed their internal borders, with similar quarantine requirements for exempt travellers. A breach of quarantine in Melbourne hotels led to the state of Victoria experiencing a second wave and returning to strict lockdown measures from July through to October 2020.[citation needed]\c\cAs of 20 July 2021[update], Australia has reported 32,129 cases, 25,486 recoveries,[citation needed] and 915 deaths, with Victoria's second wave accounting for nearly 75 percent of cases and 90 percent of fatalities. No deaths from COVID-19 were recorded in Australia from 28 December 2020 until 13 April 2021, when one death occurred in Queensland, then none until July 2021, when four elderly New South Wales residents, and one in her fifties, died in ten days during the outbreak of Delta variant in Sydney. As of 12 July 2021[update], there have also been 4 deaths linked to rare adverse reactions to vaccines. 2 of the deaths were in New South Wales, 1 in Western Australia, and 1 in South Australia. With concurrent lockdowns in Sydney, Darwin, Perth and Brisbane, on 29 June 2021 more than 12 million of Australia's population was in lockdown. The Australian National Cabinet's stated pandemic policy goal is "zero community transmission," in contrast to the mitigation policies of most other Western countries. \c\cAs of 3 April 2020, Norfolk Island has not had any cases. As a precautionary measure the government imposed a 32-day travel ban and declared a state of emergency. Administrator Eric Hutchinson stated that the measures were necessary due to the remote island's extremely limited health capacity. Lockdown measures began to be lifted from 6 May. \c\cOn 19 March 2020, the local government of Easter Island ordered a lockdown of the island and requested LATAM Airlines to evacuate all tourists on the island. However, on 24 March, the first case of coronavirus was reported on the island. By the start of April, 5 confirmed cases had been reported. All cases have recovered after some weeks and no new cases have been reported since. \c\cThe first case of the disease in Fiji was reported on 19 March 2020, leading to the lockdowns of Fiji's two largest cities, Lautoka and Suva for over twenty days. \c\cOn 31 July 2020, Fiji recorded its first death from COVID-19, a 66-year-old man who was repatriated from India. \c\cAfter over 365 days of no new cases in the community, Fiji recorded a new community case on 19 April 2021 leading to the immediate lockdown of Nadi and a second lockdown for Lautoka. This lockdown lasted almost fifty days and ended on 5 June 2021 despite COVID-19 cases still growing in the community. A similar lockdown was also introduced in the Central Division which contained Suva, Lami and Nausori in a single large containment area. The lockdown for the Lami-Nausori containment remains in place as of date. \c\cOn 30 June 2021,  Fiji confirmed 274 new cases of COVID-19. \c\cOn 11 March 2020, the first case in French Polynesia was confirmed. The first patient was Maina Sage, a member of the French National Assembly. There were 39 confirmed cases on 4 April. A ban on sales of alcohol was extended until the crisis is over. \c\cAs of 11 November 2020, 11,316 cases and more than 4,842 recoveries had been reported in French Polynesia. \c\cAs of 18 July 2020, there were 22 cases in New Caledonia. President Thierry Santa went into self-isolation on 4 April after a member of his staff tested positive. On 7 March 2021, the first nine locally-transmitted cases were reported. \c\cOn 16 October 2020, the collectivity reported its first case. On 23 October, a second test on the first case returned a negative result, making the collectivity again COVID-free. \c\cA local community outbreak began on 6 March 2021, and the number of cases has since risen to 302 by 20 March. The first death was reported on 22 March. \c\cOn 1 February 2020, the government of Kiribati put all visas from China on hold and required new arrivals to fill in a health form and travellers from countries with the coronavirus to go through a self-quarantine period. Despite not having any cases, on 28 March President Taneti Maamau declared a state of emergency. \c\cOn 10 September, the government announced it will keep the borders closed until the end of the year to keep the country free of the virus. \c\cOn 18 May 2021, a local seafarer on a ship quarantined in the port of Betio tested positive for the virus. \c\cOn 24 January 2020, the Marshall Islands issued a travel advisory that requires any visitors to the country to have spent at least 14 days in a country free of the virus. On 1 March, the ban was extended to China, Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. \c\cAs of 18 March, all incoming international travel had been temporarily suspended, as well as some intra-island flight services. \c\cThe first two positive cases of COVID-19 were confirmed at the US Army Garrison on Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA) on 29 October. They were both placed in managed quarantine. \c\cOn 29 December, the Marshall Islands became the first independent nation in the Pacific to begin its COVID-19 vaccinations. \c\cThe Federated States of Micronesia reported its first case in managed isolation on 8 January 2021. \c\cNew Zealand reported its first case on 28 February 2020 from a citizen who had arrived from Iran on 26 February. The second case was a citizen who had recently traveled to northern Italy. The first local transmission of the virus happened on 4 March in Auckland. On 29 March, New Zealand reported its first fatality, a woman in her 70s from the West Coast region. \c\cThe New Zealand Government introduced a four-level alert system on 21 March to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. On 25 March, the country moved into Alert Level 4, placing the country in a nationwide lockdown and closing its borders. While mass gatherings were banned and schools and most businesses were closed, essential services such as supermarkets, petrol stations, and health services remained open. Due to successful efforts to eliminate the pandemic within New Zealand's borders, the alert level system was progressively lowered to Level 3 on 27 April and Level 2 on 13 May, with lockdown restrictions and social distancing measures being eased at each stage. On 9 June, New Zealand entered into Alert level 1, where remaining restrictions on economic activities and daily life were eliminated but the country's borders remained closed to most international travellers. \c\cOn 4 May, the country marked the first day without the reports of any new case of COVID-19, a month after the country announced lockdown. By 31 May, there was only one active case with a total of 1,504 (1,154 confirmed and 350 probable) cases, 1,481 recoveries, and 22 deaths. By 8 June, that last active case had recovered. Following 24 consecutive days of no new cases, two new cases resulting from overseas travel were reported on 16 June. On 11 August, four cases were reported in Auckland, making the first reported community transmissions after 102 days. \c\cAs of 23 July 2021, New Zealand has reported 2,855 cases (2,499 confirmed and 356 probable cases), with 80 active cases. In addition, 2,749 people have recovered and 26 people have died. As of 23 July 2021, no cases have been reported in the associated state Niue and the dependent territories of Tokelau and the Ross Dependency (see below).[citation needed]\c\cOn 5 June 2021, the first positive PCR test result in the Cook Islands was obtained, but it was determined to be a non-infectious historical case. \c\cAs of 7 June 2021, there have been no cases in Niue. As a precautionary measure, the government has banned visitors from highly affected countries. From 24 March 2021, travellers from Niue can resume quarantine free travel into New Zealand. Niue is beginning their vaccination campaign the week beginning 31 May 2021. \c\cAs of 7 June 2021, there have been no cases in Tokelau. As a precautionary measure, boats arriving from affected countries have been banned from landing. On 19 March, all incoming travel was suspended, except for Tokelauans. \c\cOn 19 July 2021, the Royal New Zealand Navy warship HMNZS Wellington delivered 120 vials of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to Tokelau's Nukunonu atoll, which is sufficient to vaccinate 720 people. Tokelau's population was 1,499 according to the 2016 Census. \c\cPalau began implementing border controls early on. The President of Palau Thomas Remengesau Jr. issued an executive order suspending all charter flights from China, Macau, and Hong Kong from 1–29 February 2020. By March, the country's borders were closed. \c\cThe order also quarantined all non-citizens who recently entered the country for fourteen days. \c\cPalauans began receiving COVID-19 vaccines in 2021. As a signatory of the Compact of Free Association with the United States, Palau has received vaccines from Operation Warp Speed. \c\cOn 31 May 2021, the first case was confirmed. \c\cOn 20 March 2020, the first case in Papua New Guinea was confirmed. \c\cSwabs were taken and sent to the Medical Research Institute in Goroka for testing. Three announcements followed. First the Health Minister Jelta Wong declared a probable case, and Prime Minister James Marape followed up by declaring the result as negative. Further tests were conducted and the prime minister confirmed the positive result for COVID-19. Police Minister Bryan Kramer then stated on Facebook that the inconsistent results were due to faulty test equipment, and that requests had been made for further testing to be conducted in Melbourne. As of 19 November 2020, Papua New Guinea had 602 cases, 585 recoveries and 7 deaths. \c\cThe Autonomous Region of Bougainville's confirmed its first case of the COVID-19 pandemic on Friday, 7 August 2020, in Arawa, Bougainville. \c\cThere are two COVID-19 cases in Samoa that were confirmed in November 2020. \c\cThe first case of COVID-19 in the Solomon Islands was confirmed on 3 October 2020. \c\cWhile the epicenter of COVID-19 in the USA lies in the contiguous 48 states, cases and outbreaks have been reported in the country's Oceanic jurisdictions. The state of Hawaii has by far the most coronavirus cases in the region, followed up by the territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. \c\cOn 9 November 2020, American Samoa reported its first three cases. \c\cAs of 28 August 2020, the US territory of Guam has had 1,287 confirmed cases of the virus, 488 recoveries, and ten deaths. \c\cThe first case was reported on 6 March 2020, and the first death was on 30 March. \c\cIn response to the initial spike in coronavirus cases, Governor David Ige issued a state-wide lockdown, which lasted from 24 March to 30 April. After another spike occurred a few months later, a second lockdown was issued from 27 August to 9 September. It was then extended until 24 September. \c\cAs of 22 January 2021[update], the US state of Hawaii had 24,870 cases, 332 deaths and 1,647 hospitalizations. The center of the outbreak is on the island of Oahu, where most Hawaii residents live. Cases have also been reported on Hawaii Island, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kauai. No cases have been reported on Niʻihau, Kahoʻolawe and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. \c\cOut of all 50 states, Hawaii has the least amount of deaths per capita. It also ranks second in least cases per capita, falling only behind Vermont. \c\cAs of 2 November 2020, the islands confirmed 96 coronavirus cases and two deaths. \c\cOn 11 November 2020, Vanuatu recorded its first COVID case by a man who tested positive after returning from the United States via Auckland and Sydney. \c\cAs of 18 January 2021, there have been no cases. The government has, however, declared a national emergency as a preventive measure, suspending all but one weekly flight to the country and instituting a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals. \c\cOn 27 March 2020, Prime Minister Pohiva Tu\'i\'onetoa announced that the country would be under a lock-down 29 March – 5 April. \c\cAs of 18 January 2021, there have been no cases in the country. As a precautionary measure, various travel and quarantining restrictions have been put in place. Cruise ships and yachts have also been banned from docking in the country. \c\cCirca 26 March 2020, the acting governor general declared a state of emergency. \c\cAs of 18 January 2021, there have been no cases in the country. As a precautionary measure, visitors will not be allowed to land without first undergoing 14 days of isolation in a third-party state. \c\cAs of 18 January 2021, there have been no cases in the Pitcairn Islands. As a precautionary measure, all passenger services to the islands have been suspended. The territory's entire population was vaccinated in May 2021, with vaccines that arrived via ship from New Zealand. \c\cDaily cases for the most infected Oceania countries:
Since the 1960s, the issue of use of Native American and First Nations names for sports teams or mascots has been the subject of increasing public controversy in the United States and Canada. This has been a period of rising indigenous civil rights movements, and Native Americans and their supporters object to the use of images and names they consider derogatory. They have conducted numerous protests and tried to educate the public on this issue. \c\cIn response since the 1970s, an increasing number of secondary schools have retired such Native American names and mascots. Changes accelerated in 2020, following public actions related to issues of institutional racism and nationally covered cases of police misconduct. National attention has been focused on the prominent use of names and images by professional franchises including the Washington Football Team (Redskins until July 2020) and the Cleveland Indians (which decided to change their name after the 2021 season). In Canada, the  Edmonton Eskimos have become the Edmonton Elks. Each such change at the professional level has been followed by changes of school teams; for instance, 29 changed their names between August and December 2020. But the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) says some 1,900 schools in 1,025 school districts still have caricature tribal mascots. \c\cThe issue has often been reported in the media only in terms of Native American individuals being affected by the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances. This reduces the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. It prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate such practices. Social science research has shown that sports mascots and images are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects in society. A 2020 analysis of this research indicates only negative effects; those psychologically detrimental to Native American students and to non-Native persons by promoting negative stereotypes and prejudicial ideas of Native Americans and undermining inter-group relations. Based on such research showing negative effects, more than 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts, have adopted resolutions stating that such use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping; it promotes misunderstanding and prejudice that contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans. \c\cDefenders of mascots often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being strong, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals. Defenders of the status quo also state that the issue is not important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than "political correctness", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. \c\cThe NCAI and over 1,500 national Native organizations and advocates have called for a ban on all Native imagery, names, and other appropriation of Native culture in sports. The joint letter included over 100 Native-led organizations, as well as tribal leaders and members of over 150 federally recognized tribes, reflecting their consensus that Native mascots are harmful. Use of such imagery and terms has declined, but at all levels of American and Canadian sports it remains fairly common. Former Representative Deb Haaland (D-New Mexico), approved in March 2021 as the first Indigenous Secretary of the Interior, has long advocated for teams to change such mascots. \c\cEuropean Americans have had a history of "playing Indian" that dates back to the colonial period. In the 19th century, fraternal organizations such as the Tammany Societies and the Improved Order of Red Men adopted the words and material culture of Native Americans in part to establish an aboriginal identity, while ignoring the dispossession and conquest of indigenous peoples. This practice spread to youth groups, such as the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) (in particular, the Order of the Arrow) and many summer camps. University students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted Indian names and symbols for their sports teams, as traditional Native American life was imagined by European Americans. \c\cProfessional team nicknames had similar origins. In professional baseball the team that is now the Atlanta Braves was founded as the Boston Red Stockings in 1871; becoming the Boston Braves in 1912. Their owner, James Gaffney, was a member of New York City's political machine, Tammany Hall. It was nominally formed to honor Tamanend, a chief of the Lenape, then known as the Delaware. The team that moved to become the Washington Redskins in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves; both the football and baseball teams played at Braves Field. After moving to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a "red" identifier while retaining the Braves "Indian Head" logo. While defenders of the Redskins sometimes say the name honored coach William Henry Dietz, who claimed Native American heritage, the use of Native American names and imagery by this NFL team began in 1932 - before Dietz was hired in 1933. \c\cThe Cleveland Indians\' name originated from a request by club owner Charles Somers to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the "Naps", following the departure of their star player Nap Lajoie after the 1914 season. The name "Indians" was chosen. It was a nickname previously applied to the old Cleveland Spiders baseball club during the time when Louis Sockalexis, a member of the Penobscot tribe of Maine, played for Cleveland. The success of the Boston Braves in the 1914 World Series may have been another reason for adopting an Indian mascot. The version that the team is named to honor Sockalexis, as the first Native American to play Major League Baseball, cannot be verified from historical documents. According to a 21st-century account, the contemporary news stories reporting the new name in 1915 make no mention of Sockalexis, but do make numerous insulting references to Native Americans. \c\cThe stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures. The government-sponsored boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries separated young Native Americans from their families in an effort to assimilate them to the mainstream and educate them as European Americans. As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland (Anishinaabe) and David E. Wilkins (Lumbee), both professors of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota: \c\cIn the 1940s, the NCAI created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports. The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the Braves and the Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people and demean their traditions and rituals. "Often citing a long-held myth by non-Native people that "Indian" mascots "honor Native people," American sports businesses such as the NFL's Washington \'Redskins\' and Kansas City \'Chiefs\', MLB's Cleveland \'Indians\' and Atlanta \'Braves\', and the NHL's Chicago Black Hawks, continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were commonplace."\c\cSeveral of the founders of the American Indian Movement, including Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest team names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism. By placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, this continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism. \c\cNative mascots are among the larger context of cultural appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights. This encompasses all instances when non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. Scholars contend that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. The use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots has been characterized as contributing to the marginalization of the people in the larger culture. While consultation with other minorities on major projects has improved, decisions affecting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, have been made while excluding Native concerns. \c\cIssues related to misunderstanding of Native American legal status have also arisen in cases of foster care or adoption of Native American children. Among these is what is known as the Baby Veronica case, in which a child was adopted by a white family without the consent of her father, an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation. Federal legislation has been passed to strengthen the priority of tribes in determining the care of their children, as often extended family take over care when needed. \c\cNot all Native Americans totally oppose mascots. Steven Denson (Chickasaw), a professor at Southern Methodist University, has said that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner. He says: \c\cThe NCAI has recognized the right of individual tribes to establish relationships with teams that allow the latter to retain tribal names. For instance, the Spokane Indians, a minor league baseball team, has established a relationship with the Spokane tribe. It has abandoned Native American imagery that it had used when the team was founded in 1903. The logo is an "S" and includes a feather; "Spokane" is written on the team jerseys in Salish, the Spokane language; this is also used for bilingual signs in the ballpark. The mascot is a person dressed as a trout, in reference to the tribe's tradition of fishing. Opponents of Native mascots are divided on this approach. Suzan Shown Harjo says that there is no such thing as a positive stereotype; while Stephanie Fryberg responds that even if the team's use of the name may be respectful, opposing fans may use racist gestures and references. \c\cA consensus on the damage caused by the use of Native American mascots was stated by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999:\c\cSports mascots have been cited as an example of microaggressions, the everyday insults that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to by other groups in society. \c\cIn 2005, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative effects on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. Such use also affects non-natives: by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, and preventing learning about Native American culture. The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs, traditions and values of Native Americans. In 2021, the New York Association of School Psychologists reiterated the APA position on Native mascots in its position statement advocating the inclusion of Indigenous persons in educational programs regarding diversity. \c\cSimilar resolutions have been adopted by the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport, the American Sociological Association, the American Counseling Association, and the American Anthropological Association. In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students, the National Education Association included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as a recommendation for improvement. In 2018, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced it would no longer consider teams with racist mascots, such as the Kansas City and Washington football teams, for its annual RWJF Sports Award; this recognizes organizations that contribute to public health through sports. \c\cSocial science research has substantiated the objections by Native Americans to use of such elements. In particular, studies support the view that sports mascots and images are not trivial. Stereotyping directly affects academic performance and self-esteem of Native American students, contributing to other issues faced by Native Americans, including suicide, unemployment, and poverty. European Americans exposed to mascots are more likely to believe not only that stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Two studies examining the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot found a tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group (Asian Americans), which is indicative of a "spreading effect". Exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking; demonstrating the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. A connection between stereotyping and racism of any group increasing the likelihood of stereotyping others was made by Native Americans opposing the "Indians" mascot in Skowhegan, Maine when fliers promoting the KKK were distributed in that town. \c\cThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for the end of the use of Native American names, images, and mascots in 1999. \c\cIn 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released an advisory opinion calling for an end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans. \c\cIn a report issued in 2012, a United Nations expert on Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples cited the continued use of Native American references by sports team as a part of the stereotyping that "obscures understanding of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive racially discriminatory attitudes." Justice Murray Sinclair, the head of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said in 2015 "sports teams with offensive names, such as Redskins and cartoonish aboriginal-looking mascots have no place in a country trying to come to grips with racism in its past". \c\cIn testimony at a session of the Nebraska Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in December 2020, local Tribal leaders said it's time for the 22 schools statewide to review their use of Native American names, symbols, and images for their mascots. The Nebraska School Activities Association which oversees interscholastic sports indicated support for ongoing discussion, but that they had no authority to issue statewide mandates regarding mascots. University of Nebraska Omaha Professor Edouardo Zendejas, a member of the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska, in addition to advocating legislation, sees the need to revise the history curriculum to include accurate information regarding Native Americans which is currently lacking. \c\cWhile all advocates for elimination of Native mascots agree that the practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for legal remedy based upon violation of civil rights. Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by African Americans and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The appropriation of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular African Americans, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the "noble savage" honors Native Americans. \c\cIn February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a complaint with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established. \c\cA legal claim of discrimination rests upon a group agreeing that a particular term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage who say they are not offended. This raised the difficulty of Native American identity in the United States, also an evolving controversy. \c\cIn 1992, the Central Conference of American Rabbis issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams names that promote racism, in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins. In 2001, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution to establish relationships with groups working to end the use of Indian images and symbols for sports and media mascots. In 2004, the United Methodist Church also passed a resolution condemning the use of Native American team names and sports mascots, which was highlighted in a meeting of the Black caucus of that organization in 2007. \c\cIn 2013 group of sixty-one religious leaders in Washington, D.C. sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Redskins owner Daniel Snyder stating their moral obligation to join the "Change the Mascot" movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended. \c\cMembers of the Indian Affairs Committee of the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends approved a formal statement condemning the name of the Washington football team, stating that "the NFL has violated its core principles for decades by allowing the team playing in Washington, D.C., to carry the name \'redskins,\' a racist epithet that insults millions of Native Americans. Continued use of the term encourages and perpetuates persecution, disrespect, and bigotry against Native men, women, and children". The Torch Committee, the student government organization of the Sandy Spring Friends School in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, voted to ban any apparel on the campus which includes the Redskins name, although the logo would continue to be allowed. \c\cIn a meeting March 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Central Atlantic Conference of the United Church of Christ (UCC) unanimously passed a resolution proposing that its members boycott Washington Redskins games and shun products bearing the team's logo until the team changes its name and mascot. Redskin's spokesman Tony Wyllie offered a response, saying, "We respect those who disagree with our team's name, but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen to the voice of the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Native Americans, who support our name and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community." At its annual meeting in June 2014, the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting the boycott. The resolution and boycott was passed by the National Synod of the UCC in June, 2015. \c\cGeneral public opinion is shifting towards approval of eliminating mascots, with a majority fans and younger people supporting recent changes by professional teams, as indicated by an Nielson poll conducted in March 2021. \c\cThe topic became an issue on a national level in the twenty-first century, with a hearing before the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2011, and a symposium at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in 2013. In November, 2015 President Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms. \c\cMainstream opinion reflects the function of identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. In an open letter published in 2013, Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to the players and the team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots being clearly racist. \c\cSome individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to Native American people. Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team in 2003, declared in the magazine Sports Illustrated that his team's name "symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership", and that the "Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people". \c\cHowever, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. Richard Lapchick, director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in black face at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with war paint on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?"\c\cOthers claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. Chief Illiniwek, the former athletic symbol for the University of Illinois, became the subject of protest in 1988. In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: "His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them." However, the mascot costume was not based on the clothing of the people of the Illinois Confederation, but of the Lakota people, and the first three men to portray Illiniwek were not performing authentic Native American dances, but routines they had learned from other non-Native hobbyists in the Boy Scouts of America. The Peoria people are the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy. In response to requests by those who had portrayed the mascot to bring back occasional performances, Peoria Chief John P. Froman reaffirmed the tribe's position that Chief (Illiniwek) "was not in any way representative of Peoria culture". \c\cConservative columnists often assert that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals, rather than being the authentic voice of Native Americans. \c\cMany argue there is a double standard in Native Americans being so frequently used as a sports team name or mascot when the same usage would be unthinkable for other racial or ethnic group. One current exception is the Coachella Valley High School "Arabs" which has also been the subject of controversy, resulting in the retirement of its more cartoonish representations. \c\cThe University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's "Ragin\' Cajuns" are sometimes cited as counter-arguments to those that favor change. However, rather than referring to "others" these teams employ symbols that European American cultures have historically used to represent themselves. The University of Notre Dame mascot, the Leprechaun is a mythical being that represents the Irish, which is both an ethnic and a national group. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette mascot is an anthropomorphic cayenne pepper, an ingredient frequently found in Cajun cuisine. Opponents also see this argument as a false equivalency, because it ignores systemic inequality, and serves to discount the Native American voice by saying that if one group isn\'t hurt by a particular portrayal, then no group has the right to be hurt, regardless of vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and social positions. \c\cThe U.S. Commission on Civil Rights call for an end to the use of Native American mascots was only for non-native schools. In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation or stereotyping. Examples include the Fighting Indians of the Haskell Indian Nations University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP), which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and close ties to the Lumbee tribe. The UNCP nickname is the Braves, but the mascot is a red-tailed hawk. Pembroke Middle School, which also has close ties to the Lumbee tribe, is nicknamed the Warriors. \c\cMany supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames generate millions of dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless. The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools. Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the American Indian Movement stated: "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating."\c\cA study done by the Emory University Goizueta Business School indicates that the growing unpopularity of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, losing money compared to more popular animal mascots. Writing for Forbes in response to the statewide mascot ban passed by Maine in 2019, marketing analyst Henry DeVries compares Native mascots to the retired "Frito Bandito" mascot, and argues that "offensive marketing mascots" are a bad idea financially and "on the wrong side of history."\c\cA survey conducted in 2002 by The Harris Poll for Sports Illustrated (SI) found that 81 percent of Native Americans who live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53 percent of Indians on reservations did not find the images discriminatory. The authors of the article concluded that "Although most Native American activists and tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree". According to the article, "There is a near total disconnect between Indian activists and the Native American population on this issue." An Indian activist commented on the results saying "that Native Americans\' self-esteem has fallen so low that they don\'t even know when they\'re being insulted". Soon after the SI article, a group of five social scientists experienced in researching the mascot issue published a journal article arguing against the validity of this survey and its conclusions. First they state that "The confidence with which the magazine asserts that a \'disconnect\' between Native American activists and Native Americans exists on this issue belies the serious errors in logic and accuracy made in the simplistic labeling of Native Americans who oppose mascots as \'activists.\'"\c\cA flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely upon self-identification to select the target population. In an editorial in the Bloomington Herald Times, Steve Russell (an enrolled Cherokee citizen and associate professor of criminal justice at Indiana University), states that both SI and Annenberg's samples of "self-identified Native Americans ... includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with Indians". Individuals claiming to be Native American when they are not is well known in academic research, and people claiming Indian identity specifically to gain authority in the debate over sports mascots has been criticised. \c\cAt the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at California State University, San Bernardino a survey has conducted of 400 individuals whose identity as Native American was verified, finding that 67% agreed with the statement that "Redskins" is offensive and racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive. In a 2020 study at UC Berkeley 49% of self-identified Native Americans responded that the Washington Redskins name was offensive or very offensive, while only 38% were not bothered by it. However, for study participants who were heavily engaged in their native or tribal cultures, 67% said they were offended, for young people 60%, and those with tribal affiliations 52%. \c\cWhile protests began in the 1970s, national attention to the issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought the behaviour of some fans to the attention of Native Americans. The appearance of the Atlanta Braves in the 1991 World Series and the Washington Redskins at the 1992 Super Bowl prompted the largest response because the games were played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which has a large Native American population. \c\cThe documents most often cited to justify the elimination of Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination. However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated. \c\cIndividual school districts have responded to complaints by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 when one of the teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles. Little League International has updated its 2019 rulebook to include a statement prohibiting "the use of team names, mascots, nicknames or logos that are racially insensitive, derogatory or discriminatory in nature." This decision has been applauded by the National Congress of American Indians. In February, 2019 US Lacrosse issued a position statement which said in part "As the sport’s national governing body, US Lacrosse believes that the misuse of Native American nicknames, logos, and mascots reflect and promote misleading stereotypes that are degrading and harmful to Native Americans. We will make every effort to assure that offensive or stereotypical mascots and logos will not be visible or promoted at events that US Lacrosse controls."\c\cThe National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) says there are still 1,916 schools in 1,025 school districts that use such mascots. The most common names are “Indians” (799), “Warriors” (417), “Braves” (208), “Chiefs” (181), and “Redskins” (95). \c\cLaws or school board decisions regarding team names and mascots have passed mainly in states with significant Native American populations; including California (2015), Colorado (2021), Michigan (2012), Nevada (2021), Oregon (2012), \c\cand Washington (2021). These laws allow for exemption for schools gaining approval agreements with local tribes. To date, Maine is the only state to completely ban Native American-themed mascots. However, opposing the trend for change, in response to the Tennessee Commission of Indian Affairs seeking a ban though the Tennessee Human Rights Commission, the Tennessee Senate passed a law allowing only elected officials to take any action banning school teams using American Indian names and symbols. The Wisconsin law passed in 2010 meant to eliminate "race-based nicknames, logos and mascots" was revised in 2013 making change much more difficult. In the original law, a single individual could file a complaint with the burden of proof on the school to defend their mascot, in the new law a petition signed by 10% of the school district residents is needed, and the petitioners need to prove discrimination. \c\cSecondary schools in both the United States and Canada have displayed a range of actions, with some voluntarily changing names or images, while others have kept current mascots. A 2013 analysis of a database indicated that more than 2,000 high schools have mascots that referred to Native American culture. Following a period of extended population growth in both countries over 50 years, this compares to around 3,000 schools with such names at the beginning of that period. \c\cThe Department of Educational Foundations at the University of Saskatchewan passed a resolution in 2013 calling for the retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict First Nations people. \c\cIn addition to changing their sports mascots, school boards in Ontario in 2016 were considering a ban on students wearing any articles bearing offensive names or logos, whether related to professional or local teams. \c\cSince the early 21st century, the Nepean Redskins Football Club, a minor league youth team operating for 35 years in Ottawa, Ontario, had been asked to change its name. In 2013 Ian Campeau (Ojibway), a musician and activist in Ottawa, filed a human rights complaint against the team on behalf of his five-year-old daughter. Campeau said, "How are they going to differentiate the playing field from the school yard? What's going to stop them from calling my daughter a redskin in the school yard? That's as offensive as using the n-word." Assembly of First Nations National Chief Shawn Atleo said he supported this suit because the word "Redskin" is "offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate. The team changed its name to the "Nepean Eagles" for the 2014 season; it was chosen from 70 suggestions submitted. Niigaan Sinclair (Anishinaabe), a writer and assistant professor at the University of Manitoba, applauded the team's action. He contrasted it with the insistence at the time of Daniel Snyder, owner of the professional Washington Redskins team in the US, in keeping that name.  (Note: The Washington team did change its name in 2020.)\c\cIn 2017, the Swift Current Indians baseball club changed its name to the Swift Current 57's. \c\cIn January 2020 the school board of Killingly High School in Connecticut, had a Republican majority. It voted to reinstate the team's "Redmen" mascot. The vote reflects a generational split, as the new school board members represent mainly older alumni in the town. Current students of the public high school, its faculty and Native Americans supported dropping the Redmen mascot. A senior active in the debate said, “We look racist...this is not what I want our school to be known for.” The mascot had been removed after the Nipmuc Tribal Council objected to it, saying that no Native mascots were flattering to Native Americans . In October 2019, "Red Hawks" had been chosen as the new mascot, but after a contentious meeting in December, the School Board decided the school would have no mascot. Renewed discussion of whether the mascot is offensive had begun in June 2019, prompted by a student initiative. The name change was used as a wedge issue in the 2019 municipal elections; there was a record turnout and several Republican victories. \c\cThis issue was dealt with differently in Maine, where there was also support for changing such offensive names. In Skowhegan, Maine, where the area high school sports team was named the "Indians", the Penobscot Nation and the ACLU of Maine urged that it be changed. In March 2019 the local School Board voted to eliminate the mascot at Skowhegan Area High School. This was the last school in the state to retire this name. Similarly, at several other schools with sports teams named "Warriors", Native American imagery was removed. By early March 2019, in independent actions through the state, Maine was the first state to eliminate indigenous mascots in all secondary schools. In keeping with this movement, a bill to ban Native American mascots in all public schools passed the Maine House of Representatives and Senate, and was signed into law by Governor Janet Mills in May 2019. This was another first for the state. \c\cDue to media coverage of the controversy over the prominent Washington Redskins, high schools with the sports teams named Redskins have received particular attention across the country. Three have a majority of Native American students. Advocates for the name suggest that, because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves, it is not insulting. But, the principal of Red Mesa High School, a Native American-majority school in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created."\c\cSome high schools have established consulting relationships with tribes in order to retain Native names and to improve their portrayal of Native tribes and cultures. For instance, Arapahoe High School, located in Centennial, Colorado, negotiated with the Arapaho Tribe of Wyoming and now uses a logo provided by them. The school agreed to the tribe's request not to have the logo image placed on the gym floor, or on any article of clothing. The logo is not used on team uniforms, but sometimes has been used in other ways at the school. The agreement includes tribal participation in school events. Strasburg High School in Strasburg, Colorado, whose sports team mascot was known as the "Indians", worked out a similar agreement with the Northern Arapahoe Tribe. \c\cThe city of Salamanca, New York lies within the boundaries of the Allegany Indian Reservation of the Seneca Nation of Indians. They are descendants of the westernmost of the historic Six Nations of the powerful Iroquois League, also known as Haudenosaunee, which dominated much of the territory of New York south of the Great Lakes and west of the Hudson River. Some 26% of the Salamanca Central High School students are Native American (primarily Seneca), and its sports teams were called the "Warriors". \c\cIn 2001, the commissioner of the New York State Education Department sent a letter to all New York school boards calling for the elimination of Native American mascots, in response to it have been an issue of controversy, as noted. The Seneca Nation Tribal Council responded with support for the Warrior imagery in the Salamanca school. Other members of the community also wanted to retain it. Since the late 20th century, keeping the Warrior sports identity has resulted in negotiations in Salamanca between the Seneca and non-Seneca populations and actions that have raised general awareness of true Seneca culture. For example, the school logo was changed to accurately depict a Seneca man; this replaced a stereotypical Plains Indian warrior image that had been used prior to 1978. \c\cSome college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots. Stanford University had "The Stanford Indian" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972. Today Stanford's athletic team identity is built around the "Stanford Cardinal", reflecting the primary school color that has been used from the earliest days, while the unofficial mascot shown on its primary logo is the Stanford Tree. Another early change was the "Saltine Warrior" that represented Syracuse University from 1931 until 1978. After a brief attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became Otto the Orange for the school color. Miami University began discussion regarding the propriety of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname to RedHawks in 1996. \c\cAlthough Dartmouth College had not used an Indian mascot for many years, Yale University printed a program for the 2016 game commemorating its 100th game against Dartmouth showing historical program covers featuring depictions of Native Americans that are now viewed as racist. \c\cThe Florida State Seminoles of Florida State University use names and images associated with the Seminole people.  The use is officially sanctioned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida even though the NCAA "continues to believe the stereotyping of Native Americans is wrong."\c\cThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to 31 colleges in 2005, for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice. Nineteen teams were cited as having potentially "hostile or abusive" names, mascots, or images, that would be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited from hosting tournaments. Subsequently, all of the colleges previously using Native American imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained official support from individual tribes based upon the principle of tribal sovereignty. \c\cSan Diego State University (SDSU) was not cited by the NCAA in 2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe with any living descendants. However, in February 2017 the SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) supported removal of the mascot, calling its continued use "institutional racism" in its official statement to the Committee on Diversity, Equity and Outreach. A task force of students, faculty, and alumni was appointed to study the issue and make a recommendation by April, 2018. The recommendation was to keep the mascot but take steps to use only respectful references to Aztec culture, however there are few signs of this being implemented. \c\cThe Atlanta Braves remain the home of the tomahawk chop (although it began at Florida State University). The logo has changed through the years from an Indian in full headdress to an Indian with a Mohawk hairstyle and single feather (described as either laughing or shouting), then to the Braves name in script over a tomahawk. The mascot Chief Noc-A-Homa was replaced in 1986 by a baseball-headed "Homer the Brave", and in 2018 by "Blooper". \c\cThe tomahawk chop and the accompanying chant has not been without controversy. In February, 2019 after the removal of the Cleveland Indians\' Chief Wahoo logo, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said "The Braves have taken steps to take out the tomahawk chop". In October, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley, a member of the Cherokee Nation, stated his belief that the tomahawk chop and chant misrepresents Native Americans. In response to this complaint, the Atlanta Braves, in their October 9 game against the Cardinals, did not provide fans with foam tomahawks, although the music accompanying the chant was played while fans performed the arm gesture. When the Braves lost to the Cardinals 13–1, the San Francisco Bay Area Fox affiliate used the headline "Braves Scalped", drawing criticism as an example of why most Native Americans oppose the use of American Indian imagery and mascots in sports. The station soon apologized. The team front office has stated that there will be talks with Native Americans during the off-season regarding the tomahawk chop tradition, while leaders of two tribes that once inhabited Georgia, the Cherokee and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation agree that the tradition is inappropriate. \c\cIn July 2020, Richard Sneed, the Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, released a statement about the tribe's conversations with the Braves. The statement said the EBCI believed "that candid, thoughtful conversations are crucial to educating leaders and bringing about positive change." The EBCI statement also applauded "the Braves’ willingness to engage in this effort and look forward to continuing to build the relationship the EBCI shares with them to present a model for how other professional sports teams can work with Native Nations in a respectful and constructive manner." Sneed also stated that he is not offended by the name Braves or the tomahawk chop cheer, but respects the opinion of those who feel differently. However, Sneed was still openly critical of usage of the word "Redskins" among sports teams. \c\cDuring the 2020 Atlanta Braves season, the team's Tomahawk Chop motivating slogan "Chop On" was changed to “For The A.” On July 19, 2020, the wooden "Chop On" sign which sat near the third base entrance to Truist Park was removed and replaced with a "For the A" sign. However, the usage of the Tomahawk Chop was still under review. Following discussion which between the Braves and the National Congress of American Indians during the offseason, it was also agreed that their would be no foam tomahawks would be handed out to fans during at least the home season opener. The death of Hank Aaron has renewed suggestions that the team change its nickname to "Hammers" in his honor. \c\cNative American rights advocate Suzan Shown Harjo (Cheyenne and Hodulgee Muscogee) says the Chicago Blackhawks have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams using Native imagery because hockey is not a cultural force on the level of football. But she says national American Indian organizations have called for an end to all Indian-related mascots and that she found the hockey team's name and Indian head symbol to be offensive. "It lacks dignity," she said. "There's dignity in a school being named after a person or a people. There's dignity in a health clinic or hospital. There's nothing dignified in something being so named (that is used for) recreation or entertainment or fun." The National Congress of American Indians also opposes the Blackhawks\' logo, as it does all Native American mascots. Members of Black Hawk's family have spoken out opposing the use of Black Hawk as a mascot and caricature logo. \c\cIn 2019, the American Indian Center of Chicago ended all ties to the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation, stating they will no longer affiliate "with organizations that perpetuate stereotypes through the use of "Indian" mascots." The AIC said that they "previously held a relationship with the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation with the intention of educating the general public about American Indians and the use of logos and mascots. The AIC, along with members of the community have since decided to end this relationship" and stated that "going forward, AIC will have no professional ties with the Blackhawks, or any other organization that perpetuates harmful stereotypes."\c\cWhile stating they will retain their name after the decision by the Washington Football Team to change theirs, the Blackhawks did agree to ban Native American headdresses at home games in recognition of their status as sacred symbols. Before the ban was enacted, there had in fact been incidents where some Blackhawk fans wore headdresses. After the Cleveland Indians announced in December 2020 that the team would change their name after the 2021 season, new CEO Danny Wirtz reinterated that the Blackhawks would not change. \c\cThe Chi-Nations Youth Council (CNYC), an Indigenous youth organization in Chicago, said in 2020, "The Chicago Blackhawks name and logo symbolizes a legacy of imperialism and genocide." "As statutes  [sic] of invaders, slave holders, and white supremacists fall across the nation so too should the images and language of the savage and dead \'Indians\'." CNYC also said "As social consciousness has grown over the past decades so has the Blackhawks performative gestures of buying their reprieve from those willing to sell out the health and humanity of our future generations."\c\cThe Cleveland Indians acknowledged on July 3, 2020 that they are ready to discuss changing their team name in the wake of news that the Washington Redskins would be reviewing theirs. \c\cOn March 21, 2018, the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York enacted a ban on Chief Wahoo being featured on future Hall of Fame plaques. This ban immediately went into effect with new Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Jim Thome, who was inducted as an Indian without Chief Wahoo's image. Starting in the 2019 season, the Chief Wahoo logo did not appear on uniforms nor on stadium signs, although it will still be licensed for team merchandise within the Cleveland area. However, Chief Wahoo's image was banned being sold on the team's website. Local groups say they will continue to advocate for a change of the team name, and object to the continued sale outside the stadium of merchandise with the Wahoo image. \c\cChief Wahoo is part of an exhibit at the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia maintained by Ferris State University in Michigan. For Dr. David Pilgrim, a sociology professor at Ferris State and an expert in racial imagery, the symbol is a "red Sambo" that hardly differs from the caricatures of blacks popular in the Jim Crow era in which Wahoo was created, when such depictions of minority races were popularly used to inflame prejudice and justify discriminatory laws and behavior. Pilgrim explains how the exaggerated features serve their discriminatory purpose by emphasizing the differences of the depicted race, thereby reinforcing the idea that the caricatured race is inferior. \c\cOn December 14, 2020, the team owner Paul Dolan announced that the process of changing the name will begin. The team will continue to play as the Indians for the 2021 season while a new name is selected and other decisions necessary for rebranding are implemented. The team announced that for the 2021 season, face paint and headdresses will be banned from Progressive Field. \c\cIn 1963 the Kansas City Chiefs adopted their name when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated. "Chiefs" was not a direct reference to Native Americans, but to Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle who was instrumental in bringing the Texans to Kansas City, Missouri. Bartle earned his nickname as founder of a Boy Scouts honor camping society, Tribe of Mic-O-Say, in which he was "Chief" Lone Bear. Bartle had been known by the nickname as a prominent Kansas City businessman, so it soon became the unavoidable name for the team. In spite of attempts to downplay Native American associations, fan behavior such as the tomahawk chop and wearing face paint and headdresses drew criticism. \c\cIn 1989 the Chiefs switched from Warpaint, a Pinto horse ridden by a man in a feathered headdress, to their current mascot K. C. Wolf. Warpaint returned in 2009, but is ridden by a cheerleader. \c\cThe Chiefs drew little attention compared to other teams until 2013, when photographs of fans in "Indian" dress appeared in the Kansas City Star. In 2014 the Star reported that the team's management planned discussions with some Native American groups to find a non-confrontational way to eliminate, or at least reduce, offensive behavior. Achieving greater visibility by reaching the playoffs in 2016, Native Americans at Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas are asking the Chiefs to stop behavior that invokes stereotypes, such as wearing headdresses and doing the "tomahawk chop". In a statistical analysis of social media comments (tweets) leading up to Super Bowl LIV, researchers found many more negative terms associated with the Kansas City team compared to San Francisco. While both teams were referred to in terms related to violence, the Chiefs were much more likely to receive insults related to intelligence (being called stupid) and many insults were specific references to negative Native American stereotypes, such as drunkenness ("firewater"), and being inbred or extinct. The conclusion drawn was support for Natives being insulted, rather than honored, by Native American mascots. \c\cOn August 20, 2020 the Chiefs announced that headdresses and Native American style face paint would be banned at Arrowhead Stadium. The ban officially went into effect during the 2020 season opener on September 10, 2020. The Tomahawk chop also underwent a subtle modification, as Arrowhead-based cheerleaders are now required to lead the chop with a closed fist rather than the traditional open palm. While fans said they will not change their behavior, a Native activist said that the chop should be eliminated entirely. Their appearance of in Super Bowl LV focuses attention on the Chiefs in 2021 to follow the example set by Washington, Cleveland, and many high schools. A group of two dozen Native Americans from Florida, Kansas City and elsewhere protested in front of the stadium on game day. \c\cSeveral teams changed when they moved to other cities, while others went out of business. The Atlanta Hawks were originally the Tri-Cities Blackhawks (using an "Indian" logo), and the Clippers were originally the Buffalo Braves. \c\cThe United States national rugby league team was known as the Tomahawks until 2015, when USA Rugby League replaced the American National Rugby League as the sport's governing body in the U.S. and chose the simpler Hawks as the new name for the team. \c\cIn part because they did not use any native imagery, the Edmonton Eskimos were rarely mentioned with regard to the controversy. However Natan Obed, the President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Canada's national Inuit organization, has stated that "Eskimo is not only outdated, it is now largely considered a derogatory term" and is a "relic of colonial power". The editorial board of the Toronto Star sees a name change as the inevitable result of social evolution, and reflecting respect for indigenous peoples. However, after a year of considering alternatives, the team decided in February 2020 to retain the name finding no consensus among Native groups including the Inuit. \c\cHowever, on July 16, 2020, it was reported that the club will be dropping the \'Eskimos\' name. On July 21, the team officially retired the name, and temporarily began using "Edmonton Football Team" and "EE Football Team" until a new name is decided.  On June 1, 2021, it was formally announced that the new team name would be the Edmonton Elks. \c\cThe Golden State Warriors eliminated Native American imagery as the team relocated. Originally the Philadelphia Warriors (1946-1962), their logo was a cartoon Native American dribbling a basketball. When they moved to San Francisco, the logo became a Native American headdress (1962-1968). \c\cWhile playing as the Washington Redskins, the Washington Football Team received the most public attention due to the prominence of the team being located in the nation's capital, and the name itself being defined in current dictionaries of American English as "usually offensive", "disparaging", "insulting", and "taboo". Native American opposition to the name began in the early 1970s with letters to the owner of the team and the editors of The Washington Post. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, and again when the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills was held in Minnesota. Those officially censuring and/or demanding the name be changed include more than 80 organizations that represent various groups of Native Americans. \c\cWhen the Redskins participated in "Blackout Tuesday" on June 2, 2020, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded "Want to really stand for racial justice? Change your name." Subsequently, Mayor Muriel Bowser interrelated her position that the name is an impediment to the team's return to a stadium in the District of Columbia. A statue of the team's founder, George Preston Marshall has been removed from the grounds of RFK Stadium after being spray painted with the words "Change the Name". The management of the stadium stated that the statue would not return, and that its removal was long overdue. In the following week, the team removed all mention of Marshall from the team's other facilities and website. \c\cIn July 2020, amidst the removal of many names and images as part of the George Floyd protests, a group of investors worth $620 billion wrote letters to major sponsors Nike, FedEx and PepsiCo encouraging pressure on the Redskins to change their name. FedEx called on the team to change its name on July 2, 2020. The same day, Nike removed Redskins apparel from its website. On July 3, the league and the franchise announced that it was "undergoing a thorough review of the team name." On July 7, it was acknowledged that the Redskins were not in contact with a group of Native Americans who petitioned the NFL to force a name change and that Redskins head coach Ron Rivera also stated the team wanted to continue “honoring and supporting Native Americans and our Military.” On July 13, 2020 the team made an official statement that their review would result in the retirement of the Redskins name and logo. On July 23, 2020 the team announced that they will be called the Washington Football Team with a block "W" logo for the 2020 season. Team president Jason Wright announced in July 2021 that the new name will not include any ties to Native Americans, including the name "Warriors"; research having shown that anything other than a clean break with the past is a slippery slope. A new name will be selected in early 2022. \c\cIn addition to the behavior of the teams that have Native American names or mascots, their rivals often invoke racist stereotypes. In December 2013 when the Washington Redskins played the Kansas City Chiefs an employee of a Sonic Drive-In in Missouri placed a message outside that used scalping, reservations and whiskey to disparage the "Redskins". It was quickly removed with the owner's apologies. A rubber severed "Indian" head impaled on a knife has been used by a sports fan in Philadelphia to taunt rival teams with Native American mascots. There have been a number of incidents of rival high school teams displaying banners or signs referencing the Trail of Tears, which have been criticized for both insensitivity and ignorance of history. Although the Central Michigan Chippewas have the support of the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation of Michigan, a student at rival Western Michigan University designed a T-shirt showing a Native American behind bars with the legend "Caught a Chippewa about a week ago". It was quickly condemned by both university presidents, who agreed that anyone wearing the shirt at a game would be ejected. In spite of the University of North Dakota changing their nickname from the Fighting Sioux to the Fighting Hawks, students at rival North Dakota State University (NDSU) continue to chant "Sioux suck shit" whenever their football team makes a first down. The NDSU president, along with the presidents of the student body and faculty senates, have called for an end to the practice, which they describe as hateful, and coming from a misplaced sense of tradition. Some NDSU fans also wear T-shirts with graphics depicting variations on the "Sioux suck" theme. \c\cTo further complicate this controversy, many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending upon the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the Cleveland Indians\' Chief Wahoo; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as Redskins or Squaws; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures, such as the tomahawk chop. \c\cThe practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response to the controversy. A local example is Washington High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Many Native American images have been removed, and the "Warriors" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a "circle of courage" logo with eagle feathers and has also "updated" the murals of Chief Hollow Horn Bear in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at Sinte Gleska University in Mission, stated: "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images. \c\cNative American names and images are used by teams in other countries, generally those playing American-style sports and copying the imagery of American teams. Several are in countries that also have a tradition of Native American hobbyists often associated with the popularity of the stories written by German author Karl May. In South America there are a number of teams that reference the Guaraní people. In Brazil, these teams may be referred to using the derogatory term bugre.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cAustralian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March, and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March. Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020, and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks. Social distancing rules were imposed on 21 March, and state governments started to close "non-essential" services. "Non-essential services" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories. The number of new cases initially grew sharply, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22 March, and started falling at the beginning of April to under 20 cases per day by the end of the month. \c\cA second wave of infections emerged in Victoria during May and June 2020, which was attributed to an outbreak at a Melbourne quarantine hotel. The second wave, though largely localised to Melbourne, was much more widespread and deadlier than the first; at its peak, the state had over 7,000 active cases. Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown which eventually lasted almost four months. The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020. Further cluster outbreaks occurred in late 2020 and mid-2021, with several brief "snap lockdowns" announced in certain states to contain their spread, particularly as novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 arrived in Australia. In response to an outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, almost half of Australia's population and most major cities were in lockdown in early July 2021. \c\cAs of 23 July 2021[update], Australia has reported 32,582 cases, 25,486 recoveries, and 915 deaths, with Victoria's second wave accounting for nearly 75 per cent of cases and 90 per cent of fatalities. No deaths from COVID-19 were recorded in Australia from 28 December 2020 until 13 April 2021, when one death occurred in Queensland, then none until July 2021, when four elderly New South Wales residents, and one in her fifties, died in ten days during the outbreak of Delta variant in Sydney. As of 21 July 2021[update], there have also been six deaths linked to the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine following rare adverse reactions to it, the first occurring on 15 April 2021. \c\cThe stated goal of the National Cabinet is "suppression", as opposed to "elimination", meaning continually trying to drive community transmission to zero but expecting that new outbreaks may occur. This is in contrast to the mitigation strategies implemented by most other nations. Compared to other Western countries, notably the United States and European countries, Australia's handling has been praised for its effectiveness. Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; rapid recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce during March 2020; comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the US and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks. Australia's international borders have also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of arrivals strictly controlled, for the duration of the pandemic. Although Australia's efforts to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app were not particularly effective, QR code-based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia's businesses. These apps, which are effectively required by State Governments, give government health departments the ability to reconstruct the presence and possible contacts of anyone with a supported functional mobile telephone handset visiting bars, restaurants or other venues, generally for 28 days after the visit. \c\cThe nationwide vaccination program began with the first doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine being administered in Sydney on Sunday 21 February 2021. The slow pace of the country's vaccine rollout, which fell short of its initial targets, has been criticised. \c\cThe pandemic has impacted Australia's economy, causing the first recession in 30 years with the arts sector being particularly hard hit. \c\cA novel coronavirus that caused a respiratory illness was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019, which confirmed its concern on 12 January 2020. WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. \c\cThe case fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower than that of SARS, a related disease which emerged in 2002, but its transmission has been significantly greater, leading to a much greater total death toll. \c\cThe widespread reporting of the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season in major media and social media around the world caused a significant drop in the number of tourists coming to Australia, including those from China. The absence of tourist arrivals during this time could have played a significant role in sparing Australia from the spread of COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. This is in contrast to other major cities in Europe and North America, where the early spread of the virus continued undetected until late February 2020 or early March 2020. \c\cThe following chart represents changes in net number of cases on a daily basis and is based on the number of cases reported in the Federal Government's daily reports. \c\cThe largest cluster in Australia so far in the pandemic was the Flemington/North Melbourne public housing cluster with 310 cases. The deadliest cluster in Australia was at St Basil's Homes for the Aged in Victoria, where 45 residents died. \c\cOn 1 February 2020, Australia banned the entry of foreign nationals who had been in mainland China, and ordered its own returning citizens who had been in China to self-quarantine for 14 days. The country also began to assess the relative risk of reflected transmission through third countries, and to ask travelers arriving from higher-risk countries to monitor for symptoms. Australia subsequently imposed bans on Iran (1 March), South Korea (5 March), and Italy (11 March). From 16 March, all travellers arriving in or returning to Australia were required to self-isolate for 14 days. Failure to self-isolate could result in a fine of A$11,000 to A$50,000 and a possible prison sentence, depending on the state. Cruise ships were also barred from docking in the country for 30 days. \c\cOn 20 March, Australia closed its borders to all non-residents and non-Australian citizens. With limited exceptions, a ban was imposed on Australians travelling overseas. \c\cBy late March 2020, 62% of Australia's more than 3,000 coronavirus cases were among people who had returned from overseas. From then, Australians returning from overseas were subject to two weeks compulsory quarantine in hotels. The New South Wales quarantine program was helped by 150 Australian Defence Force personnel, including 30 who were stationed at hotels. In Victoria, three private security operators were contracted to provide the security, while the other states and territories used their police resources. The states and territories carried the costs of hotel quarantine. By 19 June, since the policy came into force 81,000 people had entered Australia. Of those, 63,000 had undergone hotel quarantine, while the rest, including flight crews, international businesspeople and defence members, fell under different rules. Hotel quarantine had cost $118 million as at 19 June. \c\cInterstate border closures began on 19 March, with Tasmania imposing a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all "non-essential" travellers to the state, including returning residents. On 24 March, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory closed their borders, with all interstate arrivals being required to self-isolate for 14 days. On 11 April, Queensland banned interstate arrivals, with only Queensland residents and those granted \'exemption\' being allowed entry. On 8 July, the Victorian and NSW governments, jointly closed their common border, following a large spike in cases in parts of Melbourne.[citation needed]\c\cWith the spike in coronavirus infections in Victoria linked to the hotel quarantine program, a judicial inquiry into the program in Victoria was called on 2 July; and all international arrivals into Melbourne were suspended. On 9 July, other state and territory leaders agreed to reduce flights and arrivals into Australia from 8,000 to 4,000 a week to ease the burden on the hotel quarantine system. States started to charge travellers for hotel quarantine. In mid-September, the states agreed to increased the number of arrivals to 6,000 a week, to help in the repatriation of tens of thousands of Australians stranded overseas. By 15 December 2020, 39,000 Australians were registered with the government as stranded, with more unregistered (as the government advised registration only for those needing assistance to return). After repeated flight cancellations and without access to government-provided health care or welfare benefits, many families reported being forced to overstay visas, and burn down savings and incur debt to pay for accommodations. Having to pay thousands of dollars for return tickets and mandatory hotel quarantine, some chose to send one family member back in order to resume work and earn enough money to pay the way of the rest. Between 13 March and 15 July 2020, more than 357,000 people returned to Australia. As of 15 January 2021[update] over 37,000 Australians were stranded abroad. On 29 January 2021, the ability of Australians stuck overseas to return was further hampered when the UK banned direct flights from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the possible spread of the South African COVID-19 variant. Both Etihad and Emirates airlines are UAE based. \c\cAn overnight curfew was introduced in Victoria on 2 August 2020, extended on 13 September and suspended on 27 September. A Supreme Court judge has ruled the curfew was legal. \c\cOn 25 January 2021, Health Minister Greg Hunt suspended Australia's travel bubble with New Zealand for a period of 72 hours after New Zealand authorities confirmed a community transmission case in the country's Northland Region. On 28 January the suspension of the travel bubble was extended for 3 more days. \c\cOn 5 February 2021, National Cabinet decided to increase the number of international passenger arrivals to Australia as from mid-February. New South Wales will return to a weekly cap of 3,010 people and Queensland to 1,000. South Australia has increased by 40 people a week to 530, and Victoria by almost 200 to 1,310. Western Australia will remain at a reduced arrival cap. The total national weekly cap of 4,100 will increase to approximately 6,300. \c\cOn 11 February 2021, the airline Cathay Pacific decided that, excepting Sydney, from 20 February it would cease all flights to Australia until the end of the month. This was in response to the Hong Kong government's new COVID rules requiring Hong Kong based aircrew to quarantine for 14 days on return to HK. \c\cOn 24 February, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria suspended their travel bubble arrangements with New Zealand in response to a recent community outbreak in South Auckland. As a result, New Zealanders traveling to these states would have to enter quarantine. \c\cOn 2 March 2021, the general closure of Australia's international borders to travel was extended another three months to 17 June 2021. Australia's borders have now already been closed for 12 months. The border could reopen earlier if the closure was "no longer needed." Despite the border closure, between 25 March and 31 December 2020 over 105,000 exemptions were approved for people to leave Australia. \c\cBy April 2021, there were still about 40,000 Australians stranded overseas by the high cost of plane tickets and the cap on the number of people in the quarantine system, which was criticised for special treatment of sportspeople and celebrities. Australia was chastised by the UN Human Rights Committee, which requested a prompt return for the country's citizens; the government has given out A$29 million to about 3,900 stranded people as a last resort, and operated 28 repatriation flights. \c\cOn 23 April, Prime Minister Morrison announced that travellers to Australia from "high risk" countries, in particular India, were to be reduced by 30 per cent. This decision was based on an increase in positive results for COVID-19 among travellers from India at the Howard Springs, Northern Territory quarantine facility. Travel to such countries was also to be limited. \c\cIn general, the border restrictions had had broad public support, though critics suggested safety could be improved by constructing more outdoor quarantine centres rather than relying on urban hotels, which had suffered 16 leaks to the surrounding communities as of April 2021, out of about half a million quarantined. The government does not have a ordered queue of returnees; outside of repatriation flights, the order in which people return is determined by commercial airlines, resulting in Australian citizens making up fewer than half of incoming travellers in February 2021. \c\cOn 27 April, due to the "record-breaking" outbreak of COVID-19 in India, with 323,000 new infections that day after five days with new cases peaking above 350,000, and another 2,771 COVID deaths there, the Federal Government "paused" all incoming flights from India until at least 15 May. The pause includes repatriation flights into the Howard Springs quarantine facility near Darwin with more than 9,000 Australians in India at this date wanting to come to Australia. \c\cLate on 30 April, the Federal Government announced a ban on Australian citizens and permanent residents in India from entering Australia via any route. These measures came into effect on 3 May and would remain in force until 15 May. Breaches would be subject to punishment under the Biosecurity Act 2015, with penalties for breaches including up to five years\' jail, a fine of A$66,600,or both. Foreign Minister Marise Payne reported that 57% of positive cases in quarantine had come from India in April, compared with 10% in March. Unlike the prior travel bans imposed in 2020 on Iran, South Korea and Italy, and the interstate travel bans regularly imposed as outbreaks occur, the move was branded as racist by some critics, and a potential breach of international human rights law. On 3 May 2021 the government announced that it would review this decision earlier than originally intended, possibly within the same week. There were about 9,000 Australian citizens in India, of whom 650 were considered vulnerable. In contrast, the resident population of Australia on 17 May 2021 which was protected by these measures was projected to be 25,775,294, or 2,864 Australian residents for every one Australian citizen in India and 39,654 for every one Australian citizen in India considered vulnerable. \c\cOn 26 June 2021 at 8:30pm (AEST), due to multiple outbreaks across Australia of the Delta variant, New Zealand immediately paused trans-Tasman travel with Australia until 10pm (AEST) on 30 June. \c\cOn 2 July, National Cabinet decided that from 14 July, the number of airline passengers allowed into Australia would be capped at 3,035, half what it was before. The Victorian, Western Australian and Queensland governments, had been advocating a large decrease in incoming passenger numbers because of the highly infectious nature of the Delta COVID strain. More repatriation flights to the Howard Springs quarantine facility were to be organised in response. \c\cThe states will receive passengers thus:\c\cSydney: 1,505\c\cPerth: 265\c\cAdelaide: 265\c\cMelbourne: 500\c\cBrisbane: 650\c\cOn 13 March 2020, the National Cabinet, a form of national crisis cabinet akin to a war cabinet, was created following a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). This is the first time such a cabinet has been proclaimed since World War II, and the only time in Australian history that a crisis cabinet has included state and territory leaders. The cabinet consists of the premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories and meets weekly during the crisis. At its first meeting on 13 March, the National Cabinet announced that gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled from 15 March. Schools, universities, workplaces, public transport and airports were not included in this recommendation. Prime Minister Morrison also announced that he intended to attend a Rugby League match on 14 March; "I do still plan to go to the football on Saturday" but later decided against attending the match. \c\cOn 29 March, the Cabinet agreed to stricter limits to apply from midnight on 30 March: a limit on both indoor and outdoor gatherings of two people except weddings (5) and funerals (10), and people of the same household or family; strong guidance to all Australians is to stay home unless for necessary shopping, health care, exercise, and work and study that can\'t be done remotely; public playgrounds, skate parks and outside gyms to be closed. It was left to individual states to enforce these guidelines. They also agreed to a moratorium on evictions for six months for both commercial and residential tenancies suffering financial distress. \c\cOn 2 April 2020, the Federal government announced the temporary provision of free childcare so that people could continue working, and to prevent closure of childcare centres. The Government paid half each centre's operating costs. The free childcare ended on 12 July, and the previous Child Care Subsidy was reintroduced. \c\cOn 18 March 2020, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, after a National Security Committee meeting the previous day. The Biosecurity Act 2015 specifies that the Governor-General may declare such an emergency exists if the Health Minister (currently Greg Hunt) is satisfied that "a listed human disease is posing a severe and immediate threat, or is causing harm, to human health on a nationally significant scale". This gives the minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and evacuations. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 was declared by the Governor-General, David Hurley, under Section 475 of the Act. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, made by the Health Minister on the same day, forbids international cruise ships from entering Australian ports before 15 April 2020. \c\cA social distancing rule of four square metres (43 sq ft) per person in any enclosed space was agreed by National Cabinet on 20 March, to be implemented through State and Territory laws. On 22 March 2020, the State governments of New South Wales and Victoria imposed a mandatory closure of non-essential services, while the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia imposed border closures. \c\cOn 22 March, Morrison announced a closure of places of social gathering, including registered and licensed clubs, licensed premises in hotels and bars, entertainment venues, including but not restricted to cinemas, casinos and nightclubs and places of worship. Cafes and restaurants could remain open, but were limited to only takeaway food. Similarly, enclosed spaces for funerals and things of that nature will have to follow the strict four-square-metre rule. These measures (labelled stage 1 in anticipation of possible future measures) were effective immediately at midday, 23 March. Morrison stated that he would like schools to remain open, but parents could keep children at home if they wished to. \c\cOn 25 March 2020, the Health Minister made a second determination under the Biosecurity Act 2015, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Overseas Travel Ban Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, which "forbids Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australian territory by air or sea as a passenger". On the same day, the Prime Minister announced a further set of restrictions, labelled stage 2 restrictions, effective midnight that night. These involved mainly smaller businesses, such as nail salons and tattoo parlours, while some, such as personal training sessions, were limited to 10 people. At the same time, other gatherings were restricted, such as weddings (5 people) and funerals (10 people). \c\cAt 12:00 am on Tuesday 31 March, restrictions were announced on indoor and outdoor gatherings, which were called stage 3 by the media, although the label "stage 3" was not part of the official announcement. The new rule limited gatherings to two people, although it did not apply to members of the same household. \c\cOn 14 April the Federal government announced the "COVIDSafe" digital contact tracing app. \c\cOn 25 April 2020, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements—Public Health Contact Information) Determination 2020, made under subsection 477(1) of the Act, was signed into law by the Health Minister. The purpose of the new legislation is "to make contact tracing faster and more effective by encouraging public acceptance and uptake of COVIDSafe", COVIDSafe being the new mobile app created for the purpose. The function of the app is to record contact between any two people who both have the app on their phones when they come within 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) of each other. The encrypted data would remain on the phone for 21 days of not encountering a person logged with confirmed COVID-19. \c\cOn 3 September 2020, the human biosecurity emergency period under the Biosecurity Act 2015 was extended until 17 December. \c\cOn 25 March, the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC) was established by the Prime Minister as a strategic advisory body for the national response to the pandemic. (On 27 July 2020, the Prime Minister renamed the organisation to the "National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board" (NCC).) The NCC's role includes providing advice on public-private partnerships and coordination to mitigate the social and economic impacts of the pandemic. \c\cOn 29 March, Prime Minister Morrison announced in a press conference following a National Cabinet meeting that public gatherings will be limited to two people, while also urging Australians over the age of 70, Australians with chronic illness over the age of 60 and Indigenous Australians over the age of 50 to stay home and self-isolate. Morrison also clarified that there were only four acceptable reasons for Australians to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes. \c\cAustralia's first human trials of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, Novavax's NVX-CoV2373, began in Melbourne by 26 May 2020. \c\cThe Australian government entered into agreements with Pfizer/BioNTech, University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax, the University of Queensland and COVAX for the supply of vaccines. The University of Queensland vaccine was abandoned in December 2020 after trials revealed that, while it was safe, it triggered false positives on HIV tests. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer vaccine in January 2021. The Australian government ordered 10 million doses, with the first 80,000 to be delivered in February 2021, but production problems and the imposition of export controls by the European Union (EU) onto deliveries to countries outside Europe made meeting the delivery schedule problematic. \c\cThis would also affect deliveries of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which was provisionally approved by the TGA in February, and received final approval in March. Orders were reduced from 3.8 million to 1.2 million doses of this vaccine, which is manufactured in Belgium, and arrival was pushed back to March 2021. CSL Limited began manufacturing 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Melbourne in November 2020. Deliveries were expected to commence in March. The AstraZeneca vaccine could be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures of 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F), whereas the Pfizer vaccine required storage at −70 °C (−94 °F). However, concerns were raised about the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The Australian and New Zealand Society for Immunology called for a pause in its rollout, as the efficacy of the vaccine reported by trials was insufficient to achieve the desired herd immunity effect. CSL management declined an invitation to appear before an Australian Senate inquiry. \c\cAlthough the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, said that Australia would be "at the front of the queue", and the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, claimed that Australia would be among the first countries to receive COVID-19 vaccines, 61 other countries had already commenced vaccinating their citizens by the end of January 2021, while the Australian vaccination rollout was not scheduled to commence for another month. \c\cOn 15 February 2021, 142,000 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Australia. The first doses were due to be administered on 22 February. The world-wide distribution of the vaccine has been described as "... the largest logistics effort in the world since World War" by Dr Roberto Perez-Franco of the Deakin University's Centre for Supply Chain and Logistics. This was followed, on 28 February, by 300,000 doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, which arrived at Sydney airport. It was planned that most Australians will be immunised with this vaccine, the majority of which will be manufactured in Australia by CSL Limited. On 5 March, Italy and the European Union blocked a shipment of 250,000 doses of the Oxford−AstraZeneca vaccine from Italy to Australia, citing low COVID-19 case numbers in Australia and the limited availability of vaccines in the EU. \c\cLocal manufacturing began in November 2020.[citation needed] On 16 February, the first vials of COVID-19 vaccine produced in Australia came off the production line at the CSL Behring plant in Broadmeadows, Melbourne. This is the active raw vaccine material. The vaccine vials are filled and packaged into doses by Seqirus, a CSL subsidiary in Parkville, Melbourne. Production of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Australia received its final approval from the TGA on 21 March. Understandably, many front line health care workers preferred the Pfizer vaccine over the AstraZeneca one. \c\cThe Australian government had also signed a deal with Novavax for 51 million doses of its vaccine, with supply originally slated for "mid-2021". As of April 2021, it had yet to be approved by the TGA. It is not manufactured in Australia, so like the other imported vaccines, its availability was uncertain. In trials it was reported to be 95.6 per cent effective against COVID-19, and an 86.3 per cent effective against the variant identified in the UK. \c\cIn a February 2021 pre-budget submission, the Australian Academy of Science renewed its call for the government to develop the capability to produce mRNA vaccine technology in Australia. The ability to mass-produce such vaccines onshore would insulate Australia against supply shocks, and cater for future pandemics and potential biosecurity situations. The mRNA vaccines had proved to be more effective than those produced with conventional vaccine technology, and easier to reconfigure to cater for new virus variants.[failed verification]\c\cThe US Moderna company entered an agreement with the Australian Federal government, announced on 13 May 2021, to provide 25 million doses of its\' COVID-19 vaccine \'mRNA-1273\', subject to TGA approval. \c\cThe first public COVID-19 vaccination in Australia, with the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, took place on 21 February 2021 in Sydney. An 84-year-old aged care resident was the first Australian to receive the vaccine. Prime Minister Morrison and Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly also received vaccinations. \c\cThe first Australian to receive the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was a doctor in regional South Australia on 5 March 2021 at Murray Bridge Hospital. \c\cMore than 2 million COVID-19 vaccinations had been administered in Australia by 28 April 2021, but this was 3 million short of original plans. By 6 June, over 5 million vaccinations had been administered. Approximately 4.45 million were first doses, nearly 570,000 were second doses. \c\cThe first death in Australia linked to an adverse vaccination reaction occurred on 15 April 2021. A diabetic 48-year-old New South Wales (NSW) woman died in John Hunter Hospital after developing thrombosis with thrombocytopenia four days after being vaccinated on 8 April with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The TGA said it was "likely" her death was linked to the vaccination. There were two previous cases in Australia of blood clotting linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. By 23 April 2021, three more cases of blood clotting were reported that are believed to be linked to AstraZeneca vaccination. A 49-year-old Queensland man, an 80-year-old Victorian man and 35-year-old NSW woman all had suspected thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). The TGA said there was a "likely link" as all three had received the AstraZeneca vaccine. All were in a stable condition and recovering. A second Australian had died of TTS by 10 June 2021. The 52-year-old woman, also from NSW, had a blood clot in her brain, a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis before she died. There had been three more new cases of TTS in the preceding week. There was a third AstraZeneca vaccination linked death from immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). A fourth death occurred in July, a 72-year-old South Australian woman died in Royal Adelaide Hospital. She was diagnosed with TTS after being vaccinated with AstraZeneca on 24 June. On 22 July 2021, another 2 deaths were linked by the TGA to TTS after vaccination with AstraZeneca. They were a 48-year-old woman from Victoria, and a 44-year-old man from Tasmania who was a confirmed case of TTS. \c\cAnother 5 cases of TTS linked to AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination had been reported by 6 May, bringing the total in Australia to 11. \c\cThe Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) and the TGA met on 8 April 2021 to review concerns over the AstraZeneca vaccine. The ATAGI accepted vaccination uptake "will likely be impacted until such time that an increased supply of alternative safe and effective vaccines can be secured." Australia's Chief Medical Officer, Doctor Paul Kelly, reassured about the vaccine's safety, but it was being reviewed. ATAGI recommended the Federal Government against using the AstraZeneca vaccine for those aged below 50 due to increased probability of TTS in younger recipients. Furthermore, on the balance of risks and factors including current availability of vaccines to the Australian population, probable COVID-19 outcomes, and currently understood probability of TTS outcomes, the ATAGI also assessed as favourable (but did not recommend) people aged 50 and over vaccinate with AstraZeneca. At the same time, however, the ATAGI also "respects a person's choice to make an informed decision on whether to accept the risk of COVID-19 vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine." This is in agreement with Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which reads "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person." In May 2021 Health Minister Greg Hunt "said people over the age of 50 who were currently eligible for the AstraZeneca vaccine could instead wait for Pfizer or Moderna doses, due towards the end of this year." Internationally there is no consensus on age threshold for AstraZeneca. Analysis in the European Union of available data by the human medicines committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) show incidence of TTS per million for ages 20–49 average 19.3, 50–69 average 10.5, and 70+ average 4.5. That is, 50- to 69-year-olds are roughly half as likely to suffer TTS as 20–49s and twice as likely as 70+. The government agency advising the German federal government in this matter, the Robert Koch Institute, advises AstraZeneca for persons aged 60 years and over only. Denmark, Norway and Austria have completely dropped AstraZeneca, in the UK "people under the age of 30" are given "the choice of a different jab", and in Italy and Portugal it is for use by people aged over 60 only. \c\cVictoria's Chief Health officer, Professor Brett Sutton, after himself receiving an AstraZeneca vaccination in April, said: "You are more likely to get a clot, whatever age you are, on a long-haul flight to Europe or North America." Daniel Thomas, haematologist and researcher at the University of Adelaide agreed and said deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was "common" but also that "the risk of death was \'much lower\' than the 25 per cent fatality observed so far in the clotting syndrome linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine." A probability of 4–6 in 1 million to get blood clots (although "higher rates have been reported in Germany and some Scandinavian countries") and a fatality rate of 25 per cent equates to 1–1.5 fatalities per million. In comparison, the probability of winning Division 1 in Saturday Lotto is 1 in 8,145,060, or about 0.123 per million. That is, a person is 8.145 to 12.218 times more likely to die of blood clots when vaccinated with AstraZeneca than to win the lottery. If every one of the 35.1 per cent of the Australian population that is aged 50 and over, which number approximately 9,047,454 people, were vaccinated with AstraZeneca, at 1–1.5 fatalities per million approximately 9–14 Australian residents in that age group are expected to die from blood clots. At the higher rate reported by the EMA for the 50–69 age group, the 23.3 per cent of the Australian population in that age group and which number 6,005,860 people, approximately 16 Australian residents in that age group are expected to die from blood clots. Similarly, at the rate reported by the EMA for the 70+ age group, the 11.8 per cent of the Australian population in that age group and which number 3,041,594 people, approximately 3 Australian residents in that age group are expected to die from blood clots. On 17 June 2021 the data available at that time for Australia quantified the rate of developing TTS "for people aged 50–59" as "1.9 cases for every 100,000 doses", which is much higher than the rate of 4–6 per million for 50 and over reported in May 2021 by the Commonwealth Department of Health, and comparable to the average of 19.3 per million reported in April by the EMA for 20–49s. Then several days later the probability of TTS was reported as "3.1 out of 100,000 for under-50s and 2.7 out of 100,000 for 50- to 59-year-olds," but with a much lower rate of death from TTS of 3–4 per cent in Australia, which, however, means "more needs to be considered than deaths" because blood clots are resulting in harm to a number of mostly young Australians who "will have long-term complications". \c\cThere are calls for a more effective advertising campaign that goes beyond presenting facts that inform, to use of emotion to change people's behaviour to overcome apparent lack of "trust in the government". For example, an advertising campaign that is "clever and well written", possibly featuring a "message from a well-known celebrity", that pushes "the idea of \'Hey, look at how quickly things can change, and this is a way to stop that happening.\' We need people to be scared." This is in stark contrast to the ATAGI position of respecting informed decision making, and the position some European nations are taking—which is possible with "an increased supply of alternative safe and effective vaccines" that Australia currently lacks. To address this, on 23 May 2021 Health Minister Greg Hunt reiterated that a sufficient supply of Pfizer is expected to begin arriving in October, with AMA president Omar Khorshid adding this promised supply means "everyone who wanted it could have both doses by Christmas" of 2021. Nevertheless, government, AMA and ATAGI advice remains for everyone to vaccinate as soon as possible and not to wait, because the (potentially future) risk of community transmission in Australia remains a possibility, and which until 17 June 2021 over 9 million Australian residents over 50 had to weigh against the \'tiny\' risk of death associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine that (according to best data available at the time) was probable to manifest for approximately 9–14 Australians, or approximately 19 Australians according to EMA data. Diagnosis and treatment of TTS that is "linked with the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine in some groups" is continuing to improve as Australian doctors "learn from their experiences with TTS", such as not to use "the type of medicine we usually use for clots, which is called heparin, because that can make things worse". \c\cThe national tally of TTS cases rose to 18 on 13 May 2021, when seven new cases of thrombosis after vaccination were reported to the TGA.[needs update]\c\cOn the advice of ATAGI, Health Minister Greg Hunt said on 17 June 2021 that the federal government would now recommend the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine only be administered to people aged 60 years and over. Everyone under 60 will be offered the Pfizer vaccine. Hunt stated that about 815,000 Australians between ages 50 and 59 had already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with Pfizer now available to the approximately 2.1 million remaining Australians in that age group. Assuming one death per 815,000 vaccinations—as observed—applies to the remaining 2.1 million Australians in the 50–59 age group, the change in policy has saved the lives of approximately 3 Australians had they all followed advice and vaccinated with AstraZeneca. \c\cIn a survey conducted in June 2021, about 15 per cent of respondents not yet vaccinated identified wanting a different vaccine "to what was available to them" as a factor holding them back from getting vaccinated. Since only 18–39 and 60+ year-olds are eligible for one vaccine (i.e., AstraZeneca) but not the other (i.e., Pfizer-BioNTech), making Pfizer-BioNTech available to everyone would obviate one factor holding back vaccination uptake. \c\cBefore the crisis, 600,000 Australians were employed in the arts, an industry which added around A$3.2 billion to export revenues. The rate of employment in the sector grew at a faster rate than the rest of the economy. According to government figures, "cultural and creative activity contributed to A$112 billion (6.4% of GDP) to Australia's economy in 2016–17". \c\cBeginning in the second week of March 2020, Australian institutions began announcing reduced services, and then complete closures. One of the first casualties was the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, with organisers announcing on 13 March 2020 that the 2020 festival had been cancelled entirely. Opera Australia announced it would close on 15 March. The national closure of all cultural institutions was mandated on 24 March, with subsequent restrictions on public gatherings. Consequently, many cultural events were also cancelled, including the Sydney Writers\' Festival. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, by the beginning of April, "Arts and Recreation services" was the sector of the national economy with the smallest proportion of its business still in operation—at 47%. A graph in Guardian Australia showing businesses by sector that had ceased trading between June 2019 and 30 March 2020 shows over 50% of arts and recreation services, the hardest hit of any sector (information media and telecommunications is next, at about 34%). Adrian Collette, CEO of the Australia Council for the Arts, the government's arts funding and advisory body, described the impact on the cultural and creative sectors as "catastrophic". \c\cThe Australian film industry has been severely impacted, with at least 60 shoots being halted and about 20,000 people out of work. On Monday 23 March, all productions funded by Screen Australia were postponed. As of 15 April 2020[update], after some improvement in COVID-19 statistics in Australia, Screen Australia continues to fund work and process applications, intending to use all of its 2019/20 budget. Film industry organisations such as Screen Producers Australia (SPA) and the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA) have been lobbying the government for a support package specific to the screen industry, and to expand the JobKeeper requirements so that those in the screen industry are better covered. Many in the film industry are employed by Special Purpose Vehicles—temporary companies that cease trading once production has finished—which cannot easily prove that their turnover has fallen by 30% or more. SPA said that the industry shutdown had cost more than A$500 million, with about A$20 million of lost export revenue. \c\cOne hundred and nineteen films and TV shows have been halted, with only a few shows (such as MasterChef Australia and Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell) continuing production through the pandemic. The TV soap Neighbours was the first English-language TV drama series in the world to announce that resumption of production would begin soon after 20 April 2020. \c\cLike other governments around the world, the Australian government has acknowledged the economic, cultural and social value of the arts industry. The Australia Council has redirected about A$5 million to "new programs designed to provide immediate relief to Australian artists, arts workers and arts organisations to support their livelihoods, practice and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic" (the "Resilience Fund"), and is also hosting weekly meetings to address the concerns of specific sections of the industry, such as Indigenous creatives and organisations, live performance and public gatherings, and various peak bodies. Several state governments have also provided relief packages. \c\cIn early April, the federal government announced a package of A$27 million in specific arts funding: A$7 million for the Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program, A$10 million for Regional Arts Australia's regional arts fund, and A$10 million for Support Act, a charity founded in 1997 that provides financial support and counselling to people in the music industry in Australia. However, the "JobKeeper" scheme specifically excluded "freelancers and casuals on short-term contracts, or who have worked for a series of employers in the last year", thus excluding a large proportion of arts and cultural sector professionals, who rely on short-term contracts. \c\cHowever, most of the arts sector's more than 193,000 workers were still unable to access the JobKeeper payments, despite being defined as sole traders, and an estimated A$330 million worth of paid performances cancelled. The Australia Institute recommended a A$750 million rescue package for the industry, while Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said that arts workers should utilise existing support measures. \c\cOn 4 May 2020, the company operating the Carriageworks multi-arts venue in Sydney declared it would be entering voluntary administration and closing, citing an "irreparable loss of income" due to government bans on events during the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent negative impact on the arts sector. Carriageworks was the first major arts venue in the country to collapse suddenly after the hit to income caused by the strict social distancing rules enforced by state and federal governments, but others feared the same fate, after being forced to shut their doors in late March. \c\cOn 13 May 2020, the Art Gallery of South Australia announced that it would reopen on 8 June. \c\cOn 24 June 2020, the federal government announced a $250 million rescue package for the arts, comprising grants and loans. The package includes $75m for a grants program for new festivals, concerts, tours and events; $90m in loans to help fund new productions; $50m to help film and television producers unable to access insurance due to the pandemic, to enable them to restart production; and $35 million in direct financial assistance for struggling Commonwealth-funded organisations, including theatre, dance, music and circus. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) welcomed the boost, but critics said that it was not nearly enough, especially with so many workers in the industry still ineligible for JobKeeper payments. \c\cOn 3 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia became the first central bank to cut interest rates in response to the outbreak. Official interest rates were cut by 0.25% to a record low of 0.5%. \c\cOn 12 March, the federal government announced a planned A$17.6 billion stimulus package. The package consists of multiple parts: a one-off payment to pensioners, social security recipients, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders, payments of A$2,000–A$25,000 to affected small businesses, an increase to the threshold for the Instant Asset Write-off Program, tax concessions for investments, a small business 50% wage subsidy for 120,000 trainees and apprentices, and A$1 billion in subsidies for heavily affected industries. \c\cOn 17 March, the New South Wales government announced a A$2.3 billion stimulus package, including A$700 million for health services. A$450 million was allocated to waive payroll tax for 3 months, and $250 million was allocated so state-owned buildings and public schools could employ more cleaners. Seven hundred and fifty million dollars was allocated for capital works and public asset maintenance. \c\cOn 18 March, the Northern Territory government announced an economic stimulus package of A$60 million. \c\cOn 19 March, the Reserve Bank again cut interest rates by a further 0.25%, from 0.5% to 0.25%, the lowest in Australian history. \c\cIn March 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) began releasing a number of additional statistical products to assess the economic impacts on the outbreak on the Australian economy. Data on retail trade turnover indicated a 0.4% rise in turnover in February 2020. Negative effects on some areas of the retail sector (particularly tourism-dependent businesses) were offset by a rise in food retail turnover, with supermarkets showing a large rise in sales, mainly arising from panic buying. \c\cOn 22 March, the Federal government announced a second stimulus package of A$66 billion, increasing the amount of total financial package offered to A$89 billion. This included several new measures like an extra A$550 \'Coronavirus Supplement\' payment to those on income support, paid from 27 April to 24 September 2020, and relaxed eligibility criteria for individuals on JobSeeker Payment, granting A$100,000 to small and medium-sized businesses and A$715 million to Australian airports and airlines. It also allowed individuals affected by the outbreak to access up to A$10,000 of their superannuation during 2019–2020 and also being able to take an additional same amount for the next year. \c\cOn 30 March, the Australian Government announced a six-month, A$130 billion JobKeeper payment. The JobKeeper payment provides businesses with up to A$1,500 a fortnight per full-time or part-time employee, or casual employee that has worked for that business for over a year. To be eligible, a business with an annual revenue of under A$1 billion must have lost 30% turnover since 1 March, or 50% for businesses over A$1 billion. The entire payment made to businesses for an employee must then, by law, be paid to that employee in lieu of normal pay. This response came after the enormous job losses seen just a week prior when an estimated 1 million Australians lost their jobs. The program was backdated to 1 March with the aim of re-employing many people who had lost their jobs in the weeks before. In the first hour of the scheme, over 8,000 businesses registered to receive the payments. The program is one of the largest economic packages ever implemented in modern Australian history. JobKeeper ended on 28 March 2021. \c\cOn 11 April, the South Australian state government announced its own A$350 million economic stimulus measures. \c\cIn late April, the Federal government announced A$94.6 million of support was available for zoos, wildlife parks and aquariums forced to close by coronavirus restrictions. This was part of previously announced economic stimulus measures. \c\cThe 2020 Federal Budget, normally delivered in May, was delayed until 6 October because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cOn 22 May 2020, the Treasury and Australian Taxation Office announced there had been a miscalculation of A$60 billion in the planned cost of the JobKeeper program. Blaming 1,000 businesses for making "significant errors" on the application form, the Australian Government revealed it had overbudgeted the program, and that it was forecast to cost A$70 billion, not A$130 billion. The Treasury also announced that its original forecast of 6.5 million recipients was inaccurate, and closer to 3.5 million. Prime Minister Scott Morrison celebrated the saving, while the Opposition announced a parliamentary inquiry in an attempt to compel Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to explain the overestimation. \c\cIn July 2020, Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, in an interview with the US CNBC news channel, vowed that the government's budget deficit was expected to increase to A$85.8 billion Australian dollars in the financial year ended on 30 June and further widen to A$184.5 billion in the new fiscal year. \c\cOn 2 September, the Australian economy went into recession for the first time in nearly thirty years. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) fell 7 per cent in the June quarter. In December, it was announced Australia had pulled out of recession after experiencing a 3.3% growth in GDP in the September quarter. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg stated the effects of the recession had lasting impacts and the recovery was far from over. Australia is set to avoid an economic depression as forecast earlier in 2020, though GDP is likely to have experienced a contraction from 2019 figures. \c\cThe 2020 Australian federal budget, delayed from May, is finally delivered on 6 October. \c\cOn 17 November 2020, the NSW Government announced in the state budget that all NSW residents over 18 years of age would be eligible to receive four A$25 vouchers through Service NSW to help stimulate the economy. Two vouchers are for dining, Monday to Thursday only, excluding public holidays. The other two are to be spent on entertainment, excluding on public holidays. Businesses need to be COVID-safe registered, and sign-up for the scheme. The vouchers cannot be used for gambling, alcohol, cigarettes, retail purchases or accommodation. The program was originally called "Out and About". \c\cResidents will need to have a Service NSW account to receive their vouchers. After trials in Sydney and regional areas, full rollout was scheduled for March. The trials began in Broken Hill, and the Rocks in Sydney on 11 February 2021. \c\cAs early as mid-April 2021, the scheme was said by some regional NSW residents to be "city centric\'. At this time, the vouchers had been used by less than 10% of the 5 million who can use it. There were calls by NSW opposition political parties for the scheme to be extended beyond its initial 30 June 2021 deadline to use the vouchers. On 9 June 2021, the Dine & Discover scheme was extended by a month to 31 July. \c\cOn 22 February 2021, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that the JobSeeker Payment base rate would be increased by A$50 a fortnight from April 2021. The payment will rise to A$614 a fortnight, with an estimated cost over forward estimates of A$9 billion. It is also intended to increase the threshold amount recipients can earn before their payment starts to be reduced. \c\cOn 26 February 2021, the Chief Executive of the Australian Airports Association, James Goodwin, said that Australian airports had been losing A$320 million every month during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said over the past 12 months, job losses amounted to 25 per cent of the airports\' workforce. \c\cOn 10 March 2021, the Federal Government announced steps worth A$1.2 billion to encourage Australians to holiday within Australia to assist ailing tourist destinations. Between April and July, up to 800,000 airfares to 13 regions normally favoured by international tourists will be halved for domestic travellers. \c\cOn 3 June 2021, the Federal Government announced that people who lose work as a result of lockdowns, of at least 7 days\' length, may be eligible for a A$325 or A$500 per week Temporary COVID Disaster Payment. To be eligible:\c\cPerson must be older than 17\c\cLive/ work in a Commonwealth defined hot-spot\c\cHave less than A$10,000 liquid assets\c\cWould have worked except for lockdown, and,\c\cWill lose income due to lockdown\c\cCan\'t access special pandemic or sick leave, or,\c\cHave used it up\c\cThose on other types of income support from the Commonwealth, like JobSeeker, are ineligible. \c\cTo get the full A$500 payment, the lost work must be at least 20 hours. If the lost work is under 20 hours, the payment is $325. \c\cVictoria announced A$30 million of financial support on 7 June 2021 for residents "locked out of work" by COVID lockdowns. The Victorian government also extended it emergency "hardship support payment" to October. This helps those on temporary or provisional visas who are not able get income from the Commonwealth. \c\cThe pandemic had dramatic effects on the Australian rate of unemployment. In July 2019 it was 5.1%, by July 2020 it peaked at 7.5%, during the pandemic, by the end of 2020 it had fallen to 6.6%. Figures for February to March 2021, released in April, showed unemployment had reduced to 5.8 per cent, 0.4 points higher than at the start to the pandemic. \c\cIn September 2020, a report from Ernst & Young stated that pandemic related border restrictions could result in a shortfall of 26,000 pickers over Australia's summer harvest season. Such work is typically reliant on seasonal staff from overseas. As a trial in early September 2020, 160 workers from Vanuatu were allowed into the Northern Territory (NT) to pick mangoes. They arrived on a specially chartered aircraft, and had to undergo the usual 14-day quarantine. It was estimated that the Vanuatuan workers saved A$100 million of fruit from the NT mango harvest being left to rot. The mango industry in the NT was valued at more than A$128 million in 2019, and produces more than half of Australia's mangoes. \c\cOn 30 September 2020, PM Scott Morrison announced that: " ... backpackers, Pacific Islanders and seasonal workers will be able to extend their visas to stay in Australia ..." and "... welfare recipients will be offered incentives to pick fruit."\c\cIn late October 2020, some farmers found that they had to plough their produce back into the ground because it could not be harvested, at a loss of A$150,000. \c\cThe "Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job" (RATTUAJ) program, scheduled to run from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021, offers A$6,000 for transport, moving expenses, accommodation and work clothing for welfare recipients willing to relocate to a regional area for a minimum of 6 weeks for short term agricultural jobs. Up to early December 2020, the relocation incentives for unemployed Australians appeared to be failing. After operating for a month, Federal Department of Employment figures showed only 148 people had taken up the offer. \c\cShortage of workers for harvesting can not only mean unpicked produce being left to rot or be ploughed back into fields, and farmers possibly not planting the next year, it creates an economic loss to those farmers, and can also noticeably increase prices for consumers. \c\cIn 2020, due to international travel restrictions, social distancing and lockdowns because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of influenza in Australia, and deaths from it, were at "record lows". In mid-June 2021 the flu was said to be almost non-existent. In May 2019 there were over 30,000 cases, in May 2021, only 71. \c\c2019 in Australia was particularly bad with 800 flu deaths, below 40 in 2020, and no reported deaths as of June 2021. \c\cAboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders have poorer health outcomes and a lower life expectancy than the non-Indigenous Australian population, particularly those living in remote areas, and along with overcrowded housing and many living in very remote communities, makes them one of the communities most vulnerable to the virus. The remote Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY lands) in South Australia, whose population has many comorbidities, high rates of tobacco use, overcrowded housing and overall poor hygiene, introduced restricted access to the lands in early March to protect their people, especially elders, from the virus. The Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said it was a sensible move, and that the federal government would work with them. (A later call to evacuate elders to Adelaide by the APY Art Centre Collective was not put into operation.)\c\cThe federal government set up a national Indigenous advisory group in early March, to create an emergency response plan for Aboriginal communities. The 43-page plan was published in March, and in late March, the Prime Minister that advised that Indigenous Australians over the age of 50 (along with everyone over 70 and those with a chronic illness over 60), should stay at home as much as possible. The Department of Health created a web page dedicated to advice for Indigenous people and remote communities, and the National Indigenous Australians Agency has one dedicated to the government's response to COVID-19. On 18 April the NIAA announced a government package of A$123 million of "targeted measures to support Indigenous businesses and communities to increase their responses to COVID-19", for the coming two financial years. \c\cThe Northern Territory developed a remote health pandemic plan, with NT Health setting up a number of remote clinics across the Territory. All non-essential travel to the 76 remote communities was banned, and a 14-day isolation period imposed for those residents wanting to return home from regional centres, and in May, health officials suggested that these controls should stay in place for the foreseeable future. In mid-March, a group of senior NT clinicians called for 16 measures to be implemented as soon as possible to help protect vulnerable communities. Other states and territories have provided advice on their health agency websites. \c\cA group of Barkindji families set up a tent town on the banks of the Darling River near Wilcannia in New South Wales, to escape the threat of the disease from overcrowded accommodation in the town. \c\cThe pandemic has created shortages of some medications since it began, initially related to panic buying. The most commonly used antidepressant in Australia, sertraline, is one of many such as the brand Zoloft, that have been affected by a global shortage. Olmesartan and irbesartan, both blood pressure medications were short in Australia as were hormone replacement therapy (HRT) patches and carbimazole, a thyroid medication. As of February 2021 the contraceptive pill "Norimin" (norethisterone) was hard for pharmacists to acquire, supply had been intermittent for 6–12 months. Shortages of Norimin and Brevinor, both Pfizer products, were reported in August 2020 and first predicted to last until December 2020, the shortage was then expected by the TGA "... to be resolved in March or April 2021". In the case of sertraline a Serious Shortage Substitution Notice (SSSN) was issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). SSSNs were also issued in Australia for Prazosin (blood pressure), Metformin (diabetes), and Estradot (HRT), which in theory allows substitutions like issuing twice the number of 25-milligram (0.39 gr) tablets in place of the prescribed 50-milligram (0.77 gr) tablets, without a new prescription, but with the patients\' consent. Chris Moy, Vice President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) said medicine shortages in Australia were a "pre-existing problem" before COVID-19. \c\cMoy also said "A lot of our medications are made in China and India. Sovereign capability and protecting supply of our medications is something that should be seriously considered."\c\cThe TGA gave short-term approval for the import of some medicines that are "not on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) that are approved for import and supply in Australia because: there is a shortage of a medicine registered in Australia; and the medicine is needed in the interest of public health."\c\cOn 20 February 2021 anti-COVID-19 vaccine rallies were held in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. There were a few hundred people at each. The Federal Government COVID-19 vaccination program was scheduled to start on 22 February, but the first doses were administered on 21 February. \c\cOn 3 November 2020 in Melbourne there was an anti-lockdown protest. More than 400 people were arrested and nearly 400 penalties issued. On 12 February 2021, there was another anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne. Two were arrested. On 28 May 2021 there was another protest in Melbourne during their fourth lockdown. \c\cDuring the 2021 Australian Open at Melbourne Park, an official referred to the COVID-19 vaccine as a sign of optimism, which was followed by booing by the fans present at the event. The Australian government criticised the reaction of the fans and called it "disgusting". \c\cOn 3 January 2021, an anti-mask protest was held inside Westfield Bondi Junction in New South Wales. This was the first day that new mask wearing requirements, including venues like shopping centres, came into effect. On 23 January 2021 an anti-mask protest was stopped by NSW Police from entering the Westfield Parramatta shopping centre. Warning was given to the group to obey public health orders, and follow social distancing guidelines. One man was arrested when he did not comply with the police directive when the group dispersed after they were given a move-on direction. A protest group was also turned away from the Parramatta Westfield a week earlier. \c\cThe major sporting leagues (A-League, AFL, AFL Women's, and the National Rugby League) initially stated that their seasons would not be suspended but would continue behind closed doors, with some games being played under those conditions. However, all the leagues were later suspended. \c\cInitially the 2020 Stawell Gift was postponed until later in the year; however, in May it was cancelled entirely for 2020. \c\cThe AFL season was initially curtailed to a maximum of 17 games, with clubs expected to take at least a 10% revenue hit from coronavirus related issues. However, on 22 March, just before the end of round 1 of the 2020 season, AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan announced that the AFL season would be suspended until at least 31 May, citing the shutting of state borders as the primary cause for this decision. The AFL season restarted on 11 June, with the Grand Final being played on 24 October at the Gabba in Brisbane, Queensland, the first Grand Final to be held outside Victoria. The 2020 AFL Women's season was cancelled midway through the finals series, with no premiership awarded to any team. \c\cThe 2020 NBL Finals began with game two, although it was stated that the competition would be immediately suspended if any participants were to be diagnosed. The best of five series was subsequently cancelled after the third game was played with the title awarded to Perth Wildcats. \c\cAll second-tier state basketball leagues were either postponed or cancelled. \c\cThe remaining two One Day Internationals between Australia and New Zealand were cancelled after the first match was played behind closed doors. Cricket Australia also cancelled the Australian women's cricket team's tour of South Africa due to the virus. \c\cThe first sporting event in Australia to be affected was the 2020 Australian Grand Prix, which was cancelled on 13 March after McLaren withdrew when a team member tested positive for COVID-19. This was also enforced on the support races which included the 2020 Melbourne 400, which was the second round of the 2020 Supercars Championship to be cancelled.[citation needed] The 2021 Australian Grand Prix was postponed from its original March date to November to allow for the easing of travel restrictions. On 6 July 2021, it was cancelled for the second consecutive year due to "restrictions and logistical challenges" related to the pandemic. \c\cFollowing the implementation of travel restrictions by New Zealand, the Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) announced that the New Zealand Warriors would be based in Australia for the foreseeable future. The 2020 season was suspended indefinitely on 23 March. Chairman of the ARLC Peter V\'landys requested a government bailout for the National Rugby League, a request that was struck down, and caused a considerable negative reaction. \c\cOn 22 April, the NRL announced that they planned for the season to restart on 28 May, with training beginning on 4 May, and has planned for 18 rounds (giving a 20-round season) and a State of Origin series, with the Grand Final rescheduled for 25 October. \c\cThe NRL season recommenced on 28 May with a round 3 game played in Brisbane between the Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta Eels. The match was played behind closed doors without any crowd, although the broadcasters (Channel 9 and Fox Sports) used fake crowd noise during the broadcast. The return match rated highly on TV as it was the first TV match of a team sport in Australia for 8 weeks. The Grand Final was played in front of a limited crowd on 25 October at ANZ Stadium. \c\cThe 2020 State of Origin series took place after the NRL season, with Game 3 holding a capacity crowd at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium. \c\cThe 2020 Super Rugby season was suspended following the conclusion of play on 15 March, due to the outbreak and the imposition of mandatory quarantine for international travellers to New Zealand. \c\cThe A-League initially announced a continuation of the league with the Wellington Phoenix being based in Australia; however, on 24 March, suspended the remaining matches indefinitely. On 17 July, the season resumed in a NSW-based hub, where the season finished with the Grand Final occurring at Bankwest Stadium on 30 August in front of a limited crowd. \c\cThe 2020 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race was cancelled on 19 December due to an outbreak in the Greater Sydney region. \c\cEconomic modelling in May 2020 by Tourism Research Australia predicted that the domestic tourism industry would drop in value from A$138 billion to $83 billion. \c\cOn 2 October 2020, Prime Minister Morrison announced that the Australian Government had formalised a deal allowing New Zealanders "one-way quarantine-free travel" into New South Wales and the Northern Territory from 16 October as part of initial steps to establish a "travel bubble" between the two countries. However, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ruled out extending reciprocal "quarantine-free travel" for Australians in order to contain the spread of COVID-19 into New Zealand. \c\cOn 17 October 2020, Stuff reported that 17 New Zealanders who had entered New South Wales traveled to Melbourne despite Victoria not being a party to the travel bubble arrangement with New Zealand. The Victorian Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the arrival of the group but stated that it did not have the authority to detain them. In response, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews threatened to close his state's borders unless the Australian Federal Government blocked travellers using the Trans-Tasman bubble from traveling to Victoria. The Federal Government has disagreed with the Victorian Government's stance. In addition, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced that her government would not prevent New Zealand passengers from travelling to Victoria. \c\cOn 11 December 2020, the Premier of Queensland Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that her state would open its borders to travelers from New Zealand from 1:00 am the following day (12 December), exempting them from quarantine restrictions. \c\cOn 14 December 2020, the New Zealand Prime Minister Ardern announced that the New Zealand Government had approved plans to establish a quarantine free travel bubble with Australia in the first quarter of 2021. Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt welcomed the move, describing it as the "first step" in normalising international travel and reiterated the Australian Government's support for measures to establish the travel bubble. \c\cOn 25 January 2021, the Federal government immediately suspended the ability of New Zealanders to travel to Australia that they had since 16 October 2020, without quarantining, for at least 72 hours. This followed the discovery of a NZ resident with the South African COVID-19 variant. The woman was not known to be infectious, having twice tested negative to COVID-19 before leaving quarantine, then visited many places in northern NZ, but she was then found to have the new strain. \c\cOn 19 April 2021, Australians were allowed quarantine-free travel to New Zealand for the first time in more than a year. To fly under the bubble's rules, passengers must have spent 14 days before departure in either Australia or New Zealand; however, they are not required to spend the full 14 day period or more in the other country, i.e. a person has spent at least 14 days in Australia, flies to New Zealand and returns to Australia after 7 days. They must not be awaiting the results of a Covid test, nor have any Covid symptoms, amongst other criteria. \c\cOn 26 October, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews announced the relaxation of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in Melbourne, ending the 112-day lockdown period. From 28 October, all repair stores, restaurants, cafes, and bars were allowed to reopen with a 10-person limit; home visits were allowed; outdoor gatherings including weddings were limited to ten people; and funerals were limited to 20 people. From 11:59 p.m. on 8 November, the 25 km travel limit in Greater Melbourne, and the border between Melbourne and regional Victoria was lifted; gyms and fitness studios were allowed to reopen; and the patron limit at restaurants, cafes and bars was raised. On the 22 November, mandatory mask wearing was dropped from outdoor public spaces where social distancing can be maintained. \c\cOn 19 April 2020, Australia questioned China's handling of the pandemic, questioned the transparency of its disclosures, and demanded an international investigation into the origins of the virus and its spread. The Chinese Ambassador Cheng Jingye, in a rare breach of diplomatic protocol, leaked details of his telephone conversation with Frances Adamson, Secretary of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on the embassy website. He warned that the demand for an inquiry could result in a consumer boycott of students and tourists visiting Australia, and could affect sales of major exports. A trade dispute involving improperly labelled beef and barley dumping ensued, which seriously affected Australian exports. On 26 August 2020, China's deputy ambassador to Australia, Wang Xining, expressed that Australia's co-proposal for an independent investigation into the causes of the pandemic "hurts the feelings of the Chinese people" during his address to the National Press Club of Australia. \c\cNumerous events in 2020 were cancelled, rescheduled, postponed, reduced in size, or changed location. Some went to an online or streaming format. Even into early 2021 some events, such as Skyfire, regional agricultural shows, and music festivals (Byron Bay Bluesfest and Groovin the Moo) were cancelled for the second year. As of 16 January 2021[update] twenty regional town shows scheduled for January or February 2021 had been postponed or cancelled in New South Wales alone. \c\cThe World Surf League cancelled all events in March 2020. \c\cAll Anzac Day marches in 2020 were cancelled.

On 4 February 2021 that year's festival was also "postponed". \c\cThe 26th Australian Scout Jamboree, scheduled for January 2022 in Elmore, Victoria, was cancelled.
Since 17 July 2021, China's Henan province has been affected by severe flooding, which was caused by a period of prolonged heavy rainfall. Record-breaking maximum rainfall in an hour, 201.9 millimetres (7.95 in), was observed in Zhengzhou, the capital of the province. 19 weather stations in Henan renewed their daily rainfall records. As of 23 July 2021, at least 56 people were killed, at least 5 went missing, 585,193 people were evacuated, 919,519 were relocated, and 7.579 million people were affected. The floods were made more likely by increases in extreme weather caused by climate change in China. \c\cThe floods were considered to be one of multiple extreme weather events that occurred globally in 2021. Several factors were attributed to the so-called "unusual" devastating floods in Henan. The subtropical high in the western Pacific and the continental high-pressure area in the Sea of Japan and inland northwest China contributed to the continuous rainfall in the province. The region, in addition, is at the end of the subtropical high in mid-July, which causes frequent downpours and thunderstorms. \c\cMesoscale convections were reported to be frequently moving over Zhengzhou, which cause intense thunderstorms. According to the China Meteorological Administration, the main reasons for the torrential rains are Typhoon In-fa, which was 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) away from Henan Province, and the continuous subtropical high pressure that continuously guides a large amount of water vapor to the land, and is affected by the uplift of the Taihang Mountains and other topographical areas. This caused heavy relief rain in Henan. \c\cFrom 8:00 on 19 July to 8:00 on 20 July, rainfall monitoring stations in Henan Province measured a large amount of rainfall, including five Chinese national monitoring stations; Songshan (364.6 mm/14.35 in), Xinmi (254.9 mm/10.03 in), Xinzheng (196 mm/7.72 in), Dengfeng (192.8 mm/7.59 in), Yanshi (183.3 mm/7.22 in). Zhengzhou encountered extremely rare heavy rainfall from 16:00 to 17:00 on the 20th. The rainfall in one hour was as high as 201.9 mm (7.95 in), causing serious waterlogging. 13 reservoirs in Henan Province have reached the flood control limit. \c\cOn 16 July, Zhengzhou began to experience heavy rain. On 20 July alone, the average precipitation on that day had reached 253 mm (9.96 in). From 16:00 to 17:00 on 20 July, the rainfall in one hour reached 201.9mm (7.95 in); and from 20:00 on 17 July to 20:00 on 20 July, the rainfall reached 617.1mm (24.30 in) in the course of three days, close to the annual average yearly precipitation. Videos emerged showing subway passengers were waist-deep in water inside their carriage and cars floated in streets. The torrential rain was so strong that many cars on a road near the Danshi Subdistrict in Nanlong Lake were washed up by the rain. The Jingguang North Road Tunnel was flooded, with over 200 cars left behind.  The Zhengzhou Meteorological Observatory issued a red warning signal for rainstorms, and the Zhengzhou Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters upgraded the emergency response of flood control level II to level I. The hourly precipitation and single-day precipitation in Zhengzhou have broken the historical record of 60 years since the station was established in 1951. The Zhengzhou flooding has raised concerns over whether the storm drain system offered sufficient drainage\c\cThe prefecture-level city of Xinxiang reportedly received the largest amount of precipitation, amounting over 260 mm (10 in) of rainfall in a 24-hour period. \c\cOn the evening of 19 July, Kaifeng was affected by heavy rainfall. By the morning of the 20 July, the heavy rain escalated to torrential rain. Kaifeng issued a red rainstorm warning accordingly, which was upgraded to an orange rainstorm warning on the afternoon of 20 July. \c\cHeavy flooding was reported in Henan province, and the Ying River, the largest river in the province overflowed, and caused flooding in the area. In the city of Dengfeng, which also experienced flooding, an aluminum alloy factory owned by Dengfeng Power Group suffered a massive explosion, but no human casualties were reported. The military were sent to safeguard Yihetan Dam. In Hebi, the Wei River flooded several villages. \c\cDuring the floods, at least 56 people were killed and 8 are missing. At least twelve died in the flooded metro lines in Zhengzhou on 20 July. Several died in a flooded road tunnel. \c\cIn Gongyi, at least four people were killed, as flood water forced more than 20,000 people to abandon their homes. \c\cChinese Premier Li Keqiang called successively for all-out efforts in rescue and relief operations in flooded areas across Henan and stressed that ensuring people's lives and safety is a top priority. Local authorities have been tasked to improve flood controls and emergency preparedness. As of 21 July, several major Chinese companies had donated a total of RMB 2 billion towards disaster relief funds. Through Alipay's donation platform, 3.36 million people had contributed a total of RMB 100 million in private donations. Another 33 million was raised through a Weibo donation channel. According to the Henan Charity Federation, a total of RMB 2.664 billion in donations was raised as of 23 July. \c\cThe Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam offered condolences to the victims and wrote on social media that with the all-out efforts of the central and provincial governments, she believes the residents affected by the disaster can be properly taken care of. She also stated that there no time to lose in the global fight against climate change. \c\cThe Chief Executive of Macau Ho Iat-seng wrote in his message to Wang Kai, governor of Henan Province, that he has called on Macanese people to support the affected in Henan through different channels and methods. \c\cThe Pakistani Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri expressed sympathy for the affected Chinese families and people in a tweet on Thursday, and stated that Pakistan is ready to assist those affected in this hour of need. \c\cIn a message to Xi Jinping, President of Russia Vladimir Putin conveyed his condolences to those who lost their families and friends in the floods, and wished early recovery to all those affected. \c\cThe President's Office spokesperson, Tun-Han Chang, conveyed President Tsai Ing-wen's condolences and concern on 21 July, saying that in addition to expressing condolences to those who tragically passed away and their families, the President also hoped that the affected areas would be freed from flood damage and return to normal life as soon as possible.
The 2021 Taliban offensive is an ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies that began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As of 15 July 2021, over a third of Afghanistan's 421 districts were controlled by the Taliban, and by 21 July, half of Afghanistan was under Taliban control. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north in 2021 may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan’s main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway of Afghanistan's capital city Kabul. In terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the Britain, Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander.  Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves - with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. \c\cOn 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July 2021, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cAs of 15 July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second-largest city of Afghanistan, Kandahar. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. As of this date, 233 Afghan National Security Forces and 114 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,100 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. The following day, Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed while covering the fighting in Spin Boldak. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban.

Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Talibans from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. \c\c Afghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahideen, Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. \c\c Taliban: On 9 July, a Taliban spokesman from Moscow, Russia, said that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and pointed that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\c China: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has criticized the withdrawal of American-led NATO forces and has urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\c India: Foreign Affairs Minister S.

However, Wallace warned that UK will review any relationship if Taliban were found violating human rights in Afghanistan.
{"The 2021 Niger attacks are an ongoing series of attacks by militants on civilians and soldiers in Niger, mainly in the western region of Tillabéri. The attacks have left 402 people dead and at least 97 others injured. \c\cSeveral major attacks occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020. However, this is the first time that over 100 civilians were killed in single incidents, marking the January attack and 21 March attack as the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. It is the first year in which attacks were carried out with frequency in the country. As of July, attacks were carried out every month of 2021. The previous biggest attack in Niger against civilians was the 12 December 2020 Toumour attack, which resulted in 28 people killed. Both the December 2020 and January 2021 attacks were carried out during Niger's municipal and regional elections, while the February bombing specifically targeted members of the electoral commission. \c\cOn the same day as the January attacks, two Algerian soldiers were killed in a shooting in Algeria and two French soldiers were killed in a bombing in Mali. \c\cThe January attacks occurred in two villages, Tchombangou (at 14°49′48′′N 01°48′45′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.83000°N 1.81250°E\ufeff / 14.83000; 1.81250) and Zaroumdareye (at 14°54′21′′N 01°46′36′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.90583°N 1.77667°E\ufeff / 14.90583; 1.77667), which are seven kilometres apart, and initially left 79 people dead and 75 wounded. Of the deceased victims, 49 were killed in Tchombangou and 30 in Zaroumdareye. A day after the attack, 21 more people were found dead and others succumbed to their injuries on Tchombangou, bringing the total death toll to 100. On 8 January UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman said that 73 people had been killed in the village of Tchouma Bangou and 32 in Zaroumdareye, making the total death toll 105. The government of Niger dispatched soldiers to the border after the attacks. The attackers are Islamist militants who arrived in the villages while crossing the border from Mali; however, the exact terrorist organization who carried out the attacks is not clear so far. \c\cSome time before the massacre, two militants who were seen in the area were killed by the local villagers. Those attacks are suspected to be in retaliation for those killings, according to the country's interior minister. \c\cOn 21 February, seven members of the electoral commission were killed and three others wounded in a landmine explosion in Tillabéri. The attack was carried out on the same day of the presidential election's second round. \c\cOn 16 March, armed men on motorcycles attacked a convoy returning from a market in Banibangou by the Malian border to a nearby village in Southwestern Niger's Tillabéri Region, killing 58 people. \c\cOn 21 March, militants riding motorbikes attacked Intazayene, Bakorat and Wistan, three villages in the Tahoua Region close to the Malian border, killing 137 people. The death toll would make the attack the deadliest committed by suspected jihadists in Niger's history. Newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum condemned the attacks and declared three days of national mourning. \c\cOn 24 March, at least 10 people were killed during attacks at two villages in the Tillabéri Region. \c\cOn 18 April, at least 19 civilians were killed and two wounded when armed men raid a village in Tillabéri Region. \c\cOn 3 May, a military patrol was ambushed in the Tahoua Region, resulting in the killing of 16 soldiers and the wounding of six more. It was the first attack against soldiers in the country[citation needed] since the beginning of the year. \c\cOn 12 May, five villagers were killed and two more wounded after militants stormed the village of Fantio, in the Tillabéri region, during Eid al-Fitr celebrations. \c\cOn 30 May, four civilians and four soldiers were killed during a raid carried out by Boko Haram militants in the town of Diffa, in the Diffa Region. The jihadists attacked the town in the late afternoon, riding in about 15 vehicles, but were pushed back by responding security forces during a long gunfight, in which six attackers were killed. \c\cOn 25 June, armed men attacked a village and nearby locations, killing a total of 19 civilians. Initially, the attackers stormed the Danga Zawne village, in the Tillabéri region, killing three people. They then attacked nearby farms, killing the other sixteen people. \c\cOn 29 June, Boko Haram fighters opened fire on a bus along the road between Diffa and Maine Soroa, killing three civilians, including the bus driver, two villagers and a village chief; two more were wounded. The fighters then moved on another road and opened fire on a group of soldiers, wounding six of them.

The 2021 Taliban offensive is an ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies that began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As of 15 July 2021, over a third of Afghanistan's 421 districts were controlled by the Taliban, and by 21 July, half of Afghanistan was under Taliban control. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north in May be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway of Afghanistan's capital city Kabul. In terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the Britain, Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves - with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. \c\cOn 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July 2021, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cAs of 15 July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second-largest city of Afghanistan, Kandahar. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. As of this date, 254 Afghan National Security Forces and 143 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,626 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. The following day, Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed while covering the fighting in Spin Boldak. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Talibans from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. \c\cOn July 24, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahideen, Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. \c\cTaliban: On 9 July, a Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar said in Moscow, Russia that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and pointed that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\cChina: Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi has criticized the withdrawal of American-led NATO forces and has urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\cIndia: Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that India would be consulting all important parts in the conflict, including China, and that India was pushing for "conciliation in Afghanistan."\c\cIran: Influential Shia cleric, lawmaker, and politician Mojtaba Zonnour said that the Taliban is "an undeniable part of the reality in Afghanistan", and that it should not be equated to Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIL or al-Qaeda. \c\cKazakhstan: Representatives from the country participated in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\cKyrgyzstan Representatives from the country participated in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\cPakistan: Keeping in view the advancements of Taliban, DG ISPR issued a statement that "Pakistan should be seen as facilitator, not guarantor in Afghan peace process."\c\cRussia: Russian authorities said they were working with the Tajik government to protect it from any foreign threat under the Collective Security Treaty Organization.Russian special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, told Russia's RIA news agency that Afghan government only paid lip service to the idea of talks and they were not doing enough to make them happen. He also said that Russia and other regional powers favoured a transitional government in Afghanistan. \c\cTajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon ordered 20,000 reserve servicemen of the country's Ground Forces to be sent to the Afghan–Tajik border. \c\cTurkey: The country offered to order its troops to protect Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \c\cTurkmenistan: Turkmen military forces were assigned to the Afghan–Turkmen border due to security concerns. \c\cUnited Kingdom: UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, said UK will be ready to work with Taliban should they come into power provided that they adhere to certain international norms. However, Wallace warned that UK will review any relationship if Taliban were found violating human rights in Afghanistan. \c\cUnited States: President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying that the country had not gone to Afghanistan to "nation build." Biden added that he would not "send another generation of Americans to fight there" and pointed to other failed attempts at unifying Afghanistan in the past. He also reassured that the U.S. safety was not at risk with any outcome of the infighting in Afghanistan. \c\cUzbekistan: The government raised concerns of a possible migratory crisis due to the infighting in Afghanistan and reported that U.S. authorities had contacted Uzbek officials to confirm if Uzbekistan could safeguard Afghans who collaborated with the U.S., fleeing from the country. In response, the Uzbek government erected a tent city for migrants in the city of Termez.

The 2020 Summer Olympics (Japanese: 2020年夏季オリンピック, Hepburn: Nisen Nijū-nen Kaki Orinpikku), officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad (第三十二回オリンピック競技大会, Dai Sanjūni-kai Orinpikku Kyōgi Taikai) and branded as Tokyo 2020 (東京2020), is an ongoing international multi-sport event that is currently being held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan, with some preliminary events beginning on 21 July. \c\cTokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is held largely behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of the state of emergency. Despite being rescheduled for 2021, the event retains the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes. This is the first time that the Olympic Games have been postponed and rescheduled, rather than cancelled. The Summer Paralympics will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021, 16 days after the completion of the Olympics. \c\cThe 2020 Games are the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the Tokyo 1964 (Summer), Sapporo 1972 (Winter), and Nagano 1998 (Winter) games. Tokyo was to host the 1940 Summer Olympics but pulled out in 1938 due to war. Tokyo is the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Games twice. The 2020 Games are the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. \c\cThe 2020 Games sees the introduction of new competitions as well as competitions that once were held but were subsequently removed. New ones include 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allow the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee are baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding, the last four of which make their Olympic debuts. \c\cThe three candidate cities were Tokyo, Istanbul, and Madrid. The applicant cities of Baku and Doha were not promoted to candidate status. A bid from Rome was withdrawn. \c\cThe IOC voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system. None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority. \c\cIn January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Olympic Games. Tokyo organizers insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics. The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and the prime minister Abe Shinzo "made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest". Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event. Also unlike the case for H1N1 "swine flu" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020. In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate. In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed games in their state, while John Coates the vice president of the International Olympic Committee in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19. \c\cEstimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University predicted that states of emergency may be required during the Games. The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts\' panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the games were to allow spectators. \c\cConcerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China. The boxing qualification tournament was originally planned to be held in Wuhan, China, the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, from 3 to 14 February, but instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March. The third round of the women's football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia. The European boxing qualification was held in London, United Kingdom, before it was suspended and resumed in June 2021 and has moved to Paris, France, affecting travel to the United Kingdom for its completion. Remaining qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and middle of 2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo. \c\cMandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that public health and safety was their topmost priority. The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3 February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the end of the month, and the anti-doping organizations in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced their testing activities by the end of March. \c\cThe Tokyo Organizing Committee (TOCOG) released a statement on 2 March 2020, confirming that preparations for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics were "continuing as planned". On 23 March, both Canada and Australia indicated that they would withdraw from the Games if they were not postponed by a year. On the same day, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated he would support a proposed postponement, citing that ensuring athlete safety was "paramount," and veteran IOC member and former vice president Dick Pound said that he expected the Games to be postponed. \c\cThe IOC and TOCOG released a joint statement on 24 March 2020, announcing that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be rescheduled to a date "beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021". They stated that the Games could "stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times", and that the Olympic flame could become "the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present". Prime Minister Abe stated that IOC president Thomas Bach responded "with 100% agreement" to his proposal to delay the Games. For continuity and marketing purposes, it was agreed that the Games would still be branded as Tokyo 2020 despite the change in scheduling. \c\cOn 30 March 2020, the IOC and TOCOG announced that they had reached an agreement on the new dates for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which would begin with the opening ceremony on 23 July 2021 and end with the closing ceremony on 8 August 2021. The subsequent Winter Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to begin on 4 February 2022, less than six months later. Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named "Here We Go" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots. \c\cHealth experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist. In an interview, Organizing Committee president and former Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori asserted that the Games would be "scrapped" if they could not go ahead in 2021. On 29 April, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games "must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic". Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20 May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was "a mammoth task" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021. However, both Bach and Mori expressed optimism about the Games going ahead.[citation needed]\c\cA member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a British Medical Journal editorial, which stated, "holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes— ignoring scientific and moral imperatives—is contradictory to Japan’s commitment to global health and human security."\c\cOn 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had "privately concluded" that the Games would have to be cancelled. The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were "categorically untrue". The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19 February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled. "President Biden supports Prime Minister Suga's efforts," the White House stated. It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan. Prime Minister Suga dismissed these reports in an April 2021 press conference with President Biden, who continues to support Suga's determination to hold the Games. "We respected the decision to delay the games last summer" and "the President proudly supports U.S. athletes," the White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. \c\cPublic support for the Games in Japan has decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country. Multiple organisations of medical professionals have voiced oppositions to the Games, while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement. In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games. The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association is calling for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo "have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity" in an open letter to the prime minister. At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games. Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement. \c\cKenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected more than 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to "prioritise life" over the Olympics. Japanese writers Jiro Akagawa and Fuminori Nakamura also called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled. \c\cOn 26 May, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which is a local sponsor of the Games, published an editorial calling for Prime Minister Suga to "calmly and objectively assess the situation and decide on the cancellation of the event this summer." On 4 June it was reported that Japanese sponsors have proposed to the organisers for "the Games to be postponed for several months," citing a comment by a corporate sponsor senior executive: "It just makes much, much more sense from our perspective to hold the Games when there are more vaccinated people, the weather is cooler and maybe public opposition is lower."\c\cIn July, it was announced that all events in Tokyo are to be held behind closed doors with no spectators due to a new state of emergency. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun found that 55% of those surveyed supported the cancellation of the Olympics, and 68% felt that organisers would not be able to suitably control COVID-19 at the Games. The decision was also detrimental to local sponsors, which had planned in-person presences to promote their products during the Games; an executive of official sponsor Toyota stated that the company had pulled a television advertising campaign it had planned for the Games in Japan, citing that the Olympics were "becoming an event that has not gained the public’s understanding."\c\cHad the games been cancelled, it would have been the first time since World War II that an Olympic event had been called off, and the first games to be scrapped due to a circumstance that didn\'t have to do with war. A complete cancellation would have also cost Japan ¥4.52 trillion (US$41.5 billion), based on operating expenses and loss of tourism activity. \c\cAccording to an estimate conducted by professor emeritus Katsuhiro Miyamoto of Kansai University and reported by the NHK, the cost of delaying the 2020 Olympics by one year will be 640.8 billion yen (US$5.8 billion), taking maintenance expenditures for the unused facilities into account. \c\cThe Tokyo Games are protected through the commercial insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London, by global reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re. The IOC takes out around $800 million of insurance for each Summer Olympics, with the total amount of loss insured for the 2020 Games likely to be more than $2 billion. The disruption caused by postponing the Games was covered by the insurance policy; those likely to make claims for their financial losses include local organizers, sponsors, hospitality firms, and travel providers. The total loss amount will not become clear until the Games have actually taken place. \c\cHolders of tickets purchased from overseas prior to postponement will be entitled to refunds for both Olympic and Paralympic ticket purchases except for costs for cancelled hotel bookings. Although about 600,000 Olympic tickets and 300,000 Paralympic tickets will need to be refunded, organisers said that they would not release the costs for refunds. Reuters quoted industry sources who estimated that the Tokyo Olympics Committee had taken out US$500-800 million in insurance and that after accounting for costs such as rebooking sporting venues and the Olympic Village, little of that payout would be available to recoup the proceeds of lost and refunded ticket sales. The local organizers are responsible for ticket sales and use them to defray the costs of holding the games; ticket sales were expected to bring in approximately US$800 million, but actual sales will be close to zero. \c\cThe Tokyo Organizing Committee was originally headed by former Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori, but he resigned in February 2021 due to backlash from sexist comments about women in meetings. Seiko Hashimoto was chosen to succeed him. Tamayo Marukawa, Minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, oversees the preparations on behalf of the Japanese government. \c\cThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government has set aside a fund of ¥400 billion (more than US$3.67 billion) to cover the cost of hosting the Games. The Japanese government is considering easing airspace restrictions to allow an increased slot capacity at both Haneda and Narita airports. A new railway line is planned to link both airports through an expansion of Tokyo Station, cutting travel time from Tokyo Station to Haneda from 30 minutes to 18 minutes, and from Tokyo Station to Narita from 55 minutes to 36 minutes; funded primarily by private investors, the line would cost ¥400 billion. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East) is also planning a new route near Tamachi to Haneda Airport. \c\cThere are plans to fund the accelerated completion of the Central Circular Route, Tokyo Gaikan Expressway, and Ken-Ō Expressway, and the refurbishment of other major expressways in the area. The Yurikamome automated transit line is also to be extended from its existing terminal at Toyosu Station to a new terminal at Kachidoki Station, passing the site of the Olympic Village, although the line is not expected to have adequate capacity to serve major events in the Odaiba area on its own. \c\cIn June 2020, TOCOG CEO Toshirō Mutō stated that the committee was exploring options for streamlining the Games to achieve cost savings. On 25 September, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee agreed to a suite of measures to simplify the Games\' logistics, including a cut to non-athlete staff, use of online meetings, and streamlined transport, among others. The committee also outlined areas it would be exploring in order to maintain the health and safety of all participants. \c\cIn February 2012, it was announced that former Tokyo's National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a ¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics. In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and "optimize" the design. \c\cIn June 2015, the government announced it was planning to reduce the new stadium's permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure. The original plans to build a retractable roof were also scrapped. As a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the stadium, which reached ¥252 billion, the government ultimately chose to reject Zaha Hadid's design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma's design has a budget of ¥149 billion. Changes in plans prevented the new stadium from being completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended. National Stadium was inaugurated on 21 December 2019 and will be named Olympic Stadium during 2020 Olympic Games. \c\cIn October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the venues could exceed US$25 billion. \c\cOf the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 are within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed. On 16 October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns. The plans were made official on 1 November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo. \c\cIn December 2018, the Japanese government chose to ban drones from flying over venues being used for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. A similar ban was also imposed for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Japan also hosted. \c\cApplications for volunteering at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were accepted beginning on 26 September 2018. By 18 January 2019, a total of 204,680 applications had been received by the Tokyo Organizing Committee. Interviews to select the requisite number of volunteers began in February 2019, with training scheduled to take place in October 2019. The volunteers at the venues are to be known as "Field Cast", and the volunteers in the city are to be known as "City Cast". These names were chosen from a shortlist of four from an original 150 pairs of names; the other three shortlisted names were "Shining Blue" and "Shining Blue Tokyo", "Games Anchor" and "City Anchor", and "Games Force" and "City Force". The names were chosen by the people who had applied to be volunteers at the Games. \c\cAs of early June 2021, approximately 10,000 out of the 80,000 registered volunteers resigned from the Games. Media attributed the rise in pandemic cases as the reason for massive quitting. More volunteer assignments are expected to be cancelled due to the spectator ban. \c\cIn February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017. A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year. \c\cIn May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base. The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019. \c\cOn 24 July 2019 (one year ahead of the originally scheduled opening ceremony), the designs of the medals were unveiled. The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition. A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively. \c\cDue to COVID-19 protocols, athletes will be presented with their medals on trays and asked to put them on themselves, rather than have them placed around their necks by a dignitary. \c\cThe slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay is "Hope Lights Our Way". \c\cAs determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games, the 2020 Summer Olympics torch was scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent. The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading "Flame of Recovery". After leaving Naraha on 26 March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals. \c\cAfter the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021. On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia. On 20 August 2020, it was announced that the torch relay would begin again in Naraha, Fukushima on 25 March 2021, nearly a year later than originally planned. \c\cThe relay ended at Tokyo's National Stadium on 23 July, with tennis player Naomi Osaka lighting the Olympic cauldron at the finale of the opening ceremony. \c\cIn February 2021, the IOC began releasing "playbooks" containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants will be asked to use Japan's COCOA Exposure Notification app and will be tested at least every four days. Athletes who test positive will be unable to compete and may be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway will be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts must also test negative in order to be cleared for competition. As the actions could spread infected droplets, athletes will be discouraged from "excessive" celebrations. The playbooks were criticised in a paper published by The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2021, for lacking "scientifically rigorous risk assessment" and failing to "distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes". \c\cThe IOC is recommending the vaccination of athletes if they are available, but vaccines will not be required, and the IOC is recommending against athletes "jumping the queue" in order to obtain priority over essential populations. On 12 March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they are approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and Sinopharm vaccines for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and purchase two doses for their nation's general public for each vaccinated athlete. On 6 May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo. \c\cApproximately 93,000 athletes and officials are exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving to Japan, provided that they remain in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccines doses allocated for this group, it has led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the games and when teams return to their countries. \c\cDue to international travel restrictions, the organising committee announced that no international guests (including spectators) would be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators would be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting. On 19 June 2021, Governor of Tokyo Yuriko Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead. On 21 June, it was announced that all venues would be capped at a maximum of 10,000 ticketed spectators or 50% capacity, whichever is lower. \c\cOn 2 July 2021, President of the Tokyo Organising Committee Seiko Hashimoto warned that there was still a possibility that the Games could be held behind closed doors due to rising cases in the country. Of particular concern has been Japan's slow vaccination rate. A University of Toktyo simulation projected that a new wave of infections could peak in mid-October if the Games went on after the existing state of emergency in Tokyo expired. \c\cOn 8 July 2021, after Tokyo recorded 920 new COVID-19 cases (its highest increase since May), Prime Minister Suga declared a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area from 12 July through 22 August (ending only two days before the Paralympics\' opening ceremony), and announced that all events at venues in the area will therefore be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. Hashimoto stated that "it is extremely regrettable that the Games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections." President of the IOC Thomas Bach stated that "we will support any measure which is necessary to have a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games for the Japanese people and all the participants."\c\cThe announcement stated that spectators will still be allowed at events being held outside of Tokyo, subject to the approval by local health authorities and the aforementioned 50%/10,000-spectator limit. The prefectures of Fukushima and Hokkaido stated that they will prohibit spectators at events held in the areas. The opening ceremony is expected to be limited to fewer than 1,000 VIP guests, including IOC representatives and dignitaries. On 16 July, it was reported that Bach had asked Prime Minister Suga about the possibility that restrictions on spectators could be eased later on if COVID-19 conditions improve in Tokyo. \c\cThe opening ceremony tickets were expected to range from ¥12,000 to ¥300,000, with a maximum price of ¥130,000 for the finals of the athletics track and field events. The average ticket price is ¥7,700, with half the tickets being sold for up to ¥8,000. A symbolic ticket price of ¥2,020 is expected for families, groups resident in Japan, and in conjunction with a school program. Tickets will be sold through 40,000 shops in Japan and by mail order to Japanese addresses through the Internet. International guests, had they been allowed, would have needed to visit Japan during the sales period, or arrange to buy tickets through a third party such as a travel agent. \c\cTickets went on general sale in Japan in the autumn of 2019 and were expected to be sold globally from June 2020; however, this plan was suspended when the Games were postponed on 24 March 2020. The Tokyo Organizing Committee confirmed that tickets already purchased would remain valid for the same sessions according to the new schedule and that refunds were also being offered. \c\cOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This includes both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders will be refunded. Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system. It was ultimately announced in July that no spectators will be allowed at any events held in Tokyo, Fukushima and Hokkaido. \c\cA cultural programme known as Nippon Festival was scheduled to coincide with the Olympics and Paralympics, running from April to September 2021 as a series of streaming events held by the Tokyo Organizing Committee and other partners. The events are reflecting the themes of "Participation and Interaction", "Towards the Realisation of an Inclusive Society" and "Reconstruction of the Tohoku Region". The programme was downsized and reformatted due to COVID-19 and the postponement of the Games. One of these events was a concert held on 18 July, which featured J-rock band Wanima, choreography by dancers Aio Yamada and Tuki Takamura, and the presentation of animated "creatures" based on illustrations "embodying the thoughts and emotions of people from across the world". \c\cThe original plans for Nippon Festival included events such as Kabuki x Opera (a concert that would have featured stage actor Ichikawa Ebizō XI, opera singers Anna Pirozzi and Erwin Schrott, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra), an arts and culture festival focusing on disabilities, and a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan shortly after the Olympics—which would have differed significantly from the traditional bi-monthly Honbasho tournaments, and featured special commentary in English and Japanese to help explain to spectators the customs and traditions of professional sumo, which are deeply rooted in the Shinto religion. \c\cThe opening ceremony was held on 23 July 2021 in the Japan National Stadium in Tokyo. It included the traditional Parade of Nations. Emperor Naruhito formally opened the games, and at the end of the torch relay the Olympic cauldron was lit by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka. \c\cThe official program for the 2020 Summer Olympics was approved by the IOC executive board on 9 June 2017. IOC president Thomas Bach stated that the goal for the Tokyo Summer Olympics was to give them a more "youthful" and "urban" appeal, and to increase the number of female participants. \c\cThe Games will feature 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines. Alongside the five new sports that are expected to be introduced in Tokyo, fifteen new events within existing sports are also planned, including 3×3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and the return of madison cycling, as well as new mixed events in several sports. \c\cIn the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses. \c\cOn 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are "relevant to sports fans of all generations", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the Executive Board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic programme. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each. \c\cThe decision to drop wrestling surprised many media outlets, given that the sport's role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original programme for the modern Games. The New York Times felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport. Out of the shortlist from the IOC vote, Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration. \c\cOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling. The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu. At the 125th IOC Session on 8 September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic programme for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively. \c\cWith the adoption of the Olympic Agenda 2020 in December 2014, the IOC shifted from a "sport-based" approach to the Olympic programme to an "event-based" programme—providing additional flexibility for the host organising committee to propose the addition of sports to the programme to improve local interest. As a result of these changes, a shortlist of eight new proposed sports was unveiled on 22 June 2015, consisting of baseball/softball, bowling, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu. On 28 September 2015, the Tokyo Organising Committee submitted their shortlist of five proposed sports to the IOC: baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding. These five new sports were approved on 3 August 2016 by the IOC during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and are to be included in the sports program for 2020 only, bringing the total number of sports at the 2020 Olympics to 33. \c\cA total of 56 test events are scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games. \c\cIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner "Ready, Steady, Tokyo". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020. \c\cAll test events originally scheduled to take place from 12 March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games. \c\cThe Republic of Macedonia has competed under the provisional name "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" in every Summer and Winter Games since its debut in 1996 because of the disputed status of its official name. The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the Prespa agreement, and the country was officially renamed North Macedonia in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games will be North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name. Since competing as Swaziland ten times at the Summer and Winter Olympics, Eswatini made its debut under that name after the renaming of the country by the king in 2018. \c\cOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use "Olympic Athletes from Russia" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as "Neutral Athlete" or "Neutral Team". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display "Russia" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the "Neutral Athlete/Team" designation. \c\cOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym "ROC" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. \c\cOn 6 April 2021, North Korea announced it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics due to COVID-19 concerns. This will mark North Korea's first absence in the Summer Olympics since 1988. On 21 July 2021, Guinea announced it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics due, "officially" to COVID-19 concerns. Guinea later reversed the decision and announced it would participate. \c\cThe following 205 national Olympic committee teams and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team have qualified (including the 104 universality places guaranteed in athletics, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification). \c\c11,656 athletes from 206 NOCs:\c\c  *   Host nation\c\cThe 2020 schedule by session was approved by the IOC Executive Board on 18 July 2018, with the exception of swimming, diving, and artistic swimming. A more detailed schedule by event was released on 16 April 2019, still omitting a detailed schedule for the boxing events. A detailed boxing schedule was released in late 2019. \c\cThe original schedule was from 22 July to 9 August 2020. To postpone the Olympics until 2021, all events were delayed by 364 days (one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week), giving a new schedule of 21 July to 8 August 2021. \c\cPer the historical precedent of swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, swimming finals are scheduled to be held in the morning to allow live primetime broadcasts in the Americas. NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games, which is one of the IOC's major sources of revenue. Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country. \c\cThe official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design is meant to "express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan". The checkered design resembles a pattern called ichimatsu moyo that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.  The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Théâtre de Liège in Belgium. The Games\' bid slogan is Discover Tomorrow (Japanese: 未来(あした)をつかもう, romanized: Ashita o tsukamō). While ashita literally means \'tomorrow\', it is intentionally spelled as mirai \'future\'. The official slogan United by Emotion was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan will be used solely in English. \c\cThe official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics is Miraitowa, a figure with blue-checkered ichimatsu moyo patterns inspired by the Games\' official emblem. Its fictional characteristics include the ability to teleport. Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision. The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for "future" and "eternity", and Someity is named after someiyoshino, a type of cherry blossom. Someity's name also refers to the English phrase "so mighty". The mascots are expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandizing and licensing deals. \c\cNaoki Satō composed the music for victory ceremonies at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. \c\cAlongside the main Emblem blue, the five other colors used in the branding of the 2020 Games are   Kurenai red,   Ai blue,   Sakura pink,   Fuji purple, and   Matsuba green. These five traditional colors of Japan are used as sub-colors to create points of difference in the color variations. \c\cSouth Korea asked the International Olympic Committee to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics, because South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism claims the flag is a symbol of Japan's imperialist past and recalls "historic scars and pain" for people of Korea just as the swastika "reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II". Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is quite controversial, as it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions including the Attack on Pearl Harbor. However, the flag has been utilized since before World War II and it is still used by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and a variant by the Japan Self-Defense Forces. South Korea did not formally raise objections against the flag until 2011. According to South Korea's Olympic Committee, the IOC has pledged to ban the flag from all Olympic sites and venues as of July 2021. \c\cRussian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games\' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan. \c\cPortions of the Games are scheduled for locations that were impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The Olympics torch relay was planned to begin in Fukushima, while Olympic baseball and softball matches are scheduled to be played at Fukushima Stadium, and some football matches are expected to be played in Rifu—an outskirt of Sendai, an area impacted by the earthquake and tsunami. The hosting of events in these locations has been promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions (the rescheduled Games will mark the events\' 10th anniversary), with the Games as a whole sometimes being promoted as the "Recovery Olympics" (Fukkō Gorin (復興五輪)). However, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are currently disputed. Some Tōhoku residents have questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games have slowed recovery efforts, and that the region has lost workers to projects associated with the Games. \c\cA petition obtained over 140,000 signatures was delivered to the Japanese Embassy expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging and rainforest destruction. \c\c In February 2018 the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests, a decision that recieved criticism in Borneo and Japan. \c\cAfter consulting the organisation's Athletes\' Commission on guidelines prohibiting protests at the Olympics, such as protesting against human rights abuses or taking a knee on the podium, the IOC decided to uphold the ban. \c\cOfficials have said that by early June, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit. "There's no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections," the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said, also stating he does not believe this will impact the operation of the Games. \c\cThe Nomura Research Institute estimated that cancelling the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021 would cost around 1.81 trillion yen ($17 billion), less than the economic damages projected if another state of emergency is declared, noting that a decision to hold the games "should be made based on the impact on infection risks, not from the standpoint of economic loss."\c\cEmperor Naruhito, Honorary Patron for the Tokyo 2020 Games, is said to be "extremely worried about the current status of coronavirus infections," and "concerned that while there are voices of anxiety among the public, the holding (of the events) may lead to the expansion of infections". \c\cMeals containing ingredients from Fukushima Prefecture being served in the Olympic Village has been a source of concern, and countries such as South Korea have started their own food service for its athletes and staff. \c\cOn 23 July, hundreds of anti-Olympic protestors gathered outside the Japan National Stadium before the opening ceremony. Security guards blocked reporters from leaving the stadium to interview protestors\c\cThe opening ceremony music included arrangements of video game soundtracks originating in Japan; however, this included Dragon Quest series music composed by Koichi Sugiyama, who has been characterized as homophobic and ultranationalist. \c\cSeveral controversial issues occurred in the preparations for the events, and several members of the Organising Committee resigned as a  result of them. \c\cThe official emblems of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were designed by Kenjirō Sano [ja] and unveiled in July 2015, but they were withdrawn and replaced until next year, following plagiarism accusations. The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his design was plagiarised, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs. \c\cOn 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics instead of Istanbul or Madrid. In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games. \c\cIn February 2021, the president of the Tokyo Olympics Committee Yoshiro Mori resigned, facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks. The following president Seiko Hashimoto's previous conduct has also drawn criticisms, leading her to comment "I regret it and think I should be careful" on one of the accusations. In May, a top Japanese government adviser, Prof. Yoichi Takahashi, resigned following backlash over his tweets joking about Japan's pandemic "ripple". \c\cThe head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies, Hiroshi Sasaki [ja], resigned in March, after making demeaning comments about Naomi Watanabe. \c\cOn 14 July 2021, the Organising Committee announced the creative team for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics and Paralympics, and included Keigo Oyamada of Cornelius as a composer for the opening ceremony. A large amount of people on social media said he was ineligible for such a role because he is widely known for his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome. Such abuses on his peers when at school included forcing them to eat their excrement and masturbate in front of other students, and he himself often boasted about the disability abuse stories in several interviews. On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, the Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games announced their support of him as a composer and vowed not to change his selection for the ceremonies. Toshirō Mutō, the chief executive of the Organising Committee, said he wanted Oyamada to remain involved. Growing criticism forced Oyamada to announce his resignation on 19 July. \c\cOn 21 July, Japanese media reported that Kentarō Kobayashi, who is the director of the opening and closing ceremonies after Sasaki resigned, utilized the Holocaust by Nazi Germany in a script for his comedy in 1998, and made malicious and anti-Semitic jokes including "Let's play Jews genocide game (Let's play Holocaust)." The Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC), a Jewish human rights organization, immediately issued a statement of condemnation at the anti-Semitic jokes. On 22 July, the day before the opening ceremony, the Organising Committee announced they would dismiss Kobayashi. On the eve of the opening ceremony, Yoshihide Suga, who is the Prime Minister of Japan and the Supreme Advisor of the Organising Committee, described Kobayashi's jokes as "outrageous and unacceptable", but also said that the opening ceremony, which directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned. \c\cOn 23 July, the day of the opening ceremony, some media reported that Latyr Sy, a Senegalese artist, wrote on his Facebook page a denunciation of the Organising Committee for canceling his performance in the opening ceremony due to him being African. Sy said about the Organising Committee, "It’s totally racist". At a regular press conference held the next morning, Masanori Takaya [ja], a spokesperson of the organising committee, said Sy's claim was completely different from the facts, and said "We had planned a music part in which many singers would participate, but due to infectious disease control and budget, we canceled the part itself. Therefore we canceled the appearance of all the participants in the music part. That is the background of that story."\c\cSony and Panasonic are partnering with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics. In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games. Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games. \c\cThe Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to be broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38 billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserts that a "right of abatement" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to "negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams. According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. \c\cIn Europe, this will be the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics cover almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia. Eurosport plans to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these are set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights. In France, these will be the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France Télévisions. Eurosport is scheduled to debut as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure. \c\cIn Canada, the 2020 Games are scheduled to be shown on CBC/Radio-Canada platforms, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN. In Australia, they will be aired by the Seven Network. In the Indian subcontinent, they will be aired by Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN).
A series of protests against the Cuban government and the ruling Communist Party of Cuba began on 11 July 2021, triggered by a shortage of food and medicine and the government's response to the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba. \c\cThe protests have been described as the largest anti-government demonstrations since the Maleconazo in 1994. Protesters were disaffected by "the government's strict authoritarianism" according to The Independent, and some journalists, such as Cuban Washington Post columnist Abraham Jiménez Enoa, stated that Cuba's political system triggered or prompted the protests, even more than the United States embargo against Cuba, which is described as still part of the problem. Some news outlets, such as NBC News, Reuters, and Vox, mentioned curbs on civil liberties due the strict COVID-19 pandemic lockdown rules imposed by the government and the lack of promised economic and political reforms in light of the crisis. \c\cMany international figures have called for dialogue, asking that the Cuban authorities respect the protesters\' freedom of assembly and peaceful demonstrations, and for an end to the American embargo. Protesters abroad have called for the United States to provide humanitarian aid, while some Cuban exiles and Floridian politicians have also called for military United States foreign intervention. As of 14 July, one person has been confirmed dead during a clash between protesters and police; the dissident organization Cuba Decide estimates five deaths. As a result of the protests, the Cuban government has lifted some import restrictions, and the United States government has announced new sanctions on Cuban officials. \c\cIn 2020, the economic situation in Cuba worsened. The Cuban economy contracted by 10.9% in 2020, and by 2% in the first six months of 2021. The economic crises emerged from a combination of factors, including reduced financial support (subsidized fuel) from Cuba's ally Venezuela, the United States embargo against Cuba and United States sanctions (tightened by the Trump administration in 2019), and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the industry of tourism in Cuba and led to a decrease in remittances from Cubans abroad. Currency reform, which limited Cuban pesos exchange for United States dollars because the government needed the reform package to finance imports, led to soaring inflation, with rates estimated to be 500%. The economic situation has been exacerbated by sanctions, and some observers have blamed inefficiencies of Cuba's Soviet style-centrally planned economy, and a lack of reforms that other communist states have taken, with Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia, saying reforms in Cuba "do not depend on the embargo, and the embargo should be eliminated unilaterally, independently from reforms in Cuba. Both cause problems." The Cuban government has blamed the crisis on the trade embargo and its tightness as well as the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Cuban scholar Lillian Guerra, the food shortages and high prices are the result of government spending money on building hotels and tourists facilities. \c\cDeteriorating economic conditions led to reductions in Cubans\' standard of living, shortages of food and other basic products, a shortage in hard currency, and persistent power outages. Promised economic reforms, which according to NBC News\' Carmen Sesin were needed and are another cause of discontent alongside the embargo, did not materialize, in part because of the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic according to the Cuban government. Cuba was not eligible for free COVID-19 vaccines from the from the COVAX initiative, and decided not to pay for them, nor to buy foreign ones, opting to develop its own one instead, the Soberana 02. News outlets, such as the Miami Herald and The Wall Street Journal, described the vaccine rollout process as "delayed" and "slow", and said it angered some Cubans and prompted their calls for more vaccines. At the time the protests had broken out, about 15% of the Cuban population was fully vaccinated. In 2021, COVID-19 cases began to surge especially in the Matanzas Province, and the situation was further aggravated by the shortage of medicines and food. Cuba responded by deploying more doctors to the province. \c\cThe protests were also fuelled by dissatisfaction with lack of civil liberties, such as freedom of assembly and political freedom, in Cuba's tightly-controlled government, which The Washington Post's Anthony Faiola described as "an authoritarian government struggling to cope with increasingly severe blackouts, food shortages and a spiking coronavirus outbreak", with protesters "demanding an end to the 62-year dictatorship" according to The Wall Street Journal. It exerts tight control using its intelligence, police, and security apparatus, which has been described by analysts as a police state that has provided intelligence support to allied governments, such as Nicaragua and Venezuela. The government's curbs and clampdowns on Cubans\' civil liberties has prompted resentment. In addition, while Cuba's measures during the pandemic, such as closed borders and no tourism, were praised for having greatly limited the number of COVID-19 infections the previous year, they were very strict and came at the expense of the economy. \c\cIncreased use of social media also mobilized participants in the demonstrations; internet access in Cuba began to sure in 2008, and 3G mobile phone service came to the island in 2019, leading to widespread adoption. In a July 2019 article for The Washington Post, Faiola stated that "Cubans are using social media to air their grievances — and the government is responding, sometimes." At that time, they were not demanding political change but wanted their government to be more responsive. Due to the evolving crises, a social media campaign using the hashtags SOSCUBA and SOSMATANZAS was initiated to collect money, medical materials, food, and other supplies to be sent to Cuba. Various international figures such as Don Omar, Ricardo Montaner, Alejandro Sanz, Nicky Jam, J Balvin, Daddy Yankee, Becky G, and Mia Khalifa joined the request. The Cuban government recognized the crisis describing it as "very complex" but rejected a proposed humanitarian corridor and described the campaign as an attempt to misrepresent the situation. The Cuban government set up a bank account to receive aid and said that it was open to receive donations, although the designated account is in a Cuban bank under United States sanctions. According to the Miami Herald, the Cuban government has historically refused or seized aid coming from Cuban exiles. During the protests, as the government shut down access to several social media websites, over one million protesters began using the tool Psiphon. \c\cOn 11 July 2021, at least two demonstrations emerged in San Antonio de los Baños, near Havana, and Palma Soriano, in the province of Santiago de Cuba, singing the song "Patria y Vida" ("Homeland and Life"), which inspired the protests according to Nancy San Martín and Mimi Whitefield. The song's name is an inversion of the Cuban Revolution motto Patria o Muerte ("Homeland or Death"). Videos of protesters singing slogans of "Down with Communism" (also shouted by protesters in the United States), "Freedom", and "We are not afraid" were broadcast on social networks, in addition to protesters demanding vaccines and an end to repression, which was aggravated by the economic crisis and the pandemic. Opposition media outlets such as Radio y Televisión Martí have published social media videos of protests in Malecón, Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Santa Clara, Ciego de Ávila, Camagüey, Bayamo, Guantánamo, San José de las Lajas, Holguín, and Cárdenas. According to Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, an exiled dissident of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, there were protests in more than fifteen cities and towns in Cuba. Gutiérrez asked the United States government to lead an international intervention to prevent protesters from being "victims of a bloodbath" (baño de sangre). The San Isidro Movement called on the protesters to march to Malecón. Writing in Slate, Ted Henken suggested that the Cuban demonstrators\' use of the Internet to mobilize and publicize the protests showed "that the Internet can still be a force for democracy" and wrote that "in authoritarian contexts like Cuba, where the government has long since monopolized the mass media and transformed journalism into political propaganda, access to unfiltered channels of information and communication can indeed shift the balance of power in small but powerful ways."\c\cCuban president and First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Díaz-Canel said that the United States embargo against Cuba and economic sanctions were responsible for the conditions that led to the unrest. He urged government-supporting citizens to take to the streets in counter-protest to respond to the demonstrations, saying in a special television broadcast: "The order to fight has been given — into the street, revolutionaries!" The government called the protests counter-revolutionary. Younger Cubans comprised the majority of protesters, while some members of older generations responded to demonstrations, assisting Cuban authorities. \c\cFollowing Díaz-Canel's statements, about 300 government supporters arrived at El Capitolio; the Miami Herald reported that one Associated Press (AP) cameraman was assaulted by these counter-protesters, while a separate AP photographer was injured by police. AP photographer Ramon Espinosa was detained by authorities as well. San Antonio residents reported that the police repressed protesters and detained certain participants. In videos circulated on social media, people were seen throwing stones at police, while reports of authorities beating demonstrators were heard. By the evening, protests had dissipated. \c\cCuban journalist Yoani Sánchez reported that after the protests on 11 July some were injured and there were hundreds of detentions. José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Human Rights Watch's Americas division, said: "This is pretty massive. My sense is that this is a combination of social unrest based on a lack of freedoms, and covid, and economic conditions. The lack of access to electricity. The blackouts. ... People are screaming for freedom." Cuban journalist Abraham Jiménez Enoa tweeted from Havana: "Cuba is an island ruled by the military for 62 years. Today there is no food, no medicine, and people are dying like flies from Covid. People got tired. This country is losing even fear." The small class of private entrepreneurs in Cuba, such as Nidialys Acosta, said that protests in the middle of a pandemic are not the solution and do not agree with Diaz-Canel inciting the revolutionaries to the streets either. The Washington Post quoted Acosta as saying: "I could not believe the magnitude. People are tired. It has been aggravated in recent weeks by blackouts. There are blackouts of six hours in a row in the countryside."\c\cOn 12 July, more protests were reported in Cuba. Camila Acosta, a journalist from the Spanish newspaper ABC, was arrested. Internet watchdog NetBlocks reported that social media platforms in Cuba were censored beginning on 12 July 2021, although virtual private networks were able to bypass government blockages and with a police presence in the streets of Havana. Dozens of women gathered in front of police stations to inquire about the whereabouts of their husbands, children and relatives arrested or disappeared during the events of the previous day. Faced with the accusations of missing persons, Díaz-Canel stated: "They have already come up with the fact that in Cuba we repress, we murder. Where are the Cuban murders? Where is the Cuban repression? Where are the disappeared in Cuba?"\c\cA meeting of the top leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba including former First Secretary Raúl Castro was held where the issue of the protests was addressed, releasing a statement that "the provocations orchestrated by counterrevolutionary elements, organized and financed from the United States with destabilizing purposes, were analyzed." Díaz-Canel accused the United States of using a policy of "economic asphyxiation [to] cause social unrest" in Cuba. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla labeled the protesters as vandals. Authorities blocked access to social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, and Instagram. \c\cStarting on 12 July, some abroad supporters and Cuban exiles in Florida called for military United States foreign intervention. Miami mayor Francis X. Suarez stated the United States should consider air strikes against Cuba. Some international politicians and abroad Cubans blamed the United States embargo against Cuba. The Cuban government blamed the protests on United States interference and "U.S.-financed \'counter-revolutionaries\' exploiting hardship caused by the decades-old U.S. trade embargo that Washington tightened in the midst of the pandemic, pushing the Cuban economy to the brink."\c\cCuba's Ministry of Interior stated that it "mourns the death" of a 36-year-old man named as Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, who had taken part to the protests. The Cuban dissident organization Cuba Decide estimated a toll of five deaths during the protests. \c\cDuring a live interview with the Spanish television program Todo es mentira, Cuban YouTuber and activist Dina Stars was detained by Cuban security officers. She was later released after being accused of promoting protests in Cuba and stated that "they didn\'t torture me or kidnap me." In Miami, Florida, protesters temporarily blocked the Palmetto Expressway in both directions in order to show support for the Cuban protesters. Some newspapers reported that the protesters were in violation of a Florida anti-riot law; however, none of the protesters have been charged, and Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis said he did not think the law applied. \c\cIn response to protesters tired of hardship and wanting change, former Cuban central bank economist Pavel Vidal stated: "There is a lack of credibility over the promised reforms. ... It's not just the economic crisis. People don\'t have hope in getting out of the crisis in a definitive way." The United States State Department said it expedites any request to export humanitarian or medical supplies to Cuba, which imported $123 million worth of chicken from the United States in the first six months of 2021. \c\cThe web page CiberCuba released a video where allegedly a black beret-wearing group, the Cuban police, break into the house of a demonstrator and fire at him immediately in front of his wife and children, detaining him afterwards. According to the organization of lawyers Cubalex, over 200 people have been detained and many remain in detention as of 15 July. Deputy Minister of the Interior Jesús Manuel Burón Tabit questioned decision-making within the ministry and the Security Council as well as what he called the excessive use of police force to repress the demonstrations; the Cuban government denied that he resigned after his statements. \c\cIn order to deal with the shortages, the Cuban Chamber of Commerce lifted customs restrictions that limited imports of hygiene products, medicine and food, which one of the protesters demanded the government should do. Travelers would be allowed to bring these products into Cuba between 19 July and 31 December 2021 without being subject to customs duties. In addition, directors of state-owned enterprises would be given the authority to determine their employees\' salaries, while small- and medium-sized privately-owned businesses would be able to be organized. The government also announced it would be improving on the electricity system, of which problems ETECSA did not provide explanation until Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla attribute them to power outages and difficulties with food or transportation. Access to internet in Cuba was partially restored, although with an unstable network of intermittent functionality, while access to social media and instant messaging applications remained blocked. \c\cDíaz-Canel stated that there are three kinds of protesters: counter-revolutionaries, criminals, and those with legitimate frustrations. In a national address on Wednesday evening, Díaz-Canel called on Cubans not to "act with hate" but also admitted some failures by the government, explaining: "We have to gain experience from the disturbances. We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."\c\cCuba's Foreign Affairs Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla claimed to have "irrefutable proof that the majority of those that took part in this (internet) campaign were in the United States and used automated systems to make content go viral, without being penalized by Twitter", which analysts from the Agence France-Presse (AFP) found it to be "at best an exaggeration" in an article published on 16 July. \c\cCuban officials rallied tens of thousands of supporters in the streets on Saturday. Former first secretary Raul Castro and Cuban president Díaz-Canel were among the thousands who attended a government-organized demonstration and spoke during the event. The turnout at the rally was said by the government to be around 100,000. Díaz-Canel reiterated blame of the unrest on the United States and the embargo, which he described as "the blockade, aggression and terror", as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a social media campaign by Cuban American groups, but he later acknowledged also some responsibility by Cuba's leaders. About the protesters, Díaz-Canel stated that there were four sectors involved in the protests: radical supporters of the United States who waved that country's flag during the protests and demanded military intervention, criminals who took advantage of the situation to loot, people genuinely desperate due to the impact of the crisis on their daily lives, and young people who felt disenfranchised. \c\cIn response to the government concessions, José Jasan Nieves, director of the independent digital newspaper El Toque, stated: "The Cuban government has just shown that it could have allowed the entry of food and medicine without quantity limits or tariffs all along but chose not to do so for more than a year of the pandemic." According to Cuban economist Omar Everleny Pérez, the measures announced by the government, such as permits for private entrepreneurs to import goods without going through the state and allowing foreign companies to install retail markets or raising the ceiling for agricultural prices in order to increase supply, "are positive measures, but they are insufficient. Without affecting the ideology, there is a lot of space in which the state can take action." William M. LeoGrande said the economic challenges are great, commenting: "I think the government is just trying to signal to people that it understands their desperation and that it's going to try to alleviate some of the misery that they\'re experiencing. The problem is that the government just doesn\'t have much in the way of resources that it can devote to doing that."\c\cAccording to the Miami Herald, various young protesters, including minors, have been arrested by Cuban authorities and subjected to summary trials under the accusation of "public disorder." Cuban lawyer Laritza Diversent told the Miami Herald that summary trials in Cuba have been "an express procedure for minor crimes" since 1959. She added that "there is almost no documentation of the whole process, making any appeal difficult. It is very arbitrary." The Miami Herald also quoted a Cuban visual artist researching the protests as saying: "The fact that they are charging people with public disorder shows they were just peaceful protesters and did not commit any crimes."\c\cAccording to a report by the Spanish NGO Prisoners Defenders, more than 178 persons have disappeared during the protests in Cuba, and have not had "contact with their relatives and for whom no document on their location exists." The alleged missing people include dissident and Patriotic Union of Cuba executive secretary José Daniel Ferrer, dissident rap singer Luis Manuel Otero, and dissident and human rights activist Guillermo Fariñas. The report mentioned journalist Camila Acosta, who was covering the protests for the Spanish newspaper ABC; however, she was put under house arrest and published a report on the 25 July describing her experiences. The whereabouts of Ferrer are also known; the San Isidro Movement stated that he was moved to a high-security prison, same as Otero. The UN Working Group against Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances has forwarded a request to the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations to take action regarding the alleged disappearances. \c\cBoth the government and some of its critics have advised Cubans to be careful of non-verified information, as some of the stories were amplified by Cubans abroad in support of the protests. The Cuban government said that "stories, which spread on social media and messaging apps, were part of a broader U.S.-backed attempt by counter-revolutionaries to destabilize the country", while government critics accused the authorities of planting the stories "to muddy online waters with misinformation and sow confusion so that no-one trusts future news of unrest."  According to Reuters, fake news spread following the protests in Cuba. Among them are that former first secretary Raúl Castro had fled to Cuba's ally Venezuela, protesters had kidnapped a provincial Communist Party of Cuba chief, and Caracas was sending in troops. \c\cThe Cuban government said such stories were spread by counter-revolutionaries, while critics said that they may have come from the authorities themselves, with Al Jazeera noting that neither provided evidence for their claims and that Reuters was not able to ascertain the origins of the stories. Mexican-based communications specialist José Raúl Gallego stated: "Often it is state security launching these kind of rumors to afterwards ... say they are foreign-directed campaigns to manipulate Cubans so people stop trusting in information circulating outside government control." According to Al Jazeera, the proliferation of manufactured or misleading videos and content on social media has become a common feature of recent protests around the world, such as in Bolivia, Chile, France, and the United States. In addition, posts shared thousands of times were mislabeled as Cuban protests, including photos from a large crowd during Cuba's 2018 May Day march and a protest from the Egyptian revolution of 2011. \c\cThe Cuban government has also blamed "a Twitter campaign orchestrated by the United States", pointing out that the SOSCuba hashtag "launched in early July to highlight Cuba's healthcare crisis, the spike in Covid-19 cases, and to plead for foreign humanitarian aid"; however, experts from the AFP stated that this view was an exaggeration. Spanish social media expert Julian Macias Tovar told the AFP that there is something strange in the figures around the hashtag and something does not add up, pointing out that between 5–8 July there were just 5,000 tweets, then suddenly went to 100,000 tweets on 9 July, 1.5 million on 10 July, and 2 million on 12 July. According to Macias Tovar, the accounts tweeting the hashtag "came from many different places, and I believe there's an international network of accounts linked ideologically", the same accounts that attacked Mexico's leftist president Andrés Manuel López Obrador and the leftist governments of Argentina and Spain, and that this was a case of fake accounts or automated accounts programmed to produce a large number of tweets. Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at the information technology firm Kentik, was more skeptical, stating: "Someone sends a tweet in the United States that puts people on the streets in Cuba? I find it hard to believe. I don\'t know if one could sit and try to create a Twitter campaign that holds such sway over the average Cuban that out of the air they convince them to do things they wouldn\'t otherwise have done." While acknowledging that there were automated tweets, Madory stated that it is "probably true also of the government themselves", which can cut off internet access. \c\cSeveral Western media outlets, such as El País, the Financial Times, Fox News, La Nación, The New York Times, RTVE, La Sexta, Voice of America, and The Washington Times, published photos of a pro-government protest which they erroneously captioned as a photo as an anti-government one. CNN published an image of a Miami demonstration in a story about demonstrations in Cuba, while only The Guardian amended a 12 July 2021 article because the original caption on the image of people on the Máximo Gómez monument described them as anti-government protesters, when they were in fact protesters in support of the government. As reported by The Express Tribune, journalists Ben Norton and Alan MacLeod were among the first to note the error, and MacLeod suggested they may have simply copied and pasted the Associated Press's original photo caption, replicating the error across multiple news outlets. \c\cCuban political scientist Harold Cardenas stated that "it would be a simplification to say it's a US campaign because there are obviously many other reasons behind the protests. ... I know communists that were detained the other day for taking part in protests. That's not to say that the United States has no responsibility in the unrest [through its sanctions that] intentionally asphyxiate the Cuban people." Cardenas added that social media has been "used to create parallel realities", mentioning fake news and doctored images shared in Cuba during the protests, and "[t]here has been an effort from abroad to create uncertainty in the country", but criticized the Cuban government for "attributing an exaggerated importance to Twitter", as people are genuinely "fed up and economically exhausted." Macias Tovar agreed with Cardenas, stating: "Beyond this being a campaign orchestrated [from abroad] there are people who are mobilizing, people who are demonstrating against the government, people who have petitions [—] what the Cuban government must do is respect the right to protest."\c\cCubans residing in Chile marched to the Cuban consulate in Santiago in support of the protests. Protests in Miami urging the United States to provide aid for the protests in Cuba have taken place. Demonstrations also took place at the Puerta del Sol in Madrid, Spain. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, a protest took place in front of the Cuban embassy in Buenos Aires with protesters holding placards with the phrases Patria y vida and others with the slogan S.O.S. Cuba. In São Paulo, Brazil, political parties and social movements staged a protest in favor of the Cuban government and "in defense of sovereignty" in front of the Consulate General of Cuba. A Change.org petition calling for the United States government to invade Cuba, started by a Belgian citizen, gained nearly 500,000 signatures by 21 July. \c\cOn 13 July 2021, a protest march was held starting at 6 pm between North Bergen, New Jersey, and West New York. The march would go along Bergenline Avenue, starting at 79th Street in North Bergen and ending at 60th Street in West New York. Northern Hudson County, New Jersey, has a sizable Cuban American population in it. About 300–400 people would attend a protest march in Las Vegas, Nevada, marching along the Las Vegas Strip that night. \c\cThree people were arrested in Tampa, Florida, during a demonstration in support of the protests on the evening of 13 July 2021. Two of those were arrested under Florida's recently passed anti-riot law, the Combating Public Disorder Act. All three were charged with resisting without violence, while two were charged under battery on a law enforcement officer. A Florida Highway Patrol trooper would be injured while trying to assist police officers in an arrest in Tampa during the protest there. In Orlando, an arrest was made during a protest that night. A crowd of about 500 people would gather near the intersection of Semoran Boulevard and Curry Ford Road. The crowd would eventually end spilling into the street blocking southbound traffic and once the crowd went into the street, the Orlando Police Department would ask them to disperse for 15 minutes in English and Spanish. A man was arrested after refusing to move off the street as he was sitting there when he was asked by the police. \c\cA group of Cuban exiles showed intention to sail into Cuba with supplies in order to support the protests. The United States Navy issued a statement asking Cubans to not cross the Straits of Florida in unauthorized vessels, recalling the deaths of 20 Cubans trying to cross the straits in recent weeks before that date: "The Coast Guard along with our local, state and federal partners are monitoring any activity ..., including unpermitted vessel departures from Florida to Cuba."\c\cOn 15 July 2021, a small group of Florida State University students with the Cuban-American Student Association gathered at the Florida State Capitol in solidarity with the demonstrators. On 16 July 2021, protesters scrawled Cuba Libre ("Free Cuba") on the street outside the Embassy of Cuba in Washington, D.C. In Miami, "a few dozen" would march for about two miles along Eight Street. Protests in Florida outside of Miami would be seen that day in Fort Myers, Florida, with protesters walking along the Fort Myers Music Walk located in the city's downtown area. \c\cOn 13 and 16 July 2021, demonstrations of Cuban exiles occurred in Downtown Halifax, Canada. Protesters wore signs in support of those in Cuba, some of them calling for an international military intervention in the island nation. Protesters also chanted the song "Patria y Vida" ("Homeland and Life"). One protester told the local press: "Tell the world that we are fighting for our freedom." At the base of the Freedom Tower in Miami, there would be protests on July 17. Several thousand are believed to have attended with the protest starting the afternoon and going into the evening. It ended when the Freedom Tower was illuminated in the colors of the Cuban flag. \c\c Antigua and Barbuda's Ambassador to the United States Ronald Sanders criticized the behavior of the United States in not normalizing the relations between the two countries. In an opinion piece, he blamed the United States for the lack of all kind of freedom in Cuba and called for an end to the United States embargo against Cuba. \c\c Argentina's President Alberto Fernández said that he could not say exactly what was happening in Cuba but supported the end of the embargo. \c\c Barbados's Foreign Affairs Minister Jerome Walcott called for an end to the embargo, labeling it as an "unjustified punishment on Cubans" that was isolating Cuba from the international community. \c\c Bolivia's President Luis Arce expressed his support for the Cuban people who "fight against destabilizing actions." Former President Evo Morales accused the United States of launching a new Operation Condor. \c\c Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro commented that it was a sad day for Cuba because people requested freedom and received shots, attacks, and prison instead. He said that there are people in Brazil who support Cuba, Venezuela, and "those kinds of people."\c\c Canada said it "supports the right to freedom of expression and assembly and calls on all parties to uphold this fundamental right." Global Affairs Canada said that all sides should "exercise restraint" and "engage in peaceful and inclusive dialogue."\c\c Chile's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement condemning the repression in order "to silence protesters who peacefully claim greater freedom, better health system and better quality of life." It also added that "freedom of expression and peaceful assembly must be guaranteed."\c\c China's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian called for the lifting of the United States embargo on Cuba, which he said was responsible for shortage of medicine and energy in the country. \c\c Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso called on the Cuban government to "start a democratic process to put an end to this situation."\c\c Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said: "I want to express my solidarity with the Cuban people. I believe that a solution must be found through dialogue without the use of force, without confrontation, without violence. And it has to be Cubans who decide because Cuba is a free country, independent and sovereign. There must not be interventionism, and the health situation of the Cuban people must not be used with political purposes." López Obrador offered Mexico's help with food and vaccines, and said that the best way to help Cuba is to end the United States blockade. \c\c Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega sent his expressions of support to Miguel Díaz-Canel, condemning the "permanent blockade, destabilization and aggression" against Cuba. \c\c North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated through its spokesperson that "the anti-government protests that occurred in Cuba are an outcome of behind-the-scene manipulation by the outside forces coupled with their persistent anti-Cuba blockade scheming to obliterate socialism and the revolution", and expressed its support to the Cuban government. \c\c Peru's Interim President Francisco Sagasti supported the protesters to "express freely and peacefully" and invoked the Cuban authorities to "consider their requirements in a democratic spirit."\c\c Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia stated through its spokesperson Maria Zakharova that it is "unacceptable for there to be outside interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state or any destructive actions that would encourage the destabilization of the situation on the island."\c\c Saint Vincent and the Grenadines's Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves issued a statement in support of the Cuban government. \c\c Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement recognizing the right of Cubans "to demonstrate freely and peacefully" and that "forms of aid that could alleviate the situation" will be studied. In Spain, the Cuban protests provoked debate and political controversy, as Spanish right-wing politicians demanded a more serious condemnation of the Cuban government from the Spanish authorities, that the Spanish government qualify it as a dictatorship, and that Spain make the European Union adopt an active opposition policy towards it. When asked if Cuba was a dictatorship, left-wing Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez responded: "It is evident that Cuba is not a democracy. That said, it has to be Cuban society that finds that path (of prosperity) and the international community that helps it find that path." These acts from right-wing politicians have received criticism, being accused of using the protests as an opposition tactic against Sánchez-led left-wing government. The lack of similar harsh condemnation  by the political right against events in other countries, such as in Colombia, human rights in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's repression in Egypt, was also criticized. \c\c United States\' President Joe Biden said that he supports the Cuban people and their "clarion call for freedom and relief." Julie J. Chung, Acting Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs for the United States Department of State, stated: "We are deeply concerned by \'calls to combat\' in Cuba. We stand by the Cuban people's right for peaceful assembly. We call for calm and condemn any violence." On 12 July, the White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters: "A Cuba policy shift is not currently among President Biden's top priorities." On 22 July, the United States announced new sanctions on Cuba, targeting a top Cuban military official and a special police unit, accusing the government of human rights violations, repression, and violence against peaceful protesters. \c\c Uruguay's President Luis Lacalle Pou expressed his support for the opposition protesters, saying they had "commendable courage."\c\c Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro expressed "all the support to the Cuban revolutionary government" on a phone call to Díaz-Canel. \c\c Vietnam urged the United States to "take concrete steps in the direction of normalizing relations with Cuba for the benefit of the two peoples, contributing to peace, stability and development in the region and the world."\c\c European Union's Foreign Relations Chief Josep Borrell said that "the Cuban people have a right to express their opinion" and that he would "personally call on the government there to allow peaceful demonstrations and to listen to the voice of discontent from demonstrators."\c\c Organization of American States\' Secretary General Luis Almagro condemned the "Cuban dictatorial regime for calling on civilians to repress and confronting those who exercise their rights to protest."\c\c United Nations\' High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called for the urgent release of those detained for "exercising their right to freedom of peaceful assembly, opinion and expression" in the protests. \c\cErika Guevara Rosas, director of Amnesty International for the Americas, said that "Amnesty International received with alarm reports of internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force – including police firing on demonstrators – and reports that there is a long list of missing persons." Amnesty International called on the government of Díaz-Canel to respect the right of peaceful assembly. \c\cMayor of Miami Francis X. Suarez, a Cuban American, stated it was time for a United States-led international intervention in Cuba, saying: "We are asking the federal government to do everything possible and not waste this moment." Senator from Tennessee Marsha Blackburn stated that she was in support of the protests and protesters who wanted to end "the ravages of socialism in Cuba", and asked for President Joe Biden to support the protesters. \c\cRepublican Senator from Florida Marco Rubio demanded President Biden to call on Cuba's military to support protesters, while Democratic Senator from New Jersey Bob Menendez said the United States should "stand in solidarity with the brave people of Cuba that are risking their lives today for change in their country and a future of Patria y Vida." Democratic Senator from Connecticut Chris Murphy argued that the embargo against Cuba had not worked and empowered the Cuban government. \c\cVenezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared that "the desire for change, freedom and the demand for fundamental rights are irrepressible forces. From Venezuela, we reiterate our support for the entire pro-democracy movement in Cuba."\c\cMauricio Macri, former president of Argentina, distanced himself from President Fernández and gave his full support to the demonstrators, saying: "I want to support the Cuban people in the streets requesting the end of the dictatorship and an improvement of their life conditions. Let them know that all the people in the continent and the world who share the value of liberty are with them." Similar messages were delivered by Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, mayor of Buenos Aires, and María Eugenia Vidal, former governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Macri also signed a letter of the Democratic Initiative of Spain and the Americas, alongside other former presidents. \c\cLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva, former Brazilian president, said during a candidacy for president event next year in Brazil that if Cuba did not have a blockade by the United States, the country "could be Holland", and said that the blockade was a form of "killing human beings without being at war."\c\cThe far-right Serbian Radical Party accused the United States of trying to "provoke a coup in Cuba and forcibly overthrow President Miguel Díaz-Canel", while adding that Serbia should be included in sending humanitarian aid to Cuba, considering that "Cuba is a friendly state that has not recognized the self-proclaimed independence of the so-called Kosovo."\c\cExpressing support for the protesters, Representative from New York Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the "anti-democratic actions" of the government of President Miguel Díaz-Canel, saying: "The suppression of media, speech and protest are all gross violations of civil rights." She also called on the Biden administration to end the embargo, stating: "The embargo is absurdly cruel and, like too many other U.S. policies targeting Latin Americans, the cruelty is the point. I outright reject the Biden administration's defense of the embargo." Self-described socialist Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders had earlier expressed similar thoughts. \c\cPope Francis called for peace and dialogue in Cuba, stating: "I am also close to the dear people of Cuba in these difficult times."\c\cOn 23 July 2021, over 400 prominent activists, intellectuals, scientists, and artists came together to produce an open letter to President Biden in The New York Times calling to "immediately lift Trump's 243 sanctions on Cuba and the whole embargo."
The Sinai insurgency is an ongoing insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, that was commenced by Islamist militants against Egyptian security forces, which have also included attacks on civilians. The insurgency began during the Egyptian Crisis, during which the longtime Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in the Egyptian revolution of 2011. \c\cThe Sinai insurgency initially consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) and proclaimed themselves Sinai Province, and a part of ISIL. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with the Sinai Province group and have blamed the porous border and ongoing civil war for the increase in sophisticated weapons available to the Islamist groups. \c\cEgyptian authorities have attempted to restore their presence in the Sinai through both political and military measures. Egypt launched two military operations, known as Operation Eagle in mid-2011 and then Operation Sinai in mid-2012. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup d\'état, which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred. \c\cThe fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share the same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services. Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. In November 2017, more than 300 Sufist worshippers were killed and over 100 injured in a terrorist attack on a mosque west of the city of Al-Arish. \c\cSufism was previously dominant in the region before militant jihadi ideas began to take hold. The Sinai Peninsula has long been known for its lawlessness, having historically served as a smuggling route for weapons and supplies. Security provisions in the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979 have mandated a diminished security presence in the area, enabling militants to operate with a freer hand. Moreover, the limited government-directed investment and development in Sinai has discriminated against the local Bedouin population, a population that values tribal allegiance over all else. The combination of Sinai's harsh terrain and lack of resources have kept the area poor and hence ripe for militancy. \c\cFollowing the January 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak's regime, the country became increasingly destabilized, creating a security vacuum in the Sinai Peninsula. Radical Islamic elements in Sinai exploited the opportunity, using the unique environment, in launching several waves of attacks upon Egyptian military and commercial facilities. \c\cAccording to The Economist, the conflict also involves local armed Bedouins "who have long-standing grievances against the central government in Cairo" and that "they are barred from joining the army or police; they find it hard to get jobs in tourism; and they complain that many of their lands have been taken from them". \c\cSince the 2011 uprising against the Mubarak regime in Egypt, there has been increasing instability in the Sinai Peninsula. In addition, the collapse of the Libyan regime increased the quantity and sophistication of weapons being smuggled into the area. The situation provided local Bedouin with an opportunity to assert their authority, leading to clashes with Egyptian security forces, but the cause of violence soon transitioned to salafi jihadism. Hard-line militant Muslims used Sinai as a launch-point for attacks against Israel and turned on the Egyptian state, focusing on Egypt's security establishment and the Sinai's Arab Gas Pipeline. \c\cIn August 2011, Egypt launched Operation Eagle in an effort to restore law and order, driving Islamist insurgents and criminal gangs out of North Sinai's urban centers, and to attempt to sever the link between militant groups in the Sinai and Gaza by augmenting its control over the Gaza border crossing. \c\cThe operation had limited success, and a week into the operation, Salafi jihadists carried out the biggest cross-border attack on Israel in the post-Mubarak period. \c\cOn 5 August 2012, an attack on the Rafah barracks shook the Egyptian military and population. Only a month into his term, President Mohamed Morsi sacked the longstanding defence minister and promoted General al Sisi in his place. Operation Sinai was launched, aimed at eliminating armed Islamist groups, protecting the Suez Canal, and destroying the tunnel network connecting the Sinai with the Gaza Strip. During the operation, 32 militants and suspects were killed and 38 arrested, while 2 civilians were killed by early September 2012. \c\cSince the July 2013 coup against President Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, Egyptian military and security services in particular were targeted by Sinai-based Islamist groups. In an increase in violence, security forces came under near daily attack throughout July to August 2013. \c\cIn 2013, the new authorities adopted a more aggressive strategy, leading to mass arrests and harsh security measures. \c\cOver the few months leading to 2014, the Egyptian army gained the upper hand in the battle against militias that had found safe haven in the peninsula. After isolating and largely clearing the populated northeastern Sinai, the army put many militant factions on the defensive, most notably Ansar Bait al-Maqdis. However, one thousand armed militiamen were still sheltering in the main stronghold in Jabal Halal, as well as Jabal Amer area. \c\cIn November 2014, the situation in the Sinai was thrust into the spotlight with the deadliest attack on the security forces since 2011, and the group responsible Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis pledging allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forming the Sinai Province. \c\cIn the wake of the attack on the security forces, the government declared state of emergency, imposing a curfew and establish a buffer zone in the Sinai's border area with Gaza. \c\cIn May 2013, a number of Egyptian Army police officers were taken hostage by armed tribesmen in the Sinai Peninsula, with videos released on the internet with them begging for their lives. As a response, Egypt's government built up security forces in northern Sinai as part of an effort to secure the release of six policemen and a border guard kidnapped by suspected militants. On 20–21 May, Egyptian troops and police, backed by helicopter gunships, conducted a sweep through a number of villages in northern Sinai, along the border with Israel. The officials said the forces came under fire from gunmen in vehicles, triggering the clashes. The clashes left one gunman dead by 21 May. The hostages were released on 22 May after talks between the captors and Bedouins. One suspect in the kidnapping was arrested on 30 May 2013. \c\cAfter Morsi's ouster on 3 July by Sisi, there was an increase in violence by armed Bedouin and Islamists. Attacks on security forces took place almost daily — leading many to link the militants there to the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group from which Morsi hails. \c\cIn response, Egypt launched a major military operation in Sinai against the militants, bringing in two additional battalions. \c\cIn the two weeks following 3 July, 39 terrorist attacks occurred in North Sinai. In the resulting clashes between armed groups and security forces, 52 gunmen and civilians and six security personnel died. On 15 July, a bus transporting workers to the army-operated Al-Arish Cement Company was attacked leaving five killed and 15 wounded, the highest civilian casualties. On 16 July, attacks resulted in some of the most intense army engagement, concentrated at Al-Masa\'id, Al-Joura, and the Central Security camp at Al-Ahrash. \c\cSecurity operations have been largely confined to the 40-kilometre area between Al-Arish and Sheikh Zuweid, extending northward toward Rafah along the border with Israel and up to the Karen Abu Salem crossing. Fighting intensified between the gunmen and the joint army-police forces at night. The frequency of attacks varied from two to five in a single day. In addition, targets expanded from fixed security checkpoints to mobile patrols. In most operations, the gunmen used four-wheel drive vehicles and combinations of light and heavy weaponry. However, in three attacks RPG-7 launchers were used, most likely smuggled from Libya. These grenades are capable of penetrating armoured vehicles and are generally fired at the doors. \c\cOn 27 July, an operation dubbed "Desert Storm" was launched by the Egyptian army in North Sinai Governorate to last for 48 hours. Two of Egypt's field armies, as well as the country's air force and navy reportedly took part in the large-scale operation. The military were said to have blocked all the roads, bridges and tunnels leading from Northern Sinai to other provinces.[citation needed]\c\cA bomb was placed at a hotel frequented by security officials on 2 August 2013, though it caused no injuries. A security source told the Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm that a majority of "terrorists" had been arrested as of 3 August 2013. 2 mausoleums were bombed on 4 August 2013, though no injuries resulted. \c\cTwenty-five Egyptian policemen died in an attack in the northern region of Sinai, on 18 August. After militants forced two mini-buses carrying off-duty policemen to stop, ordered the policemen out and forced them to lie on the ground before shooting them. The Egyptian military arrested eleven people, including five Hamas members, three local residents and three foreign nationals,  for their alleged involvement in the killings. The person who committed the murders confessed on 1 September 2013. \c\cMilitary spokesperson Ahmed Ali said that Egyptian security forces operations in Sinai, from 5 July to 23 August, resulted in 78 suspected militants killed, including 32 foreigners; 116 people injured; and 203 people arrested, including 48 foreigners, for their alleged involvement in attacks on security checkpoints in the peninsula. Additionally 343 tunnels on the border with Gaza at Rafah were destroyed. \c\cOn 3 September, fifteen Islamist militants were killed in an attack by military helicopters. \c\cOn 7 September, the Egyptian army launched a new operation in the region involving tanks and at least six Apache helicopters. The army jammed communications to thwart militant coordination. The army combed through areas near the Gaza Strip, including locations used by militants suspected in the killing and abduction of Egyptian soldiers over the past year. In the three days of operations, after 7 September, one officer, two soldiers and 29 militants were killed, and 39 militants arrested. \c\cOn 11 September, a suicide bomber targeted Egyptian military intelligence headquarters in Rafah, bringing down the structure, at the same time a car bomb had rammed an army checkpoint. In the simultaneous attack at least nine soldiers were killed. \c\cOn 24 December, 16 were killed and over 134 injured in a huge bomb which hit the Daqahliya Security Directorate in Mansoura, in the worst attack on a government site since the ouster of Morsi in July. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, a Sinai-based group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The group deemed Egyptian troops infidels because they answer to a "secular government", warning them to desert or face death. \c\cOn 26 January, militants shot down an army Mi-17 helicopter in North Sinai, killing all five of its crew members. The weapon the insurgents used was an infrared-homing, surface-to-air missile from the Russian-made Igla family. This was the first time in Egyptian history that an armed nonstate actor dropped a state's military helicopter by a missile. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility for this attack as well as series of escalating  attacks on police and soldiers. Earlier that morning masked men in an SUV attacked a bus carrying soldiers in Sinai, killing at least three and injuring at least 11. \c\cOn 3 February, in what was described as the biggest operation in the Egyptian army's ongoing offensive against militants in the Sinai, 30 suspected militants were killed and another 15 injured in a series of airstrikes and another 16 were arrested. \c\cOn 16 February 2014, a bomb exploded on or under a tour bus of a South Korean church group in the Egyptian city of Taba, which borders the Gulf of Aqaba and Eilat, Israel. The bombing killed 4 people – 3 South Koreans and the Egyptian bus driver – and injured 17 others. According to The New York Times, the bombing could "offer worrying new evidence that militants who have been attacking Egypt's security forces for months were broadening their campaign against civilians."\c\cOn 24 October 2014, 33 army and police soldiers were killed in two separate attacks in North Sinai. The attack was the largest ever since the start of the war on terror in Sinai. As a result of the attack, president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared a state of emergency in the governorate after meeting with the National Defence Council for several hours. The state of emergency was to last for three months and to include a daily curfew from 5 pm to 7 am until further notice. \c\cOn 10 November 2014, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forming the Sinai Province group with a confusingly similar name to two Egyptian regional governments. \c\cOn 14 November 2014, ISIL published a video online that included footage of the group carrying out the October 2014 Sinai attacks. \c\cDuring 2015, the intensity and the scale of insurgent attacks expanded. \c\cOn 12 January 2015, Sinai Province kidnapped a police officer while traveling in North Sinai and took him to an unknown location. On the following day on 13 January 2015, Egyptian military spokesperson announced the discovery of the dead body of the officer after launching a search operation. He also said that during the operation 10 militants were killed, while two others were arrested. \c\cOn 26 January 2015, Sinai Province published a video online that included the kidnapping and execution of the police officer kidnapped on 12 January. \c\cOn 29 January 2015, militants from the Sinai Province militant group launched a series of attacks on army and police bases in Arish using car bombs and mortars. The attacks, which occurred in more than six different locations, resulted in 44 confirmed deaths including army personnel and civilians. \c\cIt was reported that on 6 February 2015 Egyptian security forces attacked the Sinai Province group, killing 47 Islamic militants in Northern Sinai. \c\cOn 10 March 2015, a suicide attack on a police barracks using a water tanker was stopped after security forces opened fire on the water tanker causing it to explode before it could get into the barracks. One civilian near the scene was killed and two other civilians alongside 30 policemen were wounded in the blast. \c\cOn 2 April 2015, an attack on an army checkpoint resulted in the death of 15 soldiers, 2 civilians and 15 attackers. As a response to the attack, the Egyptian army launched an operation the following day allegedly killing 100 militants. \c\cOn 8 April 2015, eleven civilians were killed in Sheikh Zuweid when an unidentified rocket-propelled grenade hit their homes. A roadside bomb killed two officers in the same city. \c\cOn 12 April 2015, 6 soldiers were killed when their armoured vehicle was bombed in North Sinai. On the same day, a separate attack on a police station in Arish resulted in the death of 5 policemen and 1 civilian. 40 were also injured, both policemen and civilians. The attack on the station was carried out by a suicide-bomber using a bomb-laden van, on which the police forces opened fire, causing a large explosion which reportedly created a large crater and shattered house windows near the police station. Militant group Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed responsibility for the attacks. \c\cOn 27 April 2015, members from Al-Tarabin tribe in North Sinai launched an attack on Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis positions in Rafah. The attack came after Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis gunmen fatally shot a member of Al-Tarabin tribe in Berth village in southern Rafah, North Sinai, after he refused to take their warning statements ordering them not to deal with the Egyptian military. \c\cOn 16 May 2015, three Egyptian judges and their driver were killed, and a fourth judge was severely wounded when gunmen opened fire on their vehicle in North Sinai. The attack came hours after a Cairo court issued a preliminary death sentence against former president Mohamed Morsi and 105 other defendants on a range of charges, including murder. \c\cOn 9 June 2015, militants fired rockets at the direction of an airport in Sinai used by the multinational peacekeeping forces. There were no casualties reported. ISIL affiliate Sinai Province claimed responsibility for the attack on several Twitter accounts linked to it. \c\cOn 1 July 2015, ISIL Sinai Province militants launched one of the largest-scale battles seen in the Sinai Peninsula since the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and the largest attack since the insurgency begun in 2011, on multiple Egyptian army checkpoints in the Sinai Peninsula, killing 21 soldiers and wounding 9. However, unknown Egyptian security and medical officials reported that up to 64 soldiers had been killed in the attacks. The attack also targeted Sheikh Zuweid police station. Reinforcements from the Second Army Zone stationed in Ismailia have been deployed to Sheikh Zuweid, including Apache helicopters and F-16 fighter jets. Militants have reportedly killed several civilians who refused to allow them onto their rooftops to target security forces. An army statement claimed the killing of more than 100 militants from the attacking force. The militant death toll increased in the following days, due to Egyptian military operations in the region, reaching 241 killed. \c\cOn 4 July 2015, a shell bomb struck a house in Sheikh Zuweid, killing a woman and her two children, the shell also seriously wounded another woman and a teenage girl.

Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan.

Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban.

Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable.

The 2021 Taliban offensive is an ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies that began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As of 15 July 2021, over a third of Afghanistan's 421 districts were controlled by the Taliban, and by 21 July, half of Afghanistan was under Taliban control. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north in May be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province.

In terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the Britain, Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan Province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban.

The first case of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City was confirmed in New York City in March 2020, though later research showed the virus had been circulating since January, with cases of community transmission confirmed as early as February. By March 27, over 23,000 cases were confirmed, which rose to 30,765 by March 29. New York City had become the worst-affected area in the country. There were over 2,000 deaths by April 6; at that stage, the city had more confirmed coronavirus cases than China, the U.K., or Iran. Bodies of the deceased were picked up from their homes by the US Army, National Guard, and Air National Guard. \c\cOn March 20, the governor's office issued an executive order closing down non-essential businesses. The city's public transportation system remained open, but transit service was reduced. By April, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers were out of work with lost tax revenues estimated to run into the billions. Low income jobs in the retail, transportation, and restaurant sectors were especially affected. By December, commercial rents had declined 13% from the previous year. \c\cThe first phase of reopening began in June with reduced occupancy ceilings. Schools reopened in September. The police department was ordered to enforce public health measures and conduct emergency inspections at private schools. Spikes in infection rates were observed in some neighborhoods, prompting shutdowns in ZIP codes that were identified as "cluster" areas. Public schools were closed again in November as the seven-day rolling average continued to rise over 3%. Indoor dining was suspended on December 14. COVID-19 vaccinations began at nursing homes on December 21. \c\cCity officials have been criticized for in early March downplaying the risks of taking the subway. Face masks were mandated throughout New York State by an executive order on April 15. In May, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) identified subways and other forms of mass transit as a critical factor that contributed to the spread of COVID-19 in New York.[not verified in body] The ongoing pandemic is the deadliest disaster by death toll in the history of New York City. \c\cAs of August 2, 2021[update], New York City has administered 10,616,315 COVID-19 vaccine doses. \c\cThe first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in New York State on March 1, 2020, in a 39-year-old health care worker who had returned home to Manhattan from Iran on February 25. Genomic analyses suggest the disease had been introduced to New York as early as January, and that most cases were linked to Europe, rather than Asia. \c\cA Queens man contracted COVID-19 via community transmission in late February, falling ill on February 29. \c\cOn March 3, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the first recorded case of person-to-person spread in New York State had been confirmed via a New Rochelle man who was working at a law firm within One Grand Central Place in Midtown Manhattan. Six days later, on March 9, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that there were 16 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City. \c\cThe virus then grew exponentially; by March 25, over 17,800 cases had been confirmed in New York City, with 199 deaths. At the time, the city's infection rate was five times higher than the rest of the country, and its cases were one-third of total confirmed US cases. The reasons for the high infection rate continue to be discussed. On March 27, infection in New York City surpassed 23,000, with 365 deaths. Queens was the worst-affected borough by number of deaths, with over a third of total deaths; the majority of the deceased had underlying health issues. Between March 28 and 29, the number of deaths in New York City tripled from the previous 24-hour period; 222 people died of the virus, bringing the city's fatalities to 672, with 30,765 confirmed cases. \c\cNew York City also saw the first case of an animal in North America testing positive for COVID-19. After the Bronx Zoo closed in mid-March, two Malayan tigers at the zoo showed signs of COVID-19 toward the end of the month. Nadia and her sister Azul both had a dry cough, wheezing, and neglected meals. Nadia and her sister both tested positive for COVID-19, while seven other large cats at the zoo also showed signs of COVID. It was assumed that the Bronx Zoo cats may have contracted the virus from humans. The area around the Zoo had been hit by the virus in high numbers. \c\cThe USNS Comfort hospital ship arrived in New York Harbor on March 30. Field hospitals were also set up in several places citywide. Refrigerator trucks were set up on city streets outside hospitals to accommodate the overflow of bodies of the deceased. On March 31, the first death of a child from COVID-19 in New York City was recorded. \c\cOn April 4, Governor Cuomo announced that the Chinese government had arranged for a donation of 1,000 ventilators to be sent to New York through foundations run by Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai. The state of Oregon was reported to be sending 140 ventilators. Trump announced that 1,000 additional federal medical soldiers would be deployed to New York City. It was reported that "Urban Area Medical Task Forces" made up of army reservists would be working in the New York City field hospitals and other parts of the country. As of April 4[update], there were 1,200 medical military personnel serving on the USNS Comfort. 2,700 New York State National Guard forces had also been deployed. \c\cOn April 5, it was reported that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo had contracted COVID-19, the first known case of a tiger anywhere being infected with the disease. Several other "big cats" were found to have COVID-19, the first of which had started showing symptoms on March 27; they were believed to have contracted COVID-19 from an infected zookeeper who was not yet showing symptoms. This was also the first known case of an animal contracting the disease from human contact in the US. On April 22 it was reported that four additional tigers plus three lions had tested positive. \c\cOn April 6, there were 72,181 confirmed cases, with at least 2,475 deaths. NYC accounted for 25% of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. The next day Gothamist reported that the death toll in New York City was undercounted. It was estimated that 1,125 people had died at home or on the street in NYC in the first five days of April, an eight-fold increase compared with FDNY figures for 2019. Due to the large increase, many of the deaths were presumed to be caused by COVID-19, but only residents with confirmed infections had been recorded in the official count. Due to the crisis circumstances of the pandemic, the real death toll was unknown. Bodies of those who had died at home, around 280 per day, were being picked up by the US Army, National Guard, and Air National Guard. \c\cSome of the communities most affected by the pandemic included densely-populated neighborhoods in north-central Queens with high immigrant populations, including Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights. As of April 8[update], these communities, with a cumulative 600,000 residents, had recorded 7,260 COVID-19 cases. On April 23, state officials said that based on preliminary antibody testing results, they estimated around 21.2% of city residents had contracted COVID-19. \c\cOn May 10, de Blasio said 38 children were known to be affected by an inflammatory syndrome believed to be linked to an immune response to COVID-19. Known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), this life-threatening condition resembles Kawasaki disease and other pediatric inflammatory conditions, such as toxic shock syndrome. Symptoms include high fevers that can last for days, rash, racing heart beat, changes in skin color, redness of the tongue, and severe abdominal pain. At least one child had died in New York City, and two additional deaths were reported statewide. The link with COVID-19 has not yet been proven. On May 19, Cuomo confirmed 137 cases of the illness, stating it was "the tip of the iceberg" with 90% of the cases testing positive for the virus or antibodies. By May 26, three deaths and 89 cases of MIS-C had been confirmed in the city, mostly affecting children and teenagers. Doctors reported that the risk of death or serious illness for MIS-C was mitigated by early detection. Hospitals were instructed to prioritize kids for testing. \c\cA survey conducted May 5–12 and reported in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that 42% of 286 respondents residing in the New York City metropolitan area knew someone who had tested positive for COVID-19, and 23.1% knew someone who had died. \c\cDuring May, COVID-19 cases started to decline. After the George Floyd protests in New York City started in late May, public officials expressed concern about the spread of COVID-19 via the crowded events. \c\cOn June 8, the city commenced the first phase of its reopening plan after meeting seven conditions of the stay-at-home order, which had been put in place three months earlier.  Safety protocols were put in place to limit occupancy of confined spaces, like elevators, to one person at a time, and occupancy ceilings were reduced to under 50% of their usual capacity. On June 24, New York state, along with New Jersey and Connecticut, began requiring travelers to self-quarantine for 14 days if traveling from an area with high infection rates. \c\cPatience and Fortitude, the lion statues outside the New York Public Library Main Branch, were masked as a symbol of the city's resilience. Health experts noted that the effectiveness of contact tracing in preventing resurgence would depend on careful monitoring of hospitalizations and targeted testing of high-risk populations to screen for asymptomatic carriers. COVID hospitalizations fell below 700, the lowest levels since mid-March, but more cases were reported in the age group between 21 and 30. \c\cPlans to open indoor dining during the Phase 3 reopening were postponed due to the heightened risks posed by customers refusing to wear face masks and the uncertain role of air conditioning on spread in indoor spaces. Indoor dining in other states has resulted in superspreading at certain venues. To compensate in part, outdoor space was expanded by shutting down certain areas to create more space for outdoor eating. Plans to reopen museums in Phase 4 were also postponed. \c\cThe governor's office announced that malls would be allowed to reopen only after installation of antiviral air filtration systems, which was opposed by mall owners and their tenants. \c\cIn late July, over 130 bars were cited for violations of COVID related regulations. The governor warned bars would be shut down again if compliance did not improve. At least 40 businesses lost their liquor licenses between March and August. Some restaurants reported difficulty controlling the crowds gathered outside, despite hiring security. \c\cOn July 11, a seven-year-old German Shepherd named Buddy died of COVID-19. He tested positive back in mid-April when his owners noticed he was having trouble breathing. He was the first dog in the United States to test positive for COVID-19. \c\cBy August 1, the total number of establishments who had their liquor licenses suspended for not following social distancing guidelines had risen to 52. In mid-August, Cuomo announced that bowling alleys would be able to reopen on August 17, and museums and other cultural institutions on August 24, at reduced capacity. \c\cOn the nineteenth anniversary ceremony of the September 11 attacks at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, the reading of names of victims, usually by family members, was instead recorded in advance. Mask protocols and social distance measures were also in place. The Tunnels to Towers foundation held a simultaneous memorial nearby at Zuccotti Park where around 125 family members took part in reading names. \c\cIn late September, parents of yeshiva students in Brooklyn were texted "DO NOT test your child for Covid," advised not to report symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and told that it was "up to parents" to prevent the school from being closed. \c\cOn September 25, 37 people tested positive for COVID-19 after a sweet sixteen party at the Miller Place Inn. The inn was fined $10,000 for violating COVID restrictions. \c\cBy the end of September, de Blasio had ordered the police department to enforce public health guidelines in several Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods and conduct emergency inspections at private religious schools. President Trump's views on masks were embraced by residents of these neighborhoods, who refused to wear masks or follow the social distancing restrictions. The rate of infection in some predominantly Orthodox neighborhoods rose to six times higher than the rest of the city. City health officials said another lockdown might be needed, similar to the one imposed in Israel, which at the time had the highest per-capita rate of new cases of any country. \c\cIn early October, the city was still in Phase 4 of reopening, which included museums, gardens, botanical gardens and gyms. Twenty ZIP Codes were identified as cluster areas, with an average 5.2% of positive tests, relatively high compared to the rest of New York State. These 20 ZIP Codes contained 26% of all positive cases in the state on October 2. In response, the governor's office announced what they called "direct enforcement" of COVID-19 related restrictions in high-risk neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. The mayor's office proposed closing businesses deemed "non-essential" and on-site dining. In-person schooling would have to shut down in nine ZIP Codes with 14-day positivity rates over 3%, while another eleven ZIP Codes were placed on a "watch list" because their positivity rates were 1–3%. A twelfth ZIP Code was placed on the "watch list" on October 5, the same day that the governor's office rejected the mayor's plan to close non-essential businesses. \c\cCommunity leaders from the Jewish communities in Queens, including the neighborhoods of Rego Park, Kew Gardens, and Kew Gardens Hills, expressed concerns that singling out neighborhoods and ZIP Codes was unfairly targeting the Jewish community. Barry Grodenchik said that, "One of the worst things is Jews being blamed for outbreaks and epidemics...slander is akin to murder." Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz said Kew Gardens and Rego Park are diverse neighborhoods and that it was unnecessary to single out Orthodox Jewish communities. \c\cOn October 6, Governor Andrew Cuomo introduced a "micro-cluster strategy." The new plan places new restrictions in cluster areas that have spikes in COVID-19 cases. The first areas to experience these new restrictions were parts of Brooklyn and Queens. On October 7, protesters opposing the micro-cluster strategy burned masks in the street and set a fire in Borough Park. Clusters have been added and removed since October 6. \c\cThere were 779 hospitalizations on October 9, the highest number reported since July 15. Significant fines of up to $15,000 per day were put in place for mass gatherings, and up to $1000 per day for violations of social distancing and mask-wearing rules. Over the first weekend under the new rules the city issued over $150,000 in fines. \c\cReligious communities have protested the restrictions. A federal judge denied to grant an injunction to prevent restrictions on mass gatherings in houses of worship in red zones, ruling that the state had a compelling state interest to protect the "health and life of all New Yorkers" and that the restrictions were not motivated by any animus. The United States Supreme Court declined to hear similar cases on appeal from two other states. \c\cThe New York Sheriff's Office broke up a rave party with over 100 attendees in Queens on October 11. The organizers were charged with multiple criminal offenses, as well as violations of the park and health codes. \c\cOn October 17, a wedding at North Fork Country Club with 91 guests resulted in at least 30 positive cases. Suffolk County Executive Steven Bellone recommended the country club be fined $17,000 for having a non-essential gathering of more than 50 people. In Bellport, a birthday party with 50 attendees resulted in at least 26 positive cases. \c\cOn November 10, Governor Cuomo stated that starting November 13 for the entirety of New York state, gatherings were to be limited to 10 people, and gyms, bars, and restaurants must close by 10 pm, with local municipalities handling enforcement responsibility. This came as the positivity rate in the city climbed back up to 2.52%, levels not seen since early June, according to Mayor de Blasio. \c\cPublic schools were closed indefinitely on November 19 after the rolling seven-day average reached 3%. Despite calls from health experts to close indoor dining before it was too late "to reverse the tide of new infections," the governor's office declined to impose restrictions until the statistical thresholds were met. The mayor's office took charge of closing schools only. Some epidemiologists and public health officials have criticized the decision to close schools, while allowing indoor dining to continue. The school-closure policy was partly reversed less than two weeks later, with de Blasio announcing that elementary schools would resume in-person learning from December 7. However, intermediate and high schools would remain closed through 2021. \c\cBy late November, the governor's office was warning that the entire city was approaching the threshold for the "orange zone" designation that would close indoor dining, salons and gyms. \c\cOn November 29, New York City police shut down an illegal bottle club with nearly 400 people in attendance. The four party organizers were arrested and charged with holding a mass gathering against health orders and not having a liquor license. \c\cIn the first week of December, there was controversy when a Staten Island tavern, Mac's Public House, publicized its violation of restrictions on bars and restaurants. The bar had continued to offer indoor dining despite Cuomo's prohibition on indoor dining, and continued to serve liquor after the New York State Liquor Authority had suspended its liquor license. After the New York City Sheriff's Office shut down Mac's on December 1 and arrested its owner, several hundred people gathered to protest the shutdown. \c\cAfter warning it was likely, Governor Cuomo announced that indoor dining would be suspended on December 14. \c\cCOVID-19 vaccinations at nursing homes began on December 21. \c\cA video of 50 members of maskless dancers at a Republican Club party in Queens went viral on December 22. At the time, gatherings of more than ten people were prohibited. \c\cOn December 23, following concerns over a new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, de Blasio issued an order for travelers from the UK to quarantine or otherwise face fines of $1,000. \c\cOn December 27, New York State announced a criminal investigation into ParCare Community Health Network for "fraudulently" obtaining vaccine doses and administering them to persons who were not within the designated priority groups to receive the first doses of vaccine. ParCare is owned and operated by Hasidic business owner Gary Schlesinger. The clinic denies the allegations. \c\cNew York State lowered its vaccine age from 75 to 65 on January 11, 2021. As of January 25, 2021, 628,831 vaccines had been administered in New York City.  During the last week of the month, the city was averaging 5000 new cases per day and around 60 deaths per day. Brooklyn's Bensonhurst and Brighton Beach neighborhoods, Queens's South Ozone Park and Flushing neighborhoods, Staten Island's South Beach area, and Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood were the hardest hit areas at the time, with positive test results in the 10% range. \c\cIn February 2021, New York City expanded its Phase 1b to include restaurant workers (including delivery workers) and taxi drivers (including FHV drivers). \c\cOn February 8, it was announced that public middle schools would reopen for in-person learning on February 25. \c\cThe MTA announced that overnight subway service, suspended since May 2020, would be partially restored as long as hospitalization and infection rates continued to decrease. On February 14, the closing times for restaurants, bars, gyms and other establishments was extended to 11 p.m. \c\cOn March 8, it was announced that public high schools would reopen for in-person learning on March 22. \c\cThe "cluster zone" restrictions were lifted in late March. Indoor fitness classes resumed. Vaccine eligibility was expanded to New Yorkers over the age of 50. The first case of the Brazilian P.1 variant was confirmed. \c\cOn April 29, de Blasio announced that New York City would fully reopen on July 1. \c\cIn early May 2021, Cuomo announced that the overnight subway closures would end on May 17, 2021, with 24-hour service resuming on that date. \c\cOn May 12, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority launched a five-day pilot project of walk-up COVID-19 vaccination sites in eight of its subway, Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road stations. This pilot project was subsequently extended another week at Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal. Over 11,000 people received the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine as part of the program. \c\cBy June, the city's overall testing positivity rate had reached its lowest since the pandemic began. Since the first vaccines arrived in December, over 8,408,000 doses have been administered. Governor Cuomo reopened the entirety of New York State on June 15, two weeks ahead of Mayor Bill de Blasio's planned July 1 reopening. \c\cOn July 7, 2021, the city held a "Hometown Heroes" ticker-tape parade to honor healthcare professionals and essential workers for their work during the pandemic. The Uniformed Firefighters Association asked its members to boycott the event, however, saying that COVID-related risks to firefighters had not yet ended, citing the case of a union member who was in the ICU with COVID-related pneumonia at the time of the parade. The Uniformed EMS Officers Union also asked its members not to attend the parade due to an ongoing dispute with the city over a lack of hazard pay during the pandemic. \c\cOn July 23, 2021, the city's health department announced that daily average cases were 32% higher than the prior week and that the Delta variant had become the dominant COVID strain, accounting for 57% of citywide samples over a four-week period. Mayor Bill de Blasio responded to the new data by pleading with private employers to "move immediately to some form of mandate" for COVID-19 vaccination. \c\cOn August 2, 2021, de Blasio recommended that vaccinated people wear masks in indoor settings, following CDC guidance and a continued uptick in positive COVID cases due to the Delta variant. The next day, it was announced that masks would be required indoors beginning August 16. \c\cOn March 2, de Blasio tweeted that people should ignore the virus and "go on with your lives + get out on the town despite Coronavirus." At a press conference the next day, New York City Commissioner of Health Oxiris Barbot said, "We are encouraging New Yorkers to go about their everyday lives."  On March 4, she said, "There’s no indication that being in a car, being in the subways with someone who’s potentially sick is a risk factor." New York City Councilmen Robert Holden and Eric Ulrich wrote to Mayor de Blasio asking him to relieve Barbot of her position. \c\cOn March 7, Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York State after 89 cases had been confirmed in the state, 70 of them in Westchester County, 12 in New York City, and 7 elsewhere. \c\cOn April 20, de Blasio announced that major events had been cancelled through June, including the Pride March and the Puerto Rican Day Parade. \c\cOn August 5, de Blasio announced that COVID-19 checkpoints would be set up at major crossings and tunnels to help enforcement of a mandatory 14-day quarantine for travelers from areas of a high transmission rate per Cuomo's order, in coordination with the New York's Sheriff department. Failure to comply with this order would result in fines ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 with de Blasio adding, "We’re not going to let our hard work slip away and will continue to do everything we can to keep New Yorkers safe and healthy.”\c\cOn March 14, before the statewide stay-at-home order (also known as the "New York State on PAUSE" executive order) was put in place, all New York Public Library branches in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island were temporarily closed. The Queens Public Library and Brooklyn Public Library were also closed. Theaters, concert venues, and nightclubs in NYC have been shut down since March 17, and restaurants were restricted to take-out and delivery only. Schools were closed until at least April 20. Gyms were closed as well. \c\cOn March 17, despite de Blasio's message to New Yorkers that they should be "prepared right now" for the possibility of "shelter in place" orders, Cuomo expressed doubts about whether the policy would be effective. The governor's office issued a statement that the shelter in place order could only be put in place by the governor's office; the Mayor's office agreed. On March 20, with 5,683 confirmed cases in NYC, the governor's office issued the PAUSE order that would go into effect on March 22 at 8 PM. The order put in place the following restrictions, summarized in the executive order in ten points:\c\cEffective at 8pm on Sunday, March 22, all non-essential businesses statewide will be closed\c\cNon-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason (e.g. parties, celebrations or other social events) are canceled or postponed at this time\c\cAny concentration of individuals outside their home must be limited to workers providing essential services and social distancing should be practiced\c\cWhen in public individuals must practice social distancing of at least six feet from others\c\cBusinesses and entities that provide other essential services must implement rules that help facilitate social distancing of at least six feet\c\cIndividuals should limit outdoor recreational activities to non-contact and avoid activities where they come in close contact with other people\c\cIndividuals should limit use of public transportation to when absolutely necessary and should limit potential exposure by spacing out at least six feet from other riders\c\cSick individuals should not leave their home unless to receive medical care and only after a telehealth visit to determine if leaving the home is in the best interest of their health\c\cYoung people should also practice social distancing and avoid contact with vulnerable populations\c\cUse precautionary sanitizer practices such as using isopropyl alcohol wipes\c\cThe governor said the provisions would be enforced. Businesses that violated the order faced fines and closure. Businesses that qualified as "essential businesses" under the stay-at-home order included but were not limited to:\c\cOn April 6, the statewide PAUSE order was extended through April 29. The rate of increase had slowed from 10,000 new confirmed cases daily to 8,700. Intubation and ICU admission rates were slowing. Fines for violating social distancing protocols were increased from $500 to $1000. On April 16, the statewide PAUSE order was extended through May 15, in coordination with "a multi-state council."\c\cGovernor Andrew Cuomo first announced the four-phase reopening plan for businesses on May 7. In order for the New York City region to begin reopening in Phase 1, it needed to meet these seven metrics:\c\c14-day decline in hospitalizations or under 15 new hospitalizations (3-day average)\c\c14-day decline in hospitalized deaths OR under 5 new (3-day average)\c\cNew hospitalizations — under 2 per 100,000 residents (3-day rolling average)\c\cShare of total beds available (threshold of 30 percent)\c\cShare of ICU beds available (threshold of 30 percent)\c\c30 per 1,000 residents tested monthly (7-day average of new tests per day)\c\c30 contact tracers per 100,000 residents or to meet current infection rate. \c\cAs of July 20, the four-phase reopening plan for New York City is detailed as follows:\c\cPhase 1: construction, manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and select retail that can offer curbside pickup. \c\cPhase 2: outdoor dining at restaurants, hair salons and barber shops, offices, real estate firms, in-store retail, vehicle sales, retail rental, repair services, cleaning services, and commercial building management. \c\cPhase 3: indoor dining at restaurants and bars at 50% capacity (excluding New York City) and personal care services. \c\cPhase 4: low-risk outdoor activities at 33% capacity (outdoor zoos, botanical gardens, nature parks, historical sites, outdoor museums, etc.); low-risk indoor activities at 25% capacity are allowed in Phase 4 regions outside of New York City. \c\cSome types of businesses, such as drive-in theaters, landscaping and gardening, and places of worship, were allowed to reopen regardless of the phase as part of a separate executive order. On May 14, Governor Cuomo issued an executive order to extend the PAUSE order through May 28 for New York City and other regions that did not meet the state's requirements to begin Phase 1 of reopening. A week later, it still had only met four of seven reopening conditions. \c\cPhase 1 of reopening in New York City began on June 8. In total, between 200,000 and 400,000 people were expected to return to work during Phase 1. On June 22, the region moved to Phase 2 with an expected 300,000 returning to work. Cuomo announced in late June that shopping malls would need to install virus-filtering air conditioning systems before reopening. On July 6, New York City entered Phase 3, excluding indoor dining. On July 20, the region entered Phase 4. \c\cOn August 17, Cuomo announced gyms and fitness centers would be able to reopen starting August 24 and no later than September 2. Gyms would be required to limit their capacity to 33%, mandate mask wearing at all times, and maintain proper ventilation systems. \c\cIn a press conference on September 9, Cuomo announced New York City would be permitted to resume indoor dining services at 25 percent capacity on September 30. \c\cSocial distancing has been recommended nationwide by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization since COVID-19 was first declared a national health emergency back in March 2020. It was mandated by Cuomo on March 20 as part of the statewide stay-at-home order. \c\cIn early March, the New York Legislature granted Cuomo the power to temporarily suspend laws or create new laws to fight the pandemic. Face masks were first mandated by law via an executive order issued by Cuomo on April 15. The order states that face masks must be in all public places when social distancing is not possible, as when people are within six feet of others. On May 28, another executive order gave business owners the authority to decide whether patrons must wear a face covering to enter. \c\cOn May 17, 2021 Governor Cuomo announced the adoption of the new CDC guidelines on mask and social distancing for vaccinated people by May 19. On May 21, 2021, the NYC Health Department issued guidelines on face coverings for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Fully vaccinated people can forego wearing a mask during certain situations, especially outdoor activities, however face coverings are still required when riding public transportation, in schools or health care facilities, certain residential facilities, and in stores and restaurants at the discretion of the owner, among other activities. \c\cGovernor Andrew Cuomo introduced a micro-cluster strategy on October 6, 2020. The new plan places new restrictions in cluster areas that have spikes in COVID-19 cases. The first areas to experience these new restrictions were parts of Brooklyn and Queens. The cluster areas are further zoned with three levels of restrictions, which consist of the following as of January 13, 2021:\c\cRed zone (most extreme): prohibits all social gatherings, closes all non-essential businesses (except places of worship), and limits schools to remote only\c\cOrange zone (warning zone): limits social gatherings to 10 people, dining to 4 people per table and 50% capacity, requires mandatory weekly testing for schools, and reduced capacity and increased testing for salons\c\cYellow zone (precautionary zone): limits social gatherings to 25 people, dining to 4 people per table and 50% capacity, and requires mandatory weekly testing for schools\c\cThe original micro-cluster strategy introduced on October 6, 2020 applied additional restrictions until various lawsuits by businesses lifted them. Places of worship were limited to varying degrees of capacity until it was ruled unconstitutional on November 5. Schools in the orange or red zone were originally required to close completely until it was ruled unconstitutional on December 1. Gyms and salons in the orange zone were originally required to close completely until it was ruled unconstitutional on December 11. Restaurants and bars in the orange zone were forced to outdoor dining only until it was ruled unconstitutional on January 13, 2021. \c\cNew York City issued new commuter guidelines following the start of the outbreak, asking sick individuals to stay off public transit, and encouraging citizens to avoid densely packed buses, subways, and trains. Beginning March 25, service on buses, subways, and commuter rail was reduced due to decreased ridership. Ridership had decreased by 92% on April 8, when 41 Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) workers had died. By April 22, 2020, COVID-19 had killed 83 agency employees; that number had increased to 131 by late August. The agency announced that their families would be eligible for $500,000 in death benefits. \c\cOn April 20, four City Council members requested that subway service be temporarily suspended, saying that reduced service had resulted in crowding on the subway and that entire cars had been taken over by homeless people. Their request was to shut down the subway was initially rejected by the governor's office and criticized by interim New York City Transit President Sarah Feinberg. City officials made efforts to place high-risk homeless persons in hotels serving as emergency shelters. \c\cStarting in May 2020, stations were closed overnight for cleaning; the overnight closures would be a temporary measure that would be suspended once the pandemic was over. On June 8, 2020, regular subway and bus service resumed with Phase 1 of the city's reopening, though the overnight subway closure remained in place. Although officials stated that only one percent of subway ridership occurred at night, trains continued to run overnight, leading to complaints that essential workers were being unnecessarily inconvenienced. Internal MTA sources stated that it was theoretically possible for the MTA to clean the system without closing it. In February 2021, the overnight closures were shortened to between 2 and 4 a.m. An app feature was added to the MYmta app in July to give riders real time information about the number of riders on buses. \c\cBy September, over 170 transit workers had reported being assaulted or harassed for asking passengers to wear face masks, including a 62-year-old man who was knocked unconscious on his route through East New York, Brooklyn, prompting officials to implement a $50 fine for riders who refused to wear a face mask. Sarah Feinberg says the fine is "a last resort" for people who refuse masks after they are offered. \c\cJeffrey E. Harris, a member of the economics faculty at MIT, said service cuts "most likely accelerated the spread of coronavirus." In his study published on April 15 he argued that public transportation was a "major disseminator" of novel coronavirus in New York City. The MTA said the study was "flawed – period." The advice to continue taking public transportation given by city officials during the early stages of the pandemic is now believed to have contributed to the intensity of the outbreak in New York City. \c\cΑ report published by the Daily News on September 29 asserted that there was "no correlation" between mass transit and COVID-19 infection rates. The MTA did not report any deaths between June and September, but lost at least 131 employees to COVID-19 during the first three months of the pandemic. On October 4, the Daily News reported that an epidemiologist affiliated with Yale University recommended that the MTA should advise riders not to talk to reduce the risk from spreading infectious aerosols. The MTA issued a statement that they were considering "all options". \c\cSubway ridership increased slowly in the early months of 2021 but not enough to reach pre-pandemic levels. \c\cOn March 8, all NYC school trips were canceled. On March 13, de Blasio stated that he would keep the schools open, citing the need for school meal programs and child care to continue. On March 15, all schools in the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) system closed until at least mid-April. \c\cOn April 11, de Blasio ordered all schools to remain closed for the rest of the academic year, while Cuomo insisted that the authority to close and reopen schools throughout the state belonged to himself as the governor, not to de Blasio or any other mayor. On May 1, Governor Cuomo announced that all schools would be closed for the academic year and continue to provide distance education. \c\cOn July 2 De Blasio announced that schools would be opening in September.  Cuomo's office said the final decision will be made by the governor's office. Cuomo said that a final decision on schools would be based on the infection rate in the state: "You can\'t open a school if the virus is on the increase." New York City said that full remote learning would be an option even if schools do reopen. \c\cAs of July 30, the city was planning for 2 to 3 days of classroom instruction, with remote learning on other days. School staff would be tested for COVID-19 before the start of the school year. There were plans for confirmed cases:\c\cIf there were one to two confirmed cases in the same class, the class would switch to full-time remote learning while the students and staff self-quarantined for two weeks. \c\cIf there were two or more confirmed cases in multiple classes in one school, the entire school would close and switch to full-time remote learning. Contact tracers would investigate. \c\cOn August 7, Cuomo announced schools could open in the fall if they publicly disclosed plans to address remote learning, testing of virus, and tracing procedures. Of the state's 749 school districts, 127 had not submitted plans, and 50 had submitted incomplete or deficient ones to the Department of Health, including the New York City region which \'disappointed\' the Governor. This came the same day for a deadline for parents in New York City to choose entirely blended or entirely remote learning for their children. On August 10, de Blasio with officials from NYCDOE gave details on their reopening plan in a news conference before the August 14 deadline set by the State. \c\cIn preparation of the first day of classes, the city deployed School Ventilation Teams to inspect public school buildings for problems with windows and supply and exhaust fans. Any rooms that did not meet the ventilation requirements would not be used. Some schools applied for outdoor learning space. Around 25% of students opted for all-remote learning. \c\cOn September 1, Mayor de Blasio and teacher unions reached an agreement to start remote and in-person classes 10 days later than originally scheduled for September 21. \c\cOn September 17, Mayor de Blasio announced the shift of the start of the school year again, opting for a phased approach, due to continued obstacles including teacher shortages. Pre-K and students with special needs would begin on September 21, with elementary student schools opening by September 29, and middle/high school students opened up on October 1. \c\cNew targeted closures were put in place in October as clusters with daily rates above city thresholds were identified. All public and private schools in "red zones" were ordered to switch to remote learning for 14 days, but some private schools refused to comply with the order, prompting the governor's office to issue an executive order that schools refusing to comply with closures would lose their funding. \c\cSchools were closed again on November 19 after the city reached a seven-day rolling average positivity rate of 3%. Some criticized the decision to close down schools without also restricting indoor dining and gyms. \c\cDuring the pandemic, the majority of New York City colleges and universities transitioned to primarily virtual or hybrid instructional programs. In-person classes were possible following New York State instructions and safety protocols. \c\cOn April 1, Cuomo ordered all playgrounds in the city to be shut down in order to promote social distancing. Parks would mostly remain open. The exceptions were Fort Totten in Queens, which was closed to provide a staging area for first responders, and the High Line, which was closed because it is a linear park with few means to spread out. Sports fields and facilities were also closed, as were the historic-house museums operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. With the start of the summer season in May, public beaches remained closed as well. \c\cOn May 7, de Blasio said that entry to public parks may be limited to prevent overcrowding and to promote social distancing. It was later announced that access might also be limited within parts of parks, such as Sheep Meadow at Central Park. On July 1, the city's public beaches were opened. On July 16, the High Line reopened to the public with free timed-entry passes in order to limit capacity in order to allow for social distancing. For the summer 2020 season, several pools were reopened with limited capacity in July and August. \c\cOn April 27, de Blasio announced plans to convert 40 to 100 miles (64 to 161 km) of streets to open streets. The affected streets would be closed to through traffic and blocked-off by temporary wooden or metal barricades with DOT signage. The purpose of the Open Streets is to provide "the space for essential workers to pursue safer commuting options, provide outdoor opportunities for vulnerable New Yorkers, and give families the chance to play beyond the four walls of their home".  The totals reached 44 miles (71 km) in May and 67 miles (108 km) in June. \c\cThe program has been largely successful, but has received some criticism from transit activists due to the poor enforcement and upkeep of barricades, the choice of segments which are too-short or border existing parks, and racial and socio-economic disparity in street choice and upkeep. \c\cOn June 22, the city initiated the Open Restaurants program, permitting restaurants to apply to use the sidewalk or curb lane adjacent to their business for outdoor dining, in order to promote open space, encourage social distancing, and help businesses economically recover. By September 5, 10,000 restaurants had participated. Additionally, starting in July, some of the open streets were made available for outdoor dining from Friday through Sunday. \c\cOn September 25, de Blasio in an interview with WNYC announced the outdoor dining and open streets programs would be extended indefinitely. The Open Restaurants program had been set to expire on October 31. \c\cOn April 6, The New York Times reported that the city's overall death rate had tripled and that morgues were overwhelmed. After councilman Mark D. Levine tweeted that temporary internment "likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials", NYC officials said they were not considering temporary burials in city parks. \c\cThe mayor's press secretary said that a next resort could be to store or bury bodies on Hart Island off the coast of the Bronx in the Long Island Sound. Following reports that mass burials had begun there, the mayor clarified that Hart Island was only being used for unclaimed bodies or for those who chose it as a burial place. Bodies are ordinarily held at the city's morgues anywhere from 30 to 60 days, but to make room for the influx of deceased individuals during the pandemic, the city's medical examiner's office announced a new policy of holding unclaimed bodies for only up to 15 days before they are transferred to the island. \c\cOn April 29, authorities discovered dozens of decomposing bodies in two trucks parked outside a funeral home in Brooklyn. \c\cBy April 2020, The New York Times reported that hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers were unemployed, with at least $7.4 billion lost tax revenue projected over the year. Broadway theaters, restaurants, hotels, and the transit system were among the most affected, while construction and real estate development activities halted, Millions of renters are uncertain as to how their rents will be paid. Low-income and formal workers such as canners and street vendors faced severe loss of income, even as they are ineligible for government support. Law firms, financial services companies, and other white collar businesses expect declining profits or losses. Between 475,000 and 1.2 million jobs, mostly low-wage positions in the retail, transportation, and restaurant sectors, were expected to be cut by the end of April. \c\cBy August 2020, the city had an unemployment rate of 16.3%, nearly twice the citywide rate. A significant percentage of populations in all five boroughs were estimated to be receiving unemployment insurance benefits, with rates ranging from 22% of the workforce in Manhattan to 41% in the Bronx. Officially, the Bronx had an unemployment rate of 17.5% in October, the highest of any county in the state at the time. The city's most badly affected neighborhood was West Farms, Bronx, where 26% of the workforce was unemployed in October 2020, several times higher than in wealthy neighborhoods such as the Upper West Side and Upper East Side of Manhattan. \c\cThe drop in income, sales tax, and tourism revenues including hotel tax revenue may cost the city up to $10 billion according to the Mayor's office. De Blasio said "We\'re not going to be able to provide basic services and actually have a normal society if we don\'t get help from the federal government." According to the New York City Independent Budget Office, a full economic recovery might not be achieved until 2024. \c\cSome stores and restaurants have closed permanently. Record Mart, the oldest record store in the city, announced that its shop in the Times Square–42nd Street station's mezzanine would not be reopening. A quarter of retail businesses operating in the subway permanently closed between March and November 2020. Other businesses that have closed permanently include Momofuku, the Copacabana nightclub, the Gem Spa, and two locations of Gimme! Coffee. As of July 16, 2020[update], four Michelin starred restaurants had announced permanent closures: Gotham Bar and Grill, Nix, Jewel Bako and Ukiyo. In August 2020, The New York Times estimated that up to 80,000 small businesses might never reopen, eliminating jobs for up to 520,000 people and representing one-third of the total number of small businesses in operation before the pandemic. At the time, 2,800 small businesses had already closed, a third of which were restaurants. \c\cBefore the pandemic, a demographic study by the Brookings Institute had found that the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S., including New York City, had been losing population for several years. High rents and cost of living in the city contributed to slowing growth by the mid-2010s as salary in the city was no longer competitive after adjusting for the cost of living. Some residents have questioned whether the high rents can be justified while public spaces, theaters and other event venues remain closed. Employees who have been furloughed from corporate jobs at institutions like Macy's may not renew their lease agreements. Realtors have reported an increase in inquiries about suburban home purchases and rentals from residents of Manhattan and other densely populated urban centers. \c\cIn July 2020, according to StreetEasy, there were more than 67,300 vacant rental units in New York City, the highest number since 2010. The median rental price in Manhattan dropped 10% from July 2019 to $3,167. Although there was an increase in people moving out of the city during the pandemic, the increase in vacancies was also attributed to the fact that real estate agents were also unable to show houses between March and June. A smaller number of buyers and renters decided to move in during the pandemic as well; between April and July, market data showed that almost 700 buyers from around the world finalized contracts for apartments in Manhattan. \c\cThe pandemic also affected commercial real estate, as office workers started telecommuting. Even after office buildings were allowed to reopen in June 2020 during Phase 2 of reopening, less than one-tenth of the city's office workers had gone back to their workplaces by August. According to a New York Times article in September 2020, only one-fourth of large employers anticipated that their employees would return to their offices by December, while 54% expected their employees to return by the following July. Commercial office leases in the first eight months of 2020 also decreased sharply compared to in the first eight months of 2019. As a result of the pandemic, some office workers had decided to telecommute permanently. By December 2020, commercial rents along retail corridors in Manhattan had declined 13 percent from the previous year, and 14 percent of Midtown Manhattan office space was vacant. \c\cThe moratorium on residential eviction for tenants with a COVID-related hardship was extended until May, and requires documentation to show hardship to prevent eviction. \c\cOne year into the pandemic the city's economic recovery was about halfway to early March 2020 levels. \c\cOn March 30, the mayor announced that most religious buildings had shut down in accordance with quarantine regulations. However, he warned that some churches and synagogues were not in compliance and would be shut down by authorities if they remained open. Several summonses and arrests were made for violating social distancing rules. On March 28, a Brooklyn bar owner was arrested for defying Cuomo's ban on bars and restaurants. On April 3, the NYPD broke up a party in the Bronx where several dozen people had gathered in violation of social distancing rules. On April 7, NBC News reported violations of the statewide PAUSE order throughout the city, and de Blasio said violations of the order could be reported to 311. \c\cOne epidemiologist at Columbia University noted "Social distancing is a privilege that not everybody has equal opportunity to practice." Of the five boroughs, Manhattan had reported the lowest number of confirmed cases. Epidemiologists have observed that low income communities were being disproportionately affected. Many residents of these neighborhoods work in essential jobs where it may not be possible to work from home. \c\cAfter some arrests for violations of social distancing protocols turned violent, the city relaxed enforcement. As the weather warmed large groups began gathering at parks and beaches. Some non-compliant bars and restaurants, limited to take out service during the pandemic, continued to allowing customers to dine in or to gather outside bars with drinks. De Blasio said non-compliant establishments risk closure. \c\cDuring May and June 2020, there were mass arrests due to the George Floyd protests, and due to close confinement of those detained along with poor rates of mask wearing by law enforcement, the probability of a second wave of COVID-19 increased significantly. Several outlets criticized police working the events for failing to wear face masks as required by policy and by order of the governor. As the number of arrests during the protests increased, many people were detained for longer periods and, as of June 5, hundreds were still waiting to see a judge, being held in close quarters in the meantime. Some of the arrested also had inadequate access to water to wash their hands. \c\cAt the beginning of March, prior to the confirmation of the first case of COVID-19, and the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in New York City, a 20 percent spike in crime for the first two months of 2020 was reported. After movement in the city became restricted, New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea stated that the pandemic had curtailed crime. At the end of March, Shea said that crime had decreased sharply during the pandemic (other than car theft, which increased markedly), though there is concern that domestic violence was not being reported. \c\cBy the end of the month, 911 calls were at a record high, and 1,048 officers and 145 civilian employees had tested positive for COVID-19. 5,657 uniformed officers, or more than 15% of the force, called out sick on March 31. The percentage of officers out sick rose to nearly 20 percent, as reported on April 6.  By April 30, 4,959 members of the NYPD had tested positive for the virus, and 37 had died. \c\cXenophobia and racism against Asians in the city increased due to the pandemic. Police investigated 11 anti-Asian hate crimes between January 1 and March 29, 2020, up from three during the same time period in the previous year. \c\cShootings have nearly doubled in 2020 from 748 to 1,480, the highest number in 14 years. There were 436 murders, an increase of 40%. The cause is still being debated. Longtime city residents have complained of an increase in gang activity of the Bloods and Crips that has worsened since the city's stop-and-frisk program was ruled unconstitutional in Floyd v. City of New York. Members of the police force say it's a combination of factors including bail reforms and the impact of body cameras and other forms of public pressure on police officers. Some scholars believe the pandemic has worsened underlying social and economic instability in the city. \c\cIn February 2021, the MTA requested an additional 1,500 police after a homeless man murdered two people on the A train. The MTA reported assaults have increased. There were two dozen attacks in the first two weeks of February. A bus driver in Brooklyn was hit with a 2-by-4. MTA workers and riders continued to experience harassment and physical attacks, including being spit on. \c\cSeveral prominent restaurant owners and chefs have died of COVID-19, including Indian chef Floyd Cardoz and Andreas Koutsoudakis (who opened the Gee Whiz diner in Tribeca in 1989). Maria Mercader, a news producer at CBS, died on March 29. Musician Alan Merrill died on March 29 at Mount Sinai Hospital. \c\cNursing homes have had high fatality rates, accounting for at least 2,056 deaths in the city as of April 20. New York State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker stated that the policy was for nursing home residents who test positive back to be readmitted to nursing homes. \c\cBetween March 11 and May 2 there were 32,107 deaths in the city; based on past data, this number was higher than expected by 24,172. According to official figures, COVID-19 is linked with 18,879 of the excess deaths (including probable cases that were not confirmed with testing). \c\cA study published in JAMA Network Open found New York City's COVID-19 death rates in the spring were comparable to the peak of the Spanish flu, per capita. \c\cNew York City usually has about 20,000 hospital beds and 5,000 ventilators, many of which are routinely in use to keep ICU patients alive. Social distancing measures were implemented to slow the spread of the virus and prevent the hospital system from collapsing. In the early days of the crisis, on March 14, 2020, the Health and Hospitals Corporation and New York-Presbyterian cancelled non-emergency surgeries. Northwell Health put out a call for retired nurses to return. The Tisch Hospital of NYU Langone converted a pediatric emergency ward into a respiratory ward. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was rationed due to shortages. By March 25 the situation at Elmhurst Hospital, one of the worst-affected hospitals in the city, had deteriorated to the point that staff described it as "apocalyptic." Dr. David Reich, President and COO of Mount Sinai Hospital, announced in March that the hospital was converting its lobbies into extra patient rooms to "meet the growing volume of patients" suffering from coronavirus. \c\cIn response to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases at the end of March 2020, several temporary field hospitals were built or proposed, including the Javits Center in Manhattan (2,500 beds), USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens (350 beds), and in Central Park in Manhattan (68-bed COVID respiratory care unit). Field hospitals were also proposed at the New York Expo Center in the Bronx, Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, and the College of Staten Island. At the request of the Mayor, veterinary clinics sent their ventilators to human hospitals. \c\cThe USTA field hospital only treated 79 COVID-19 patients until it closed on May 13, while costing the city at least $52 million. Due to rules constraining transfers and preventing 911 calls from going there, it remained mostly empty as at least three COVID-19 patients quarantining at home died and nearby hospitals exceeded capacity. USTA also had its own ambulances it could not use to pick up transfers due to exclusivity agreements between hospitals and ambulance companies. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, private hospitals had spare beds while some public hospitals were unable to offload enough patients to stay within normal capacity, unlike during Hurricane Sandy, when patients were actively balanced across the region. \c\cAlthough the number of new patients admitted to the hospitals started to slow in early April, Cuomo stated that social distancing protocols would continue to be enforced to prevent a rise in these figures that could overwhelm the strained healthcare system. The USNS Comfort was originally intended to take non-COVID patients to ease the burden on city hospitals, but most New Yorkers remained isolated in their homes and non-COVID admissions decreased dramatically; the admission processes for patients who did present at the emergency room was cumbersome. On April 21, when Cuomo told Trump that the Comfort was no longer needed, the ship had treated 179 patients. Another field hospital, built in Brooklyn for $21 million during April, was closed the next month without ever seeing any patients. \c\cThe Senior Director of the System-wide Special Pathogens Program at NYC Health + Hospitals Syra Madad, who worked through the first wave in spring,  said, "We never want this to happen again," referring to the nearly 20,000 deaths from COVID-19 in New York City. \c\cThe New York City healthcare system continued to experience major shortages with its COVID-19 testing capacity. An alert sent out on April 11, 2020, by the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene stated that the city's hospitals are close to running out of cotton swabs used for COVID-19 testing. The same alert reminded the providers that only those patients admitted for hospitalization should be given COVID-19 tests. \c\cSome doctors have been trying to crowdsource tablets so patients can say goodbye to loved ones. The last contact patients have with their families was when they were dropped off at the hospital or taken by ambulance. \c\cDue to the demand from the pandemic on New York City hospitals, emergency medical services (EMS) personnel were ordered not to transport adult cardiac arrest cases to the hospital, if the EMS personnel were unable to restart the patient's heart at the scene. On April 21, this order was modified to "do not resuscitate," meaning EMS should no longer try to revive persons on scene. \c\cOn April 5, a state Health Department official confirmed that seriously ill patients were being treated with hydroxychloroquine. The effects are being observed by the University of Albany's School of Public Health. On April 23, Cuomo said that based on one study the drug "didn\'t really have much on an effect on the recovery rate." Although studies are still ongoing, hospitals have stopped using the drug as treatment. \c\cOn May 1, 2020, the New York State Department of Health issued fresh COVID-19 guidelines for the Medicaid providers who are serving low-income families, nursing homes (including adult care facilities), and physically disabled individuals. These guidelines were directed towards the providers of the following home and community-based services  — social daycare (SDC) services which also included the elderly (PACE) organizations and providers of Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP). However, just a month ago, New York State signed a 2021 fiscal budget to cap Medicaid long-term care (LTC) enrollment at 3% under the managed long-term care (MLTC) plans. In the long run, the 3% capping will gradually reduce the number of individuals served by current Medicaid LTC plans, and also reduce the number of provider organizations able to contract with MLTC plans. However, the LTC recipients are a substantial population at risk for COVID-19 and there are cost involved to make sure the LTC facilities are adequately staffed and that infection control protocols are closely followed. \c\cBy March 2021, the B.1.526 variant (believed to have developed locally in NYC) accounted for over 45% of new cases in the city. The variant first appeared in samples collected in the city in November 2020 and accounted for an alarming rise of variants in January 2021. \c\cThe first case of P.1 variant (Brazil) was identified on March 20. The UK variant has also been spreading. While the UK variant was becoming dominant in the rest of the United States, in NYC the New York variant has been spreading even faster. \c\cIn total, the three variants accounted for 65.1% of new cases by late March. \c\cOn April 5, 2020, it was reported that 51% of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in NYC involved people at least 50 years old. In previous weeks, the dominant cohort of cases had been men between 18 and 49 years of age. \c\cIn April,  The New York Times reported that the virus has been twice as deadly for Black and Latino people than whites in New York City. Officials attribute this difference to longstanding inequalities of health care access, economic status, prevalence of chronic health issues or other co-morbidities, and the fact that Black and Latino people might be over represented among essential workers. 75% of front line workers are minorities. By early May, over 5,200 Latinos in the city had died of COVID-19, making them the ethnic group with the highest number of deaths from the disease. \c\cCOVID-19 is also considered to disproportionately affect low-income immigrants, who may have higher risk of exposure, misinformation, and be hesitant to access care. \c\cAdapted from nyc.gov. Note that the cases are by date of diagnosis, and deaths are by date of death. Due to delays in reporting, historical counts may be subject to change and recent data may be incomplete. \c\cWeekly all-cause deaths in New York City Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19:
This is a list of rocket and mortar attacks on Israel carried out by Palestinian militant groups and/or Muslim Shia or Sunni militant groups from Lebanon. \c\cJuly 1981: the PLO opened a heavy and indiscriminate artillery barrage on the Galilee panhandle using Katyusha rockets and 130mm guns. This barrage lasted 10 days driving the residents of northern Israel underground into bomb shelters. \c\cJune 1982: Twenty villages were targeted in Galilee bombardment by the PLO and 3 Israelis were wounded. \c\cOn 31 March 1995, a rocket attack on Nahariyya in Western Galilee kills an 18-year-old. \c\cApril 9, 1996, A heavy rocket barrage, launched by Hezbollah upon the cities of Galilee caused the initiation of the Operation Grapes of Wrath by the IDF. \c\cDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Lebanese Shi\'a Islamist militant group and political party Hezbollah fired some 4,000 rockets at Israel. \c\cUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, adopted at the end of the 2006 Lebanon War, called for a full cessation of hostilities between Lebanon and Israel and for the Lebanese government to take full control of its territory, and it authorized the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) "to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind". Nevertheless, since the war, there have been multiple rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon. The Lebanese government has not claimed responsibility for any of the attacks, and has disavowed some of them. \c\cAs of September 2009, There were an estimated 30,000 rockets in southern Lebanon, near Israel's border, all under the control of Hezbollah. \c\cTwo Katyusha rockets were fired from Lebanon at northern Israel, striking the town of Kiryat Shmona. The rockets caused some damage but no casualties. \c\cIsraeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called the incident "very disturbing". Russian ambassador to Lebanon Sergei Boukin voiced concern about the incident and said it was a violation of UN Resolution 1701. \c\cHezbollah denied responsibility. A previously unknown militant Islamic group calling itself "Jihadi Badr Brigades – Lebanon branch" claimed responsibility and vowed to continue attacks, saying: "We had promised our people jihad. Here, we again strike the Zionists when a group from the Jihadi Badr Brigades struck the Zionists in the occupied Palestinian territory."\c\cAt least three Katyusha rockets were fired from southern Lebanon into the area of Nahariya in northern Israel. One of the rockets directly hit a nursing home for the elderly. At least two people were wounded, one suffering a broken leg, and others suffered from shock. A witness said that the second floor of the facility, where the residents sleep, sustained heavy damage, and that many lives were saved because they were in the dining hall at the time. Israel Police ordered residents of the city to remain close to fortified areas, and Shlomi Regional Council residents were told to open their bomb shelters; school in the area was cancelled. The incident took place during the Gaza War. \c\cIsrael responded by firing five artillery shells into Lebanon, which it said was a pinpoint response at the source of fire. \c\cThe Lebanese Office of the Prime Minister rejected the attack on Israel, saying: "Prime Minister Siniora regards what happened in the south as a violation of the international resolution 1701 and something he does not accept and Siniora called for an investigation into the incident". Hezbollah denied involvement, as did Hamas sources in Lebanon. An official from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command did not deny responsibility for the attack, and stated: "Don’t be surprised to see more rockets launched into northern Israel. It's a normal response to Israel's brutal aggression."\c\cIn the second such attack in a week, rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel, landing near the town of Kiryat Shmona. No injury or damage was reported. Residents fled to bomb shelters. \c\cAccording to Haaretz, the attack and the previous one were carried out by Hezbollah through the proxy of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, a close Hezbollah ally. \c\cUnited Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon expressed alarm at the incident and urged restraint from all sides. \c\cTwo rockets were fired from near the Lebanese coastal town of Naqoura into northern Israel, one striking a mostly Christian Arab Israeli village. At least one person was lightly injured. \c\cIsrael responded by firing some six artillery shells at the launch area, causing no injuries. \c\cLebanese Prime Minister Fuad Saniora said that the rockets "threatened security and stability" in the region and violated UN Resolution 1701. He also called Israel's retaliation "an unjustified violation of Lebanese sovereignty."\c\cTwo Katyusha rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, one striking near Nahariya and another near Kibbutz Gesher Haziv. No damage or injury was reported. A witness said that the rockets had sparked panic, with residents entering bunkers and children being evacuated from schools. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the attack violated United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 and that Israel would hold the Lebanese government accountable for it. \c\cIsrael responded by firing some 12 artillery shells at the launch area, near Qlayleh. No damage or injury was reported. \c\cThe United Nations condemned the attack on Israel and urged both sides "to exercise maximum restraint."\c\cAccording to Lebanese commentators, the attack on Israel was connected to the country's political crisis exacerbated by Saad Hariri's inability to form a government. United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) spokesman Milos Strugar blamed radicals from Palestinian refugee camps in southern Lebanon for the attack. \c\cUNIFIL had been warned of a possible attack 10 days before it occurred, and the UN body informed the Lebanese army two days before the attack. \c\cA Katyusha rocket was fired from Lebanese town of Hula into northern Israel, striking an open area east of Kiryat Shmona. The rocket caused a fire, but no serious damage or injury was reported. An Israeli military spokeswoman said Israel was treating the shooting "very seriously" and that it held the Lebanese government responsible. \c\cIsrael responded with artillery fire at Lebanon, causing no casualties, and lodged a complaint with the United Nations. \c\cThe Brigades of Abdullah Azzam, Battalions of Ziad Jarrah, a group linked to Al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility. In a statement, the group linked the attack to the 2009 Temple Mount riots: "The occupying Jews have dared to repeatedly raid the courtyard of Al-Aqsa Mosque ... In response to this aggression, a battalion among the Battalions of Ziad Jarrah" fired the Katyusha, the group said. Nevertheless, Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said that an "Israeli agent" was responsible for the attack. \c\cThe United States condemned the attack and, in a reference to Hezbollah, said it underscored the need to disarm all Lebanese groups. \c\cUNIFIL launched an inquiry into the incident. The following day, the Lebanese military discovered four more rockets, ready to be fired, in the garden and on the balcony of a house belonging to the mayor of Hula. \c\cThe Lebanese Army later arrested Fadi Ibrahim of Ein el-Hilweh near Sidon for firing the rocket. Ibrahim was said to be a member of Fatah al-Islam, which is linked to al-Qaida. According to Lebanese daily A-Safir, Ibrahim and his followers were responsible for the subsequently discovered rockets as well. \c\cShortly after midnight, four 122-millimeter rockets were fired at Israel from an area between Aita Shaab and Rumaysh in southern Lebanon. Two rockets landed near the Israeli localities of Biranit and Netu\'a in the Western Galilee, some 700 meters from the Lebanese border. No injuries or damage were reported. Two additional rockets severely damaged a chicken coop and caused a propane gas tank to go up in flames. The Israel Defense Forces returned artillery fire at the launch site, causing no casualties. \c\cThe Abdullah Azzam Brigades, a group affiliated with al-Qaeda, reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack on Israel. Part of a statement attributed to the group read: "On Tuesday morning 29/11/2011 a unit from Abdullah Azzam Brigades shelled Zionist settlements in north Palestine from south Lebanon and the missiles have hit their targets. Victory is but from God." The group later denied this and implied that responsibility lay with Syria and Hezbollah. Hezbollah itself denied any connection to the attack. \c\cUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack and called for "maximum restraint" from the parties concerned. The United States State Department also condemned the attack, calling it a "provocative act" that undermined Lebanon's stability and violated Resolution 1701. \c\cA rocket fired at Israel from the southern Lebanese village of Majdal Silim fell short and hit a home in Hula, Lebanon, injuring a Lebanese woman. \c\cTwo rockets fired from Lebanon at Israel landed within Lebanon, according to Beirut officials. \c\cThe previous day, a Lebanese army patrol had discovered two ready-to-launch 107mm Grad rockets between the villages of Halta and Mari, about 2 miles from the Israeli border. The forces defused the rockets. IDF official Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai said Palestinian factions in Lebanon were probably behind the plot. \c\cOn November 22, the Lebanese army disarmed an additional rocket aimed at Israel, in Marjayoun, about 10 kilometers from the border. \c\cA rocket was fired from south Lebanon towards Israel, but it was not clear where the rocket landed and there were no immediate reports of damage inside Israel. \c\cFour Katyusha rockets fired from southern Lebanon targeted northern Israel, setting off air-raid sirens in Acre, Nahariya and additional areas in the Western Galilee, causing no casualties but some damage. The Iron Dome defense system intercepted one of the rockets. The Abdallah Azzam Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack. The United States condemned the rocket fire and called it a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701. Israel retaliated by carrying out an airstrike on a target near Beirut. \c\cThree rockets were fired toward Israel. IDF retaliated by firing about 25 artillery shells on the area. \c\cTwo Katyusha rockets launched from Lebanon against Israel's northern city of Nahariya landed in open territory. No injuries or damage were reported. IDF artillery responded by targeting the launch site in Lebanon. \c\cA rocket fired from Lebanon hit a building in an open area in the Upper Galilee. Two children were lightly injured by shrapnel and four people were suffering from shock as a result of the attack. \c\cTwo rockets were fired into Israel by Lebanese militants, prompting rocket sirens in towns along the border, including Kiryat Shmona and Metula. IDF responded with artillery fire. \c\cThree rockets were fired into northwestern Israel. Sirens sounded in the area of Nahariya and Shlomi. No injuries were reported. The IDF responded with artillery fire. The attack came half a day after the killing of Samir Kuntar in Syria by the Israeli Air Force. \c\cAmidst the background of the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, three rockets were launched from the Qlaileh area towards northern Israel. The IDF stated that the rockets landed in the Mediterranean Sea, causing no damage or casualties, and witnesses in the Israeli city of Haifa reported hearing the three explosions from the rockets impacting the sea. \c\cFor a second time during the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel. According to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, 6 rockets were fired from the Rachaya Al Foukhar area, triggering Red Alert sirens in the northern Israeli kibbutz of Misgav Am. The IDF responded to the rocket fire by firing around 22 artillery shells towards the source of the rocket fire. \c\cOnce again during the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, four rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel, triggering Red Alerts in Haifa. One rocket was intercepted by Iron Dome, while another landed in an open area and two landed in the Mediterranean Sea. The IDF retaliated with artillery fire at the source of the rocket fire. \c\cIn the early morning of July 20, two rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards Israel. One rocket was intercepted by Iron Dome, while the other landed in an open area. The IDF retaliated by firing artillery shells at the source of the rocket fire. \c\cJust after noon on August 4, three rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards Israel. Two rockets landed in Kiryat Shmona, while a third fell short in Lebanon. The IDF retaliated by firing dozens of artillery shells towards the source of the rocket fire.
On 20 May 2021, 21 LGBT rights activists in Ghana were arrested at a hotel in Ho, Ho Municipal District, during an assembly where the activists were discussing human rights treatment of LGBT+ people in the country. The arrests sparked international condemnation and the rise of a movement under the banner #ReleaseThe21 calling for their release and an end to state violence against the Ghanaian LGBT+ community. In the most recent court hearing, on 11 June 2021, the activists were granted bail on their fourth application. \c\cHomosexuality is illegal in many parts of Africa, and in Ghana, it has been criminalized since the 1860s. Although LGBT organizations exist, they are only allowed to discuss human rights but not promote or practice gay sex, which is punishable with up to three years\' imprisonment. \c\cIn February 2021, a community center for the LGBT community had to close its doors amidst mounting pressure by religious groups and anti-gay organizations against sexual minorities. Actor Idris Elba along with British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful and model Naomi Campbell signed an open letter to the government of Ghana to address discrimination and legalize homosexuality in Ghana. \c\cLGBT+ issues are often seen as part of a Western agenda trying to spread US or European values in the country, which has led to high levels of discrimination against LGBT+ people, including blackmail, extortion, and violent attacks. \c\cIn April 2018, President Nana Akufo-Addo, had to clarify statements made to news outlet Al Jazeera about gay rights in the country and after opposition party National Democratic Congress (NDC) asked him to clarify his stance, one of his office spokesmen said that the President would not be willing to legalize gay sex in Ghana and that there would be no changes to existing laws. \c\cAfter the Accra LGBT center had to close, many Black celebrities showed sympathy to the Ghanaian gay community; among them actors Idris Elba and Michaela Coel and signed a letter under the hashtag #GhanaSupportsEquality. Human Rights Watch also condemned the raid and closure of the center. However, members of the organization such as Alex Kofi Donkor and others of LGBT+ Rights Ghana, have stated that they will not flee or leave Ghana and that they will continue for rights recognitions. Donkor stated that authorities had further limited their activities to only "health related" programs. Donkor also said that whilst mixed, the reaction of Ghanaians to the LGBT+ were not openly against them. Donkor also thanked singer Boy George for releasing a song in support of the gay Ghanaian community and he said that it is "heartwarming to see all this support" coming from the international community. \c\cFollowing these statements made by Donkor, a group of MPs led by NDC's Sam Nartey George said that they would push along with other lawmakers to criminalize the promotion of LGBTQ+ rights. George wrote on social media that it was owed to the Ghanaian people to uphold "that which gives us identity as people" and asked for help to fight the "scourge and perversion that homosexuality presents". In response, LGBT+ Rights Ghana urged President Akufo-Addo to guarantee peace and safety for gay people in Ghana and that it was not within the organization's goals to legalize same-sex civil unions. \c\cOn 20 May 2021, a group of LGBT+ rights advocates (16 women and five men) held a meeting in the city of Ho in the southeastern Volta Region of Ghana. Meeting at a hotel for nurses and midwives, the group had met to share information on documenting LGBT+ rights violations in Ghana and had brought a number of flyers with them, including ones on "Coming out" and "All about Trans."\c\cShortly after the meeting began, police raided the hotel and arrested them under the anti-homosexuality laws, unlawful assembly and promoting LGBTQ+ agenda. This was seen as the latest crackdown on LGBT individuals in the country and the arrests were widely condemned as there are no legal parameters to forbid the assembly to discuss improvement of living LGBT+ people, according to organization Rightify Ghana, which also accused, along with an academic, of depriving the activists arrested, access to legal counseling. \c\cSoon after the arrests, the hashtag #ReleaseThe21 went viral on Twitter in the country but the petition by a LGBT organization before the Ho City Circuit Court to immediately release them was refused. \c\cThe Ho City Police Department released a statement saying that the activists arrested "were advocating for LGBTQI activities" and further stated that "The command is cautioning the public, particularly parents, to be wary of activities of persons involved in this misbehavior and report them to the police". \c\cThey were first set to appear in court on 4 June 2021, where the charges against them were read and delayed their bail application for a few days. The activists\' lawyers pointed that promoting LGBT rights is not a crime in Ghana. On 8 June 2021, the Ho City Court denied bail to all 21 activists and ordered the next hearing on the case for 16 June. One of the activists\' lawyers, Julia Selman Ayetey, did not elaborate on why they were denied bail by the Ho City High Court and anticipated that they had already filed for the Circuit Court. \c\cOn 11 June 2021, the activists were released on an almost USD900 bail and their case is expected to resume on a later date. \c\cOn 16 June 2021, Circuit Court Judge Felix Datsomor granted the state prosecutor a postponement for further advice and instruction due to the case being stranded at the attorney general's jurisdiction. \c\cThe United Nations strongly condemned the "arbitrary detention" of the activists and asked for their release through their departments of discriminations against LGBT+ people and arbitrary detentions. In its words of condemnation for the alleged arbitrary detainment and petition to respect the rights of LGBT+ people, the UN added and urged "The Government of Ghana (must) release them immediately and unconditionally."\c\cThe United States State Department also condemned the arrests and called on the government of Ghana to "uphold constitutional human rights protections" and called on all Ghanaians to respect the provisions under Ghana’s constitution that guarantee freedom of speech, expression, and peaceful assembly. \c\cThe European Union and aid donors to Ghana also asked the country for the immediate release of the activists and to respect their human rights and right of free assembly. \c\cThe World Bank and the news agency Thomson Reuters among other donors of aid to Ghana, asked the authorities to respect the rights of the activists and also called for their immediate release. The donors further stated that they were "closely monitoring (and) watching the developing situation". \c\cAfter the bail was granted, Human Rights Watch urged the general prosecutor of Ghana to drop the charges against the 21 activists, saying that the case is a "stain on Ghana's reputation".
The COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec is part of an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic first spread to Quebec in late February 2020, with the first confirmed case being a 41-year-old woman from Montreal who had returned from Iran on a flight from Doha, Qatar. \c\cQuebec declared its first Public Health Emergency in its history on March 14, 2020, which was later renewed and extended multiple times through 2020 and 2021 indefinitely. On March 15, the government enforced the closure of various entertainment and recreational venues, and on March 23, all non-essential businesses were ordered to close. By the end of March, over four and a half thousand cases had been confirmed in all regions of the province. Long-term care homes were particularly hard-hit, with around 80% of deaths in the first wave occurring in centres d\'hébergement de soins de longue durée (CHSLDs) and résidences privée pour aînés (RPAs). \c\cAs summer approached, the number of daily cases saw a steep decline, leading to the relaxation of some health restrictions. However, beginning in late summer and autumn 2020, a second wave of the virus began to emerge in Quebec and throughout Canada. In response, the province entered a province-wide lockdown on December 25 (Christmas Day) 2020 and implemented a curfew on January 9, 2021. The lockdown ended on January 11, allowing for non-essential businesses to re-open. In February 2021, as a result of a rapid decline in cases, Quebec began to reopen the economy regionally. Soon after, in April, the reopening was reversed due to a third wave caused by the variants. As cases began to fall in tandem with the acceleration of the vaccination campaign in May, restrictions started to loosen, with the curfew ending on May 28 in the entire province. Restrictions will continue to be gradually lifted over the summer; by the end of August 2021, most or all restrictions are expected to be lifted. \c\cUntil 2021, Quebec had reported the highest number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Canada, eventually overtaken by Ontario. \c\cFollowing Health Canada's approval of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna, mass vaccination plans began in Quebec, with the first vaccine in Canada given to a Quebec City long-term care home resident on December 14, 2020. \c\cQuebec received their first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine on December 13, 2020. The vaccination campaign was launched the next day, with Gisèle Levesque, an 89-year-old resident of a long-term care home in Quebec City, being the first in the province and country to receive a vaccine. On March 1, 2021, vaccination of the general population began, starting with people 80 years of age or older in Montreal. Over the course of the next three months, the vaccination campaign was gradually expanded to each age group in descending order. By May 14, all adults in Quebec were able to book a vaccination appointment, and by June 6, 75% of Quebecers aged 12 and up had received at least one dose of a vaccine. \c\cVaccination against COVID-19 is not mandatory in Quebec and the vaccines are free of charge for those who choose to get it. \c\cOn September 8, the province unveiled a four-tier system to determine guidance and restrictions based on present risks at a regional level, based on caseload and healthcare capacity. All tiers are subject to continued practice of social distancing, mandatory masking, and hygiene practices. \c\cOn March 16, 2020, the government of Quebec announced financial compensation to workers who returned from abroad that had been placed in segregation, and did not have access to employment insurance. The Programme d\'aide temporaire aux travailleurs touchés par le coronavirus (PATT) paid $573 per week for two weeks. \c\cOn March 20, the government of Quebec announced the suspension of interest on student loans as of April 1, 2020, for the next six months. \c\cDue to the economic impact of the pandemic, initiatives emerged to promote local purchasing, including the social media campaign #OnSeSerreLesCoudes ("We stick together") and Panier Bleu—a government-run directory promoting Quebecois retailers that are offering online sales. \c\cOn April 2, a salary bonus of 8% to all healthcare professionals on the front line and a bonus of 4% to the rest of the network's employees was announced by ministers Christian Dubé and Danielle McCann. A salary increase of $4 per hour was also granted to the 34,000 beneficiary attendants for a period of 16 weeks. On April 4, a bonus of 8% was also granted to the paramedics in the province. \c\cOn April 3, Minister of the Economy Pierre Fitzgibbon announced $150 million in expenditure to help small and medium-sized businesses impacted by the pandemic. Hydro-Québec announced that its executives are renouncing their salary increase for 2020 and that the bonuses and bonuses for 2019 will be paid later this year. In addition, Hydro-Quebec donated 125,000 protective masks to the Quebec government. \c\cIn an interview with Gérard Filion of RDI Économie on April 16, the Minister of Finance, Éric Girard, predicted a budget deficit between $10 and $15 billion for the year 2020. The government had tabled its budget for the year 2020 on March 10, before the start of the pandemic. Its calculation was based on the assumption that 40% of the Quebec economy would be put on pause for a period of eight weeks, and that there would be an increase in health spending. \c\cOn March 15, 2020, the Antonopoulos group — owner of many hotels and restaurants in Old Montreal — announced to its employees that several layoffs were expected. Groupe Sportscene (owner of sports bar chain La Cage) laid off 2,200 of its 2,500 employees. Cirque du Soleil announced the temporary layoff of 4,679 employees, representing almost 95% of its workforce. On March 26, Cogeco Media announced that it would lay off 130 employees, representing a quarter of their workforce. On April 6, CAE announced the layoff of approximately 2,600 employees, representing just over a quarter of their workforce. \c\cOn March 24, the city of Quebec laid off nearly 2,000 employees. On April 4, more than half of municipal workers in Donnacona were laid off. In Lévis, the city has laid off 353 temporary employees for three weeks. Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures and L\'Ancienne-Lorette have also laid off fifty employees. \c\cSince March 15, 2020, anyone who has left a health professional order, such as the Order of Nurses of Quebec [Wikidata], may begin practicing that profession again, without charge, as long as they have not been out of the order for more than 5 years, and are not over 70 years old. \c\cOn March 31, Premier Legault warned of potential shortages of medical supplies within the next week, including personal protective equipment, and announced that Premier of Ontario Doug Ford had agreed to divert some of its shipments of medical equipment to the province. The province of Alberta also announced on April 11 that they would be sending 250,000 N95 masks, 2 million procedural masks, and 15 million gloves to Quebec. \c\cOn April 5, the Quebec government began to centralize the purchase of drugs, and sought to find an alternative drug for propofol, out of fear of a shortage. \c\cOn May 5, Premier Legault revealed that 11,200 workers in the healthcare system were absent. Two days later, that number had increased to 11,600. Of the workers who were present, only 50% were working full-time. The lack of full-time healthcare personnel in Quebec continues to be a problem, particularly in long-term care facilities. \c\cAs of April 1, 2020, 519 long-term care facilities in Quebec, including both lodging centres for long-term care (French: centre d\'hébergement de soins de longue durée, CHSLD) and private seniors\' residences (French: résidence privée pour aînés, RPA), had at least one confirmed case of COVID-19. As of April 30, a total of 6603 residents in CHSLDs and RPAs had been infected. Nearly half of Quebec's deaths from the pandemic have occurred in long-term care facilities. \c\cCHSLD Sainte-Dorothee in Laval has had one of the largest outbreaks; on April 8, it was reported that at least 115 of its 250 residents had been infected, and that there had been at least 13 deaths. The same day, Premier Legault announced that the province would deploy 500 nurses, 450 doctors, and more equipment to long-term care facilities in order to help reduce their burden. \c\cAt least 150 cases have been connected to CHSLD Herron, located in the Montreal suburb of Dorval. There were also reports of neglect and poor living conditions at the facility, with staff having deserted the facility since March 29, and health care workers describing it as being akin to a horror movie or a concentration camp, due to discovering unhygienic living conditions, and residents neglected for nourishment and personal hygiene. On April 10, Health Minister McCann announced that an investigation would be launched into the facility, which had been placed under provincial trusteeship. \c\cOn April 11, the province reported that there had been 31 deaths at CHSLD Herron over the last month, with at least five attributed to COVID-19. CIUSSS de l\'Ouest-de-l\'Île-de-Montréal (CIUSSSOIM) president Lynne McVey stated that the facility's owner was uncooperative, preventing authorities from obtaining the health records of its residents until April 8. Quebec's coroner's office and the Montreal police are also investigating. \c\cThat weekend, teams were sent to all 41 private CHSLDs in the province to evaluate their response to the pandemic. On April 12, AELDPQ (an association representing Quebec's private CHSLDs) sent a letter to Minister McCann, accusing the province of breaking promises to increase funding for private CHSLDs, not displaying equal scrutiny towards public facilities, cutting off private facilities\' procurement of personal protective equipment via provincial suppliers, and not providing promised emergency funding for them to purchase PPE (requiring them to cover their own costs). \c\cOn April 13, Premier Legault presented findings from the evaluations, reporting that the "vast majority" of private CHSLDs were "very well managed," but that there were several that required further monitoring and that the province would now be inspecting all 2,600 CHSLDs. He admitted that pre-existing issues with under-staffing at the facilities due to low wages may have been exacerbated by the pandemic, and announced plans to give temporary bonuses to attendants and orderlies, pending negotiations with unions to raise wages outright. \c\cOn April 14, Premier Legault announced that Quebec would allow residents of CHSLDs to receive visits from a pre-existing primary caregiver beginning April 16. The same day, the owners of CHSLD Herron sent a letter to Legault accusing CIUSSSOIM of engaging in a cover-up, claiming that 28 of the deaths reported had actually occurred after the facility was placed under trusteeship on March 29, disputing that they had not allowed them access to health records until April 8, and that "no communication was made to the families of the residents by the representatives of the CIUSSSOIM, despite numerous requests made to that effect by the employees as well as members of the management of the CHLSD Herron."\c\cOn April 16, the Montreal Regional Director of Public Health, Mylène Drouin, stated that outbreaks of COVID—19 had affected at least 75% of long-term care facilities in the city. Two days later, the Canadian Armed Forces began to deploy 125 workers — including nurses and other support staff — to assist CHSLDs in managing the outbreak and augmenting staff. On April 22, Premier Legault announced that the province had requested an additional 1,000 workers to "give us more resources to help us with non-medical tasks."\c\cOn May 5, Premier Legault announced that some restrictions in uninfected RPAs would be lifted, allowing residents to go for walks unaccompanied and to meet with family outdoors, as long as social distancing measures were being respected. \c\cOn June 4, 2021, the government announced that more restrictions would be lifted in CHSLDs and RPAs. In green zones, residents will be able to receive 9 visitors. In yellow zones, residents will be able to receive visitors from a single "bubble", usually consisting of one household. \c\cAs of March 16, the Montréal–Trudeau International Airport is one of only four airports across the country that is accepting international flights to Canada from outside the Caribbean, Mexico, and the United States. \c\cThe Quebec government has advised against non-essential interprovincial travel. On March 28, regional access to the regions of Bas-Saint-Laurent, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Côte-Nord, Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Nord-du-Québec, Nunavik and Eeyou Istchee have been restricted by police roadblocks and airport controls. \c\cOn April 1, security checkpoints were implemented in several municipalities in the Lanaudiere region, the Laurentians, La Tuque, and the Outaouais region (including the Ontario border), to restrict non-essential travel into the regions. \c\cSince March 15, 2020, all hearings before a judicial administrative court must be held behind closed doors, and all visits (except those of lawyers) to a detention facility in Quebec were suspended. All decisions of the Tribunal administratif du logement authorizing the resumption of housing or the eviction of the tenant were suspended. \c\cSince March 16, all appeals to be heard by the Supreme Court of Canada in March, April and May 2020 have been postponed to June 2020, just as the hearings convened from March 16 to April 30, 2020 before the Quebec Access to Information Commission were cancelled. \c\cSince March 19, orders made by the Court of Quebec that allowed children of the DPJ to maintain physical contact with their biological parents were suspended. \c\cSince March 20, individuals who served an intermittent sentence were on medical leave, and all deadline to introduce a case in front of the Tribunal administratif du Québec, the Tribunal administratif du travail, the Tribunal administratif des marchés financiers, or the Commission d\'accès à l\'information were suspended during the pandemic. \c\cFrom March 23 to April 24, 2020, all deadlines for civil procedures were suspended, and only urgent cases were heard before the Quebec Court of Appeal, the Superior Court of Quebec and the Court of Quebec. \c\cOn April 1, the bar school of the province of Quebec postponed the final evaluation to May 25. \c\cThe curfew that lasted from January 9, 2021, to May 28, resulted in more than 20,000 fines, amounting to about $30 million. \c\cOn March 11, 2020, Premier Legault recommended that a voluntary 14-day quarantine be imposed on all students and faculty returning from school trips to countries strongly affected by the pandemic (such as China and Italy), even if there are no signs of symptoms. He also cancelled upcoming trips to such locations. The same day, students and staff members from several schools who had recently travelled to Italy were told to stay home. Collège International Marie de France suspended classes, pending the testing of a student who was suspected to have been infected. On March 13, the Université de Montréal cancelled all international teaching and research activities until the next school year. \c\cOn March 13, Quebec ordered the closure of all schools, CEGEPs, and post-secondary institutions until at least March 27. Daycares were also ordered closed, unless serving the children of health care professionals. On March 15, the government announced that it would offer free emergency childcare services for people working in essential services, with up to 60,000 spots available, using the up to 400 schools that the government had closed. On March 16, the Université Laval, the Université de Sherbrooke, and the École de technologie supérieure transitioned to online classes. Université Laval and Université de Sherbrooke established emergency funds for students impacted by the pandemic. \c\cOn March 22, the school closures were extended to May 1. On April 5, Quebec extended all closures relating to the pandemic through at least May 4. \c\cThere were calls by the students of the Université du Québec system for the winter terms to be cancelled outright, with Trois-Rivières students circulating a petition also requesting that they receive credits without a grade. \c\cThe province launched a website known as L\'École Ouverte (Open School), which provides a collection of online education resources and activities in French and English. \c\cOn April 20, Minister of Education Jean-François Roberge announced that the province's R score system (typically used by universities to help select CEGEP applicants) would be suspended for the winter semester, so that students are not "unfairly penalized" due to a lack of uniformity in responses and approaches by Quebec's CEGEP's. \c\cOn April 27, Premier Legault announced that elementary schools and daycares would be allowed to reopen outside of the Montreal area on May 11, and within Montreal on May 18, if cases remain stable. Classes will be limited to 15 students each, and parents will be allowed to choose whether their children may return to classes. Secondary and post-secondary schools will not be re-opened until the next school year, to prevent overcrowding of public transit. \c\cOn March 21, 2020, the provincial government awarded a $7 million grant to Medicago, a Quebec City-based firm that was developing a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. On March 23, a team at the Montreal Heart Institute led by Jean-Claude Tardif launched a clinical trial exploring the use of colchicine to help treat complications of COVID-19. The first results are expected for the month of June 2020. \c\cOn March 26, the Fonds de Recherche du Québec, and the Génome Québec, established a provincial task force to build a biobank of COVID-19 samples, led by McGill University chair Vincent Mooser. Mila, an artificial intelligence institute in Montreal, is developing contact tracing software for mobile phones. \c\cOn March 12, 2020, Montreal and Quebec City cancelled their St. Patrick's Day parades (the former for the first time in its 196-year history). The Montreal Symphony Orchestra cancelled concerts scheduled through May 24 (including a planned performance at New York City's Carnegie Hall). All Grand Théâtre de Québec shows were cancelled through at least March 29. Various festivals have been cancelled, including the Festival d\'été de Québec, Les Francos, Metro Metro, Montréal Complètement Cirque, the Montreal International Jazz Festival, and the Festival Santa Teresa. Montreal's Just for Laughs comedy festival was postponed to late September and early October. The Montreal Fireworks Festival was also cancelled. \c\cOn April 7, Montreal ordered the cancellation of all cultural events, festivals, public gatherings, and sporting events through July 2 (resulting in the cancellation of local Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day and Canada Day festivities). On April 10, Quebec requested that all cultural events, festivals, and sporting events be cancelled province-wide through at least August 31. \c\cThe National Hockey League and Major League Soccer have suspended their regular seasons, affecting the Montreal Canadiens and Montreal Impact.
