The 2021 Taliban offensive is an ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies that began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As of 15 July, over a third of Afghanistan's 421 districts were controlled by the Taliban, and by 21 July, half of Afghanistan was under Taliban control. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway of Afghanistan's capital city Kabul. In terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the Britain, Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan Province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cIn July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second and third largest cities of Afghanistan, Kandahar and Herat respectively. During the month, 335 Afghan National Security Forces and 189 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,159 Taliban fighters. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves, with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. On 7 July, pro-government forces defeated a Taliban attempt to capture the city of Qala e Naw. On 8 July, the Taliban captured the strategically important Karakh District in Herat Province. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. \c\cOn 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cOn 16 July, Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed while covering the fighting in Spin Boldak. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Talibans from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban. Lyons implored both sides to protect civilians as she says that women and children are being killed. The same day around 46 Afghan troops, including 5 officers, sought refuge in Pakistan after they were unable to defend their military post. \c\cOn 28 July, a delegation from the Taliban met in Tianjin with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who pledged the People's Republic of China's support for the Taliban on the condition that they cut ties with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, vowing the "bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream" and offering to host peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. \c\cBy 31 July 2021, the Taliban had entered the provincial capitals of both Helmand and Herat provinces, capturing scores of districts in said provinces and capturing border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan. Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions. On 3 August, 40 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in the fighting. After capturing Lashkar Gah's radio station, the Taliban began broadcasting their Voice of Sharia programming. The rebels also began to attack the city's airport. Meanwhile, the government dispatched reinforcements to prevent the city from falling to the insurgents. \c\cOn 3 August, 13 people - including five attackers - were killed in a Taliban bombing and shootout in Kabul. The inghimasi-style operation, carried out by the Taliban's "Martyrdom Battalion", aimed at killing Defence Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi; he survived the attack. Mohammadi was described by the Long War Journal as one of the key government figures responsible for countering the Taliban offensive. \c\cAs of 5 August, 115 Afghan National Security Forces and 58 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,661 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. \c\cOn 6 August 2021, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul. On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital. \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahideen Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. On 2 August 2021, President Ghani blamed the advance of the Taliban on the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops and said the former had not cut ties with terrorist organizations and had escalated attacks against women, which the Taliban denied. \c\cTaliban: On 9 July, Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar said in Moscow that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and pointed  out that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\cChina: Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi has criticized the withdrawal of American-led NATO forces and has urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\cIndia: Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that India would be consulting all important parts in the conflict, including China, and that India was pushing for "conciliation in Afghanistan."\c\cIran: Influential Shia cleric, lawmaker, and politician Mojtaba Zonnour said that the Taliban is "an undeniable part of the reality in Afghanistan", and that it should not be equated to Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIL or al-Qaeda. \c\cKazakhstan: Representatives from the country participated in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\cKyrgyzstan: Representatives from the country participated in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\cPakistan: Keeping in view the advancements of Taliban, DG ISPR issued a statement that "Pakistan should be seen as facilitator, not guarantor in Afghan peace process."\c\cRussia: Russian authorities said they were working with the Tajik government to protect it from any foreign threat under the Collective Security Treaty Organization.Russian special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, told Russia's RIA news agency that Afghan government only paid lip service to the idea of talks and they were not doing enough to make them happen. He also said that Russia and other regional powers favoured a transitional government in Afghanistan. Taliban representatives visited Moscow in July. Russia's Foreign Ministry called the Islamist group "of sound mind". \c\cTajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon ordered 20,000 reserve servicemen of the country's Ground Forces to be sent to the Afghan–Tajik border. \c\cTurkey: The country offered to order its troops to protect Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \c\cTurkmenistan: Turkmen military forces were assigned to the Afghan–Turkmen border due to security concerns. \c\cUnited Kingdom: UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, said UK will be ready to work with Taliban should they come into power provided that they adhere to certain international norms. However, Wallace warned that UK will review any relationship if Taliban were found violating human rights in Afghanistan. \c\cUnited States: President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying that the country had not gone to Afghanistan to "nation build." Biden added that he would not "send another generation of Americans to fight there" and pointed to other failed attempts at unifying Afghanistan in the past. He also reassured that the U.S. safety was not at risk with any outcome of the infighting in Afghanistan. \c\cUzbekistan: The government raised concerns of a possible migratory crisis due to the infighting in Afghanistan and reported that U.S. authorities had contacted Uzbek officials to confirm if Uzbekistan could safeguard Afghans who collaborated with the U.S., fleeing from the country. In response, the Uzbek government erected a tent city for migrants in the city of Termez.
Since the beginning of August 2021, multiple wildfires in Greece have killed two people, injured at least 20 others and burned dozens of homes, after an historical heatwave for the country. Authorities have evacuated several villages and towns. \c\cThe largest wildfires are in Attica, Olympia, Messenia, and Euboea.

On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion. The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape. As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had "sold" the city to the Taliban. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \'deadlier phase\' of the war. The British government warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan "immediately" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation. \c\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ex-warlord and the strongman who had traditionally dominated the city, took his followers and fled to Khwaja Du Koh District, the only area in Jowzjan Province which was still government-held. Meanwhile, pro-government forces had been reduced to a pocket of resistance in Lashkar Gah, while Kandahar and Herat remained fiercely contested. Insurgents also launched repeated raids on the other provincial capitals. The following day, the Taliban overran most of Kunduz and Sar-e Pol city after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces. In the battles for the two cities, mass desertations were reported, as many Afghan National Army soldiers had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance as well as Taliban propaganda. Pro-government forces were only able to hold onto Kunduz's military base and airport. Reporting described the capture of Kunduz as \'the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May\' with the city being one of Afghanistan's largest settlements, well connected to other major locations in country including the capital city Kabul and considered part of a major Asian drug smuggling route. \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). \c\cOn 29 January 2020, Queensland was the first to declare a public health emergency. The legislation was strengthened on 6 February by the Public Health (Declared Public Health Emergencies) Amendment Bill 2020. In March, power was given directly to the Chief Health Officer (rather than the Health Minister on behalf of the Cabinet) to make \'Directions\', amongst other things allowing her to declare restrictions on movement, gatherings and business activities, to set social distancing or masking requirements, and to close borders.  As of the end of July 2021, Queensland had recorded the death of just 7 patients with Covid-19.  This fatality rate, of just under 1 per million residents, was the lowest not just in Australia, but of any sizeable jurisdiction with its own policing and health powers, in the world. \c\cKey directions made under the Public Health Act 2005 include:\c\c2 April – A person must not leave their principal place of residence except for essential needs including work, food, medical and exercise, outdoor gatherings only up to 2 persons or with members of household, receiving only to 2 visitors at a residence, and no gatherings in non-residences. \c\c9 April – "Non-essential" business, activity or undertaking must not be operated. "Non-essential" businesses include cinemas, casinos, concerts, indoor sports, gyms, playgrounds, campgrounds, libraries. Restrictions also apply to restaurants (take away or delivery only), churches, hairdressers etc. However, most construction, mining, manufacturing and retail businesses continued to operate. \c\cRestricted entry into Queensland was introduced, with only Queensland residents and those considered an \'exempt person\' being allowed to enter Queensland by air, sea, rail or road from another state or territory. This was introduced in stages: Stage 1 started on 26 March 2020, with stages 2 and 3 involving tightening the restrictions. Stage 4, introduced on 11 April, was the most restrictive, every person crossing the border including Queensland residents required a permit. In addition, a person who had been in a declared COVID-19 hotspot in the previous 14 days had to self-quarantine for 14 days. \c\cClosures of areas within Queensland included:\c\cAll camping areas within Queensland national parks, state forests and recreation areas were closed on 26 March.[citation needed]\c\cClosure of high visitation National Parks including Fraser Island as well as all day use areas and visitor centres on 9 April. \c\cClosure of Queensland waters to cruise ships on 6 April. \c\cClosure of Surfers Paradise, Coolangatta and The Spit beaches on 8 April. \c\cAccess to the Torres Strait Islands has been restricted to prevent COVID-19 from reaching the region, which has to date remained free of cases. \c\cOn 1 February 2021, Queensland opened its border to all Australian states and territories except Western Australia. Since the border closures were implemented, 6,855,750 border passes were issued. \c\cOn 22 February, the first Queenslander received a COVID-19 vaccination at Gold Coast University Hospital. She was a nurse who works in that hospital's COVID-19 ward. \c\cOn 28 February 2021,  the "Check in Qld" QR code sign-in/contact tracing app was launched by the Minister for Health and Ambulance Services, Yvette D\'Ath.  It is based on the ACT "Check in CBR" app. Use of the app is not mandatory. \c\cOn 12 March, Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane went into lockdown after a doctor tested positive for COVID-19. This was the beginning of one cluster in Brisbane connected to that hospital. Queensland had gone 59 days without any locally acquired COVID-19 infections. \c\cDue to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, from 1am on 24 June, the Queensland government declared all of Greater Sydney was a hotspot. Border entry will be refused to anyone who lives in, or has visited: Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Wollongong or Shellharbour. Residents returning will be quarantined for 14 days. Everyone entering Queensland will have to complete a border declaration. \c\cOn 8 January 2021, a three-day lockdown was announced by Annastacia Palaszczuk to prevent spread of the more contagious UK strain of coronavirus that escaped from a Brisbane hotel quarantine. The lockdown applied to all of greater Brisbane including council areas of Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan City, Moreton Bay and Redland City from 6 pm that day. More than 2 million residents were affected. \c\cOn 29 March at 5 pm, Greater Brisbane went into yet another three-day lockdown. The step was taken when a second cluster of the UK strain of COVID-19 grew to seven people. Two of them were an un-vaccinated nurse from Princess Alexandra Hospital, and her sister. By 30 March another 8 locally acquired cases were reported, for a total of 10 new cases in the preceding 24 hours, and 2 separate clusters, both UK strain were identified. As of this date Queensland had 78 active cases in hospitals. On 31 March in Queensland 34,711 coronavirus tests and 7,596 vaccinations were conducted. \c\cOn 1 April, the "three-day" lockdown was lifted five hours early at midday. Though 10 new cases had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, there was only one case of community transmission, which was linked to the second cluster surrounding the infected nurse from the Princess Alexandra Hospital. This cluster now numbered 12, up from 7 on 29 March. \c\cSome restrictions introduced for the lockdown were maintained temporarily:\c\call Queenslanders had to carry a face-mask outside their home until 15 April,\c\cpatrons at food or beverage venues had to stay seated, no dancing allowed,\c\c30 person limit at private gatherings at homes statewide,\c\cbusinesses and churches could open, but have only one-person-per 2-square-metres of floor area,\c\cvisitors were not permitted for 2 weeks at: aged or disabled care facilities, hospitals and prisons. \c\cOn 28 June Queensland recorded 3 new COVID-19 cases overnight. 2 were locally acquired, one acquired overseas. A miner was found to be infected with the Delta variant of COVID-19 after returning from the Northern Territory. As a result of these cases, from 10pm on 29 June, masks became mandatory in these local government areas:\c\cBrisbane\c\cGold Coast\c\cIpswich\c\cLogan\c\cLockyer Valley\c\cMoreton Bay\c\cNoosa\c\cRedlands\c\cScenic Rim Region\c\cSomerset\c\cSunshine Coast Region\c\cIn addition:\c\cMasks must be worn in workplaces when another person is present. \c\cDancing is again banned\c\cNo more than 30 people are allowed inside homes. \c\cAfter the lockdown was expanded: \c\cMasks mandatory when leaving the house. \c\cHousehold visitors limited to 2\c\cFunerals restricted to 20 people\c\cWeddings restricted to 10 people\c\cdancing and singing not allowed\c\cRestaurants and cafes can only provide: \c\ctake away\c\chome delivery. \c\cOn 29 June from 6pm the lockdown was expanded to new areas. All of:\c\cSouth East Queensland\c\cTownsville city\c\cMagnetic Island and\c\cPalm Island\c\cwent into lockdown for 3 days, till 6pm on 2 July. This move was taken after a casual clerical worker from Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane, who worked outside the COVID ward as a concierge, became infected with the Delta variant and travelled from Sandgate in Brisbane to Magnetic Island and Townsville where she visited markets. \c\cOn 23 July, the border with NSW was closed from 1:00am due to locations outside Greater Sydney reporting COVID-19 cases. From 6:00am on 23 July to 6:00am on 20 August the same rules will be used across the state, except for SE Queensland where masks were still required. \c\cIn SE Queensland wearing a face mask is mandatory whenever outside the home, unless:\c\cin a car alone\c\cor with household members\c\ceating or drinking\c\cexercising\c\coutdoors alone\c\cor with household members\c\cit is unsafe\c\cOn 24 July 2021, there was an anti-lockdown protest in Brisbane. There were also protests in Melbourne, and in Sydney, where several people were arrested, infringement notices issued and over 50 people charged. \c\cOn 31 July from 4pm, 11 LGAs in South East Queensland went into a snap lockdown for 3 days. This was after 6 new locally acquired cases of the Delta COVID variant. The areas affected were:\c\cBrisbane, Gold Coast, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Logan, Moreton Bay, Noosa, Redlands, Sunshine Coast, Somerset and Scenic Rim. One of the cases is a medical student at the University of Queensland, who had been to many venues, including Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, the University of Queensland, and the Translational Research Institute at Princess Alexandra Hospital. \c\cBy 1 August there were 18 locally acquired cases of Delta variant. Deputy Premier Steven Miles said that the 9 new cases were the greatest number since August 2020. \c\cOn 2 August there were 15 new cases of COVID-19, 2 overseas acquired. Consequently, the South-east Queensland’s lockdown was extended until 4:00pm on 8 August (Sunday). The same day, because of the extension, the Ekka agricultural show was cancelled for the second year, 5 days before it was to be open to the public from 7 August (Saturday). \c\cOn 8 August the lockdown in SE Queensland ended, though some restrictions remained in force, including mandatory wearing of masks. \c\cOn 9 August, Cairns went into lockdown from 4:00pm for three days. This was due to an "unexpected" case of COVID-19, a taxi driver who was infectious in the community for ten days. \c\cIn 2020 and 2021 the Ekka agricultural show was cancelled and again in 2021 as South East Queensland was then in lockdown. \c\cThe Big Pineapple Music Festival was first postponed from May to November 2020 due to restriction of non-essential events to 500 patrons maximum. It was then cancelled in August. The next festival event is scheduled for Saturday, 22 May 2021. \c\c"Land Forces 2020" international military exhibition scheduled for 1–3 September 2020, deferred until 1–3 June 2021. \c\cBrisbane, and the Gold Coasts\' New Year's Eve fireworks at the end of 2020 were cancelled. \c\cOn 16 February 2021, the World Surf League event the Gold Coast Corona Open was moved from Snapper Rocks to Narrabeen in Sydney. It is scheduled for 16–26 April 2021. \c\cAll events of the Brisbane Open House planned in 2020 and 2021 had been cancelled. \c\cThe Birdsville Races were cancelled in 2020. In 2021 they were also "called off" and rescheduled to April 2022. \c\cCOVID-19 cumulative cases in Queensland
The COVID-19 pandemic in Palau is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Palau on 31 May 2021. \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cPalau began implementing border controls early on. The President of Palau Thomas Remengesau Jr. issued an executive order suspending all charter flights from China, Macau, and Hong Kong from 1–29 February 2020. By March, the country's borders were closed. Schools were also shut starting in April. Remengesau eventually suspended travel to Palau. \c\cThe order also quarantined all non-citizens who recently entered the country for fourteen days. \c\cOn 1 April 2021 Palau and Taiwan established a "travel bubble", allowing people to travel between the two countries, with restrictions. \c\cPalau registered its first case of COVID-19 on 31 May 2021. President Surangel Whipps Jr. said that the patient was at low risk of infecting others and that the close contacts of the patient had returned negative test results. Whipps Jr. also highlighted that the majority of the population had been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. \c\cOn 11 June 2021, a second case is reported. \c\cPalauans began receiving COVID-19 vaccines in 2021. As a member of the Compact of Free Association with the United States, Palau has received vaccines from Operation Warp Speed. According to the Ministry of Health, vaccination started on 3 January and as of 12 April 40% of the population was fully vaccinated. By 26 May, an estimated 96% of adults (18 and over) in the country had been fully vaccinated. By the time the first case was detected, 97% of the adult population was vaccinated, about 70% of all Palauans. Plans were also announced to start vaccinating adolescents from 12 to 17. \c\cBy early August, 65% of 12 to 17 year olds had at least one dose of the vaccine, resulting in 80% of the eligible population being fully vaccinated.
Egypt–Russia relations (Russian: Российско-египетские отношения) refer to bilateral relations between Egypt and Russia. Diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Egypt were established on August 26, 1943. Egypt has an embassy in Moscow, while Russia has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate-general in Alexandria. \c\cRelations between Russia and Egypt have a long history, dating back to before the 16th century.  Early on, they were centered on the Russian government's and the Russian Church's support for the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria.  As early as in 1556, Patriarch Joachim of Alexandria sent a letter to the Russian Tzar Ivan IV,  asking the Orthodox monarch to provide some material assistance for the Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, which had suffered from the Turks. In 1558, the Czar sent to Egypt a delegation led by archdeacon Gennady, who, however, died in Constantinople before he could reach Egypt. From then on, the embassy was headed by a Smolensk merchant, Vasily Poznyakov. Poznyakov's delegation visited Alexandria, Cairo, and Sinai, brought the patriarch a fur coat and an icon sent by the Tzar. Poznyakov's  account of its two and half years\' travels, which may have  been the first ever Russian first-hand African trip report,  became popular among Russian readers for centuries to follow. \c\cRussia continued to provide support to Egyptian Christians for centuries to come. \c\cIn the 1950s, Gamal Abdel Nasser's independent and anti-imperialist policy earned him enthusiastic support from the Communist government of the USSR. In 1955, Egypt  made a major arms deal with Soviet Union, and from then, teams of Egyptian officers were trained in Eastern Bloc countries. Czechoslovak instructors also came in 1956, to train Egyptian personnel in the use of Soviet weapons. When France attacked Egypt during Suez Crisis, USSR threatened to use destructive weapons i.e. nuclear weapons for the defense of Egypt.  The degree of the Soviet approval of the Egyptian leader's policies culminated, rather controversially, in the award of the highest Soviet decoration, the star of the Hero of the Soviet Union with the Order of Lenin  to Nasser during Nikita Khrushchev's visit to the country in 1964. \c\cDuring the Nasser years, many young Egyptians studied in Soviet universities and military schools. Among them was the future president, Hosni Mubarak, who went for training in a military pilot school in Kyrgyzstan. During the War of Attrition, USSR sent 10-15000 servicemen to operate the air defense of Egypt against Israeli air attacks. \c\cThe relationship went sour within years after the death of Nasser, when the new president, Anwar Sadat, started re-orienting the country toward the West. On May 27, 1971, a friendship treaty was signed between the two countries, but relations were nevertheless declining. In July 1972, it was claimed the Egyptian government expelled Soviet military advisors from Egypt, (however new research indicates that this was disinformation to hide Egypt's offensive plans), and captured Egyptian documents demonstrate that Soviet advisors continued in their previous roles of training Egyptian troops, and were certainly present during the war in 1973. During the Yom Kippur War , Soviet Union sent several thousands of tonnes of aid to Egypt. Brezhnev threatened to intervene on behalf of Egypt if Israel broke the ceasefire. Lieutenant General Anatoly Pushkin claimed that 1500 Soviet pilots and air defense experts engaged in combat for Egypt during the war. In March 1976 Egypt abrogated the friendship treaty, and relations between the two countries were damaged once again when Egypt supported the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan when the USSR invaded in 1979. In September 1981, these relations were severed by the Egyptian government, accusing Soviet leadership of trying to undermine Sadat's leadership in retaliation to the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. Relations were reestablished under president Hosni Mubarak in 1984, and Alexander Belonogov became the Ambassador. In February 1989, Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Shevardnadze visited Egypt. \c\cIntergovernmental relations improved after the fall of Communism in the USSR, and Russia's appearance as an independent political actor. \c\cIn April 2005, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, visited Egypt, and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak visited Russia in April 2008. Both countries agreed to work together to help Egypt create a nuclear program which is mostly for civilian purposes. In May 2013, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi visited Russia. \c\cRelations between the two countries improved even further following the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office in July 2013. Both countries have since then worked closely to strengthen military and trade ties, among other aspects of bilateral cooperation. From 2009 to 2018, Russia accounted for 31% of Egypt's imports of major weapons. \c\cIn November 2013, Egypt's then Defense Minister Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy met with their Russian counterparts, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov who were on a visit to Cairo. Fahmy stated that Egypt wished to return to Soviet-level relations with Russia, and Shoigu hinted that there may be military cooperation between the Russian and Egyptian navies and air forces.[citation needed] It was the first meeting of its kind since the Soviet era. \c\cSince then, Egyptian and Russian leaders have exchanged two rounds of four-way visits in both Cairo and Moscow. Sisi went to Russia twice in 2014: in February, when he was still Egypt's defense minister, and in August after his election as president. The February meeting was Sisi's first visit abroad following Mohamed Morsi's removal, during which Russian president Vladimir Putin offered him Russia's backing in his race for the presidency of Egypt before Sisi even officially announced his campaign. \c\cSisi made his second visit on August 12 at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, and it was his first to a non-Arab or African country since his inauguration as President two months earlier. During the visit, both him and Putin agreed on boosting bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Putin promised to speed up arms sales to Egypt. "We are actively developing our military and technological cooperation," Putin told Sisi. He added that a corresponding protocol was signed in March and that weapons are being delivered to Egypt. \c\cTrade and economic investment plans were also announced during the meeting, during which Putin said that Egypt was discussing a free trade zone with the Russian-led Eurasian Customs Union which also includes Belarus and Kazakhstan.[citation needed] Additionally, both leaders have discussed plans to establish a Russian industrial zone in the New Suez Canal project that was recently inaugurated by Sisi, as well as another plan to renew and redevelop important projects that were established by the former Soviet Union. \c\cIn September 2014, a preliminary deal was reached between both countries to buy arms worth $3.5 billion from Russia, despite Western sanctions on Moscow as a result of its involvement in the war in Donbass. \c\cAs a result of the Metrojet Flight 9268 crash on October 31, 2015, which carried 224 passengers on board toward Russia, both countries were planning investigating the crash. \c\cOn November 28, 2015, Egypt and Russia signed a deal which would allow Russian and Egyptian warplanes to use each other's airbases and airspace. Both countries could be described as "close allies" as Putin usually referred to Sisi as a "Trusted and Close Partner." On 11 December 2017, during President Vladimir Putin's visit to Cairo, the two countries signed agreements in which Russia would build Egypt's first nuclear reactor, and supply nuclear fuel for the same. It was also agreed that a "Russian Industrial Zone" would be built along the Suez Canal, explained by Putin as being "the biggest regional center for producing Russian products onto the markets of the Middle-East and North Africa."\c\cRussia supports Syrian government in the Syrian civil war, and intervened militarily in its favor in 2015. Egypt also supports the Syrian government in the Civil War. In 2020, Egypt has reportedly dispatched 150 troops to help Syrian government. Egypt is openly backing House of Representatives in the ongoing Libyan Civil War, while the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group is assisting the House of Representatives\' forces. \c\cIn summer 2020, Egypt received five Su-35 jets, despite the American threatening with sanctions. However, the Russian journalist, Ivan Safronov, who revealed the transaction was detained for disclosing a state secret. \c\cRussians constitute the largest group of outsiders to visit Egypt, while Russia is popular with Egyptian tourists as well.[citation needed] As of 2015[update] Egypt is the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroad—a basic vacation package including flight, hotel and meals can be purchased for as little as US$1,000. \c\cIn August 2021, direct commercial flights between Russia and Egypt resumed for the first time since the Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing in 2015, which killed 224 people, most of whom were Russian tourists. A Rossiya Airlines passenger plane landed in Sharm El Sheikh carrying 518 passengers, and was welcomed with a water cannon salute, roses and flags. \c\cIn 2006, the Egyptian Russian University was opened in Badr City, Cairo, offering training in pharmacy and engineering. 
An ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As of 15 July, over a third of Afghanistan's 421 districts were controlled by the Taliban, and by 21 July, half of Afghanistan was under Taliban control. On 6–9 August, the Taliban captured six provincial capitals including Kunduz. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway to Afghanistan's capital city Kabul. In terms of equipment, the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces, as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on the ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the U.K., Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan Province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cIn July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second and third largest cities of Afghanistan, Kandahar and Herat respectively. During the month, 335 Afghan National Security Forces and 189 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,159 Taliban fighters. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves, with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. On 7 July, pro-government forces defeated a Taliban attempt to capture the city of Qala e Naw. On 8 July, the Taliban captured the strategically important Karakh District in Herat Province. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. On 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force; Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed there while covering the fighting two days later. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Talibans from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban. Lyons implored both sides to protect civilians as she says that women and children are being killed. The same day around 46 Afghan troops, including 5 officers, sought refuge in Pakistan after they were unable to defend their military post. \c\cOn 28 July, a delegation from the Taliban met in Tianjin with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who pledged the People's Republic of China's support for the Taliban on the condition that they cut ties with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, vowing to "bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream" and offering to host peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. \c\cBy 31 July, the Taliban had entered the provincial capitals of both Helmand and Herat provinces, capturing scores of districts in said provinces and capturing border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan. Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable.

Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban.

The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions.

On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion. The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape. As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had "sold" the city to the Taliban. Social media posts suggested that Taliban were welcomed by some resident of the city which has a long history of lawlessness. The social media posts showed Taliban driving captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs and pickups through the streets while flying Taliban flags as local residents — mostly youths and young men — cheered them on. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \'deadlier phase\' of the war. The governments of Britain and United States warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan "immediately" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation. \c\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital.

USS Ronald Reagan was launching fast jets to provide support to the missions. The American Embassy in Kabul urged all Americans to leave the country immediately due to increased security concerns, and the inability of the embassy to guarantee the safety of American citizens due to the reduction of staff at the embassy. \c\cThe following day, the Taliban captured the cities of Kunduz and Sar-e Pol after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces. In the battles for the two cities, mass desertions were reported, as many Afghan National Army soldiers had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance as well as Taliban propaganda.

They had also taken control of the police headquarters and prison. Although heavy fighting continued, Farah is the seventh provincial capital to fall. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cOn 23 June, the U.S. intelligence agencies estimated that the Afghan government could fall within the next six months following the U.S. withdrawal. \c\cSince 2 July, U.S. withdrawal from the Bagram Airfield, U.S. airstrikes against the Taliban have been led from outside of Afghanistan. Requiring the warplanes to travel several hours to reach their targets.

Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves, with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. On 7 July, pro-government forces defeated a Taliban attempt to capture the city of Qala e Naw. On 8 July, the Taliban captured the strategically important Karakh District in Herat Province. \c\cOn 8 July, Afghan soldiers executed an Afghan villager by making him sit on an improvised explosive device (IED) before it exploded. The victim, named Barakatullah, was accused of aiding the Taliban by Afghan police and anti-Taliban militia. Father of Barakatullah denied that his son was working with the Taliban. The incident took place south of the city of Sharana, the capital Paktika province and the video of the incident was uploaded on TikTok. France 24 Observers team was able to verify and geolocate the video. Fawad Aman, a spokesperson for the Afghan ministry of defence, denied that any such incident took place. An Afghan journalist, Naseeb Zadran, said that this not an isolated incident and reflects the impunity enjoyed by Afghan army. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. On 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force; Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed there while covering the fighting two days later. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Talibans from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban. Lyons implored both sides to protect civilians as she says that women and children are being killed. The same day around 46 Afghan troops, including 5 officers, sought refuge in Pakistan after they were unable to defend their military post. \c\cOn 28 July, a delegation from the Taliban met in Tianjin with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who pledged the People's Republic of China's support for the Taliban on the condition that they cut ties with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, vowing to "bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream" and offering to host peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. \c\cBy 31 July, the Taliban had entered the provincial capitals of both Helmand and Herat provinces, capturing scores of districts in said provinces and capturing border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan. Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions. On 3 August, 40 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in the fighting. After capturing Lashkar Gah's radio station, the Taliban began broadcasting their Voice of Sharia programming. The rebels also began to attack the city's airport. Meanwhile, the government dispatched reinforcements to prevent the city from falling to the insurgents. \c\cOn 3 August, 13 people - including five attackers - were killed in a Taliban bombing and shootout in Kabul. The inghimasi-style operation, carried out by the Taliban's "Martyrdom Battalion", aimed at killing Defence Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi; he survived the attack. Mohammadi was described by the Long War Journal as one of the key government figures responsible for countering the Taliban offensive. \c\cAs of 5 August, 115 Afghan National Security Forces and 58 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,197 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. \c\cOn 6 August, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul. On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion. The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape. As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had "sold" the city to the Taliban. Social media posts suggested that Taliban were welcomed by some resident of the city which has a long history of lawlessness. The social media posts showed Taliban driving captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs and pickups through the streets while flying Taliban flags as local residents — mostly youths and young men — cheered them on. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \'deadlier phase\' of the war. The governments of Britain and United States warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan "immediately" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation. \c\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ex-warlord and the strongman who had traditionally dominated the city, took his followers and fled to Khwaja Du Koh District, the only area in Jowzjan Province which was still government-held. Meanwhile, pro-government forces had been reduced to a pocket of resistance in Lashkar Gah, while Kandahar and Herat remained fiercely contested. Insurgents also launched repeated raids on the other provincial capitals. On the same day, U.S. B-52 bombers carried out airstrikes against Taliban in Afghanistan, operating from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The United States was also using armed Reaper drones and AC-130 Spectre gunships which reportedly began daily attacks against targets around Kandahar, Herat, and Lashkar Gah. USS Ronald Reagan was launching fast jets to provide support to the missions. The American Embassy in Kabul urged all Americans to leave the country immediately due to increased security concerns, and the inability of the embassy to guarantee the safety of American citizens due to the reduction of staff at the embassy. \c\cThe following day, the Taliban captured the cities of Kunduz and Sar-e Pol after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces. In the battles for the two cities, mass desertions were reported, as many Afghan National Army soldiers had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance as well as Taliban propaganda. Pro-government forces were only able to hold onto Kunduz's military base and airport. Reporters described the capture of Kunduz as "the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May" with the city being one of Afghanistan's largest settlements, well connected to other notable locations in the country including Kabul and considered part of a major Central Asian drug smuggling route. The city of Taloqan was also taken by the Taliban late 8 August, making it the fifth provincial capital to fall. Government forces retreated from the city after noon, retaking Warsaj District and Farkhar District. \c\cOn 9 August, the Taliban captured Aybak, the capital of Samangan province. Deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told the AFP news agency that government forces had withdrawn from the city without a fight after community representatives had requested that it be spared more violence. On the same day, Asif Azimi, a former senator from Samangan and a prominent warlord from the Jamiat-e Islami party, defected to the Taliban. Azimi said hundreds of men under his command had also defected to the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani and other political leaders also agreed to form a joint command center to coordinate and assist with public uprising forces. \c\cFighting intensified around Mazar-i-Sharif on 10 August. In Farah, capital of Farah Province, the Taliban had taken control of the governor's compound with heavy fighting between the Taliban and government forces. They had also taken control of the police headquarters and prison. Although heavy fighting continued, Farah is the seventh provincial capital to fall. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cOn 23 June, the U.S. intelligence agencies estimated that the Afghan government could fall within the next six months following the U.S. withdrawal. \c\cSince 2 July, U.S. withdrawal from the Bagram Airfield, U.S. airstrikes against the Taliban have been led from outside of Afghanistan. Requiring the warplanes to travel several hours to reach their targets. According to a U.S. defence official, the airstrikes since 2 July amounted to only "a handful" each day. \c\cOn 8 August, the head of extremist monitoring group SITE, Rita Katz said that the Taliban advance resembled the earlier days of the Syrian civil war amid Nusra Front's victories, "except now on a completely different scale, given the Taliban's horrifying momentum". \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahideen Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. On 2 August 2021, President Ghani blamed the advance of the Taliban on the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops and said the former had not cut ties with terrorist organizations and had escalated attacks against women, which the Taliban denied. On August 9, #SanctionPakistan became one of the top Twitter trends in Afghanistan and worldwide, with Afghans holding Pakistan responsible for its support of the Taliban. \c\cTaliban: On 9 July, Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar said in Moscow that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and pointed  out that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\c China: Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi criticized the speed and timing of withdrawal of the American-led NATO forces and urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\c India: Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that India would consult all important parts in the conflict, including China, and that India was pushing for "conciliation in Afghanistan."\c\c Iran: Influential Shia cleric, lawmaker, and politician Mojtaba Zonnour said that the Taliban is "an undeniable part of the reality in Afghanistan", and that it should not be equated to Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIL or al-Qaeda. \c\c Kazakhstan: Kazakh representatives participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Kyrgyzstan: Representatives from the country participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Pakistan: Keeping in view the advancements of Taliban, DG ISPR issued a statement that "Pakistan should be seen as facilitator, not guarantor in Afghan peace process."\c\c Russia: Russian authorities said they were working with the Tajik government to protect it from any foreign threat under the Collective Security Treaty Organization.Russian special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said that the Afghan government only paid lip service to the idea of talks and they were not doing enough to make them happen. He also said that Russia and other regional powers favoured a transitional government in Afghanistan. Taliban representatives visited Moscow in July. Russia's Foreign Ministry called the Taliban "of sound mind". \c\c Tajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon ordered 20,000 reserve servicemen of the country's Ground Forces to be sent to the Afghan–Tajik border. \c\c Turkey: The country offered to order its troops to protect Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \c\c Turkmenistan: Turkmen military forces were assigned to the Afghan–Turkmen border due to security concerns. \c\c United Kingdom: UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, said UK will be ready to work with the Taliban should they come into power provided that they adhere to certain international norms. However, Wallace warned that UK will review any relationship if Taliban were found violating human rights in Afghanistan. \c\c United States: President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying that the country had not gone to Afghanistan to "nation build." Biden added that he would not "send another generation of Americans to fight there" and pointed to other failed attempts at unifying Afghanistan in the past. He also reassured that the U.S. safety was not at risk with any outcome of the infighting in Afghanistan. \c\c Uzbekistan: The government raised concerns of a possible migratory crisis due to the infighting in Afghanistan and reported that U.S. authorities had contacted Uzbek officials to confirm if Uzbekistan could safeguard Afghans who collaborated with the U.S., fleeing from the country. In response, the Uzbek government erected a tent city for migrants in the city of Termez.
The 2021 Algeria wildfires are multiple wildfires happening in Algeria since 9 August 2021, and have killed 65 people (37 civilians and 28 soldiers). \c\cOn 9 August 2021, many fires started up in the Kabyle region and elsewhere, and Algerian authorities sent soldiers to help citizens with the blazes and evacuations. \c\cOn 10 August 2021, multiple fires have burned Mediterranean trees, destroying olive trees and killing cattle and chickens. \c\cMany distant villages have very limited water. Some villagers fled, while others tried to hold back the flames themselves, using buckets, branches and rudimentary tools. \c\cThe firefighting aircraft were not available.
The Lebanese liquidity crisis is an ongoing financial crisis affecting the nation of Lebanon, starting in August 2019, which was further exacerbated by both the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon (which began in 2020) and the 2020 Beirut port explosion. \c\cSince 1997, the Lebanese pound has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1,507.5 LBP per USD. In August 2019, due to various financial hardships, especially the growing probability that the Lebanese government will default on maturing debt obligations, the black market exchange rate started diverging from the official exchange rate. \c\cIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the black market exchange rate reached 1,600 LBP per USD, and increased to 3,000 LBP per USD in April 2020, 14,000 LBP per USD in March 2021 and 15,200 LBP per USD in June 2021. The USD black market exchange rate continues to fluctuate substantially due to devaluation of the Lebanese pound caused by acute USD shortages within Lebanon. This dollar shortage also caused 785 restaurants and cafes to close between September 2019 and February 2020 and resulted in 25,000 employees losing their jobs. Consumer goods prices have increased by 580% since October resulting from the worst economic crisis in decades. This economic crisis made Lebanon's gross domestic product fall to about 44 billion USD from about 55 billion USD the year before. \c\cThe fall of the exchange rate caused the 2019–2021 Lebanese protests, which ultimately resulted in the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet. After the resignation occurred, the COVID-19 pandemic forced additional businesses to close their doors and to lay off their employees. \c\cPrime minister Hassan Diab stated that the country would default on its Eurobond debt and seek out restructuring agreements amid a spiraling financial crisis that has affected foreign currency reserves. Lebanon was due to pay a US$1.2 billion Eurobond on 9 March 2020, with another 700 million USD expected to mature in April and a further 600 million USD in June. Due to the lack of foreign currencies, the prime minister said that the reserves had fallen to "a worrying and dangerous level which pushes the Lebanese government to suspend payment of the 9 March Eurobond maturity because of a need for these funds."\c\cThe head of research at Bank Audi stated that Lebanese banks owned 12.7 billion USD of the country's outstanding 30 billion USD Eurobonds as of January 2020. The central bank held 5.7 billion USD and the remainder was owned by foreign creditors. \c\cThe debt to GDP ratio sits at 170% as of April 2020. The default is the first one in the history of the country. Foreign currency inflows have slowed and Lebanon's pound has dropped in value compared to the dollar and other currencies. The nation's commercial banks have imposed tough restrictions on dollar withdrawals and transfers to maintain reserves. Due to this Lebanon's sovereign debt became junk rated. \c\cThe Lebanese pound was pegged at around 1,500 per US$1; since October 2019, it has dropped to a third of this value, reaching 4,500 per US$1 on black markets on 28 April 2020. Two weeks before that, the currency sat at around 3,000 to US$1. Official valuations are different from the ones on the black market. One bank allowed depositors to withdraw Lebanese pounds from their dollar account at 2,000 to US$1. This caused significant anger towards the banks. The prime minister has sharply criticized the governor of the central bank Riad Salameh over its performance. \c\cThe shortage of U.S. dollars, which are used in everyday transactions in Lebanon, and the crash in the value of the pound have undercut the country's ability to pay for imports, including essentials such as wheat and oil. Banks have stopped giving short-term loans to businesses and no longer provide them with U.S. dollars for imports, forcing people to turn to the black markets. There is also significant inflation, which caused a massive loss of purchasing power and an increase in poverty. The price of foule or ful, a fava bean common in the region, was up 550% in March 2020 over a year earlier. Sugar has seen an increase of 670%, while wheat, tea, rice, and cigarettes have all gone up nearly 1000% over the same period. \c\cThis liquidity crisis also created a barrier to every single person who had accounts in Lebanese banks; as they are unable to access their deposits. Not only are they unable to access their deposits, but they are unable to withdraw any USD directly. They can withdraw them in the national currency. These depositors needed to preserve the value of their savings, especially following press reports about restructuring of the banking sector. They therefore turned to buying real estate. For example, revenues from land sales of the major real estate developer, Solidere company, soared from nearly $1.3 million to $234.5 million. Also, these depositors turned to buying shares in Solidere company, which lead to a rise of 500% in it between the start of the liquidity crisis and April 2021. \c\cOn 1 June 2021, the World Bank released a report which warned that the economic crisis in Lebanon would risk becoming one of the three most severe since the mid-19th century, if its "bankrupt economic system, which benefited a few for so long" weren\'t reformed. \c\cOn 11 August 2021, the Central Bank of Lebanon ended fuel subsidies, announcing that they would instead offer "credit lines for fuel imports based on the market price for the Lebanese pound". The decision was likely to result in a significant increase in fuel prices amid an economic crisis in the country.
An ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As of 15 July, over a third of Afghanistan's 421 districts were controlled by the Taliban, and by 21 July, half of Afghanistan was under Taliban control. As of 10 August, the Taliban controls 65% of the country. From 6–11 August, the Taliban captured nine provincial capitals, including Kunduz. \c\cOn September 2020, over 5,000 Taliban prisoners, including 400 of whom were accused and convicted of major crimes such as murder were released by the Afghan government as part of the  peace agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban. According to Afghanistan's National Security Council, many of the released prisoners who were "experts" returned to the battlefield and strengthened the Taliban's hand. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway to Afghanistan's capital city Kabul. In terms of equipment, the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces, as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on the ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters.

On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan Province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10.

Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions.

As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had "sold" the city to the Taliban. Social media posts suggested that Taliban were welcomed by some resident of the city which has a long history of lawlessness. The social media posts showed Taliban driving captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs and pickups through the streets while flying Taliban flags as local residents — mostly youths and young men — cheered them on. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \'deadlier phase\' of the war. The governments of Britain and United States warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan "immediately" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation. \c\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital.

In the battles for the two cities, mass desertions were reported, as many Afghan National Army soldiers had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance as well as Taliban propaganda.

The Taliban insurgency began after the group's fall from power during the 2001 War in Afghanistan. The Taliban forces are fighting against the Afghan government, formerly led by President Hamid Karzai, now led by President Ashraf Ghani, and against the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The insurgency has spread to some degree over the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to neighboring Pakistan, in particular Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Taliban conduct warfare against Afghan National Security Forces and their NATO allies, as well as against civilian targets. Regional countries, particularly Pakistan, Iran, China and Russia, are often accused of funding and supporting the insurgent groups. \c\cThe leader of the Taliban is Hibatullah Akhundzada, who heads the Quetta Shura. The allied Haqqani Network, Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, and smaller al-Qaeda groups have also been part of the insurgency. \c\cFollowing the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the Taliban was defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan. In May and June 2003, high Taliban officials proclaimed the Taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel US forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah. Dadullah took charge in Zabul province. \c\cIn late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country". \c\cWhile The Taliban spent several years regrouping, they launched a re-escalation of the insurgency campaign in 2006. \c\cAs of 2017, the Taliban was composed of four different shuras, or representative councils. The first is the Quetta Shura. Two smaller shuras are subordinated to it, the Haqqani network (also known as the Miran Shah Shura) and the Peshawar Shura. The Pehsawar Shura was established in March 2005, and is based in eastern Afghanistan. The majority of its fighters are former members of the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin.  The Haqqani network declared its autonomy from the Quetta Shura in 2007, and rejoined in August 2015.  The Peshawar Shura was autonomous from 2009 until 2016. \c\cThe second autonomous shura is the Shura of the North, based in Badakhshan Province.  The third is the Mashhad Shura, sponsored by Iran, and the fourth is the Rasool Shura, led by Muhammad Rasul and also known as the High Council of the Islamic Emirate. \c\cFollowing the Battle of Tora Bora and Operation Anaconda, The Taliban were defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan, where they began the initial stages of re-grouping. \c\cPamphlets by Taliban and other groups turned up strewn in towns and the countryside in early 2003, urging Islamic faithful to rise up against U.S. forces and other foreign soldiers in holy war. On 27 January 2003, during Operation Mongoose (War in Afghanistan), a band of fighters were assaulted by U.S. forces at the Adi Ghar cave complex 25 km (15 mi) north of Spin Boldak. Eighteen rebels were reported killed with no U.S. casualties. The site was suspected to be a base for supplies and fighters coming from Pakistan. The first isolated attacks by relatively large Taliban bands on Afghan targets also appeared around that time. \c\cIn May 2003, the Taliban Supreme Court's chief justice, Abdul Salam, proclaimed that the Taliban were back, regrouped, rearmed, and ready for guerrilla war to expel U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah, who took charge in Zabul province. \c\cSmall mobile Taliban training camps were established along the border to train recruits in guerrilla warfare, according to senior Taliban warrior Mullah Malang in June 2003. Most were drawn from tribal area madrassas in Pakistan. Bases, a few with as many as 200 fighters, emerged in the tribal areas by the summer of 2003. Pakistani will to prevent infiltration was uncertain, while Pakistani military operations proved of little use. \c\cAs the summer of 2003 continued, Taliban attacks gradually increased in frequency. Dozens of Afghan government soldiers, NGO humanitarian workers, and several U.S. soldiers died in the raids, ambushes and rocket attacks. Besides guerrilla attacks, Taliban fighters began building up forces in the district of Dai Chopan in Zabul Province. The Taliban decided to make a stand there. Over the course of the summer, up to 1,000 guerrillas moved there. Over 220 people, including several dozen Afghan police, were killed in August 2003. \c\cOperation Valiant Strike was a major United States military ground operation in Afghanistan announced on 19 March 2003 that involved 2nd and 3rd battalions of 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Romanian and Afghan troops. The combined forces moved through Kandahar and parts of Southern Afghanistan with the objective of eliminating Taliban enemy forces and weapons caches while also attempting to gather intelligence on Taliban activity in the area. At the conclusion of the operation on 24 March 2003, coalition forces had detained 13 suspected Taliban fighters and confiscated more than 170 rocket-propelled grenades, 180 land mines, 20 automatic rifles and machine guns, as well as many rockets, rifles, and launchers. \c\cUnited States led-coalition forces carried out Operation Asbury Park on June 2, 2004, and June 17, 2004, of taskforce 1/6 BLT of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit engaged in fighting with Taliban and other anti-coalition forces in both Oruzgan Province and Zabul Province culminating in the Dai Chopan region of Afghanistan. This operation was characterized by atypical fighting on the side of the tactics of the Taliban and the other guerillas encountered. culminating in a large battle on June 8. During Asbury Park, the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit was faced with an opponent that frequently would dig in and engage the Marine forces, rather than the traditional hit and run (or "asymmetric attack") methods. As such, Marines, with the aid of B-1B Lancer, A-10 Warthog, and AH-64 Apache aircraft, engaged in "pitched battles each day," culminating in a large battle on June 8. The last of the fighting which took place near Dai Chopan on June 8 was decisive in that enemy forces were depleted to such an extent that no further contact was made with the enemy for the duration of the operation. What was meant by the enemy to be a three pronged attack June 8, 2004 resulted in over eighty-five confirmed kills, with estimates well in excess of 100 enemy dead, an estimated 200–300 wounded, with dozens captured. While throughout the entire operation a "handful" of US forces and Afghan Militia were injured. \c\cIn late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country". \c\cIn late June through mid-July 2005, United States Navy Seals carried out Operation Red Wings as a combined / joint military operation in the Pech District of Afghanistan's Kunar Province, on the slopes of a mountain named Sawtalo Sar, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Kunar's provincial capital of Asadabad, . Operation Red Wings was intended to disrupt local Taliban anti-coalition militia (ACM) activity, thus contributing to regional stability and thereby facilitating the Afghan Parliament elections scheduled for September 2005. At the time, Taliban anti-coalition militia activity in the region was carried out most notably by a small group, led by a local man from Nangarhar Province, Ahmad Shah, who had aspirations of regional Islamic fundamentalist prominence. He and his small group were among the primary targets of the operation. \c\cIn between August 13 and August 18 2005, United States Marine Corps carried out a military operation, called Operation Whalers that took place in Afghanistan's Kunar Province, just weeks after the disastrous Operation Red Wings. Like Operation Red Wings, the objective of Operation Whalers was the disruption of Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) activity in the region in support of further stabilizing the region for unencumbered voter turnout for the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections. Operation Whalers was planned and executed by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment (2/3). The emphasis of the operation was an Anti-Coalition Militia cell led by Ahmad Shah, which was one of 22 identified ACM groups operating in the region at that time, and was the most active. Ahmad Shah's cell was responsible for the Navy SEAL ambush and subsequent MH-47 shootdown that killed, in total, 19 U.S. special operations personnel during Operation Red Wings. Operation Whalers, named after the Hartford / New England Whalers professional hockey team, was the "sequel" to Operation Red Wings in that it was aimed at furthering stabilization of the security situation in the restive Kunar Province of Eastern Afghanistan, a long-term goal of American and coalition forces operating in the area at that time. Operation Whalers, conducted by a number of Marine infantry companies of 2/3 with attached Afghan National Army soldiers and supported by conventional Army aviation, intelligence, and combat arms forces units and U.S. Air Force aviation assets, proved a success. Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia activity dropped substantially and subsequent human intelligence and signals intelligence revealed that Ahmad Shah had been seriously wounded. Shah, who sought to disrupt the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections, was not able to undertake any significant Taliban Anti-Coalition operations subsequent to Operation Whalers in Kunar or neighboring provinces. \c\cIn 2006, Afghanistan began facing a wave of attacks by improvised explosives and suicide bombers, particularly after NATO took command of the fight against insurgents in spring 2006. \c\cAfghan President Hamid Karzai publicly condemned the methods used by the western powers. In June 2006 he said:\c\cInsurgents were also criticized for their conduct. According to Human Rights Watch, bombing and other attacks on Afghan civilians by the Taliban (and to a lesser extent Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin), are reported to have "sharply escalated in 2006" with "at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects." 131 of insurgent attacks were suicide attacks which killed 212 civilians (732 wounded), 46 Afghan army and police members (101 wounded), and 12 foreign soldiers (63 wounded). \c\cThe United Nations estimated that for the first half of 2011, the civilian deaths rose by 15% and reached 1462, which is the worst death toll since the beginning of the war and despite the surge of foreign troops. \c\cJune:\c\c6 June: A roadside bombing leaves 2 American soldiers killed, the attack took place in the province of Nangarhar. Also a separate suicide bombing in Khost leaves three US soldiers wounded. \c\c15 June: A bus carrying workers to an American base explodes killing 10 and wounding 15.

Of that number, "only 2,000 to 3,000 are highly motivated, full-time insurgents", the Times reported. The rest are part-timers, made up of alienated, young Afghan men angry at bombing raids or fighting in order to get money. In 2007, more foreign fighters were showing up in Afghanistan than ever before, according to Afghan and United States officials. An estimated 100 to 300 full-time combatants are foreigners, usually from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Chechnya, various Arab countries and perhaps even Turkey and western China. They tend to be more fanatical and violent, and they often bring skills such as the ability to post more sophisticated videos on the Internet or bombmaking expertise. It has also been reported that the Taliban now control up to 54% of Afghanistan. \c\cOn 15 April, the Afghan Government promised to end all hostage deals with the Taliban after two Afghan kidnapped victims were executed in an agreement to free an Italian journalist. \c\cJanuary:\c\c23 January: A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a US base in eastern Afghanistan, killing 10 people who were waiting outside the base. \c\cFebruary:\c\c2 February: Taliban forces raided a southern Afghan town, destroying the government center and briefly holding some elders captive. \c\c19 February: The Taliban briefly seized a small town in western Afghanistan after police fled the town, the Taliban forces moved in for 30 minutes and seized three vehicles. \c\c20 February: A suicide bomber blew himself up during an opening hospital ceremony injuring 2 NATO soldiers and a hospital worker. \c\c27 February: 23 people were killed when a suicide bomber attacked an American military base, Bagram Airfield (BAF), in Bagram District, Parwan Province.

His death was confirmed by the Taliban. \c\cThe U.S. warned that in 2008 the Taliban has "coalesced into a resilient insurgency", and would "maintain or even increase the scope and pace of its terrorist attacks". Attacks by Taliban insurgents in eastern Afghanistan increased by 40% when compared to the same period in 2007. \c\cFebruary\c\c24 February: Poor military intelligence leads to conflicted reports of a possible Taliban spring offensive. \c\cAugust\c\c19 August: Taliban forces kill 9 French troops (with a 10th death in an accident) near Kabul. \c\cOctober\c\c6 October: CNN reported that, via Saudi intermediaries, the Taliban is negotiating to end the conflict in Afghanistan, and that the Taliban has split from Al Qaeda. \c\cDecember:\c\c7 December: 200 Taliban armed with RPGs and automatic weapons attack two NATO supply depots outside of Peshawar destroying 100 vehicles packed with supplies intended to support the NATO effort in Afghanistan. \c\c8 December: 200 Taliban armed with RPGs and automatic weapons attack a NATO supply depot outside of Peshawar destroying 53 container trucks packed with supplies intended to support the NATO effort in Afghanistan. \c\cDuring 2009 the Taliban regained control over the countryside of several Afghan provinces.

The Taliban reacted to the President's speech by saying they will step up their fight in Afghanistan. A Taliban commander told the BBC that if more US troops came, more would die. \c\cAfter his disputed re-election, President Hamid Karzai announced to move ahead with a plan for a Loya Jirga to discuss the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban would be invited to take part in this Jirga. \c\cDuring 2010, the Taliban were ousted from parts of Helmand Province by the ISAF Operation Moshtarak that started in February 2010. In the meantime the Taliban insurgency spread to the northern provinces of the country. The new policy of the Taliban was to shift militants from the south to the north, to show they exist "everywhere", according to Faryab Province Governor Abdul Haq Shafaq. With most Afghan and NATO troops stationed in the southern and eastern provinces, villagers in the once-peaceful north found themselves confronted with a rapid deterioration of security, as insurgents seized new territory in provinces such as Kunduz and Baghlan, and even infiltrated the mountains of Badakhshan Province in the northeast. \c\cJanuary:\c\c17 January: "Kabul's day of terror":\c\cOn this day, gunbattles near the presidential palace and other government buildings paralyzed the Afghan capital for hours. \c\cAs President Karzai was swearing in his new cabinet ministers inside the presidential palace, militants performed attacks on multiple locations in Kabul, including shopping malls, a cinema and the central bank. A team of gunmen launched a spectacular assault in "commando style" with two men detonating suicide bombs and the rest fighting to the death near the gates of the presidential palace, an operation by insurgents to terrorize the Afghan capital, further demoralizing the population and lending to the impression that virtually no part of the country could be safe.

One day before, 5 Afghans soldiers and 2 NATO soldiers were killed in a bomb attack on their patrol. \c\cAugust:\c\c6 August: 31 American Special Forces soldiers were killed in the crash of their helicopter probably shot down during a fight with the Taliban. Seven Afghan soldiers were also killed. This was the biggest death toll for NATO troops in the whole war. Most of the American soldiers killed were Navy SEALs. \c\c7 August: 4 NATO soldiers were killed, including two French Foreign Legion members, and 5 others were wounded. \c\cThe Taliban insurgency continued into 2012. \c\cAugust:\c\c27 August:\c\cTaliban insurgents in the Taliban-controlled southern Helmand area killed 17 civilians – fifteen men and two women – who were attending a party. A government official said that the victims were beheaded for celebrating with music and mixgender dancing in the Musa Qala district of Helmand, which ran contrary to the Taliban's extreme brand of Islam. Later, however, a provincial government official said that the 17 people killed were due to a fight between two Taliban commanders over two women (who were also killed). The civilians were either beheaded or had their throats cut, but some showed signs of gunshot wounds or beatings. \c\cThe attacks were condemned by Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, who ordered an investigation into the attack, the leader of the NATO coalition led by the United States, the United Nations, and the European Union. However, the Taliban has denied responsibility for the attack, saying that no Taliban members have ever killed civilians. \c\cThe attack occurred on the same day when two United States troops were killed by an Afghan soldier. \c\c10 Afghan soldiers were killed by the Taliban, also in the Helmand province. \c\cOn 3 April, Taliban gunmen and bombers attacked Farah, killing 34 civilians and 10 members of the security forces.

The Taliban has increased suicide attacks and has made multiple territorial gains across the country. \c\cBeginning in April, the Taliban fought for the city of Kunduz in the northern Kunduz Province with them capturing the city by September. Afghan Armed Forces recaptured the city in October but local sources dispute this claim. The quick fall of the city resulted in calls by some government officials for President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Abdullah Abdullah to resign. \c\cIn December, the Taliban made more territorial gains by besieging Afghan forces in the cities of Lashkar Gah, Sangin and outlying towns in the Helmand Province in Southern Afghanistan. By late December, most of Sangin was captured by the Taliban with local Afghan forces surrounded and forced to rely on airlifts for ammunition and food. \c\cThe gains made by the Taliban have hampered peace talks between them and the government and made rifts appear in the Taliban over negotiations. In response to the new offensives, it was reported that the United States would slow down their withdrawal of troops to help in counter-insurgency operations. \c\c14 April: Taliban attacking Kunduz;\c\c31 May: kidnapping a bus with 220 people, killing 10;\c\c1 June storming a court in Ghazni, 5 dead Taliban and 5 dead others;\c\cJune: Taliban have 25,000 fighters in Helmand, Kandahar and Uruzgan, according to US sources;\c\c18 July attacking Qalai Zal, unsuccessfully;\c\cJuly: 20% of Afghanistan is in Taliban hands, said Time magazine;\c\cDecember: Taliban controls 10% of Afghanistan, said the US military. \c\cOn 27 January, a Taliban suicide bomber killed over 100 people in Kabul using a bomb in an ambulance. \c\cThroughout most of the year, the US government maintained high-level talks with the Taliban, in an effort to secure a peace deal with the insurgency. However, a suicide bombing in Kabul on 7 September 2019 which killed 11 people and one American soldier prompted the US President to break-off peace talks with the Taliban. In mid September, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged that the Taliban had suffered more than 1,000 war casualties in the space of only one week since the US broke off peace negotiations with the Taliban. \c\cOn 29 February, the United-States reached an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, in Doha, Qatar. The agreement calls for the withdrawal of all 13,000 U.S. and allied troops over the next 14 months, on the condition that the Taliban continues with the peace process. The first withdrawal, of around 5,000 personnel, will occur within the next 135 days. \c\cThe peace deal stipulates that the Taliban not allow terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda “to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.” If successful, the peace deal will bring an end to 18-years of conflict. Only days after signing the historic deal, US forces conducted airstrikes on Taliban soldiers as a "defensive" measure, as Taliban fighters were "actively attacking" an Afghan government checkpoint. \c\cOn 2 May, the US revealed that the agreement included an informal commitment for both sides to cut violence by 80%. Since the agreement was signed, attacks on cities and coalition forces had decreased, but overall attacks had increased 70% compared with the same period in 2019, according to Reuters. The Taliban claim that attacks have fallen since the agreement was signed. \c\cOn 14 May, a Taliban suicide truck bomber killed five civilians in Gardez, Paktia Province. On 18 May, the Taliban killed nine people in a similar attack in Ghazni Province.[citation needed]\c\cOn 29 May, it was revealed that numerous Taliban and Taliban-aligned Haqqani Network leaders were infected with COVID-19. This resulted in the late founder Mullah Mohammad Omar's son Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob being made the entire organization's acting leader. \c\cIn 2021, the United States forces and allies started to withdraw from Afghanistan which allowed the Taliban to intensify their insurgency. The Taliban controls more than 85% of Afghanistan. \c\cOn 29 June, intense fighting between Taliban insurgents and government forces killed 28 civilians and injured another 290 during the past week, according to the head of a hospital in Kunduz, with the majority of the dead being children, women and elderly people. The Taliban had moved beyond its southern strongholds and had intensified the fighting in the north, according to military experts. \c\cOn 2 July, U.S. troops fully left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces as the coalition, including the U.S., prepared to leave Afghanistan after 20 years. Meanwhile, fighting continued between the Taliban and government forces, with analysts said that the Taliban would be "at the door of Kabul". Afterwards, Bagram Airfield was looted by locals following the sudden American withdrawal from the airbase, which was conducted without any coordination with local officials. Afghan troops later cleared the airbase of looters and secured control of it. \c\cHowever, it was reported that, during June, the Taliban captured 700 Humvees as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems from the Afghan National Army as more districts fall under the group's control during their offensive in the north. \c\cOn 4 July, the Taliban took control of several further districts overnight as Afghan troops abandoned their posts and fled into neighboring Tajikistan via Badakhshan Province. The State Committee for National Security of Tajikistan reported that more than 300 Afghan troops crossed the Tajik border as Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed that most of the territory gaining occurred without a fight. \c\cOn 5 July, Afghan presidential advisor Hamdullah Mohib said that there would be a counter-offensive against the Taliban in the north after the group captured six districts in Badakhshan Province. A day earlier, at least 1,037 Afghan troops abandoned their positions and fled into Tajikistan. \c\cOn 7 July, Taliban insurgents entered Qala e Naw, the provincial capital of Badghis Province, with heavy fighting reported as the militants moved "towards the centre of the city". All government officials in the city had been moved to a nearby army base, while the Taliban had freed about 400 prisoners from the city's prison. \c\cOn 9 July, the Taliban captured the border town of Islam Qala, Herat, Afghanistan's biggest border crossing with Iran. On the same day, Taliban insurgents captured the border town of Torghundi on the border with Turkmenistan as the Afghan National Security Forces collapsed in Herat. The Interior Ministry said that troops had been "temporarily relocated" and that efforts were underway to recapture the border crossing. In addition, a spokesperson for Kandahar Province Governor Rohullah Khanzada mentioned that the Taliban had captured the city of Kandahar. \c\cOn 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak District. \c\cOn 3 August, a suicide car bomber and gunmen attacked Kabul. Thirteen people — including five attackers — were killed. \c\cOn 9 August, #SanctionPakistan became one of the top Twitter trends in Afghanistan and worldwide, with Afghans holding Pakistan responsible for its support of the Taliban. \c\cBy 12 August, about two-thirds of the country was in Taliban hands, with only four cities outside of Taliban control. Sectors of the United States government estimated that Kabul would fall within 30 days, and American diplomats were reportedly requesting that the Taliban not deface the American embassy there. \c\cWhile the pre-2001 Taliban suppressed opium production, the current insurgency "relies on opium revenues to purchase weapons, train its members, and buy support." In 2001, Afghanistan produced only 11% of the world's opium. Today it produces 93% of the global crop, and the drug trade accounts for half of Afghanistan's GDP. \c\cOn 28 July 2009, Richard Holbrooke, the United States special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that money transfers from Western Europe and the Gulf States exceeded the drug trade earnings and that a new task force had been formed to shut down this source of funds. \c\cThe United States Agency for International Development is investigating the possibility that kickbacks from its contracts are being funneled to the Taliban. \c\cA report by the London School of Economics (LSE) claimed to provide the most concrete evidence yet that the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI is providing funding, training and sanctuary to the Taliban on a scale much larger than previously thought. The report's author Matt Waldman spoke to nine Taliban field commanders in Afghanistan and concluded that Pakistan's relationship with the insurgents ran far deeper than previously realized. Some of those interviewed suggested that the organization even attended meetings of the Taliban's supreme council, the Quetta Shura. A spokesman for the Pakistani military dismissed the report, describing it as "malicious".
An ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. In the early stage of the offensive the Taliban made significant advances in the countryside, increasing the number of districts it controls from 73 to 223. Starting on 6 August, the Taliban captured eleven of Afghanistan's thirty-four provincial capitals, including Kunduz and Herat, and by 10 August, the Taliban controlled 65% of the country. \c\cThe offensive is noted for the rapid territorial gains of the Taliban, as well as its domestic and international ramifications. On 10 August, U.S. officials estimated that the Afghan capital, Kabul, could fall to the Taliban within 30 to 90 days. \c\cOn September 2020, over 5,000 Taliban prisoners, including 400 of whom were accused and convicted of major crimes such as murder were released by the Afghan government as part of the Doha Agreement between the United States. and the Taliban. According to Afghanistan's National Security Council, many of the released prisoners who were "experts" returned to the battlefield and strengthened the Taliban's hand. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 ANSF troops and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway to Afghanistan's capital city, Kabul. In terms of equipment, the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces, as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on the ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the U.K., Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan Province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan Province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cIn July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second and third largest cities of Afghanistan, Kandahar and Herat respectively. During the month, 335 Afghan National Security Forces and 189 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,159 Taliban fighters. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves, with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. On 7 July, pro-government forces defeated a Taliban attempt to capture the city of Qala e Naw. On 8 July, the Taliban captured the strategically important Karakh District in Herat Province. \c\cOn 8 July, Afghan soldiers executed an Afghan villager by making him sit on an improvised explosive device (IED) before it exploded. The victim, named Barakatullah, was accused of aiding the Taliban by Afghan police and anti-Taliban militia. The father of Barakatullah denied that his son was working with the Taliban. The incident took place south of the city of Sharana, the capital of Paktika province and the video of the incident was uploaded on TikTok. France 24 Observers team was able to verify and geolocate the video. Fawad Aman, a spokesperson for the Afghan ministry of defence, denied that any such incident took place. An Afghan journalist, Naseeb Zadran, said that this not an isolated incident and reflects the impunity enjoyed by Afghan army. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. On 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force; Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed there while covering the fighting two days later. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Taliban from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban. Lyons implored both sides to protect civilians as she says that women and children are being killed. The same day around 46 Afghan troops, including 5 officers, sought refuge in Pakistan after they were unable to defend their military post. \c\cOn 28 July, a delegation from the Taliban met in Tianjin with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who pledged the People's Republic of China's support for the Taliban on the condition that they cut ties with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, vowing to "bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream" and offering to host peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. \c\cBy 31 July, the Taliban had entered the provincial capitals of both Helmand and Herat provinces, capturing scores of districts in said provinces and capturing border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan. Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions. On 3 August, 40 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in the fighting. After capturing Lashkar Gah's radio station, the Taliban began broadcasting their Voice of Sharia programming. The rebels also began to attack the city's airport. Meanwhile, the government dispatched reinforcements to prevent the city from falling to the insurgents. \c\cOn 3 August, 13 people - including five attackers - were killed in a Taliban bombing and shootout in Kabul. The inghimasi-style operation, carried out by the Taliban's "Martyrdom Battalion", aimed at killing Defence Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi; he survived the attack. Mohammadi was described by the Long War Journal as one of the key government figures responsible for countering the Taliban offensive. \c\cAs of 5 August, 115 Afghan National Security Forces and 58 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,197 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. \c\cOn 6 August, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul. On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion. The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape. As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had "sold" the city to the Taliban. Social media posts suggested that the Taliban were welcomed by some residents of the city which has a long history of lawlessness. Images appearing on social media showed Taliban fighters driving captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs and pickups through the streets while flying Taliban flags as local residents — mostly youths and young men — cheered them on. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \'deadlier phase\' of the war. The governments of Britain and United States warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan "immediately" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation. \c\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ex-warlord and the strongman who had traditionally dominated the city, took his followers and fled to Khwaja Du Koh District, the only area in Jowzjan Province which was still government-held. Meanwhile, pro-government forces had been reduced to a pocket of resistance in Lashkar Gah, while Kandahar and Herat remained fiercely contested. Insurgents also launched repeated raids on the other provincial capitals. On the same day, U.S. B-52 bombers carried out airstrikes against Taliban in Afghanistan, operating from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The United States was also using armed Reaper drones and AC-130 Spectre gunships which reportedly began daily attacks against targets around Kandahar, Herat, and Lashkar Gah. The remaining ground defense of Lashkar Gah and Kandahar was mostly organized by hundreds of Afghan Commandos who had become encircled by the insurgents; as these soldiers were the Afghan military's best-trained and most highly motivated troops, the Long War Journal argued that their loss would be a major setback in regards to the Afghan security forces\' future effectiveness. USS Ronald Reagan was launching fast jets to provide support to the missions. The American Embassy in Kabul urged all Americans to leave the country immediately due to increased security concerns, and the inability of the embassy to guarantee the safety of American citizens due to the reduction of staff at the embassy. \c\cThe following day, the Taliban captured the cities of Kunduz and Sar-e Pol after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces. In the battles for the two cities, mass desertions were reported, as many Afghan National Army soldiers had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance as well as Taliban propaganda. Pro-government forces were only able to hold onto Kunduz's military base and airport. Reporters described the capture of Kunduz as "the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May" with the city being one of Afghanistan's largest settlements, well connected to other notable locations in the country including Kabul and considered part of a major Central Asian drug smuggling route. The battle for Kunduz involved the Red Unit, the Taliban elite shock troops, and resulted in the release of hundreds of prisoners including Taliban commanders. The city of Taloqan was also taken by the Taliban late 8 August, making it the fifth provincial capital to fall. Government forces retreated from the city after noon, retaking Warsaj District and Farkhar District. \c\cOn 9 August, the Taliban captured Aybak, the capital of Samangan province. Deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told the AFP news agency that government forces had withdrawn from the city without a fight after community representatives had requested that it be spared more violence. On the same day, Asif Azimi, a former senator from Samangan and a prominent warlord from the Jamiat-e Islami party, defected to the Taliban. Azimi said hundreds of men under his command had also defected to the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani and other political leaders also agreed to form a joint command center to coordinate and assist with public uprising forces. \c\cFighting intensified around Mazar-i-Sharif on 10 August. In Farah, capital of Farah Province, the Taliban had taken control of the governor's compound after heavy fighting between the Taliban and government forces. They had also taken control of the police headquarters and prison. Although heavy fighting continued, Farah became the seventh provincial capital to fall. An eighth provincial capital, Puli Khumri of Baghlan Province, was also captured on 10 August. \c\cOn 11 August, Fayzabad of Badakhshan Province became the ninth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban. After the Taliban reached the city gates, government forces decided to retreat to Farkhar District and join with security forces there from Taloqan's fall. Prior to the U.S. invasion, Fayzabad had been the headquarters of the Northern Alliance. On the same day, the Taliban captured Kunduz Airport and a major military base belonging to 217 Pamir Corps after hundreds of Afghan troops surrendered, securing Taliban control over their military equipment in Kunduz. The military base was responsible for security of Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan and was one of the eight such installations in Afghanistan. Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) quoted two local councillors who said that the entire 217th Pamir Corps surrendered to Taliban forces in Kunduz. A Taliban spokesman also posted a video on Twitter which purportedly showed government soldiers joining the militants\' ranks. Additionally, the day saw General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai's replacement by General Haibatullah Alizai as the new Afghan Army chief of staff. The outgoing General Ahmadzai served as an Afghan army chief of staff since he assumed the post in June 2021. \c\cOn 12 August, the Taliban captured the city of Ghazni, making it the tenth provincial capital to fall within a week. The city lies along the Kabul–Kandahar Highway, serving as a gateway between Kabul and the strongholds in the south. The Governor of Ghazni Province was soon arrested in Wardak for "surrendering without a fight" in exchange of safe passage. On the same day, the central government offered a proposal of "power-sharing" in lieu of ceasefire; Taliban has not responded as of yet. Late that night, Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city and the capital of an eponymous province, fell to Taliban. By this point they controlled 11 of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals. The Taliban had also launched an assault on Qala e Naw, capturing the city after failing to do so in July, bringing their control of provincial capitals to 12 provincial capitals.  \c\cA few hours after the fall of Herat, the U.S. and the U.K. governments announced the deployment of 3,000 and 600 of their troops respectively to the Kabul airport, in order to secure the airlifting of their nationals, embassy staff and the Afghan civilians who worked with the coalition forces out of the country. Officials said that the first deployment would occur in the next 24 to 48 hours, and that it would be completed by the end of the month. According to said sources the plan is to use charter aircraft for the evacuation using the Kabul airport which is still open with commercial airliners flying, however that military aircraft will be used if that becomes impossible. According to the British government, the evacuation and its timing had long been planned, while an Afghan official said that the timing was brought forward as the security situation rapidly deteriorated. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cOn 23 June, the U.S. intelligence agencies estimated that the Afghan government could fall within the next six months following the U.S. withdrawal. On 10 August, U.S. officials revised the previous six month estimate, saying that it could happen much more quickly, and that some scenarios envisioned the fall of Kabul within 30 to 90 days. \c\cSince 2 July, U.S. withdrawal from the Bagram Airfield, U.S. airstrikes against the Taliban have been led from outside of Afghanistan, from the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and the U.S. Navy carrier strike group in the Persian Gulf. Requiring the warplanes to travel several hours to reach their targets. According to a U.S. defence official, the airstrikes since 2 July amounted to only "a handful" each day. \c\cOn 8 August, the head of extremist monitoring group SITE, Rita Katz, said that the Taliban advance resembled the earlier days of the Syrian civil war amid Nusra Front's victories, "except now on a completely different scale, given the Taliban's horrifying momentum". \c\cAccording to a U.S. defense official, the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of U.S. military forces could create an opening for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups to reorganize. The official added that, while the U.S. would still maintain authority to strike Al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan, the lack of a robust U.S. presence on the ground would hamper the ability to identify potential targets. The CENTCOM commander General McKenzie said that he has not seen anything that would make him believe the Taliban would stop Al Qaeda from using Afghanistan to strengthen and rebuild. \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahid Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. On 2 August 2021, President Ghani blamed the advance of the Taliban on the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops and said the former had not cut ties with terrorist organizations and had escalated attacks against women, which the Taliban denied. State-run newspaper, The Kabul Times, reported that on August 9, #SanctionPakistan became one of the top Twitter trends in Afghanistan and worldwide, with Afghans holding Pakistan responsible for its support of the Taliban. \c\cTaliban: On 9 July, Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar said in Moscow that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and pointed  out that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\c China: Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi criticized the speed and timing of withdrawal of the American-led NATO forces and urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\c Germany: Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Germany would cut off financial aid in case the Taliban imposes Sharia law if they take power in the country. \c\c India: Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that India would consult all important parts in the conflict, including China, and that India was pushing for "conciliation in Afghanistan."\c\c Indonesia: Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged all Indonesian nationals to leave Afghanistan. Commission I of Indonesian parliament also urged the government to be active on mediating both sides of the conflict as a muslim-majority nation. \c\c Iran: Influential Shia cleric, lawmaker, and politician Mojtaba Zonnour said that the Taliban is "an undeniable part of the reality in Afghanistan", and that it should not be equated to Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIL or al-Qaeda. \c\c Kazakhstan: Kazakh representatives participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Kyrgyzstan: Representatives from the country participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Pakistan: Keeping in view the advancements of Taliban, DG ISPR issued a statement that "Pakistan should be seen as facilitator, not guarantor in Afghan peace process."\c\c Russia: Russian authorities said they were working with the Tajik government to protect it from any foreign threat under the Collective Security Treaty Organization.Russian special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said that the Afghan government only paid lip service to the idea of talks and they were not doing enough to make them happen.

An ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. In the early stage of the offensive the Taliban made significant advances in the countryside, increasing the number of districts it controls from 73 to 223. Starting on 6 August, the Taliban captured eleven of Afghanistan's thirty-four provincial capitals, including Kunduz and Herat, and by 10 August, the Taliban controlled 65% of the country. \c\cThe offensive is noted for the rapid territorial gains of the Taliban, as well as its domestic and international ramifications. On 10 August, U.S. officials estimated that the Afghan capital, Kabul, could fall to the Taliban within 30 to 90 days. \c\cOn September 2020, over 5,000 Taliban prisoners, including 400 of whom were accused and convicted of major crimes such as murder were released by the Afghan government as part of the Doha Agreement between the United States. and the Taliban. According to Afghanistan's National Security Council, many of the released prisoners who were "experts" returned to the battlefield and strengthened the Taliban's hand. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 ANSF troops and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway to Afghanistan's capital city, Kabul. In terms of equipment, the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces, as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on the ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the U.K., Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan Province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan Province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cIn July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second and third largest cities of Afghanistan, Kandahar and Herat respectively. During the month, 335 Afghan National Security Forces and 189 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,159 Taliban fighters. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves, with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. On 7 July, pro-government forces defeated a Taliban attempt to capture the city of Qala e Naw. On 8 July, the Taliban captured the strategically important Karakh District in Herat Province. \c\cOn 8 July, Afghan soldiers executed an Afghan villager by making him sit on an improvised explosive device (IED) before it exploded. The victim, named Barakatullah, was accused of aiding the Taliban by Afghan police and anti-Taliban militia. The father of Barakatullah denied that his son was working with the Taliban. The incident took place south of the city of Sharana, the capital of Paktika province and the video of the incident was uploaded on TikTok. France 24 Observers team was able to verify and geolocate the video. Fawad Aman, a spokesperson for the Afghan ministry of defence, denied that any such incident took place. An Afghan journalist, Naseeb Zadran, said that this not an isolated incident and reflects the impunity enjoyed by Afghan army. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. On 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force; Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed there while covering the fighting two days later. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Taliban from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban. Lyons implored both sides to protect civilians as she says that women and children are being killed. The same day around 46 Afghan troops, including 5 officers, sought refuge in Pakistan after they were unable to defend their military post. \c\cOn 28 July, a delegation from the Taliban met in Tianjin with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who pledged the People's Republic of China's support for the Taliban on the condition that they cut ties with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, vowing to "bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream" and offering to host peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. \c\cBy 31 July, the Taliban had entered the provincial capitals of both Helmand and Herat provinces, capturing scores of districts in said provinces and capturing border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan. Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions. On 3 August, 40 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in the fighting. After capturing Lashkar Gah's radio station, the Taliban began broadcasting their Voice of Sharia programming. The rebels also began to attack the city's airport. Meanwhile, the government dispatched reinforcements to prevent the city from falling to the insurgents. \c\cOn 3 August, 13 people - including five attackers - were killed in a Taliban bombing and shootout in Kabul. The inghimasi-style operation, carried out by the Taliban's "Martyrdom Battalion", aimed at killing Defence Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi; he survived the attack. Mohammadi was described by the Long War Journal as one of the key government figures responsible for countering the Taliban offensive. \c\cAs of 5 August, 115 Afghan National Security Forces and 58 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,197 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. \c\cOn 6 August, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul. On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion. The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape. As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had "sold" the city to the Taliban. Social media posts suggested that the Taliban were welcomed by some residents of the city which has a long history of lawlessness. Images appearing on social media showed Taliban fighters driving captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs and pickups through the streets while flying Taliban flags as local residents — mostly youths and young men — cheered them on. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \'deadlier phase\' of the war. The governments of Britain and United States warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan "immediately" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation. \c\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ex-warlord and the strongman who had traditionally dominated the city, took his followers and fled to Khwaja Du Koh District, the only area in Jowzjan Province which was still government-held. Meanwhile, pro-government forces had been reduced to a pocket of resistance in Lashkar Gah, while Kandahar and Herat remained fiercely contested. Insurgents also launched repeated raids on the other provincial capitals. On the same day, U.S. B-52 bombers carried out airstrikes against Taliban in Afghanistan, operating from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The United States was also using armed Reaper drones and AC-130 Spectre gunships which reportedly began daily attacks against targets around Kandahar, Herat, and Lashkar Gah. The remaining ground defense of Lashkar Gah and Kandahar was mostly organized by hundreds of Afghan Commandos who had become encircled by the insurgents; as these soldiers were the Afghan military's best-trained and most highly motivated troops, the Long War Journal argued that their loss would be a major setback in regards to the Afghan security forces\' future effectiveness. USS Ronald Reagan was launching fast jets to provide support to the missions. The American Embassy in Kabul urged all Americans to leave the country immediately due to increased security concerns, and the inability of the embassy to guarantee the safety of American citizens due to the reduction of staff at the embassy. \c\cThe following day, the Taliban captured the cities of Kunduz and Sar-e Pol after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces. In the battles for the two cities, mass desertions were reported, as many Afghan National Army soldiers had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance as well as Taliban propaganda. Pro-government forces were only able to hold onto Kunduz's military base and airport. Reporters described the capture of Kunduz as "the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May" with the city being one of Afghanistan's largest settlements, well connected to other notable locations in the country including Kabul and considered part of a major Central Asian drug smuggling route. The battle for Kunduz involved the Red Unit, the Taliban elite shock troops, and resulted in the release of hundreds of prisoners including Taliban commanders. The city of Taloqan was also taken by the Taliban late 8 August, making it the fifth provincial capital to fall. Government forces retreated from the city after noon, retaking Warsaj District and Farkhar District. \c\cOn 9 August, the Taliban captured Aybak, the capital of Samangan province. Deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told the AFP news agency that government forces had withdrawn from the city without a fight after community representatives had requested that it be spared more violence. On the same day, Asif Azimi, a former senator from Samangan and a prominent warlord from the Jamiat-e Islami party, defected to the Taliban. Azimi said hundreds of men under his command had also defected to the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani and other political leaders also agreed to form a joint command center to coordinate and assist with public uprising forces. \c\cFighting intensified around Mazar-i-Sharif on 10 August. In Farah, capital of Farah Province, the Taliban had taken control of the governor's compound after heavy fighting between the Taliban and government forces. They had also taken control of the police headquarters and prison. Although heavy fighting continued, Farah became the seventh provincial capital to fall. An eighth provincial capital, Puli Khumri of Baghlan Province, was also captured on 10 August. \c\cOn 11 August, Fayzabad of Badakhshan Province became the ninth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban. After the Taliban reached the city gates, government forces decided to retreat to Farkhar District and join with security forces there from Taloqan's fall. Prior to the U.S. invasion, Fayzabad had been the headquarters of the Northern Alliance. On the same day, the Taliban captured Kunduz Airport and a major military base belonging to 217 Pamir Corps after hundreds of Afghan troops surrendered, securing Taliban control over their military equipment in Kunduz. The military base was responsible for security of Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan and was one of the eight such installations in Afghanistan. Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) quoted two local councillors who said that the entire 217th Pamir Corps surrendered to Taliban forces in Kunduz. A Taliban spokesman also posted a video on Twitter which purportedly showed government soldiers joining the militants\' ranks. Additionally, the day saw General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai's replacement by General Haibatullah Alizai as the new Afghan Army chief of staff. The outgoing General Ahmadzai served as an Afghan army chief of staff since he assumed the post in June 2021. \c\cOn 12 August, the Taliban captured the city of Ghazni, making it the tenth provincial capital to fall within a week. The city lies along the Kabul–Kandahar Highway, serving as a gateway between Kabul and the strongholds in the south. The Governor of Ghazni Province was soon arrested in Wardak for "surrendering without a fight" in exchange of safe passage. On the same day, the central government offered a proposal of "power-sharing" in lieu of ceasefire; Taliban has not responded as of yet. Late that night, Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city and the capital of an eponymous province, fell to Taliban. By this point they controlled 11 of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals. The Taliban had also launched an assault on Qala e Naw, capturing the city after failing to do so in July.   After heavy clashing in Kandahar, possibly ordered by US high command, the ANA had withdrew from the city of Kandahar, the second largest city in Afghanistan, allowing the Taliban to capture the city and making the provincial capitals captured by the Taliban to 13 provincial capitals. \c\cA few hours after the fall of Herat, the U.S. and the U.K. governments announced the deployment of 3,000 and 600 of their troops respectively to the Kabul airport, in order to secure the airlifting of their nationals, embassy staff and the Afghan civilians who worked with the coalition forces out of the country. Officials said that the first deployment would occur in the next 24 to 48 hours, and that it would be completed by the end of the month. According to said sources the plan is to use charter aircraft for the evacuation using the Kabul airport which is still open with commercial airliners flying, however that military aircraft will be used if that becomes impossible. According to the British government, the evacuation and its timing had long been planned, while an Afghan official said that the timing was brought forward as the security situation rapidly deteriorated. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cOn 23 June, the U.S. intelligence agencies estimated that the Afghan government could fall within the next six months following the U.S. withdrawal. On 10 August, U.S. officials revised the previous six month estimate, saying that it could happen much more quickly, and that some scenarios envisioned the fall of Kabul within 30 to 90 days. \c\cSince 2 July, U.S. withdrawal from the Bagram Airfield, U.S. airstrikes against the Taliban have been led from outside of Afghanistan, from the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and the U.S. Navy carrier strike group in the Persian Gulf. Requiring the warplanes to travel several hours to reach their targets. According to a U.S. defence official, the airstrikes since 2 July amounted to only "a handful" each day. \c\cOn 8 August, the head of extremist monitoring group SITE, Rita Katz, said that the Taliban advance resembled the earlier days of the Syrian civil war amid Nusra Front's victories, "except now on a completely different scale, given the Taliban's horrifying momentum". \c\cAccording to a U.S. defense official, the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of U.S. military forces could create an opening for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups to reorganize. The official added that, while the U.S. would still maintain authority to strike Al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan, the lack of a robust U.S. presence on the ground would hamper the ability to identify potential targets. The CENTCOM commander General McKenzie said that he has not seen anything that would make him believe the Taliban would stop Al Qaeda from using Afghanistan to strengthen and rebuild. \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahid Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. On 2 August 2021, President Ghani blamed the advance of the Taliban on the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops and said the former had not cut ties with terrorist organizations and had escalated attacks against women, which the Taliban denied. State-run newspaper, The Kabul Times, reported that on August 9, #SanctionPakistan became one of the top Twitter trends in Afghanistan and worldwide, with Afghans holding Pakistan responsible for its support of the Taliban. \c\cTaliban: On 9 July, Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar said in Moscow that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and pointed  out that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\c China: Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi criticized the speed and timing of withdrawal of the American-led NATO forces and urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\c Germany: Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Germany would cut off financial aid in case the Taliban imposes Sharia law if they take power in the country. \c\c India: Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that India would consult all important parts in the conflict, including China, and that India was pushing for "conciliation in Afghanistan."\c\c Indonesia: Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged all Indonesian nationals to leave Afghanistan.

Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves, with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. On 7 July, pro-government forces defeated a Taliban attempt to capture the city of Qala e Naw. On 8 July, the Taliban captured the strategically important Karakh District in Herat Province. \c\cOn 8 July, Afghan soldiers executed an Afghan villager by making him sit on an improvised explosive device (IED) before it exploded. The victim, named Barakatullah, was accused of aiding the Taliban by Afghan police and anti-Taliban militia. The father of Barakatullah denied that his son was working with the Taliban. The incident took place south of the city of Sharana, the capital of Paktika province and the video of the incident was uploaded on TikTok. France 24 Observers team was able to verify and geolocate the video. Fawad Aman, a spokesperson for the Afghan ministry of defence, denied that any such incident took place. An Afghan journalist, Naseeb Zadran, said that this not an isolated incident and reflects the impunity enjoyed by Afghan army. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. On 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force; Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed there while covering the fighting two days later. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Taliban from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban. Lyons implored both sides to protect civilians as she says that women and children are being killed. The same day around 46 Afghan troops, including 5 officers, sought refuge in Pakistan after they were unable to defend their military post. \c\cOn 28 July, a delegation from the Taliban met in Tianjin with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who pledged the People's Republic of China's support for the Taliban on the condition that they cut ties with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, vowing to "bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream" and offering to host peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. \c\cBy 31 July, the Taliban had entered the provincial capitals of both Helmand and Herat provinces, capturing scores of districts in said provinces and capturing border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan. Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions. On 3 August 40 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in the fighting. After capturing Lashkar Gah's radio station, the Taliban began broadcasting their Voice of Sharia programming. The rebels also began to attack the city's airport. Meanwhile, the government dispatched reinforcements to prevent the city from falling to the insurgents. \c\cOn 3 August 13 people - including five attackers - were killed in a Taliban bombing and shootout in Kabul. The inghimasi-style operation, carried out by the Taliban's "Martyrdom Battalion", aimed at killing Defence Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi; he survived the attack. Mohammadi was described by the Long War Journal as one of the key government figures responsible for countering the Taliban offensive. \c\cAs of 5 August 115 Afghan National Security Forces and 58 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,197 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. \c\cOn 6 August, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul. On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion. The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape. As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had "sold" the city to the Taliban. Social media posts suggested that the Taliban were welcomed by some residents of the city which has a long history of lawlessness. Images appearing on social media showed Taliban fighters driving captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs and pickups through the streets while flying Taliban flags as local residents — mostly youths and young men — cheered them on. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \'deadlier phase\' of the war. The governments of Britain and United States warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan "immediately" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation. \c\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ex-warlord and the strongman who had traditionally dominated the city, took his followers and fled to Khwaja Du Koh District, the only area in Jowzjan Province which was still government-held. Meanwhile, pro-government forces had been reduced to a pocket of resistance in Lashkar Gah, while Kandahar and Herat remained fiercely contested. Insurgents also launched repeated raids on the other provincial capitals. On the same day, U.S. B-52 bombers carried out airstrikes against Taliban in Afghanistan, operating from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The United States was also using armed Reaper drones and AC-130 Spectre gunships which reportedly began daily attacks against targets around Kandahar, Herat, and Lashkar Gah. The remaining ground defense of Lashkar Gah and Kandahar was mostly organized by hundreds of Afghan Commandos who had become encircled by the insurgents; as these soldiers were the Afghan military's best-trained and most highly motivated troops, the Long War Journal argued that their loss would be a major setback in regards to the Afghan security forces\' future effectiveness. USS Ronald Reagan was launching fast jets to provide support to the missions. The American Embassy in Kabul urged all Americans to leave the country immediately due to increased security concerns, and the inability of the embassy to guarantee the safety of American citizens due to the reduction of staff at the embassy. \c\cThe following day, the Taliban captured the cities of Kunduz and Sar-e Pol after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces. In the battles for the two cities, mass desertions were reported, as many Afghan National Army soldiers had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance as well as Taliban propaganda. Pro-government forces were only able to hold onto Kunduz's military base and airport. Reporters described the capture of Kunduz as "the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May" with the city being one of Afghanistan's largest settlements, well connected to other notable locations in the country including Kabul and considered part of a major Central Asian drug smuggling route. The battle for Kunduz involved the Red Unit, the Taliban elite shock troops, and resulted in the release of hundreds of prisoners including Taliban commanders. The city of Taloqan was also taken by the Taliban late 8 August, making it the fifth provincial capital to fall. Government forces retreated from the city after noon, retaking Warsaj District and Farkhar District. \c\cOn 9 August, the Taliban captured Aybak, the capital of Samangan province. Deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told the AFP news agency that government forces had withdrawn from the city without a fight after community representatives had requested that it be spared more violence. On the same day, Asif Azimi, a former senator from Samangan and a prominent warlord from the Jamiat-e Islami party, defected to the Taliban. Azimi said hundreds of men under his command had also defected to the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani and other political leaders also agreed to form a joint command center to coordinate and assist with public uprising forces. \c\cFighting intensified around Mazar-i-Sharif on 10 August. In Farah, capital of Farah Province, the Taliban had taken control of the governor's compound after heavy fighting between the Taliban and government forces. They had also taken control of the police headquarters and prison. Although heavy fighting continued, Farah became the seventh provincial capital to fall. An eighth provincial capital, Puli Khumri of Baghlan Province, was also captured on 10 August. \c\cOn 11 August, Fayzabad of Badakhshan Province became the ninth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban. After the Taliban reached the city gates, government forces decided to retreat to Farkhar District and join with security forces there from Taloqan's fall. Prior to the U.S. invasion, Fayzabad had been the headquarters of the Northern Alliance. On the same day, the Taliban captured Kunduz Airport and a major military base belonging to 217 Pamir Corps after hundreds of Afghan troops surrendered, securing Taliban control over their military equipment in Kunduz. The military base was responsible for security of Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan and was one of the eight such installations in Afghanistan. Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) quoted two local councillors who said that the entire 217th Pamir Corps surrendered to Taliban forces in Kunduz. A Taliban spokesman also posted a video on Twitter which purportedly showed government soldiers joining the militants\' ranks. Additionally, the day saw General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai's replacement by General Haibatullah Alizai as the new Afghan Army chief of staff. The outgoing General Ahmadzai served as an Afghan army chief of staff since he assumed the post in June 2021. \c\cOn 12 August, the Taliban captured the city of Ghazni, making it the tenth provincial capital to fall within a week. The city lies along the Kabul–Kandahar Highway, serving as a gateway between Kabul and the strongholds in the south. The Governor of Ghazni Province was soon arrested in Wardak for "surrendering without a fight" in exchange for safe passage. On the same day, the central government offered a proposal of "power-sharing" in lieu of ceasefire; Taliban has not responded as of yet. Late that night, Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city and the capital of the eponymous province, fell to the Taliban. By this point, they controlled 11 of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals. The Taliban had also launched an assault on Qala e Naw, capturing the city after failing to do so in July. \c\cOvernight, Kandahar was captured by the Taliban: heavy clashing around the city led to the withdrawal of the ANA, thus increasing the number of provincial capitals controlled by the Taliban to thirteen. \c\cA few hours after the fall of Herat, the U.S. and the U.K. governments announced the deployment of 3,000 and 600 of their troops respectively to the Kabul airport, in order to secure the airlifting of their nationals, embassy staff and the Afghan civilians who worked with the coalition forces out of the country. Officials said that the first deployment would occur in the next 24 to 48 hours, and that it would be completed by the end of the month. According to said sources the plan is to use charter aircraft for the evacuation using the Kabul airport which is still open with commercial airliners flying, however that military aircraft will be used if that becomes impossible. According to the British government, the evacuation and its timing had long been planned, while an Afghan official said that the timing was brought forward as the security situation rapidly deteriorated. In addition to the 3,000 U.S troops, an additional 3,500 will be on standby in Kuwait in case the situation escalates to an armed conflict with the Taliban. \c\cCanada announced that Canadian special forces units will be deployed to evacuate embassy personnel in Kabul, which houses Afghan families who have worked with Canadian staff in the past. \c\cAfter several weeks of fighting in the Battle of Lashkargah, the city of Lashkar Gah, capital of Helmand Province, was captured by the Taliban on 13 August. On the same day, the Taliban took control of Feruz Koh, the capital city of Afghanistan’s western province of Ghor. Officials said the city fell without any fighting, becoming the 15th provincial capital to fall to the Taliban within a week. Feruz Koh has a population of nearly 132,000 people. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cOn 23 June, the U.S. intelligence agencies estimated that the Afghan government could fall within the next six months following the U.S. withdrawal. On 10 August, U.S. officials revised the previous six month estimate, saying that it could happen much more quickly, and that some scenarios envisioned the fall of Kabul within 30 to 90 days. \c\cSince 2 July, U.S. withdrawal from the Bagram Airfield, U.S. airstrikes against the Taliban have been led from outside of Afghanistan, from the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and the U.S. Navy carrier strike group in the Persian Gulf. Requiring the warplanes to travel several hours to reach their targets. According to a U.S. defence official, the airstrikes since 2 July amounted to only "a handful" each day. \c\cOn 8 August, the head of extremist monitoring group SITE, Rita Katz, said that the Taliban advance resembled the earlier days of the Syrian civil war amid Nusra Front's victories, "except now on a completely different scale, given the Taliban's horrifying momentum". \c\cAccording to a U.S. defense official, the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of U.S. military forces could create an opening for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups to reorganize. The official added that, while the U.S. would still maintain authority to strike Al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan, the lack of a robust U.S. presence on the ground would hamper the ability to identify potential targets. The CENTCOM commander General McKenzie said that he has not seen anything that would make him believe the Taliban would stop Al Qaeda from using Afghanistan to strengthen and rebuild. \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahid Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. On 2 August 2021, President Ghani blamed the advance of the Taliban on the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops and said the former had not cut ties with terrorist organizations and had escalated attacks against women, which the Taliban denied. State-run newspaper, The Kabul Times, reported that on 9 August, #SanctionPakistan became one of the top Twitter trends in Afghanistan and worldwide, with Afghans holding Pakistan responsible for its support of the Taliban. \c\cTaliban: On 9 July, Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar said in Moscow that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and pointed  out that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\c China: Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi criticized the speed and timing of withdrawal of the American-led NATO forces and urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\c Germany: Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Germany would cut off financial aid in case the Taliban imposes Sharia law if they take power in the country. \c\c India: Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that India would consult all important parts in the conflict, including China, and that India was pushing for "conciliation in Afghanistan."\c\c Indonesia: Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged all Indonesian nationals to leave Afghanistan. Commission I of Indonesian parliament also urged the government to be active on mediating both sides of the conflict as a muslim-majority nation. \c\c Iran: Influential Shia cleric, lawmaker, and politician Mojtaba Zonnour said that the Taliban is "an undeniable part of the reality in Afghanistan", and that it should not be equated to Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIL or al-Qaeda. \c\c Kazakhstan: Kazakh representatives participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Kyrgyzstan: Representatives from the country participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Pakistan: Keeping in view the advancements of Taliban, DG ISPR issued a statement that "Pakistan should be seen as facilitator, not guarantor in Afghan peace process."\c\c Russia: Russian authorities said they were working with the Tajik government to protect it from any foreign threat under the Collective Security Treaty Organization.Russian special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said that the Afghan government only paid lip service to the idea of talks and they were not doing enough to make them happen. He also said that Russia and other regional powers favoured a transitional government in Afghanistan. Taliban representatives visited Moscow in July. Russia's Foreign Ministry called the Taliban "of sound mind". \c\c Tajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon ordered 20,000 reserve servicemen of the country's Ground Forces to be sent to the Afghan–Tajik border. \c\c Turkey: The country offered to order its troops to protect Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \c\c Turkmenistan: Turkmen military forces were assigned to the Afghan–Turkmen border due to security concerns. \c\c United Kingdom: UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, said that the UK will be ready to work with the Taliban should they come into power provided that they adhere to certain international norms. However, Wallace warned that the UK will review any relationship if Taliban were found violating human rights in Afghanistan. \c\c United States: President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying that the country had not gone to Afghanistan to "nation build." Biden added that he would not "send another generation of Americans to fight there" and pointed to other failed attempts at unifying Afghanistan in the past. He also assured that the safety of the U.S. was not at risk, regardless of the outcome of the infighting in Afghanistan. On 10 August, Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, told reporters that US was confident that airstrikes were having an effect on the Taliban, but that the American air power alone would not be enough to halt the insurgent offensive. 
The Sinai insurgency is an ongoing insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, that was commenced by Islamist militants against Egyptian security forces, which have also included attacks on civilians. The insurgency began during the Egyptian Crisis, during which the longtime Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in the Egyptian revolution of 2011. \c\cThe Sinai insurgency initially consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) and proclaimed themselves Sinai Province, and a part of ISIL. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with the Sinai Province group and have blamed the porous border and ongoing civil war for the increase in sophisticated weapons available to the Islamist groups. \c\cEgyptian authorities have attempted to restore their presence in the Sinai through both political and military measures. Egypt launched two military operations, known as Operation Eagle in mid-2011 and then Operation Sinai in mid-2012. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup d\'état, which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred. \c\cThe fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share the same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services. Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. In November 2017, more than 300 Sufist worshippers were killed and over 100 injured in a terrorist attack on a mosque west of the city of Al-Arish. \c\cSufism was previously dominant in the region before militant jihadi ideas began to take hold. The Sinai Peninsula has long been known for its lawlessness, having historically served as a smuggling route for weapons and supplies. Security provisions in the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979 have mandated a diminished security presence in the area, enabling militants to operate with a freer hand. Moreover, the limited government-directed investment and development in Sinai has discriminated against the local Bedouin population, a population that values tribal allegiance over all else. The combination of Sinai's harsh terrain and lack of resources have kept the area poor and hence ripe for militancy. \c\cFollowing the January 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak's regime, the country became increasingly destabilized, creating a security vacuum in the Sinai Peninsula. Radical Islamic elements in Sinai exploited the opportunity, using the unique environment, in launching several waves of attacks upon Egyptian military and commercial facilities. \c\cAccording to The Economist, the conflict also involves local armed Bedouins "who have long-standing grievances against the central government in Cairo" and that "they are barred from joining the army or police; they find it hard to get jobs in tourism; and they complain that many of their lands have been taken from them". \c\cSince the 2011 uprising against the Mubarak regime in Egypt, there has been increasing instability in the Sinai Peninsula. In addition, the collapse of the Libyan regime increased the quantity and sophistication of weapons being smuggled into the area. The situation provided local Bedouin with an opportunity to assert their authority, leading to clashes with Egyptian security forces, but the cause of violence soon transitioned to salafi jihadism. Hard-line militant Muslims used Sinai as a launch-point for attacks against Israel and turned on the Egyptian state, focusing on Egypt's security establishment and the Sinai's Arab Gas Pipeline. \c\cIn August 2011, Egypt launched Operation Eagle in an effort to restore law and order, driving Islamist insurgents and criminal gangs out of North Sinai's urban centers, and to attempt to sever the link between militant groups in the Sinai and Gaza by augmenting its control over the Gaza border crossing. \c\cThe operation had limited success, and a week into the operation, Salafi jihadists carried out the biggest cross-border attack on Israel in the post-Mubarak period. \c\cOn 5 August 2012, an attack on the Rafah barracks shook the Egyptian military and population. Only a month into his term, President Mohamed Morsi sacked the longstanding defence minister and promoted General al Sisi in his place. Operation Sinai was launched, aimed at eliminating armed Islamist groups, protecting the Suez Canal, and destroying the tunnel network connecting the Sinai with the Gaza Strip. During the operation, 32 militants and suspects were killed and 38 arrested, while 2 civilians were killed by early September 2012. \c\cSince the July 2013 coup against President Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, Egyptian military and security services in particular were targeted by Sinai-based Islamist groups. In an increase in violence, security forces came under near daily attack throughout July to August 2013. \c\cIn 2013, the new authorities adopted a more aggressive strategy, leading to mass arrests and harsh security measures. \c\cOver the few months leading to 2014, the Egyptian army gained the upper hand in the battle against militias that had found safe haven in the peninsula. After isolating and largely clearing the populated northeastern Sinai, the army put many militant factions on the defensive, most notably Ansar Bait al-Maqdis. However, one thousand armed militiamen were still sheltering in the main stronghold in Jabal Halal, as well as Jabal Amer area. \c\cIn November 2014, the situation in the Sinai was thrust into the spotlight with the deadliest attack on the security forces since 2011, and the group responsible Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis pledging allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forming the Sinai Province. \c\cIn the wake of the attack on the security forces, the government declared state of emergency, imposing a curfew and establish a buffer zone in the Sinai's border area with Gaza. \c\cIn May 2013, a number of Egyptian Army police officers were taken hostage by armed tribesmen in the Sinai Peninsula, with videos released on the internet with them begging for their lives. As a response, Egypt's government built up security forces in northern Sinai as part of an effort to secure the release of six policemen and a border guard kidnapped by suspected militants. On 20–21 May, Egyptian troops and police, backed by helicopter gunships, conducted a sweep through a number of villages in northern Sinai, along the border with Israel. The officials said the forces came under fire from gunmen in vehicles, triggering the clashes. The clashes left one gunman dead by 21 May. The hostages were released on 22 May after talks between the captors and Bedouins. One suspect in the kidnapping was arrested on 30 May 2013. \c\cAfter Morsi's ouster on 3 July by Sisi, there was an increase in violence by armed Bedouin and Islamists. Attacks on security forces took place almost daily — leading many to link the militants there to the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group from which Morsi hails. \c\cIn response, Egypt launched a major military operation in Sinai against the militants, bringing in two additional battalions. \c\cIn the two weeks following 3 July, 39 terrorist attacks occurred in North Sinai. In the resulting clashes between armed groups and security forces, 52 gunmen and civilians and six security personnel died. On 15 July, a bus transporting workers to the army-operated Al-Arish Cement Company was attacked leaving five killed and 15 wounded, the highest civilian casualties. On 16 July, attacks resulted in some of the most intense army engagement, concentrated at Al-Masa\'id, Al-Joura, and the Central Security camp at Al-Ahrash. \c\cSecurity operations have been largely confined to the 40-kilometre area between Al-Arish and Sheikh Zuweid, extending northward toward Rafah along the border with Israel and up to the Karen Abu Salem crossing. Fighting intensified between the gunmen and the joint army-police forces at night. The frequency of attacks varied from two to five in a single day. In addition, targets expanded from fixed security checkpoints to mobile patrols. In most operations, the gunmen used four-wheel drive vehicles and combinations of light and heavy weaponry. However, in three attacks RPG-7 launchers were used, most likely smuggled from Libya. These grenades are capable of penetrating armoured vehicles and are generally fired at the doors. \c\cOn 27 July, an operation dubbed "Desert Storm" was launched by the Egyptian army in North Sinai Governorate to last for 48 hours. Two of Egypt's field armies, as well as the country's air force and navy reportedly took part in the large-scale operation. The military were said to have blocked all the roads, bridges and tunnels leading from Northern Sinai to other provinces.[citation needed]\c\cA bomb was placed at a hotel frequented by security officials on 2 August 2013, though it caused no injuries. A security source told the Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm that a majority of "terrorists" had been arrested as of 3 August 2013. 2 mausoleums were bombed on 4 August 2013, though no injuries resulted. \c\cTwenty-five Egyptian policemen died in an attack in the northern region of Sinai, on 18 August. After militants forced two mini-buses carrying off-duty policemen to stop, ordered the policemen out and forced them to lie on the ground before shooting them. The Egyptian military arrested eleven people, including five Hamas members, three local residents and three foreign nationals,  for their alleged involvement in the killings. The person who committed the murders confessed on 1 September 2013. \c\cMilitary spokesperson Ahmed Ali said that Egyptian security forces operations in Sinai, from 5 July to 23 August, resulted in 78 suspected militants killed, including 32 foreigners; 116 people injured; and 203 people arrested, including 48 foreigners, for their alleged involvement in attacks on security checkpoints in the peninsula. Additionally 343 tunnels on the border with Gaza at Rafah were destroyed. \c\cOn 3 September, fifteen Islamist militants were killed in an attack by military helicopters. \c\cOn 7 September, the Egyptian army launched a new operation in the region involving tanks and at least six Apache helicopters. The army jammed communications to thwart militant coordination. The army combed through areas near the Gaza Strip, including locations used by militants suspected in the killing and abduction of Egyptian soldiers over the past year. In the three days of operations, after 7 September, one officer, two soldiers and 29 militants were killed, and 39 militants arrested. \c\cOn 11 September, a suicide bomber targeted Egyptian military intelligence headquarters in Rafah, bringing down the structure, at the same time a car bomb had rammed an army checkpoint. In the simultaneous attack at least nine soldiers were killed. \c\cOn 24 December, 16 were killed and over 134 injured in a huge bomb which hit the Daqahliya Security Directorate in Mansoura, in the worst attack on a government site since the ouster of Morsi in July. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, a Sinai-based group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The group deemed Egyptian troops infidels because they answer to a "secular government", warning them to desert or face death. \c\cOn 26 January, militants shot down an army Mi-17 helicopter in North Sinai, killing all five of its crew members. The weapon the insurgents used was an infrared-homing, surface-to-air missile from the Russian-made Igla family.

Many of the new forces are stationed in the northeast of Sinai along the Egyptian border with Gaza. Setting up roadblocks and checkpoints to monitor and inspect traffic transiting the Sinai Peninsula to counter this smuggling. \c\cIn the October 2014 attacks, for the first time the militants in Sinai used suicide truck bombs to breach army roadblocks and strongpoints, then followed them with an infantry attack. \c\cAfter the October attacks, the Egyptian military began using armed drones for the first time since the Sinai insurgency began.

The face mask requirement was a factor in the killing of a security guard at a Family Dollar store in Flint after a woman refused to wear a mask and was denied entry, leading to the arrests of a family of four people, in which a 23-year-old man was charged with first-degree murder. Governor Whitmer has since extended the face mask requirement until July 15. On July 10, she extended the requirement and added a provision in which businesses can be fined $500 for not enforcing it and customers may be refused service for failing to wear one. \c\cThe state legislature approved $125 million to aid in relief efforts on March 17, and Governor Gretchen Whitmer called in the Michigan Army National Guard to assist with supply distribution the next day. The state legislature allocated an additional $150 million for medical supplies and personal protective equipment for hospitals on March 30. Governor Whitmer requested a major disaster declaration on March 26, which President Donald Drumpf granted on March 28. \c\cSeveral of the restrictions on businesses and medical facilities were lifted in late May. \c\cGovernor Whitmer has issued several states of emergency, the latest of which expired on October 27. On June 1, the Governor announced that the stay at home order was partially lifted and that Michigan was in stage four of its six-stage re-opening plan. Outdoor crowds of up to 100 people are allowed starting June 1. Restaurants and bars began re-opening for indoor dining services starting June 8, and other restrictions on businesses were loosened. Hair and nail salons, barbershops, and tattoo and massage parlors were allowed to reopen on June 15. Starting July 31, indoor gatherings will be limited to 10 people and bars will be closed for indoor service and outdoor gatherings to 100. On August 14, Governor Whitmer announced four million masks will be distributed to vulnerable populations in Michigan. Movie theaters and other entertainment venues were allowed to re-open on October 9. \c\cOn October 22, Governor Whitmer signed several bills that protect workers from the spread of coronavirus on the job and protect businesses from lawsuits related to people contracting COVID-19 if they are following all prevention mandates. \c\cOn October 29, the MDHHS issued a new mask mandate and crowd size limitations for public places, businesses, private gatherings, and restaurants. \c\cOn November 15, after several days of record highs in new cases, Governor Whitmer announced the MDHHS has ordered the closure of several businesses and services for three weeks, effective November 18. Specifically, high schools and universities are closed to in-person learning, and organized sports (except for professional) are on hiatus. Businesses ordered to close include live theaters, movie theaters, stadiums, arenas, bowling centers, ice skating rinks, indoor water parks, bingo halls, casinos, arcades, and group fitness classes. \c\cA month later on December 18, the state announced an extension of the shutdown for indoor dining and bars for four weeks, but allowed other indoor entertainment venues like theaters, casinos, bowling alleys and indoor gun ranges will be allowed to reopen with capacity limits and a ban on concessions. High schools, colleges and universities will be allowed to reopen on January 4. \c\cOn February 8, 2021, the Federal Emergency Management Agency gave Michigan DHHS $8,375,955 for COVID-19 vaccination distribution efforts. \c\cIn May 2021, it was determined that Governor Whitmer did not follow Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) self-quarantine rules upon her March trip to Florida. \c\cFor impacts on high school and college sports, see the High school and College sections\c\cAs of March 11, all campuses of the Lake Superior State University, University of Michigan, Western Michigan University, Wayne State University, Michigan Technological University, Northern Michigan University, Michigan State University, Grand Valley State University, Saginaw Valley State University, Central Michigan University, and all community colleges, had various restrictions on students and faculty in response to the virus. \c\cExecutive Order 2020-05 also included the closure of all K–12 school buildings from March 16 through April 5 (Executive Order 2020-05).  On April 2, the order was updated to suspend the remainder of the 2019–20 school year unless crisis restrictions are otherwise lifted. The order included guidelines for the development and distribution of home learning materials. Additionally, all high school seniors will be given the opportunity to graduate on their previously anticipated date. \c\cAdditionally, on March 13, the Michigan Department of Education was granted a federal waiver by the United States Department of Agriculture. The waiver allowed for students who will receive food from the Unanticipated School Closure SFSP to not be mandated to receive the food in a group setting.  The Michigan Department of Corrections banned visitors to prisons, along with prohibiting any volunteers from the prison. Staff at prisons will be required to have their temperature tested and be proven to be under 100.4 °F (38.0 °C) along with other measures.  The Michigan Career and Technical Institute suspended all programs until April 5. \c\cOn June 30, Governor Whitmer released the state's "Return to School Roadmap" containing three proposed plans for re-opening K-12 schools for the upcoming 2020–21 school year. \c\cOn August 18, Michigan State University moved all classes for the fall 2020 semester to virtual learning. \c\cOn August 19, it was announced the state's public schools, especially low-income school districts, are receiving a combined $65 million for virtual learning technology. \c\cAugust 24, Eastern Michigan University postponed its date for students to move onto campus from August 27 to September 17. It began its fall semester online on August 31, but will transition the small number of classes that were scheduled to be in-person to a near fully online schedule through September 20. \c\cIn December 2020, two veterinary students appeared before the MSU Board of Trustees, on behalf of the graduating classes of 2023 and 2024, to request a tuition rebate for months of online instruction after originally expecting a mix of in-person and online courses. MSU President Samuel L. Stanley Jr. commented that a refund wouldn\'t be practical due to the university's fixed costs, and that the change in instruction was "one of the unfortunate casualties of the pandemic." In January 2021, MSU instituted a lockdown for the minority of students who had returned to campus, asking all in-person students to primarily stay in their residences for two weeks, citing a rapid increase in the university's COVID-19 positivity rate. \c\cIn early February 2021, senior nursing students in the Baker College system began to directly administer vaccines to patients at sites throughout Michigan, under the supervision of nursing faculty. \c\cThe University of Michigan (Ann Arbor campus) will require students to prove they\'ve been fully vaccinated by July 15 to live in dorms in fall 2021 and subsequent semesters. Michigan State University subsequently decided to require COVID-19 vaccination and masking for all new and returning students by August 31, citing new CDC data regarding the contagiousness of the Delta variant. \c\cOn March 13, with Executive Order 2020–05, the Governor banned all gatherings of 250 or more people in a single space starting that day. The ban made exceptions for residential facilities and child care services at schools in addition to exemptions for consumers buying groceries or products, for industrial and manufacturing work, and for public transport and other forms of mass transit (Executive Order 2020-05)  The ban was lowered to 50 people on March 16 per a CDC recommendation and is effective from March 17 – April 5. The order was later updated to exclude houses of worship from penalty if they convened more than 50 people. \c\cMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issued an order starting March 16 to limit all Michigan Secretary of State branch offices to appointment-only instead of walk-ins.  The only services provided by the offices will be for those applying for new licenses and IDs, for title transfers, and for testing for a license.  All branches will no longer be open on Saturdays, with most weekday hours expanding.  For those renewing their licenses, the proof of car insurance requirement was waived.  Also waived were late fees associated with the change. \c\cOn March 10, Attorney General Dana Nessel set up a hotline to report businesses price gouging goods such as toilet paper, meat, milk, bread, bottled water, face masks, hand sanitizers, and cleaning supplies. Sellers face fines if their asking price is at least 20% higher than it was on March 9, after an executive order from Governor Whitmer banned the practice, until April 16. The order includes a clause that exempts retailers if they "can prove the increase is attributable to an increase in cost of bringing the product to market or an extraordinary discount was in effect as of March 9". As of March 19, at least 800 complaints have been received. On March 19, Nessel sent a cease and desist letter to Menards after her investigators found evidence of price hikes, sometimes doubling the retail cost, on high-demand bleach and 3M face masks. In other instances, tipsters reported seeing face masks that cost $10 each, cases of water for $35, and bottles of hand sanitizer for $60. Whitmer issued a second order on March 20 which "focuses enforcement resources on the cases most pertinent to the emergency by clarifying which price increases constitute price gouging." As of April 14, 3,541 complaints have been received. \c\cOn March 20, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order banning landlords from filing eviction requests against tenants until April 17, which she says "relieves courts from certain statutory restrictions to enable them to stay eviction-related proceedings until after the COVID-19 emergency has passed". Also on that date, Whitmer signed an executive order for medical and dental facilities to postpone any "non-essential" procedures, such as plastic surgery and teeth whitening, beginning March 20 through the time the State of Emergency is lifted. On March 21, Whitmer issued an executive order to close facilities that provide non-essential personal care services such as hair and nail salons, tanning salons, spas, and businesses that offer massages, tattoos, body art, and piercings, until April 13. On March 30, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order banning non-essential veterinary visits. \c\cOn May 18, Governor Whitmer issued two executive orders, one prohibiting factories from giving tours and another requiring people to cover their faces in indoor public spaces. The former requirement was waived to allow President Drumpf to visit a Ford manufacturing plant in Ypsilanti on May 21. While touring the plant (which was producing ventilators and personal protective equipment), Drumpf had a mask with the presidential seal but did not wear it on camera, saying he "didn\'t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it." Michigan's attorney general Dana Nessel said she expected to "have a very serious conversation with Ford" for enabling the violation of the face-covering requirement, adding the president had sent "the worst possible message" and that he would no longer be welcome to tour facilities in the state.  Governor Whitmer also signed an executive order on March 21 allowing gatherings of 10 people or less at retail stores by appointment only. Some malls opened as early as March 28 and some automobile showrooms reopened after the executive order was made. Tribal casinos plan to reopen on May 29. \c\cAfter the flooding in Midland due to two dams breaking on May 20 forcing mass evacuations, Senator Jim Stamas asks Governor Whitmer to reopen restaurants in the area. \c\cOn June 11, Governor Whitmer extended the freeze on residential evictions for non-payment of rent to June 30. According to the Executive Order signed by Governor Whitmer, on June 10, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Northern Michigan and on June 15 personal care services will reopen. \c\cOn August 21, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA) cited six businesses with coronavirus health and safety violations, including lack of health screenings, face coverings, employee training, cleaning measures, and overall preparedness plans. Each faces a $7,000 fine. \c\cOn September 17, another 19 businesses were fined by MIOSHA for "serious violations" of COVID-19 safety protocols. \c\cOn October 2, it was announced ten more business were cited for violating COVID-19 safety guidelines. \c\cOn November 25, it was announced three bars have had their licenses suspending for violating the MDHHS's latest emergency order, and four other businesses have faced fines. Five more had theirs suspended on December 29. \c\cOn February 5, it was reported 20 business across the state were fined for COVID-19 violations. Another 16 businesses were charged on February 19. With the latest batch of violations, the state's Attorney General has now charged over 100 separate businesses. \c\cOn April 9, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced 12 more businesses were fined for violations. On April 19, it was reported 25 more businesses were cited, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan which required union employees to work from the office, but allowed nonunion employees doing similar jobs to work from home. \c\cOn March 17, the Michigan Legislature approved $125 million to fight the pandemic, with $50 million going towards the Department of Health and Human Services and another $40 million towards other state agencies for ongoing coronavirus response needs. Another $35 million was set in reserve in case more funding becomes necessary in the future. On March 18, Governor Whitmer asked the Michigan Army National Guard to "assist the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services with assembling and loading critical personal protective equipment, such as gloves, gowns, and face shields." In response to widespread rumors that were circulating regarding the National Guard's presence in the state, Whitmer reaffirmed on March 20 that there were no active plans to implement martial law, although she did indicate that state officials were monitoring the effectiveness of lock-down protocols in other states, should they become necessary. On March 30, the legislature allocated an additional $150 million to purchase supplies to fight the pandemic. President Donald Drumpf approved Governor Whitmer's disaster declaration on March 28. Michigan will get about $2 billion from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) signed into law on March 27. On August 5, it was announced small businesses in Michigan will receive a combined total of $5.7 million from the CARES Act. Michigan will receive $65 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 11, 2021. A total of $622 million of federal money for rental assistance will become available to eligible Michigan residents starting the third week of March 2021. Some of it, $282 million, will be distributed immediately, and the other $340 million will be appropriated by the state legislature at a later date. \c\cOn March 23, Governor Whitmer issued a statewide stay-at-home order, starting March 24, and lasting for at least three weeks, until April 13. \c\cOn April 15, Governor Whitmer ordered nursing homes to transfer coronavirus patients to separate units or special facilities and banned evictions from nursing homes. The order was in effect until May 13. \c\cOn April 16, Governor Whitmer joined the governors of Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky to coordinate a plan to reopen the Midwest regional economy. On April 17, Governor Whitmer outlined a plan to re-open the state's economy starting May 1. \c\cThe stay-at-home order was extended to April 30, and then re-extended until May 15, and once more until May 30 with modified restrictions compared to previous orders. \c\c"Stay Home, Stay Safe", Executive Order 2020–21 directed all businesses and operations to temporarily suspend in-person services that are not necessary to sustain or protect life. The order directed residents to remain "in their homes unless they’re a part of an essential workforce, engaged in an outdoor activity, or performing tasks necessary to the health and safety of themselves or their family, like going to the hospital, or grocery store." When leaving the house, individuals must adhere to social distancing measures, as directed by the CDC. The next stay-at-home order, Executive Order 2020–42, signed April 9, closed golf courses, disallowed recreational boating and travel to vacation homes in the state, and banned customers from shopping in non-essential sections of retail stores and businesses, including carpeting, flooring, furniture, garden centers, plant nurseries or paint. Failure to abide by the order could have resulted in a $1,000 fine or 90 days in jail. \c\cThe stay-at-home order was later extended to May 15, with some restrictions from the second one lifted and others added. The controversial bans of recreational boating and travel to vacation homes were removed, while non-medical grade face coverings in public became mandatory starting April 26. Several businesses and sections of stores were allowed to reopen, including those gardening supplies and paint, as well as golf courses, but Airbnb rentals were banned. The next stay-at-home order modified some of the restrictions from previous orders and allowed manufacturing to restart on May 11. On April 27, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order placing several new regulations on restaurant and grocery stores and their employees. \c\cOn May 18, Governor Whitmer announced bars and restaurant dining rooms in the Northern Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula would be allowed to open on May 22. She later announced retail stores and auto dealerships may reopen on May 26 and nonessential medical, dental, and veterinary procedures may begin on May 29. \c\cOn May 22, Governor Whitmer extended the stay-at-home order until June 12 and the state of emergency until June 19. \c\cOn June 1, Governor Whitmer lifted the stay-at-home order, and also announced that restaurants and bars would be allowed to reopen statewide on June 8. \c\cOn July 14, Governor Whitmer extended the state of emergency again until August 11. \c\cA month later Whitmer issued a new order to expire September 4. A later emergency order expired October 27. \c\cFacing a COVID-19 surge in the state in April, Governor Whitmer hoped to avoid more mandatory shutdowns and asked Michigan residents on April 9 to take more "personal responsibility," while asking the White House to send more vaccine doses. The request for vaccines was denied, in large part because the protection provided by vaccines activates only after several weeks while the need to prevent new infections was immediate. On April 12, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky argued that asking for voluntary quarantine would not be enough. She said that Michigan needed "to really close things down, to go back to our basics, to go back to where we were last spring, last summer, and to shut things down."\c\cDuring the week of March 16, 2020, Michigan Medicine started in-house testing for COVID-19, with the capabilities to deliver same-day results. This allowed the hospital to bypass the state's testing system, which was previously the sole provider of testing for the virus. The same week, the health system also launched drive-thru testing services for Michigan Medicine patients at West Ann Arbor Health Center, Brighton Health Center, and Canton Health Center. \c\cSimilarly, Beaumont Health and Henry Ford Health System in Metro Detroit also developed in-house testing methods in an effort to increase overall testing capacity within the state. On March 27, 2020, a regional drive-up testing center opened in Detroit, at the vacant State Fairgrounds site. A partnership between Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties, the city of Detroit, and three regional health systems, the center is able to test up to 400 residents a day, who are referred to the site from their doctor via scheduled appointments. The state restructured reporting procedures and began incorporating private test results in official government case tallies on March 19, 2020. On April 15, 2020, Hurley Medical Center in Flint opened a mobile testing clinic at Atwood Stadium, with capacity for at least 250 people per day. Testing is provided to those with orders from a doctor and is not open to the general public. Similar drive-thru testing facilities opened in Atlanta, Bad Axe, Battle Creek, Bay City, Benton Harbor, Dearborn, Grand Rapids, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Saginaw, and Traverse City. \c\cThe state health department released case counts and death tolls daily and updated recovered cases weekly. Reviews of the outcomes of reported COVID cases led to the discovery of unrecorded deaths on multiple occasions. These deaths were added to the daily toll when discovered, with the result that daily reported deaths did not always indicate the current state of the epidemic. Recovery from the disease was defined simply as surviving 30 days after first symptoms, with no review of actual health or hospitalization status. Starting May 29, 2020, families could get tested together in Kalamazoo. \c\cStarting April 13, 2020, new testing sites opened in Atlanta, Bad Axe, Bay City, Battle Creek, Benton Harbor, Detroit, Flint, Jackson, Kalamazoo, and Traverse City. \c\cMichigan airports received a combined $256 million in federal aid to help ease economic hardship from the coronavirus crisis, funded by the CARES Act. \c\cStarting March 13, 2020, Delta Air Lines, which has a major hub at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said it would cancel all flights to Europe for 30 days, decreasing flights by 40% and grounding 300 planes. Delta had previously indicated it would reduce international flights by 20–25% and domestic flights by 10–15%. On April 28, Delta announced it was suspending flights to and from Flint, Lansing, and Kalamazoo and several other small hub airports across the country after losing $534 million in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic. American Airlines ended service to 15 small airports, including Kalamazoo, starting October 7. \c\cStarting on March 15, 2020, several grocery chains that have stores in Michigan, including Kroger, Meijer, and Walmart, began reducing their business hours for cleaning and restocking in response to the pandemic. Similarly, Michigan-based Meijer reported a plan to hire 40–50 new seasonal employees per store to help meet public demand during the outbreak. Kroger announced that, starting the morning of March 23, all of its Michigan stores would be dedicating the first hour of business on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to seniors, expectant mothers, first responders, and those with compromised immune systems. The following week, Kroger announced it would hire up to 2,000 people in Michigan in response to the pandemic. \c\cThe 2020 North American International Auto Show in Detroit was canceled on March 29, due to the use of its venue TCF Center as a FEMA facility. \c\cMichigan-based automotive manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler announced plans to gradually shut down plants starting March 19 with all plants closed by the end of the month. \c\cOn March 30, Ford announced it will convert its Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti to produce GE/Airon Corporation Model A-E ventilators. It says it will produce 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days. \c\cOn April 1, 2020, General Motors announced it will produce 30,000  V+Pro critical care ventilators for the national stockpile. \c\cOn the morning of March 16, Governor Whitmer announced a temporary order to close all bars and restaurants in the state to sit-down service, effective at 3 pm the same evening until March 30. Carry-out and delivery options were excluded from the order, although restaurants were urged to limit in-building carry-out services to five customers at a time. The order also included fitness centers, theaters, casinos, and other venues that encourage large assemblages of patrons, with several exceptions, such as office buildings. This order is expected to have significant economic impacts on businesses, and it prompted the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association to call for Whitmer to submit paperwork to qualify Michigan for the U.S. Small Business Administration Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. The order also expands unemployment benefits to public health workers who become ill, people who need to take time off to care for children, and others, until April 14. \c\cDomino's Pizza, which is centered in the state, anticipated hiring up to 10,000 people to help meet increased demand for food delivery services due to the pandemic, while Jet's Pizza also prepared to hire "hundreds" of additional delivery drivers for the same reason. \c\cOn June 8, Lansing restaurants reopened for dine-in service for the first time since mid-May. \c\cOn September 21, it was announced three bars in West Michigan lost their liquor licenses temporarily after they allegedly failed to enforce coronavirus mandates. \c\cOn January 22, 2021, at Governor Whitmer announced that starting on February 1, restaurants may re-open at 25% capacity with up to 100 people, tables must be six feet apart with no more than six people per table, and bars and restaurants must close by 10 p.m. Contact information must also be collected from people for contact tracing purposes. \c\cSince December 1, 21 restaurants have received COVID-19 order violations by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Six restaurants had their food license suspended – and five of the six suspensions are still in place. Another 15 businesses were sent cease-and-desist orders, which is a lesser violation. \c\cRestaurants, bars and retail stores were allowed to operate at 50% capacity starting March 5, 2021. \c\cOn March 19, the owner of a pizza restaurant in Holland was criminally charged with allowing indoor dining when it was banned, not enforcing mask rules, and ignoring capacity limits. \c\cOn March 19, the Michigan Strategic Fund unanimously voted to approve a $20 million economic relief program meant to help struggling small businesses affected by the pandemic. The Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) had processed over 1.7 million applications as of May 13, with 1.375 million people receiving benefits. The state has paid $5.62 billion in benefits since the state of emergency was declared two months prior. By June 19, UIA disbursed $11.4 billion to two million people since the coronavirus pandemic reached the state. On August 21, the Federal Emergency Management Administration approved UIA's application for funding that would provide an additional $300 per week payment to Michigan residents receiving unemployment benefits. On October 14, the federal government approved unemployment benefits for 20 more weeks, with up to 59 weeks of benefits for some workers. On October 20, Governor Whitmer signed a bill approving six more weeks of state unemployment aid. \c\cOn March 12, Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training. Four days later, they announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, which affected Michigan's team, the Detroit Tigers. On June 24, two members of the Detroit Tigers organization (later identified as pitcher Daniel Norris and a coach) tested positive for COVID-19. Norris was later cleared to join the Opening Day roster. \c\cOn June 25, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order which allows professional sports to resume in the state. Two days before, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred unilaterally implemented a 60-game season. Players reported to training camps at their regular season home stadiums on July 1 in order to resume spring training, which included inter-squad games only, and prepare for a July 23 or 24 Opening Day (July 24 for the Tigers). In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, teams only played their own division and the opposite league's corresponding geographical division, e.g. the Tigers only played the American League Central (40 games total) and National League Central (20 games total). Games were played behind closed doors, with artificial crowd noise played over loudspeakers. \c\cThe Tigers\' August 3–6 series against the St. Louis Cardinals was postponed several times after 17 of the latter's members tested positive for COVID-19, with two of the games later cancelled outright. \c\cOn March 15, 2021 Governor Whitmer increased the maximum allowed capacity of sports stadiums from 375 people to 1,000, in time for the start of the 2021 Detroit Tigers season. On June 8, Comerica Park was allowed to return to operating at full seating capacity after April and May games this season were limited to 8,000 fans. \c\cAlso on March 12, the National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days, which affected the Detroit Pistons. \c\cOn March 14, Detroit Pistons power forward Christian Wood reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. \c\cThe Pistons\' season officially ended on June 5 when they failed to make the cut for a 22-team restart. \c\cIn their 2020–21 season, the Pistons\' game against the Denver Nuggets on February 1 was postponed due to a positive test on a Detroit player, as well as the February 16 game against the San Antonio Spurs due to an outbreak on the latter team. \c\cIn the National Hockey League, the season was suspended for an indefinite amount of time starting March 12, which affected the Detroit Red Wings. \c\cThe Red Wings\' season officially ended on May 27 when they failed to make a 24-team playoff tournament. \c\cThe NHL's shortened 2020–21 season began on January 13. The regular season ran for 56 games per team, ending on May 8. \c\cOn July 27, National Football League preseason games, which usually take place in August, were cancelled by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell due to the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the Detroit Lions. \c\cSince July 30, the Lions have placed eight players on the injury list after they tested positive for COVID-19. One player's test, quarterback Matthew Stafford, was later revealed to be a false-positive and he was removed from the list on August 4. \c\cMost games in the 2020 season were played behind closed doors, with crowds at some stadiums limited to friends and families of the players, coaches, and staff members. \c\cSeveral members of the Lions coaching staff, including interim head coach Darrell Bevell, sat out the December 26 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers due to an outbreak. \c\cExecutive Order 2020–42, signed April 9, closed golf courses in the state.

The NASCAR Cup Series postponed the 2020 FireKeepers Casino 400 at Michigan International Speedway from June 5–7 to August 8. The NASCAR Xfinity Series lost their Michigan date for 2020. \c\cThe NCAA also canceled all of its remaining winter tournaments for the 2019–2020 academic year, including the 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament—whose national semi-finals and championship were scheduled to be hosted by Detroit. All spring 2020 seasons were canceled as well. \c\cOn June 1, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order that allows college teams to begin workouts and practice sessions for fall 2020 sports seasons. It allows "outdoor fitness classes, athletic practices, training sessions or games, provided that coaches, spectators and participants not from the same household maintain six feet of distance from one another at all times". \c\cOn August 8, the Mid-American Conference (MAC), which includes the Central Michigan Chippewas, Eastern Michigan Eagles, and Western Michigan Broncos, canceled all of its fall 2020 sports seasons. On September 25, the MAC reversed its previous decision on its 2020 football season, voting to play a six–game schedule which started on November 4. \c\cOn August 11, the Big Ten Conference, which includes the Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans, postponed their fall 2020 sports seasons. On September 16, however, it was announced the 2020 football season would start on October 24 with an eight-game schedule. \c\cOn August 12, the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, which is made up mostly of schools in Michigan, postponed its fall 2020 and winter 2021 sports seasons. \c\cIn the fall of 2020, the pandemic caused both the Michigan Wolverines football and Michigan State Spartans football teams to cancel their games against the Maryland Terrapins football team due to COVID-19 outbreaks. The Michigan football team's game against their arch-rival, the Ohio State Buckeyes, as well as their game against the Iowa Hawkeyes, were also canceled after an increasing number of Michigan players and staff members became infected. \c\cOn January 23, 2021 the University of Michigan (U of M) shut down all sports for two weeks after the new more infectious UK variant of COVID-19 was discovered in five individuals with ties to the school. As of April 23, 2021, 342 U of M student-athletes and 59 coaches and staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. \c\cAt the high school level, the Michigan High School Athletic Association canceled the remainder of the winter 2019-20 seasons and all of the spring 2020 seasons on April 3, 2020. \c\cOn July 17, MHSAA announced all fall sports will resume as scheduled for the 2020–21 school year with practices starting August 10 for football and August 12 for other sports. However, on July 30, they announced all preseason scrimmages would be canceled and medium and high-risk sports (soccer, volleyball and football) could start practice but a final decision on whether games would be allowed might not be made until August 20. The MHSAA postponed the football season until spring 2021. On August 20, the MHSAA announced it will be allowing soccer, volleyball and swimming to start fall competition in Michigan's region 6 and 8 in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Regions 1-5 and 7 are still pending due to the phases they are in according to the Governor's executive orders on the pandemic. Girl's golf, boys tennis and cross country in both peninsulas are able to start immediately because they are not contact sports. On September 3, the MHSAA approved the return of all fall 2020 sports. \c\cOn November 15, Governor Whitmer announced the MDHHS has ordered all high school sports to suspend activities for three weeks, effective November 18. \c\cOn April 15, a convoy of thousands of motorists drove from all over the state to protest the extension of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order. The protest, known now as Operation Gridlock, involved clogging the streets surrounding on near the Michigan State Capitol, including the Capitol Loop, with their vehicles, drawing national attention. The protest was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, a group with ties to the DeVos family, through Facebook. The Michigan Freedom Fund supported the rally by as an event co-host, spending an estimated $250 to promote the event. The Michigan Conservative Coalition is asking the governor to take a more measured approach that would allow certain parts of work and daily life to start returning to normal. The organizers urged participants to practice social distancing, and not leave their vehicles during the protest. Lt. Darren Green of the Michigan State Police estimated several thousand cars were part of the demonstration, with 100 to 150 people congregating on the Capitol lawn. “They’re doing a pretty good job of maintaining social distance," Green said. "They’re being respectful and not causing any issues at all.” Neither the Michigan State Police nor the Lansing Police Department had reported any arrests. Multiple services have been disrupted as a result of Operation Gridlock, such as the Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA) temporarily suspending their downtown route. Governor Whitmer said the protest was legal per the First Amendment's right to freedom of assembly, and understood the protesters\' anger, but warned them they were endangering their health by not following social distancing guidelines and noticed some people were not wearing personal protective equipment, including children, further adding "(It's) not a political decision, it's about public health. The enemy is the virus, not one another." President Donald Trump supported the protest on April 17 with an all-caps tweet saying "Liberate Michigan". \c\cOn April 30, a second protest occurred when hundreds of protesters, many carrying firearms, gathered at the Michigan Capitol.  Many protesters were able to enter the building.  The demonstration was organized by conservative group Michigan United for Liberty. Governor Whitmer said on April 30 that she found elements of the protest ‘disturbing.’ Also, in an appearance May 3 on CNN’s State of the Union, the governor said the Confederate flags, nooses and Nazi signs displayed were ‘outrageous’ and racist, with some depicting her as Adolf Hitler. On May 14, more armed protesters from Michigan United for Liberty gathered outside the Michigan State Capitol. The organization's Facebook group was deleted over death threats against Governor Whitmer and a fight broke out over a doll tied to a noose carried by a man who also had an axe at the protest. The Michigan Legislature closed its scheduled session to avoid the possibility of another armed confrontation inside the chamber. \c\cOn May 20, the Michigan Conservative Coalition held "Operation Haircut" on the lawn of the Capitol Building, in which barbers gave free haircuts, in support of an Owosso barber who was forced to shut down after continuing to operate until the previous week, violating the executive order closing non-essential businesses that included barbershops and beauty salons resulting in the state suspending his license. Several of the barbers at the demonstration were issued $1,000 citations by the Michigan State Police for disorderly conduct. A week later on May 27, the group from Operation Haircut delivered a letter to the Governor with a layout of safe practices to reopen. The charges against the Owosso barber were eventually dismissed. The charges against the other barbers arrested during the Operation Haircut demonstration were dismissed on February 8, 2021. \c\cA peaceful demonstration of prayers organized by the religious non-profit Transformation Michigan was performed on the Capitol lawn on May 28. \c\cA peaceful protest called "Let MI People Go" by religious group Stand Up Michigan took place on the Capitol lawn on October 8. \c\cOn December 15, a protest took place near the home of Robert Gordon, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, to oppose the new restrictions imposed by the state. \c\cDuring the summer and fall of 2020, Governor Whitmer was targeted with an alleged elaborate kidnapping plot. The plot was revealed when the Federal Bureau of Investigation thwarted it. In October 2020, fourteen members of a right-wing militia group called the Wolverine Watchmen were charged with several federal and state crimes. One of the suspects cited Whitmer's handling of the pandemic as part of their motive to kidnap her. \c\cIn April multiple lawsuits were filed challenging Whitmer's executive orders. The suits were filed by individuals, business owners, recreational fishermen, a conservation organization, and several county prosecutors. They alleged that her orders were overly broad, violated their constitutional rights, harmed businesses, and amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property rights. Governor Whitmer's third stay-at-home order, issued April 24, overturned the restrictions on recreational boating and visits to vacation homes, effectively ending some of the lawsuits. \c\cOn April 29, inmates from various Michigan prisons filed a class action lawsuit against the Michigan Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, claiming the state is violating the Eighth Amendment by subjecting inmates to cruel and unusual punishment by not taking necessary pandemic precautions. \c\cOn May 6, a group of churches sued Governor Whitmer, claiming "Executive Order 2020-70 continues to prohibit gatherings of two or more individuals, including at churches, thereby denying them the ability to hold worship services and otherwise carry out their ministry functions until May 28, 2020" violates their First Amendment right of freedom of religion. 
An ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. In the early stage of the offensive, the Taliban made significant advances in the countryside, increasing the number of districts it controls from 73 to 223. Starting on 6 August, the Taliban captured eighteen of Afghanistan's thirty-four provincial capitals, including Kandahar and Herat, and by 10 August, the Taliban controlled 65% of the country. \c\cThe offensive is noted for the rapid territorial gains of the Taliban, as well as its domestic and international ramifications. On 10 August, U.S. officials estimated that the Afghan capital, Kabul, could fall to the Taliban within 30 to 90 days. \c\cIn September 2020, over 5,000 Taliban prisoners, including 400 of whom were accused and convicted of major crimes such as murder, were released by the Afghan government as part of the Doha Agreement between the United States and the Taliban. According to Afghanistan's National Security Council, many of the released prisoners who were "experts" returned to the battlefield and strengthened the Taliban's hand. International counterterrorism experts and some U.S. officials argued that the Afghan National Security Forces\' (ANSF) swift collapse in case of a U.S. withdrawal "should come as no surprise". One expert pointed at the Taliban had been able to move their forces freely throughout Afghanistan after the Doha Agreement with almost no intervention from Afghan government forces. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko stated that the U.S. military command "knew how bad the Afghan military was". \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 ANSF troops and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by the Taliban. Among the locations captured by the Taliban was Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway to Afghanistan's capital city, Kabul. In terms of equipment, the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces, as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on the ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad; eyewitnesses stated that the language the Taliban militants spoke among themselves was foreign, indicating that the fighters were not from the area. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the U.K., Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan Province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan Province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cIn July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second and third largest cities of Afghanistan, Kandahar and Herat respectively. During the month, 335 Afghan National Security Forces and 189 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,159 Taliban fighters. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves, with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. On 7 July, pro-government forces defeated a Taliban attempt to capture the city of Qala e Naw. On 8 July, the Taliban captured the strategically important Karakh District in Herat Province. \c\cOn 8 July, Afghan soldiers executed an Afghan villager by making him sit on an improvised explosive device (IED) before it exploded. The victim, named Barakatullah, was accused of aiding the Taliban by Afghan police and anti-Taliban militia. The father of Barakatullah denied that his son was working with the Taliban. The incident took place south of the city of Sharana, the capital of Paktika province and the video of the incident was uploaded on TikTok. France 24 Observers team was able to verify and geolocate the video. Fawad Aman, a spokesperson for the Afghan ministry of defence, denied that any such incident took place. An Afghan journalist, Naseeb Zadran, said that this not an isolated incident and reflects the impunity enjoyed by Afghan army. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. On 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force; Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed there while covering the fighting two days later. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Taliban from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban. Lyons implored both sides to protect civilians as she says that women and children are being killed. The same day around 46 Afghan troops, including 5 officers, sought refuge in Pakistan after they were unable to defend their military post. \c\cOn 28 July, a delegation from the Taliban met in Tianjin with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who pledged the People's Republic of China's support for the Taliban on the condition that they cut ties with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, vowing to "bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream" and offering to host peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. \c\cBy 31 July, the Taliban had entered the provincial capitals of both Helmand and Herat provinces, capturing scores of districts in said provinces and capturing border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan. Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions. On 3 August 40 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in the fighting. After capturing Lashkar Gah's radio station, the Taliban began broadcasting their Voice of Sharia programming. The rebels also began to attack the city's airport. Meanwhile, the government dispatched reinforcements to prevent the city from falling to the insurgents. \c\cOn 3 August 13 people—including five attackers—were killed in a Taliban bombing and shootout in Kabul. The inghimasi-style operation, carried out by the Taliban's "Martyrdom Battalion", aimed at killing Defence Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi; he survived the attack. Mohammadi was described by the Long War Journal as one of the key government figures responsible for countering the Taliban offensive. \c\cAs of 5 August, 115 Afghan National Security Forces personnel and 58 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,197 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. \c\cOn 6 August, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul. On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion. The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape. As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had "sold" the city to the Taliban. Social media posts suggested that the Taliban were welcomed by some residents of the city which has a long history of lawlessness. Images appearing on social media showed Taliban fighters driving captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs and pickups through the streets while flying Taliban flags as local residents—mostly youths and young men—cheered them on. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \'deadlier phase\' of the war. The governments of Britain and United States warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan "immediately" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation. \c\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ex-warlord and the strongman who had traditionally dominated the city, took his followers and fled to Khwaja Du Koh District, the only area in Jowzjan Province which was still government-held. Meanwhile, pro-government forces had been reduced to a pocket of resistance in Lashkar Gah, while Kandahar and Herat remained fiercely contested. Insurgents also launched repeated raids on the other provincial capitals. On the same day, U.S. B-52 bombers carried out airstrikes against Taliban in Afghanistan, operating from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The United States was also using armed Reaper drones and AC-130 Spectre gunships which reportedly began daily attacks against targets around Kandahar, Herat, and Lashkar Gah. The remaining ground defense of Lashkar Gah and Kandahar was mostly organized by hundreds of Afghan Commandos who had become encircled by the insurgents; as these soldiers were the Afghan military's best-trained and most highly motivated troops, the Long War Journal argued that their loss would be a major setback in regards to the Afghan security forces\' future effectiveness. USS Ronald Reagan was launching fast jets to provide support to the missions. The American Embassy in Kabul urged all Americans to leave the country immediately due to increased security concerns, and the inability of the embassy to guarantee the safety of American citizens due to the reduction of staff at the embassy. \c\cThe following day, the Taliban captured the cities of Kunduz and Sar-e Pol after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces. In the battles for the two cities, mass desertions were reported, as many Afghan National Army soldiers had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance as well as Taliban propaganda. Pro-government forces were only able to hold onto Kunduz's military base and airport. Reporters described the capture of Kunduz as "the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May" with the city being one of Afghanistan's largest settlements, well connected to other notable locations in the country including Kabul and considered part of a major Central Asian drug smuggling route. The battle for Kunduz involved the Red Unit, the Taliban elite shock troops, and resulted in the release of hundreds of prisoners including Taliban commanders. The city of Taloqan was also taken by the Taliban late 8 August, making it the fifth provincial capital to fall. Government forces retreated from the city after noon, retaking Warsaj District and Farkhar District. \c\cOn 9 August, the Taliban captured Aybak, the capital of Samangan province. Deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told the AFP news agency that government forces had withdrawn from the city without a fight after community representatives had requested that it be spared more violence. On the same day, Asif Azimi, a former senator from Samangan and a prominent warlord from the Jamiat-e Islami party, defected to the Taliban. Azimi said hundreds of men under his command had also defected to the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani and other political leaders also agreed to form a joint command center to coordinate and assist with public uprising forces. \c\cFighting intensified around Mazar-i-Sharif on 10 August. In Farah, capital of Farah Province, the Taliban had taken control of the governor's compound after heavy fighting between the Taliban and government forces. They had also taken control of the police headquarters and prison. Although heavy fighting continued, Farah became the seventh provincial capital to fall. An eighth provincial capital, Puli Khumri of Baghlan Province, was also captured on 10 August. \c\cOn 11 August, Fayzabad of Badakhshan Province became the ninth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban. After the Taliban reached the city gates, government forces decided to retreat to Farkhar District and join with security forces there from Taloqan's fall. Prior to the U.S. invasion, Fayzabad had been the headquarters of the Northern Alliance. On the same day, the Taliban captured Kunduz Airport and a major military base belonging to 217 Pamir Corps after hundreds of Afghan troops surrendered, securing Taliban control over their military equipment in Kunduz. The military base was responsible for security of Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan and was one of the eight such installations in Afghanistan; its fall further reduced the suffering morale of the Afghan National Army, while effectively making a government counter-offensive to relieve Mazar-i-Sharif impossible. Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) quoted two local councillors who said that the entire 217th Pamir Corps surrendered to Taliban forces in Kunduz. A Taliban spokesman also posted a video on Twitter which purportedly showed government soldiers joining the militants\' ranks. The besieged troops of the 217 Pamir Corps had held out for three days before surrendering; much military equipment was captured by the rebels at the base and airport. Additionally, the day saw General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai's replacement by General Haibatullah Alizai as the new Afghan Army chief of staff. The outgoing General Ahmadzai served as an Afghan army chief of staff since he assumed the post in June 2021. \c\cOn 12 August, the Taliban captured the city of Ghazni, making it the tenth provincial capital to fall within a week. The city lies along the Kabul–Kandahar Highway, serving as a gateway between Kabul and the strongholds in the south. The Governor of Ghazni Province was soon arrested in Wardak for "surrendering without a fight" in exchange for safe passage. On the same day, the central government offered a proposal of "power-sharing" in lieu of ceasefire; the Taliban rejected this offer stating that it wanted to establish a new Islamic emirate. The same day also saw the fall of strategic Shindand Air Base in Herat and capture of two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters stationed in the Air Base. Late that night, Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city and the capital of the eponymous province, fell to the Taliban. The fall of Herat, after two weeks of siege, forced Ismail Khan and other top government officials and forces to seek refuge at a provincial airport and the army corps outside the city. In the morning, Khan along with Abdul Rahman Rahman, deputy interior minister, and Hasib Sediqi, Chief of National Directorate of Security in Herat, surrendered to the Taliban. The commander of 207 Zafar Corps, Khyal Nabi Ahmadzai, and thousands of government forces also surrendered to the Taliban. According to the local officials, an entire Afghan army Corps in the city of Herat crumbled. By this point, they controlled 11 of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals. The Taliban had also launched an assault on Qala e Naw, capturing the city after failing to do so in July. \c\cOvernight, Kandahar was captured by the Taliban: heavy clashing around the city led to the withdrawal of the ANA, thus increasing the number of provincial capitals controlled by the Taliban to thirteen. \c\cA few hours after the fall of Herat, the U.S. and the U.K. governments announced the deployment of 3,000 and 600 of their troops respectively to the Kabul airport, in order to secure the airlifting of their nationals, embassy staff and the Afghan civilians who worked with the coalition forces out of the country. Officials said that the first deployment would occur in the next 24 to 48 hours, and that it would be completed by the end of the month. According to said sources the plan is to use charter aircraft for the evacuation using the Kabul airport which is still open with commercial airliners flying, however that military aircraft will be used if that becomes impossible. According to the British government, the evacuation and its timing had long been planned, while an Afghan official said that the timing was brought forward as the security situation rapidly deteriorated. In addition to the 3,000 U.S troops, an additional 3,500 will be on standby in Kuwait in case the situation escalates to an armed conflict with the Taliban. Canada announced that Canadian special forces units will be deployed to evacuate embassy personnel in Kabul, which houses Afghan families who have worked with Canadian staff in the past. The Danish and Norwegian governments announced their embassies in Kabul will be closed due to security reasons and will make plans to evacuate their diplomatic staff and Afghans who worked alongside them. \c\cAfter several weeks of fighting in the Battle of Lashkargah, the city of Lashkargah, capital of Helmand Province, was captured by the Taliban on 13 August. On the same day, the Taliban took control of Chaghcharan (also called Firozkoh), the capital city of Ghor Province. Officials said the city fell without any fighting, becoming the fifteenth provincial capital to fall to the Taliban within a week. Firozkoh has a population of nearly 132,000 people. Later on 13 August, the Taliban captured Puli Alam, Qalat and Tarinkot, the provincial capitals of Logar Province, Zabul Province and Uruzgan Province respectively. \c\cOn 14 August 2021, the Taliban entered Mazar-i-Sharif, provincial capital of Balkh Province, in an attempt to capture it. President Ghani had previously visited the city to rally local warlords to fight the Taliban. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cOn 23 June, the United States Intelligence Community estimated that the Afghan government could fall within the next six months following the U.S. withdrawal. On 10 August, U.S. officials revised the previous six month estimate, saying that it could happen much more quickly, and that some scenarios envisioned the fall of Kabul within 30 to 90 days. \c\cSince 2 July, U.S. withdrawal from the Bagram Airfield, U.S. airstrikes against the Taliban have been led from outside of Afghanistan, from the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and the U.S. Navy carrier strike group in the Persian Gulf. Requiring the warplanes to travel several hours to reach their targets. According to a U.S. defence official, the airstrikes since 2 July amounted to only "a handful" each day. \c\cOn 8 August, the head of extremist monitoring group SITE, Rita Katz, said that the Taliban advance resembled the earlier days of the Syrian civil war amid Nusra Front's victories, "except now on a completely different scale, given the Taliban's horrifying momentum". \c\cAccording to a U.S. defense official, the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of U.S. military forces could create an opening for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups to reorganize. The official added that, while the U.S. would still maintain authority to strike Al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan, the lack of a robust U.S. presence on the ground would hamper the ability to identify potential targets. The CENTCOM commander General McKenzie said that he has not seen anything that would make him believe the Taliban would stop Al Qaeda from using Afghanistan to strengthen and rebuild. \c\cBritish Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said that the vacuum could give terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda a safe haven. \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahid Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. After the fall of Herat on 12 August, Khan was detained by the Taliban. On 2 August 2021, President Ghani blamed the advance of the Taliban on the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops and said the former had not cut ties with terrorist organizations and had escalated attacks against women, which the Taliban denied. State-run newspaper The Kabul Times reported that on 9 August, #SanctionPakistan became one of the top Twitter trends in Afghanistan and worldwide, with Afghans holding Pakistan responsible for its support of the Taliban. \c\cTaliban: On 9 July, Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar said in Moscow that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and added that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\c China: Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi criticized the speed and timing of withdrawal of the American-led NATO forces and urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\c Germany: Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Germany would cut off financial aid in case the Taliban imposes Sharia law if they take power in the country. \c\c India: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that India would consult all important parts in the conflict, including China, and that India was pushing for "conciliation in Afghanistan."\c\c Indonesia: Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged all Indonesian nationals to leave Afghanistan. Commission I of the Indonesian parliament also urged the government to be active on mediating both sides of the conflict as a Muslim-majority nation. \c\c Iran: Influential Shia cleric, lawmaker, and politician Mojtaba Zonnour said that the Taliban is "an undeniable part of the reality in Afghanistan", and that it should not be equated to Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIL or al-Qaeda. Grand Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani called trusting Taliban an irreparable error. \c\c Kazakhstan: Kazakh representatives participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Kyrgyzstan: Representatives from the country participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Pakistan: Keeping in view the advancements of Taliban, DG ISPR issued a statement that "Pakistan should be seen as facilitator, not guarantor in Afghan peace process."\c\c Russia: Russian authorities said they were working with the Tajik government to protect it from any foreign threat under the Collective Security Treaty Organization.Russian special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said that the Afghan government only paid lip service to the idea of talks and they were not doing enough to make them happen. He also said that Russia and other regional powers favoured a transitional government in Afghanistan. Taliban representatives visited Moscow in July. Russia's Foreign Ministry called the Taliban "of sound mind". \c\c Tajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon ordered 20,000 reserve servicemen of the country's Ground Forces to be sent to the Afghan–Tajik border. \c\c Turkey: The country offered to order its troops to protect Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \c\c Turkmenistan: Turkmen military forces were assigned to the Afghan–Turkmen border due to security concerns. \c\c United Kingdom: UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, said that the UK will be ready to work with the Taliban should they come into power provided that they adhere to certain international norms. However, Wallace warned that the UK will review any relationship if Taliban were found violating human rights in Afghanistan. In an unusual criticism of his country's American allies, U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace referred to the Doha agreement as "a rotten deal" that "effectively told a Taliban that wasn’t winning that they were winning... We will all, in the international community, probably pay the consequences of that."\c\c United States: President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying that the country had not gone to Afghanistan to "nation build." Biden added that he would not "send another generation of Americans to fight there" and pointed to other failed attempts at unifying Afghanistan in the past. He also assured that the safety of the U.S. was not at risk, regardless of the outcome of the infighting in Afghanistan. On 10 August, Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, told reporters that US was confident that airstrikes were having an effect on the Taliban, but that the American air power alone would not be enough to halt the insurgent offensive. \c\c Uzbekistan: The government raised concerns of a possible migratory crisis due to the infighting in Afghanistan and reported that U.S. authorities had contacted Uzbek officials to confirm if Uzbekistan could safeguard Afghans who collaborated with the U.S., fleeing from the country. In response, the Uzbek government erected a tent city for migrants in the city of Termez. \c\cA joint statement released by twelve nations, including China, India, the US with the UN and EU said that no Afghan government would be recognized if it was established through force.
The 2021 Taliban offensive, also known as the Fall of Afghanistan, is an ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies which began on 1 May 2021, together with the withdrawal of most U.S. and allied troops from Afghanistan. \c\cIn the first three months of the offensive the Taliban made significant advances in the countryside, increasing the number of districts it controlled from 73 to 223, progressively isolating urban centers. Starting on 6 August, the Taliban captured thirty-one of Afghanistan's thirty-four provincial capitals, and by 10 August, the Taliban controlled 65% of the country's area. \c\cThe offensive is noted for the rapid territorial gains of the Taliban, as well as its domestic and international ramifications. On 10 August, U.S. officials estimated that the Afghan capital, Kabul, could fall to the Taliban within 30 to 90 days. On 15 August, the Associated Press reported that the Taliban had reached Kabul and that they were awaiting a "transfer" of power. \c\cIn September 2020, over 5,000 Taliban prisoners, including 400 of whom were accused and convicted of major crimes such as murder, were released by the Afghan government as part of the Doha Agreement between the United States and the Taliban. According to Afghanistan's National Security Council, many of the released prisoners who were "experts" returned to the battlefield and strengthened the Taliban's hand. \c\cIn early 2021, both the Pentagon and Afghan leadership believed into a continuous US support for Kabul. President Biden continuing President Trump's persistent will to move the US away from an endless foreign war where Afghan leadership consistently rely on the US's man power and support, was not anticipated. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 ANSF troops and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by the Taliban. Among the locations captured by the Taliban was Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway to Afghanistan's capital city, Kabul. In terms of equipment, the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces, as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on the ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. Among the dead was Major Sohrab Azimi, son of retired General Zahir Azimi. He was posthumously promoted to brigadier general. Eyewitnesses stated that the language the Taliban militants spoke among themselves was foreign, indicating that the fighters were not from the area. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the U.K., Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan Province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan Province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cIn July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second and third largest cities of Afghanistan, Kandahar and Herat respectively. During the month, 335 Afghan National Security Forces and 189 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,159 Taliban fighters. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves, with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. On 7 July, pro-government forces defeated a Taliban attempt to capture the city of Qala e Naw. On 8 July, the Taliban captured the strategically important Karakh District in Herat Province. \c\cOn 8 July, Afghan soldiers executed an Afghan villager by making him sit on an improvised explosive device (IED) before it exploded. The victim, named Barakatullah, was accused of aiding the Taliban by Afghan police and anti-Taliban militia. The father of Barakatullah denied that his son was working with the Taliban. The incident took place south of the city of Sharana, the capital of Paktika province and the video of the incident was uploaded on TikTok. France 24 Observers team was able to verify and geolocate the video. Fawad Aman, a spokesperson for the Afghan ministry of defence, denied that any such incident took place. An Afghan journalist, Naseeb Zadran, said that this not an isolated incident and reflects the impunity enjoyed by Afghan army. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. The border crossings of Torghundi with Turkmenistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. On 11 July, Australian Defence Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force; Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed there while covering the fighting two days later. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Taliban from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban. Lyons implored both sides to protect civilians as she says that women and children are being killed. The same day around 46 Afghan troops, including 5 officers, sought refuge in Pakistan after they were unable to defend their military post. \c\cOn 28 July, a delegation from the Taliban met in Tianjin with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who pledged the People's Republic of China's support for the Taliban on the condition that they cut ties with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, vowing to "bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream" and offering to host peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. \c\cBy 31 July, the Taliban had entered the provincial capitals of both Helmand and Herat provinces, capturing scores of districts in said provinces and capturing border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan. Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions. On 3 August 40 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in the fighting. After capturing Lashkar Gah's radio station, the Taliban began broadcasting their Voice of Sharia programming. The rebels also began to attack the city's airport. Meanwhile, the government dispatched reinforcements to prevent the city from falling to the insurgents. \c\cOn 3 August 13 people—including five attackers—were killed in a Taliban bombing and shootout in Kabul. The inghimasi-style operation, carried out by the Taliban's "Martyrdom Battalion", aimed at killing Defence Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi; he survived the attack. Mohammadi was described by the Long War Journal as one of the key government figures responsible for countering the Taliban offensive. \c\cAs of 5 August, 115 Afghan National Security Forces personnel and 58 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,197 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. \c\cOn 6 August, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul. On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion. The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape. As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had "sold" the city to the Taliban. Social media posts suggested that the Taliban were welcomed by some residents of the city which has a long history of lawlessness. Images appearing on social media showed Taliban fighters driving captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs and pickups through the streets while flying Taliban flags as local residents—mostly youths and young men—cheered them on. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \'deadlier phase\' of the war. The governments of Britain and United States warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan "immediately" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation. \c\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ex-warlord and the strongman who had traditionally dominated the city, took his followers and fled to Khwaja Du Koh District, the only area in Jowzjan Province which was still government-held. Meanwhile, pro-government forces had been reduced to a pocket of resistance in Lashkar Gah, while Kandahar and Herat remained fiercely contested. Insurgents also launched repeated raids on the other provincial capitals. On the same day, U.S. B-52 bombers carried out airstrikes against Taliban in Afghanistan, operating from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The United States was also using armed Reaper drones and AC-130 Spectre gunships which reportedly began daily attacks against targets around Kandahar, Herat, and Lashkar Gah. The remaining ground defense of Lashkar Gah and Kandahar was mostly organized by hundreds of Afghan Commandos who had become encircled by the insurgents; as these soldiers were the Afghan military's best-trained and most highly motivated troops, the Long War Journal argued that their loss would be a major setback in regards to the Afghan security forces\' future effectiveness. USS Ronald Reagan was launching fast jets to provide support to the missions. The American Embassy in Kabul urged all Americans to leave the country immediately due to increased security concerns, and the inability of the embassy to guarantee the safety of American citizens due to the reduction of staff at the embassy. \c\cThe following day, the Taliban captured the cities of Kunduz and Sar-e Pol after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces. In the battles for the two cities, mass desertions were reported, as many Afghan National Army soldiers had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance as well as Taliban propaganda. Pro-government forces were only able to hold onto Kunduz's military base and airport. Reporters described the capture of Kunduz as "the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May" with the city being one of Afghanistan's largest settlements, well connected to other notable locations in the country including Kabul and considered part of a major Central Asian drug smuggling route. The battle for Kunduz involved the Red Unit, the Taliban elite shock troops, and resulted in the release of hundreds of prisoners including Taliban commanders. The city of Taloqan was also taken by the Taliban late 8 August, making it the fifth provincial capital to fall. Government forces retreated from the city after noon, retaking Warsaj District and Farkhar District. \c\cOn 9 August, the Taliban captured Aybak, the capital of Samangan province. Deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told the AFP news agency that government forces had withdrawn from the city without a fight after community representatives had requested that it be spared more violence. On the same day, Asif Azimi, a former senator from Samangan and a prominent warlord from the Jamiat-e Islami party, defected to the Taliban. Azimi said hundreds of men under his command had also defected to the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani and other political leaders also agreed to form a joint command center to coordinate and assist with public uprising forces. \c\cFighting intensified around Mazar-i-Sharif on 10 August. In Farah, capital of Farah Province, the Taliban had taken control of the governor's compound after heavy fighting between the Taliban and government forces. They had also taken control of the police headquarters and prison. Although heavy fighting continued, Farah became the seventh provincial capital to fall. An eighth provincial capital, Puli Khumri of Baghlan Province, was also captured on 10 August. \c\cOn 11 August, Fayzabad of Badakhshan Province became the ninth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban. After the Taliban reached the city gates, government forces decided to retreat to Farkhar District and join with security forces there from Taloqan's fall. Prior to the U.S. invasion, Fayzabad had been the headquarters of the Northern Alliance. On the same day, the Taliban captured Kunduz Airport and a major military base belonging to 217 Pamir Corps after hundreds of Afghan troops surrendered, securing Taliban control over their military equipment in Kunduz. The military base was responsible for security of Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan and was one of the eight such installations in Afghanistan; its fall further reduced the suffering morale of the Afghan National Army, while effectively making a government counter-offensive to relieve Mazar-i-Sharif impossible. Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) quoted two local councillors who said that the entire 217th Pamir Corps surrendered to Taliban forces in Kunduz. A Taliban spokesman also posted a video on Twitter which purportedly showed government soldiers joining the militants\' ranks. The besieged troops of the 217 Pamir Corps had held out for three days before surrendering; much military equipment was captured by the rebels at the base and airport. Additionally, the day saw General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai's replacement by General Haibatullah Alizai as the new Afghan Army chief of staff. The outgoing General Ahmadzai served as an Afghan army chief of staff since he assumed the post in June 2021. \c\cOn 12 August, the Taliban captured the city of Ghazni, making it the tenth provincial capital to fall within a week. The city lies along the Kabul–Kandahar Highway, serving as a gateway between Kabul and the strongholds in the south. The Governor of Ghazni Province was soon arrested in Wardak for "surrendering without a fight" in exchange for safe passage. On the same day, the central government offered a proposal of "power-sharing" in lieu of ceasefire; the Taliban rejected this offer stating that it wanted to establish a new Islamic emirate. The same day also saw the fall of strategic Shindand Air Base in Herat and capture of two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters stationed in the Air Base. Late that night, Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city and the capital of the eponymous province, fell to the Taliban. The fall of Herat, after two weeks of siege, forced Ismail Khan and other top government officials and forces to seek refuge at a provincial airport and the army corps outside the city. In the morning, Khan along with Abdul Rahman Rahman, deputy interior minister, and Hasib Sediqi, Chief of National Directorate of Security in Herat, surrendered to the Taliban. The commander of 207 Zafar Corps, Khyal Nabi Ahmadzai, and thousands of government forces also surrendered to the Taliban. According to the local officials, an entire Afghan army Corps in the city of Herat crumbled. By this point, they controlled 11 of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals. The Taliban had also launched an assault on Qala e Naw, capturing the city after failing to do so in July. \c\cOvernight, Kandahar was captured by the Taliban: heavy clashing around the city led to the withdrawal of the ANA, thus increasing the number of provincial capitals controlled by the Taliban to thirteen. \c\cA few hours after the fall of Herat, the U.S. and the U.K. governments announced the deployment of 3,000 and 600 of their troops respectively to the Kabul airport, in order to secure the airlifting of their nationals, embassy staff and the Afghan civilians who worked with the coalition forces out of the country. Officials said that the first deployment would occur in the next 24 to 48 hours, and that it would be completed by the end of the month. According to said sources the plan is to use charter aircraft for the evacuation using the Kabul airport which is still open with commercial airliners flying, however that military aircraft will be used if that becomes impossible. According to the British government, the evacuation and its timing had long been planned, while an Afghan official said that the timing was brought forward as the security situation rapidly deteriorated. In addition to the 3,000 U.S troops, an additional 3,500 will be on standby in Kuwait in case the situation escalates to an armed conflict with the Taliban. Canada announced that Canadian special forces units will be deployed to evacuate embassy personnel in Kabul, which houses Afghan families who have worked with Canadian staff in the past. The Danish and Norwegian governments announced their embassies in Kabul will be closed due to security reasons and will make plans to evacuate their diplomatic staff and Afghans who worked alongside them. \c\cAfter several weeks of fighting in the Battle of Lashkargah, the city of Lashkargah, capital of Helmand Province, was captured by the Taliban on 13 August. On the same day, the Taliban took control of Chaghcharan (also called Firozkoh), the capital city of Ghor Province. Officials said the city fell without any fighting, becoming the fifteenth provincial capital to fall to the Taliban within a week. Firozkoh has a population of nearly 132,000 people. Later on 13 August, the Taliban captured Puli Alam, Qalat and Tarinkot, the provincial capitals of Logar, Zabul and Uruzgan provinces respectively. Government loyalists put up a determined defense in Logar before being overrun, while Zabul and Uruzgan were only surrendered to the rebels after the local defenders judged their situation to be untenable and opted to retreat. In contrast, Qalat and Fayroz Koh fell without any fighting. Qalat had been deprived of defenders who had been sent to Kandahar, and Fayroz Koh officials preferred to negiotiate a takeover instead of being "steamrolled by the Taliban offensive". The Long War Journal argued that the fall of these provincial capitals allowed the Taliban to besiege Kabul, and described the Afghan government as being on the "verge of collapse". \c\cOn 14 August 2021, the Taliban captured seven provincial capital cities; Gardez, Sharana, Asadabad, Maymana, Mihtarlam, Nili, and Mazar-i-Sharif, the fourth-largest city in Afganistan. Two long-time anti-Taliban warlords, namely Dostum and Atta Muhammad Nur, fled to Uzbekistan. Abas Ebrahimzada, a lawmaker from the Balkh province, said that in Mazar-i-Sharif, the national army surrendered first which caused the pro-government militia and other forces to lose morale and surrender in the face of Taliban assault on the city. Following the loss of the city, Atta Muhammad Nur stated in a Facebook post that his defeat in Mazar-i-Sharif was planned and held the government forces responsible for the defeat. He did not specify who was behind the conspiracy, nor provide any detail other then saying that he and Dostum are in a safe place. Later, Taliban forces also entered Maidan Shar, center of Maidan Wardak Province. At this point, the rebels had encircled Kabul, while the Afghan National Army had descended into chaos following its rapid defeat across the country. Only the 201st Corps and 111th Division, both based at the Afghan capital, were left operational. \c\cEarly on 15 August 2021, the Taliban entered Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar Province, unopposed. It was the twenty-sixth provincial capital to fall, and its capture left Kabul as the last major city under Afghan government control. Soon afterward, Maidan Shar, Khost, Bamyan, Mahmud-i-Raqi, and Charikar also fell. \c\cOn the same day, authorities in Uzbekistan detained 84 Afghan soldiers who had crossed the border, and provided medical aid to both the detained soldiers and a group of soldiers which had gathered on the Afghan side of the Termez-Khairaton bridge. \c\cThe same day, 15 August, despite issuing a statement saying "it has no plans to take the Afghan capital \'by force\'", the Taliban entered the outskirts of Kabul from multiple directions, including Kalakan District, Qarabagh District, and Paghman District. A citywide blackout and possible assault and inmate uprising at Pul-e-Charkhi prison was reported. Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters began landing at the American embassy in Kabul to carry out evacuations and diplomats were reported to be rapidly shredding classified documents. \c\cThe Afghan interior ministry said in a statement that the Afghan president Ghani has decided to relinquish power and an interim government led by the Taliban will be formed. Meanwhile, security forces surrendered Bagram Airfield to the Taliban; the airbase houses around 5,000 Taliban and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant prisoners. \c\cLater in the day, it was announced that former president Hamid Karzai was part of the negotiations team and that President Ghani announced his intent to step down. Also, the Taliban ordered its fighters to wait for a peaceful transfer of power and to not enter Kabul by force. \c\cCorrupt Afghan army officers leading ghost battalions, who pocket the salaries of absent soldiers, is a known issue in the Afghan military. In a 2016 report, the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said “neither the United States nor its Afghan allies know how many Afghan soldiers and police actually exist, how many are in fact available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capabilities”. In early 2019, at least 42,000 ghost soldiers were removed from the army's payroll. \c\cOn July 30th, SIGAR said there were "corrosive effects of corruption within the ANDSF, inaccuracies on the actual strength of the Afghan forces, lack of combat readiness, will to fight, unsustainability due to dependencies on advanced equipment, lack of focus on ministerial-level capabilities, and lack of critical information, such as assessments of district control, that could be used to help measure the ANDSF’s performance in recent years."\c\cOn 12 August, International counter-terrorism experts and some U.S. officials said that the Afghan National Security Forces\' (ANSF) swift collapse in case of a U.S. withdrawal "should come as no surprise". According to an expert, the Taliban had been able to move their forces freely throughout Afghanistan after the Doha Agreement with almost no intervention from the Afghan government forces. On the same day, former U.S. adviser Vali Nasr, said that there was "no kind of leadership that would give local warlords reasons for why they should resist the Taliban. So the more they see the Taliban victory is inevitable, the more the victory becomes inevitable, because they just cut their own deals with them". \c\cSince 2 July, U.S. withdrawal from the Bagram Airfield, U.S. airstrikes against the Taliban have been led from outside of Afghanistan, from the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and the U.S. Navy carrier strike group in the Persian Gulf, requiring the warplanes to travel several hours to reach their targets. According to a U.S. defence official, the airstrikes since 2 July amounted to only "a handful" each day. \c\cAccording to a U.S. defense official, the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of U.S. military forces could create an opening for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups to reorganize. The official added that, while the U.S. would still maintain authority to strike Al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan, the lack of a robust U.S. presence on the ground would hamper the ability to identify potential targets. The CENTCOM commander General McKenzie said that he has not seen anything that would make him believe the Taliban would stop Al Qaeda from using Afghanistan to strengthen and rebuild. \c\cBritish Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said that the vacuum could give terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda a safe haven. \c\cOn 8 August, the head of extremist monitoring group SITE, Rita Katz, said that the Taliban advance resembled the earlier days of the Syrian civil war amid Nusra Front's victories, "except now on a completely different scale, given the Taliban's horrifying momentum". \c\cOn 23 June, the United States Intelligence Community estimated that the Afghan government could fall within the next six months following the U.S. withdrawal. On 10 August, U.S. officials revised the previous six month estimate, saying that it could happen much more quickly, and that some scenarios envisioned the fall of Kabul within 30 to 90 days. On 13 August, reports appeared that "senior western diplomatic sources" expected the Taliban to enter Kabul within the next seven days. \c\cOn 8 July, U.S. President Joe Biden speaking to reporters in a press conference, said that a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is not inevitable, stating, "the Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped — as well-equipped as any army in the world — and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban." The President said that the U.S. intelligence community have not assessed that the Afghan government would likely collapse. When asked about whether there were parallels between this withdrawal and what happened in Vietnam, the President replied "None whatsoever.  Zero.  What you had is — you had entire brigades breaking through the gates of our embassy — six, if I’m not mistaken. The Taliban is not the south — the North Vietnamese army. They’re not — they’re not remotely comparable in terms of capability.  There’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a embassy in the — of the United States from Afghanistan.  It is not at all comparable." Biden added that "...the likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely."\c\cOn July 11, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that the ANDSF “have much more capacity than they’ve ever had before” and, “they know how to defend their country. On 9 August, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko stated that the U.S. military command "knew how bad the Afghan military was". \c\cOn 12 August, U.S. officials said that the surprise speed of the Taliban offensive was connected to both structural and political issues, such as early under-investment in local governments, lack of sufficient nation building, societal structures in clans, topography, ghost soldiers and unequal troops quality[clarification needed], as well as the recent peace agreement and Taliban prisoners amnesty. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cAndrew Watkins, senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group, said there was no evidence that the Taliban had increased their manpower to conduct this offensive, aside from utilising some of the 5,000 insurgents who were released earlier. Watkins believes that the end of US airstrikes changed the scenario. He says that the end of US airstrikes granted the insurgents with freedom of movement and they were able regroup, plan, strengthen their supply lines, without fear of US airstrikes. \c\cAccording to an open-source investigative report published at the Oryx blog by Stijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans, the Taliban captured twelve tanks (seven T-54s and five T-62s), fifty-one armoured fighting vehicles (forty-six M1117 ASVs, two M1117 Command & Controls and three M113 APCs), sixty-one artilleries and mortars (thirty-five 122mm D-30 howitzers, three 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)s, one 120mm mortar, two 82mm M69 mortars, one 60mm mortar and nineteen mortars of unknown origin), eight anti-aircraft guns (two 14.5mm KPV-1s and six 23mm ZU-23s), ten helicopters (nine Mil Mi-17s, one Mil Mi-24V, four UH-60A BlackHawks and two MD 530Fs), six unmanned aerial vehicles (six Boeing Insitu ScanEagles), and 1,973 trucks, vehicles and jeeps from the Afghan armed forces. During the same period,[when?] the Taliban also destroyed nine M1117 ASVs, four Mi-17s and three UH-60A BlackHawks, one DJI Mavic and 104 trucks, vehicles and jeeps. Oryx only counts destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available. \c\cSince 2 July, US forces conducted multiple airstrikes targeting military equipment captured by the insurgents. US airstrikes destroyed multiple D30 artillery pieces, multiple tanks, MRAPs and Humvees that the Taliban had captured from Afghan security forces. \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahid Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. After the fall of Herat on 12 August, Khan was detained by the Taliban. On 2 August 2021, President Ghani blamed the advance of the Taliban on the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops and said the former had not cut ties with terrorist organizations and had escalated attacks against women, which the Taliban denied. State-run newspaper The Kabul Times reported that on 9 August, #SanctionPakistan became one of the top Twitter trends in Afghanistan and worldwide, with Afghans holding Pakistan responsible for its support of the Taliban. \c\cTaliban: On 9 July, Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar said in Moscow that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and added that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\c China: Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi criticized the speed and timing of withdrawal of the American-led NATO forces and urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\c Germany: Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Germany would cut off financial aid in case the Taliban imposes Sharia law if they take power in the country. \c\c India: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that India would consult all important parts in the conflict, including China, and that India was pushing for "conciliation in Afghanistan."\c\c Indonesia: Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged all Indonesian nationals to leave Afghanistan. Commission I of the Indonesian parliament also urged the government to be active on mediating both sides of the conflict as a Muslim-majority nation. \c\c Iran: Influential Shia cleric, lawmaker, and politician Mojtaba Zonnour said that the Taliban is "an undeniable part of the reality in Afghanistan", and that it should not be equated to Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIL or al-Qaeda. Grand Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani called trusting the Taliban an irreparable error. \c\c Kazakhstan: Kazakh representatives participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Kyrgyzstan: Representatives from the country participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Pakistan: Keeping in view the advancements of Taliban, DG ISPR issued a statement that "Pakistan should be seen as facilitator, not guarantor in Afghan peace process."\c\c Philippines: The Philippine embassy in Pakistan, which exercises jurisdiction over Afghanistan, has reached out to Filipinos to ascertain their security situation and to advise them on the proper course of action. The Department of Foreign Affairs said the embassy has gathered some 75 individuals for repatriation, with more expected to join the list in the coming days. Joseph Glenn Gumpal, president of Samahang Pilipino sa Afghanistan (Organization of Filipinos in Afghanistan), the Filipino expatriate community in Afghanistan, said that there are planned repatriation flights from 22 August to 24 August. There are at least 171 registered overseas Filipino workers in Afghanistan that are employed by 33 companies running the gamut from defense contractors to telecommunication firms. \c\c Russia: Russian authorities said they were working with the Tajik government to protect it from any foreign threat under the Collective Security Treaty Organization.Russian special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said that the Afghan government only paid lip service to the idea of talks and they were not doing enough to make them happen. He also said that Russia and other regional powers favoured a transitional government in Afghanistan. Taliban representatives visited Moscow in July. Russia's Foreign Ministry called the Taliban "of sound mind". \c\c Tajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon ordered 20,000 reserve servicemen of the country's Ground Forces to be sent to the Afghan–Tajik border. \c\c Turkey: The country offered to order its troops to protect Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \c\c Turkmenistan: Turkmen military forces were assigned to the Afghan–Turkmen border due to security concerns. \c\c United Kingdom: UK defence minister Ben Wallace said that the UK will be ready to work with the Taliban should they come into power provided that they adhere to certain international norms. However, Wallace warned that the UK will review any relationship if Taliban were found violating human rights in Afghanistan. In an unusual criticism of his country's American allies, U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace referred to the Doha agreement as "a rotten deal" that "effectively told a Taliban that wasn’t winning that they were winning... We will all, in the international community, probably pay the consequences of that."\c\c United States: President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying that the country had not gone to Afghanistan to "nation build". Biden added that he would not "send another generation of Americans to fight there" and pointed to other failed attempts at unifying Afghanistan in the past. He also assured that the safety of the U.S. was not at risk, regardless of the outcome of the infighting in Afghanistan. On 10 August, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters that US was confident that airstrikes were having an effect on the Taliban, but that the American air power alone would not be enough to halt the insurgent offensive. \c\c Uzbekistan: The government raised concerns of a possible migratory crisis due to the infighting in Afghanistan and reported that U.S. authorities had contacted Uzbek officials to confirm if Uzbekistan could safeguard Afghans who collaborated with the U.S., fleeing from the country. In response, the Uzbek government erected a tent city for migrants in the city of Termez. \c\cA joint statement released by twelve nations, including China, India, the US with the UN and EU said that no Afghan government would be recognized if it was established through force.
A federal election will take place on Sepetmber 20, 2021, to elect members of the House of Commons to the 44th Canadian Parliament. The latest possible date of the vote is determined by the fixed-date provisions of the Canada Elections Act, which requires federal elections to be held on the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year after the polling day of the previous election. Since the current government is a minority government, the election has been before the scheduled date if Parliament is dissolved by the Governor General of Canada due to a motion of no confidence in the government or at the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada for a snap election. A by-election in Haldimand-Norfolk was cancelled because of the election call. \c\cThe 2019 federal election resulted in the Liberals, led by incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, losing their majority but winning the most seats.

An ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies began on 1 May 2021, together with the withdrawal of most U.S. and allied troops from Afghanistan. \c\cIn the first three months of the offensive the Taliban made significant advances in the countryside, increasing the number of districts it controls from 73 to 223, progressively isolating urban centers. Starting on 6 August, the Taliban captured thirty of Afghanistan's thirty-four provincial capitals, and by 10 August, the Taliban controlled 65% of the country's area. \c\cThe offensive is noted for the rapid territorial gains of the Taliban, as well as its domestic and international ramifications. On 10 August, U.S. officials estimated that the Afghan capital, Kabul, could fall to the Taliban within 30 to 90 days. On 15 August, the Associated Press reported that the Taliban had reached Kabul and that they were awaiting a "transfer" of power. \c\cIn September 2020, over 5,000 Taliban prisoners, including 400 of whom were accused and convicted of major crimes such as murder, were released by the Afghan government as part of the Doha Agreement between the United States and the Taliban. According to Afghanistan's National Security Council, many of the released prisoners who were "experts" returned to the battlefield and strengthened the Taliban's hand. \c\cInternational counter-terrorism experts and some U.S. officials said that the Afghan National Security Forces\' (ANSF) swift collapse in case of a U.S. withdrawal "should come as no surprise". According to an expert, the Taliban had been able to move their forces freely throughout Afghanistan after the Doha Agreement with almost no intervention from the Afghan government forces. \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 ANSF troops and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by the Taliban. Among the locations captured by the Taliban was Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway to Afghanistan's capital city, Kabul. In terms of equipment, the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces, as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on the ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. Among the dead was Major Sohrab Azimi, son of retired General Zahir Azimi. He was posthumously promoted to brigadier general. Eyewitnesses stated that the language the Taliban militants spoke among themselves was foreign, indicating that the fighters were not from the area. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the U.K., Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed]\c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan Province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan Province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. \c\cIn July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second and third largest cities of Afghanistan, Kandahar and Herat respectively. During the month, 335 Afghan National Security Forces and 189 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,159 Taliban fighters. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves, with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. On 7 July, pro-government forces defeated a Taliban attempt to capture the city of Qala e Naw. On 8 July, the Taliban captured the strategically important Karakh District in Herat Province. \c\cOn 8 July, Afghan soldiers executed an Afghan villager by making him sit on an improvised explosive device (IED) before it exploded. The victim, named Barakatullah, was accused of aiding the Taliban by Afghan police and anti-Taliban militia. The father of Barakatullah denied that his son was working with the Taliban. The incident took place south of the city of Sharana, the capital of Paktika province and the video of the incident was uploaded on TikTok. France 24 Observers team was able to verify and geolocate the video. Fawad Aman, a spokesperson for the Afghan ministry of defence, denied that any such incident took place. An Afghan journalist, Naseeb Zadran, said that this not an isolated incident and reflects the impunity enjoyed by Afghan army. \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. The border crossings of Torghundi with Turkmenistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. On 11 July, Australian Defence Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force; Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed there while covering the fighting two days later. \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Taliban from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban. Lyons implored both sides to protect civilians as she says that women and children are being killed. The same day around 46 Afghan troops, including 5 officers, sought refuge in Pakistan after they were unable to defend their military post. \c\cOn 28 July, a delegation from the Taliban met in Tianjin with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who pledged the People's Republic of China's support for the Taliban on the condition that they cut ties with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, vowing to "bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream" and offering to host peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. \c\cBy 31 July, the Taliban had entered the provincial capitals of both Helmand and Herat provinces, capturing scores of districts in said provinces and capturing border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan. Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions. On 3 August 40 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in the fighting. After capturing Lashkar Gah's radio station, the Taliban began broadcasting their Voice of Sharia programming. The rebels also began to attack the city's airport. Meanwhile, the government dispatched reinforcements to prevent the city from falling to the insurgents. \c\cOn 3 August 13 people—including five attackers—were killed in a Taliban bombing and shootout in Kabul. The inghimasi-style operation, carried out by the Taliban's "Martyrdom Battalion", aimed at killing Defence Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi; he survived the attack. Mohammadi was described by the Long War Journal as one of the key government figures responsible for countering the Taliban offensive. \c\cAs of 5 August, 115 Afghan National Security Forces personnel and 58 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,197 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. \c\cOn 6 August, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul. On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion. The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape. As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had "sold" the city to the Taliban. Social media posts suggested that the Taliban were welcomed by some residents of the city which has a long history of lawlessness. Images appearing on social media showed Taliban fighters driving captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs and pickups through the streets while flying Taliban flags as local residents—mostly youths and young men—cheered them on. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \'deadlier phase\' of the war. The governments of Britain and United States warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan "immediately" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation. \c\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ex-warlord and the strongman who had traditionally dominated the city, took his followers and fled to Khwaja Du Koh District, the only area in Jowzjan Province which was still government-held. Meanwhile, pro-government forces had been reduced to a pocket of resistance in Lashkar Gah, while Kandahar and Herat remained fiercely contested. Insurgents also launched repeated raids on the other provincial capitals. On the same day, U.S. B-52 bombers carried out airstrikes against Taliban in Afghanistan, operating from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The United States was also using armed Reaper drones and AC-130 Spectre gunships which reportedly began daily attacks against targets around Kandahar, Herat, and Lashkar Gah. The remaining ground defense of Lashkar Gah and Kandahar was mostly organized by hundreds of Afghan Commandos who had become encircled by the insurgents; as these soldiers were the Afghan military's best-trained and most highly motivated troops, the Long War Journal argued that their loss would be a major setback in regards to the Afghan security forces\' future effectiveness. USS Ronald Reagan was launching fast jets to provide support to the missions. The American Embassy in Kabul urged all Americans to leave the country immediately due to increased security concerns, and the inability of the embassy to guarantee the safety of American citizens due to the reduction of staff at the embassy. \c\cThe following day, the Taliban captured the cities of Kunduz and Sar-e Pol after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces. In the battles for the two cities, mass desertions were reported, as many Afghan National Army soldiers had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance as well as Taliban propaganda. Pro-government forces were only able to hold onto Kunduz's military base and airport. Reporters described the capture of Kunduz as "the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May" with the city being one of Afghanistan's largest settlements, well connected to other notable locations in the country including Kabul and considered part of a major Central Asian drug smuggling route. The battle for Kunduz involved the Red Unit, the Taliban elite shock troops, and resulted in the release of hundreds of prisoners including Taliban commanders. The city of Taloqan was also taken by the Taliban late 8 August, making it the fifth provincial capital to fall. Government forces retreated from the city after noon, retaking Warsaj District and Farkhar District. \c\cOn 9 August, the Taliban captured Aybak, the capital of Samangan province. Deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told the AFP news agency that government forces had withdrawn from the city without a fight after community representatives had requested that it be spared more violence. On the same day, Asif Azimi, a former senator from Samangan and a prominent warlord from the Jamiat-e Islami party, defected to the Taliban. Azimi said hundreds of men under his command had also defected to the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani and other political leaders also agreed to form a joint command center to coordinate and assist with public uprising forces. \c\cFighting intensified around Mazar-i-Sharif on 10 August. In Farah, capital of Farah Province, the Taliban had taken control of the governor's compound after heavy fighting between the Taliban and government forces. They had also taken control of the police headquarters and prison. Although heavy fighting continued, Farah became the seventh provincial capital to fall. An eighth provincial capital, Puli Khumri of Baghlan Province, was also captured on 10 August. \c\cOn 11 August, Fayzabad of Badakhshan Province became the ninth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban. After the Taliban reached the city gates, government forces decided to retreat to Farkhar District and join with security forces there from Taloqan's fall. Prior to the U.S. invasion, Fayzabad had been the headquarters of the Northern Alliance. On the same day, the Taliban captured Kunduz Airport and a major military base belonging to 217 Pamir Corps after hundreds of Afghan troops surrendered, securing Taliban control over their military equipment in Kunduz. The military base was responsible for security of Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan and was one of the eight such installations in Afghanistan; its fall further reduced the suffering morale of the Afghan National Army, while effectively making a government counter-offensive to relieve Mazar-i-Sharif impossible. Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) quoted two local councillors who said that the entire 217th Pamir Corps surrendered to Taliban forces in Kunduz. A Taliban spokesman also posted a video on Twitter which purportedly showed government soldiers joining the militants\' ranks. The besieged troops of the 217 Pamir Corps had held out for three days before surrendering; much military equipment was captured by the rebels at the base and airport. Additionally, the day saw General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai's replacement by General Haibatullah Alizai as the new Afghan Army chief of staff. The outgoing General Ahmadzai served as an Afghan army chief of staff since he assumed the post in June 2021. \c\cOn 12 August, the Taliban captured the city of Ghazni, making it the tenth provincial capital to fall within a week. The city lies along the Kabul–Kandahar Highway, serving as a gateway between Kabul and the strongholds in the south. The Governor of Ghazni Province was soon arrested in Wardak for "surrendering without a fight" in exchange for safe passage. On the same day, the central government offered a proposal of "power-sharing" in lieu of ceasefire; the Taliban rejected this offer stating that it wanted to establish a new Islamic emirate. The same day also saw the fall of strategic Shindand Air Base in Herat and capture of two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters stationed in the Air Base. Late that night, Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city and the capital of the eponymous province, fell to the Taliban. The fall of Herat, after two weeks of siege, forced Ismail Khan and other top government officials and forces to seek refuge at a provincial airport and the army corps outside the city. In the morning, Khan along with Abdul Rahman Rahman, deputy interior minister, and Hasib Sediqi, Chief of National Directorate of Security in Herat, surrendered to the Taliban. The commander of 207 Zafar Corps, Khyal Nabi Ahmadzai, and thousands of government forces also surrendered to the Taliban. According to the local officials, an entire Afghan army Corps in the city of Herat crumbled. By this point, they controlled 11 of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals. The Taliban had also launched an assault on Qala e Naw, capturing the city after failing to do so in July. \c\cOvernight, Kandahar was captured by the Taliban: heavy clashing around the city led to the withdrawal of the ANA, thus increasing the number of provincial capitals controlled by the Taliban to thirteen. \c\cA few hours after the fall of Herat, the U.S. and the U.K. governments announced the deployment of 3,000 and 600 of their troops respectively to the Kabul airport, in order to secure the airlifting of their nationals, embassy staff and the Afghan civilians who worked with the coalition forces out of the country. Officials said that the first deployment would occur in the next 24 to 48 hours, and that it would be completed by the end of the month. According to said sources the plan is to use charter aircraft for the evacuation using the Kabul airport which is still open with commercial airliners flying, however that military aircraft will be used if that becomes impossible. According to the British government, the evacuation and its timing had long been planned, while an Afghan official said that the timing was brought forward as the security situation rapidly deteriorated. In addition to the 3,000 U.S troops, an additional 3,500 will be on standby in Kuwait in case the situation escalates to an armed conflict with the Taliban. Canada announced that Canadian special forces units will be deployed to evacuate embassy personnel in Kabul, which houses Afghan families who have worked with Canadian staff in the past. The Danish and Norwegian governments announced their embassies in Kabul will be closed due to security reasons and will make plans to evacuate their diplomatic staff and Afghans who worked alongside them. \c\cAfter several weeks of fighting in the Battle of Lashkargah, the city of Lashkargah, capital of Helmand Province, was captured by the Taliban on 13 August. On the same day, the Taliban took control of Chaghcharan (also called Firozkoh), the capital city of Ghor Province. Officials said the city fell without any fighting, becoming the fifteenth provincial capital to fall to the Taliban within a week. Firozkoh has a population of nearly 132,000 people. Later on 13 August, the Taliban captured Puli Alam, Qalat and Tarinkot, the provincial capitals of Logar, Zabul and Uruzgan provinces respectively. Government loyalists put up a determined defense in Logar before being overrun, while Zabul and Uruzgan were only surrendered to the rebels after the local defenders judged their situation to be untenable and opted to retreat. In contrast, Qalat and Fayroz Koh fell without any fighting. Qalat had been deprived of defenders who had been sent to Kandahar, and Fayroz Koh officials preferred to negiotiate a takeover instead of being "steamrolled by the Taliban offensive". The Long War Journal argued that the fall of these provincial capitals allowed the Taliban to besiege Kabul, and described the Afghan government as being on the "verge of collapse". \c\cOn 14 August 2021, the Taliban captured seven provincial capital cities; Gardez, Sharana, Asadabad, Maymana, Mihtarlam, Nili, and Mazar-i-Sharif, the fourth-largest city in Afganistan. Two long-time anti-Taliban warlords, namely Dostum and Atta Muhammad Nur, fled to Uzbekistan. Abas Ebrahimzada, a lawmaker from the Balkh province, said that in Mazar-i-Sharif, the national army surrendered first which caused the pro-government militia and other forces to loose morale and surrender in the face of Taliban assault on the city. Following the loss of the city, Atta Muhammad Nur stated in a Facebook post that his defeat in Mazar-i-Sharif was planned and held the government forces responsible for the defeat. He did not specify who was behind the conspiracy, nor provide any detail other then saying that he and Dostum are in a safe place. Later, Taliban forces also entered Maidan Shar, center of Maidan Wardak Province. At this point, the rebels had encircled Kabul, while the Afghan National Army had descended into chaos following its rapid defeat across the country. Only the 201st Corps and 111th Division, both based at the Afghan capital, were left operational. \c\cEarly on 15 August 2021, the Taliban entered Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar Province, unopposed, It was the twenty-sixth provincial capital to fall, and its capture left Kabul as the last major city under Afghan government control. Soon afterward, Maidan Shar fell, as well as Khost, Bamyan, and Mahmud-i-Raqi. \c\cOn the same day, authorities in Uzbekistan detained 84 Afghan soldiers who had crossed the border, and provided medical aid to both the detained soldiers and a group of soldiers which had gathered on the Afghan side of the Termez-Khairaton bridge. \c\cThe same day, 15 August, despite issuing a statement saying "it has no plans to take the Afghan capital “by force,” as the Taliban entered the outskirts of Kabul from multiple directions, including Kalakan District, Qarabagh District, and Paghman District. A citywide blackout and possible assault and inmate uprising at Pul-e-Charkhi prison was reported. Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters begun landing at the American embassy in Kabul to carry out evacuations and diplomats were reported to be rapidly shredding classified documents. \c\cThe Afghan interior ministry in a statement said the Afghan president Ghani decided to relinquish power and an interim government led by Taliban will be formed. Meanwhile, security forces surrendered Bagram Airfield to the Taliban; the airbase houses around 5,000 Taliban and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant prisoners. \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \c\cOn 23 June, the United States Intelligence Community estimated that the Afghan government could fall within the next six months following the U.S. withdrawal. On 10 August, U.S. officials revised the previous six month estimate, saying that it could happen much more quickly, and that some scenarios envisioned the fall of Kabul within 30 to 90 days. On 13 August, reports appeared that "senior western diplomatic sources" expected the Taliban to enter Kabul within the next seven days. \c\cOn 8 August, the head of extremist monitoring group SITE, Rita Katz, said that the Taliban advance resembled the earlier days of the Syrian civil war amid Nusra Front's victories, "except now on a completely different scale, given the Taliban's horrifying momentum". \c\cAndrew Watkins, senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group, said there was no evidence that the Taliban had increased their manpower to conduct this offensive, aside from utilising some of the 5,000 insurgents who were released earlier. Watkins believes that the end of US airstrikes changed the scenario. He says that the end of US airstrikes granted the insurgents with freedom of movement and they were able regroup, plan, strengthen their supply lines, without fear of US airstrikes. \c\cOfficers corruption leading ghost battalion with large part of the unit actually not present while the officer pockets their salaries is a known issue in Afghanistan military. In a 2016 report, the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) claimed “neither the United States nor its Afghan allies know how many Afghan soldiers and police actually exist, how many are in fact available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capabilities”. In early 2019, at least 42,000 ghost soldiers where removed from the army's payroll. \c\cIn early 2021, both the Pentagon and Afghan leadership believed into a continuous US support for Kabul. Biden persistent will to move the US away from an endless foreign war where local leadership consistently rely on the US's man power and support, was not anticipated. Despite US encouragement as a last resort strategy, Afghan leadership did no reinforce urban centers with defense lines. Without US support, the credibility of the central Afghan government collapsed and poorly supported front line soldiers walked away. \c\cOn July 30th, 2021, SIGAR reported :\c\cOn 9 August, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko stated that the U.S. military command "knew how bad the Afghan military was". \c\cOn 12 August, U.S. officials said that the surprise speed of the Taliban offensive was connected to both structural and political issues, such as early under-investment in local governments, lack of sufficient nation building, societal structures in clans, topography, ghost soldiers and unequal troops quality[clarification needed], as well as the recent peace agreement and Taliban prisoners amnesty. \c\cFormer U.S. adviser Vali Nasr, said that there was "no kind of leadership that would give local warlords reasons for why they should resist the Taliban. So the more they see the Taliban victory is inevitable, the more the victory becomes inevitable, because they just cut their own deals with them". \c\cSince 2 July, U.S. withdrawal from the Bagram Airfield, U.S. airstrikes against the Taliban have been led from outside of Afghanistan, from the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and the U.S. Navy carrier strike group in the Persian Gulf, requiring the warplanes to travel several hours to reach their targets. According to a U.S. defence official, the airstrikes since 2 July amounted to only "a handful" each day. \c\cAccording to a U.S. defense official, the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of U.S. military forces could create an opening for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups to reorganize. The official added that, while the U.S. would still maintain authority to strike Al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan, the lack of a robust U.S. presence on the ground would hamper the ability to identify potential targets. The CENTCOM commander General McKenzie said that he has not seen anything that would make him believe the Taliban would stop Al Qaeda from using Afghanistan to strengthen and rebuild. \c\cBritish Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said that the vacuum could give terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda a safe haven. \c\cAccording to an open-source investigative report published at the Oryx blog by Stijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans, the Taliban captured twelve tanks (seven T-54s and five T-62s), fifty-one armoured fighting vehicles (forty-six M1117 ASVs, two M1117 Command & Controls and three M113 APCs), sixty-one artilleries and mortars (thirty-five 122mm D-30 howitzers, three 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)s, one 120mm mortar, two 82mm M69 mortars, one 60mm mortar and nineteen mortars of unknown origin), eight anti-aircraft guns (two 14.5mm KPV-1s and six 23mm ZU-23s), ten helicopters (nine Mil Mi-17s, one Mil Mi-24V, four UH-60A BlackHawks and two MD 530Fs), six unmanned aerial vehicles (six Boeing Insitu ScanEagles), and 1,973 trucks, vehicles and jeeps from the Afghan armed forces. During the same period, the Taliban also destroyed nine M1117 ASVs, four Mi-17s and three UH-60A BlackHawks, one DJI Mavic and 104 trucks, vehicles and jeeps. Oryx only counts destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available. \c\cSince 2 July, US forces conducted multiple airstrikes targeting military equipment captured by the insurgents. US airstrikes destroyed multiple D30 artillery pieces, multiple tanks, MRAPs and Humvees that the Taliban had captured from Afghan security forces. \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahid Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. After the fall of Herat on 12 August, Khan was detained by the Taliban. On 2 August 2021, President Ghani blamed the advance of the Taliban on the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops and said the former had not cut ties with terrorist organizations and had escalated attacks against women, which the Taliban denied. State-run newspaper The Kabul Times reported that on 9 August, #SanctionPakistan became one of the top Twitter trends in Afghanistan and worldwide, with Afghans holding Pakistan responsible for its support of the Taliban. \c\cTaliban: On 9 July, Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar said in Moscow that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and added that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. \c\c China: Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi criticized the speed and timing of withdrawal of the American-led NATO forces and urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". \c\c Germany: Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Germany would cut off financial aid in case the Taliban imposes Sharia law if they take power in the country. \c\c India: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that India would consult all important parts in the conflict, including China, and that India was pushing for "conciliation in Afghanistan."\c\c Indonesia: Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged all Indonesian nationals to leave Afghanistan. Commission I of the Indonesian parliament also urged the government to be active on mediating both sides of the conflict as a Muslim-majority nation. \c\c Iran: Influential Shia cleric, lawmaker, and politician Mojtaba Zonnour said that the Taliban is "an undeniable part of the reality in Afghanistan", and that it should not be equated to Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIL or al-Qaeda. Grand Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani called trusting the Taliban an irreparable error. \c\c Kazakhstan: Kazakh representatives participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Kyrgyzstan: Representatives from the country participated in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit along with Russian and Chinese authorities to discuss a possible influx of Afghan refugees. \c\c Pakistan: Keeping in view the advancements of Taliban, DG ISPR issued a statement that "Pakistan should be seen as facilitator, not guarantor in Afghan peace process."\c\c Philippines: The Philippine embassy in Pakistan, which exercises jurisdiction over Afghanistan, has reached out to Filipinos to ascertain their security situation and to advise them on the proper course of action. The Department of Foreign Affairs said the embassy has gathered some 75 individuals for repatriation, with more expected to join the list in the coming days. Joseph Glenn Gumpal, president of Samahang Pilipino sa Afghanistan (Organization of Filipinos in Afghanistan), the Filipino expatriate community in Afghanistan, said that there are planned repatriation flights from 22 August to 24 August. There are at least 171 registered overseas Filipino workers in Afghanistan that are employed by 33 companies running the gamut from defense contractors to telecommunication firms. \c\c Russia: Russian authorities said they were working with the Tajik government to protect it from any foreign threat under the Collective Security Treaty Organization.Russian special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said that the Afghan government only paid lip service to the idea of talks and they were not doing enough to make them happen. He also said that Russia and other regional powers favoured a transitional government in Afghanistan. Taliban representatives visited Moscow in July. Russia's Foreign Ministry called the Taliban "of sound mind". \c\c Tajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon ordered 20,000 reserve servicemen of the country's Ground Forces to be sent to the Afghan–Tajik border. \c\c Turkey: The country offered to order its troops to protect Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \c\c Turkmenistan: Turkmen military forces were assigned to the Afghan–Turkmen border due to security concerns. \c\c United Kingdom: UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, said that the UK will be ready to work with the Taliban should they come into power provided that they adhere to certain international norms. However, Wallace warned that the UK will review any relationship if Taliban were found violating human rights in Afghanistan. In an unusual criticism of his country's American allies, U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace referred to the Doha agreement as "a rotten deal" that "effectively told a Taliban that wasn’t winning that they were winning... We will all, in the international community, probably pay the consequences of that."\c\c United States: President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying that the country had not gone to Afghanistan to "nation build." Biden added that he would not "send another generation of Americans to fight there" and pointed to other failed attempts at unifying Afghanistan in the past. He also assured that the safety of the U.S. was not at risk, regardless of the outcome of the infighting in Afghanistan. On 10 August, Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, told reporters that US was confident that airstrikes were having an effect on the Taliban, but that the American air power alone would not be enough to halt the insurgent offensive. \c\c Uzbekistan: The government raised concerns of a possible migratory crisis due to the infighting in Afghanistan and reported that U.S. authorities had contacted Uzbek officials to confirm if Uzbekistan could safeguard Afghans who collaborated with the U.S., fleeing from the country. In response, the Uzbek government erected a tent city for migrants in the city of Termez. \c\cA joint statement released by twelve nations, including China, India, the US with the UN and EU said that no Afghan government would be recognized if it was established through force.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Victoria is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in the Australian state of Victoria was identified on 19 January 2020, when a man returning from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cOn 10 March, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews warned Victorians to expect "extreme measures" in the wake of the federal government updating the travel advice for Italy. These could include cancelling major sporting events, requiring entire economic sectors to work from home, and calling recently retired health professionals to return to work. \c\cA state of emergency was declared on 16 March, which was extended on 12 April, with existing directions remaining in place including staying at home, restrictions on particular activities, detention, restrictions on airports and cruise ships, aged care, hospitals and isolation for people diagnosed with COVID-19.[citation needed] It was extended further on 11 May,[citation needed] and again on 19 July to 16 August. \c\cOn 22 March, the school holiday was brought forward from 27 to 24 March. \c\cOn 14 April, Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced that Victoria would have the widest coronavirus testing in Australia, with anyone having COVID-19 symptoms able to get tested. The statement was issued that those who presented with fever or chills, in the absence of any other alternative diagnosis that explained the issue, or acute respiratory infection characterised by coughing, sore throat or shortness of breath should be tested for coronavirus. \c\cOn 20 June, the Victorian Government re-tightened restrictions on household gatherings following a spike in community transmitted cases over the previous week, reported to be mainly caused by family-to-family transmission in large household gatherings. From 22 June, households could once again only have five visitors; and most easing of restrictions that were to take place were postponed. \c\cOn 30 June, the Victorian Government re-enforced local lockdowns across 10 different Melbourne postcodes. Residents there would need to comply with the four acceptable reasons to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes. \c\cOn 2 July, the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced the "Judicial Inquiry into Hotel Quarantine Program". This followed some cases of coronavirus in Victoria being linked by DNA sequencing to a breach in hotel quarantine infection control. The Inquiry was to "... examine the operation of Victoria's hotel quarantine program for returning travellers." It was headed by retired judge Jennifer Coate, and was scheduled to deliver its report to the Governor by 25 September. The inquiry was delayed by lockdown restrictions. Andrews noted that "it is abundantly clear that what has gone on here is completely unacceptable and we need to know exactly what has happened." An interim report was published on 6 November, and the inquirys final report was published on 21 December. The Government response to the interim report was published in November. \c\cOn 4 July, the Victorian Government announced two more postcodes affected by the lockdown until 29 July 2020. Nine public housing towers housing 3,000 residents were also added, with the additional condition that residents could not leave the tower under any circumstances for five days, with the possibility of an extension to 14 days. The Victorian ombudsman later found the lockdown of the public housing towers breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 6 July, the Victorian and NSW state Governments announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July. \c\cOn 7 July, after recording 191 new cases, Premier Andrews announced that metropolitan Melbourne and the Shire of Mitchell would re-enter lockdown from 12 am on 9 July, for 6 weeks. \c\cOn 19 July, following a "concerning increase in coronavirus cases", Premier Andrews announced that "face coverings" were to be made mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne, and Mitchell Shire. This was not enforced until after 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday 22 July to allow the populace time to acquire a face covering. In addition, the state of emergency was extended until 16 August 2020. \c\cFrom 22 July, as the chance of coronavirus infection remained high in aged care and health care settings, visits were restricted to carers only, and with a limit of one hour per day. \c\cFrom 23 July, "face coverings" in metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire became mandatory whenever residents leave their homes. A fine of A$200 was imposed to those not complying, though medical and other exemptions were allowed, such as not being required for children under 12 years of age. \c\cOn 2 August, a state of disaster was declared and metropolitan Melbourne was moved to Stage 4 restrictions. A curfew across Melbourne from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. was imposed, a 5 km (3.1 mi) radius restriction as added, and other restrictions that had previously been applied only to selected postcodes were applied to the whole of metropolitan Melbourne. A permit system was introduced for any residents that still needed to travel to work outside of their 5 km radius. \c\cOn 6 September (Father's Day), the "Roadmap for Reopening" was announced; a series of four steps towards "COVID Normal" which would begin on 13 September. In the "First Step", which applied to metropolitan Victoria, several restrictions were eased including a reduction of the curfew, some loosening of rules around outdoor exercise and social interactions, the introduction of a "bubble" that allowed single people living alone to nominate one person to be allowed to visit them during the first two steps, and increased limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. At the same time, it was announced that regional Victoria would move to the "Second Step", which included a staged return of students to onsite learning as well as the reopening of outdoor public pools and further increases to limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. \c\cOn 18 October, regional Victoria was moved to "Step Three", which included the reopening of most businesses to the public, increased seating for hospitality, the allowance of visitors for all residents and the resumption of some indoor sports. At the same time, the 5 km limit in metropolitan Victoria was increased to 25 km (16 mi) and the two-hour time limit was removed, however the border between metropolitan and regional Victoria (often referred to as the "ring of steel") was strengthened with extra checkpoints added. \c\cOn 26 October, metropolitan restrictions were eased, with residents allowed to leave home for any reason, all retail businesses allowed to reopen, hospitality venues allowed to seat patrons, further relaxations on outdoor gatherings, and allowance of visitors to all residents, with some caveats. The 25 km restriction and "Ring of steel" remained in place, however. \c\c With a length of 112 days, Victoria's second lockdown was the longest continuous lockdown world-wide, as of October 2020. \c\cOn 8 November, metropolitan restrictions were brought into line with regional restrictions with travel now being allowed to and from anywhere in the state. Indoor recreation, community and entertainment venues were also reopened. Restrictions on accommodation were also loosened in an effort to encourage intrastate tourism. It was also announced that, subject to public health advice, Victoria would move to the "Last Step" on 22 November. \c\cOn 27 November, Victoria recorded its 28th consecutive day of 0 new cases and 0 deaths, and had 0 active cases, epidemiologically eliminating the virus. \c\cOn 30 November, the Victorian government announced that a new dedicated agency, "COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria" (CQV), had been created. The interim Commissioner of CQV is the Commissioner of Corrections, Emma Cassar. CQV is part of the government's response to the COVID-19 Hotel Quarantine Enquirys\' interim report. It will oversee all parts of the Victorian quarantine program: mandatory quarantine for people entering Australia, Health Hotels for positive and suspected cases, or close contacts, and Frontline Worker Accommodation. The CQV Commissioner will be supported by three Deputy State Controllers. Deputy Chief Health Officer Professor Ben Cowie will lead the CQVs\' health management. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Ross Guenther will provide expertise in enforcement. As of 15 January 2021[update] the third Controller was still to be appointed. On 5 May 2021, the CQV general manager of infection control, Matius Bush, was stood down by the Minister for Government Services Danny Pearson pending a conduct review. Bush breached infection controls twice by: refusing a COVID test at a quarantine hotel when requested by Defence personnel; and failing to sanitise or change his mask when returning to a quarantine hotel from a coffee shop. Reports about the breaches were leaked and published in The Australian newspaper. \c\cOn 17 December, the Victorian ombudsman tabled a report in the Victorian Parliament in which she found the 4 July lockdown of public housing towers In Melbourne breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 30 December, Victoria's 61-day streak of zero community cases came to an end as three community cases were identified, linked to the New South Wales outbreak. As a precautionary measure for New Year's Eve the Victorian Government reduced household gatherings from 30 people to 15 and mandated masks within an indoor setting. The border to New South Wales closed at 11:59 pm on 31 December, with returning Victorian residents from "green zones" that returned before the deadline made to isolate until they received a negative test result. Those that returned afterwards would have to get tested and isolate for 14 days, aligning the restrictions with visitors from the Northern Beaches and Greater Sydney that had been enforced 11 days prior. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, a quarantine hotel worker at the Grand Hyatt Melbourne, a "resident support officer" involved in the Australian Open tennis quarantine program, was found to have COVID-19. From 11:59 pm Victoria immediately reintroduced some rules, tightened some, and put off imminent easing of some restrictions. The plan to, from 8 February (Monday), allow up to 75 per cent of office workers back into their workplaces was put on hold. Masks are mandatory inside, and only 15 persons are allowed at private events. The man visited at least 14 businesses from 29 January to 1 February, but was able to give contact tracers a detailed list of places and times. Anyone who was at those places at those times, must be tested, and isolate for 14 days. Testing site hours were extended from 4 February, opening at 8 am. More drive-through lanes were added, and additional testing sites opened. By 5 February, genomic sequencing confirmed that the Hyatt worker was infected with the more contagious "UK strain" of COVID-19. \c\cOn 12 February, it was announced that a five-day lockdown under Stage 4 restrictions would take effect beginning at 11:59 pm. AEDT, due to a cluster of 13 cases tied to a Holiday Inn quarantine hotel near Melbourne Airport, which have been assumed to be the UK variant. It was alleged by health officials to have been spread on a hotel floor due to a patient's use of an aerosol-generating nebuliser, which is normally banned under hotel quarantine. By 14 February the cluster had grown to 16, and by 16 February, the number of confirmed infections had increased to 19. By 19 February,  the Melbourne Holiday Inn outbreak had increased to 22, one person was admitted to intensive care, and about 3,515 contacts were quarantined. \c\cResidents may not leave their homes except for essential shopping, exercise, caregiving, essential work, or participating in a professional sporting event. Residents may only shop or exercise within five kilometres of their homes. Face masks are mandatory at all times out-of-home, all public gatherings are banned, and all schools are closed. As they account for the majority of UK variant cases, international arrivals into Victoria were also suspended. All Australian states and territories have placed travel restrictions upon Victoria. Premier Andrews stated that these infections were "moving at a velocity that has not been seen anywhere in our country over the course of these last 12 months." Special dispensation was given to the 2021 Australian Open, which became crowdless effective 11:30 pm. AEDT on 12 February in the midst of the night's final match (play was temporarily suspended at that time to remove all spectators from the court). \c\cThe lockdown was lifted as anticipated at 11:59 pm on 17 February. Despite this, Victoria will not allow any incoming international flights "indefinitely". \c\cRemaining restrictions included:\c\cMasks mandatory inside,\c\cMasks outdoors when unable to keep social distance,\c\c5 person limit on home visits,\c\c20 person limit for outdoor gatherings. \c\cAs of 9 May 2021 Victoria had no cases of community transmission for 72 days. \c\cOn 24 May in northern Melbourne, 4 cases of COVID-19 in the community were reported; this broke Victoria's streak of 86 days with no community transmission. Another 5 community cases, for a total of 9, were reported on 25 May. 4 of them were family contacts of a man, who may be the source of the outbreak, who tested positive on 2 May. As a result, restrictions in Greater Melbourne were again tightened from 6pm on Tuesday, 25 May, to at least Friday, 4 June. Restrictions included:\c\cmandatory wearing of masks indoors (children under 12 exempted)\c\cprivate gatherings, limited to 5 people\c\cpublic gatherings, limited 30 people\c\climits on visitors to hospitals and aged care reinstated\c\cMelbourne residents were allowed to travel out of the city, but had to observe restrictions as if they were still in Melbourne\c\cno changes to the number of people allowed in workplaces, shops, bars, or beauty services. \c\cRelaxation of "density caps" in hospitality venues had been planned, was put on hold. Cultural and sports event were allowed, but the AFL "paused" ticket sales for Victorian-based games. \c\cBy 27 May the Melbourne outbreak had risen to 26 cases. There were over 150 exposure sites and 11,000 contacts had been linked through contact tracing to the outbreak. As a result of the growing outbreak Victoria entered its fourth lockdown, statewide, as of 11:59pm on 27 May. The restrictions were initially planned to last for at least 7 days until 11:59pm on 3 June. By 1 June the number of cases in the Victorian outbreak had reached 60 and on 2 June the lockdown was extended for another 7 days. By June 7 there were 81 active COVID cases in the outbreak. The lockdown ended, with some restrictions remaining, just before midnight on 10 June. \c\cDuring the lockdown leaving home was initially only allowed for 5 reasons:\c\cFood and supply shopping (only within 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) of home)\c\cAuthorised work\c\cCare and caregiving, health\c\cExercising, for up to two hours:\c\cwith no more than one other person\c\cwithin 5 km of home\c\cTo get a COVID-19 vaccination. \c\cOtherwise:\c\cSchools closed (some exemptions)\c\cHigher education, online only\c\cChildcare centres and kindergartens, stay open\c\cHairdressers, beauty salons and similar, closed\c\cEntertainment venues, closed\c\cOnly take-away food allowed from cafes and restaurants\c\cNo public or private gatherings\c\cNo hospital or nursing home visits (some exemptions)\c\cFunerals limited to 10 people, plus those running the event\c\cWeddings not allowed (some exemptions)\c\cMasks mandatory outside the home, unless exempted. \c\cThere were anti-lockdown protests in Melbourne on 28 May. \c\cDue to the outbreak, all Australian states imposed a range of restrictions on travellers from Victoria, either banning entry, only allowing state residents back in, requiring home isolation for 7 days under Victorias\' rules, 14 days hotel quarantine, or other measures. New Zealand paused the travel bubble with Victoria from 7:59pm on 25 May. As a result of the pausing of the travel bubble, the Melbourne Rebels\' scheduled Super Rugby Trans-Tasman match against the Highlanders was forced to be relocated from Queenstown, New Zealand to Sydney. On 3 June the stay-at-home order from NSW Health, for anyone in NSW who had been in Victoria since May 27, was extended by a week. \c\cThe fourth lockdown meant that a number of other interstate professional sporting matches that were due that week had to either be played in empty stadiums, or relocated to alternative venues. The A-League match between Western United FC and Melbourne Victory FC on 28 May, the AFL match between the Western Bulldogs and Melbourne on 28 May and the AFL matches scheduled on 29 May (Collingwood against Geelong at the MCG and St Kilda against North Melbourne at Marvel Stadium) were played in empty stadiums, while the AFL match between Richmond and Adelaide scheduled for Sunday 30 May and the NRL match between the Melbourne Storm and the Gold Coast Titans scheduled for 5 June were both relocated interstate, to Sydney and the Sunshine Coast respectively. \c\cAfter the number of cases in the Victorian outbreak had reached 60 by 1 June, on 2 June the lockdown was extended for another 7 days. Some restrictions were eased:\c\cthe 5 km travel limit was extended to 10 km (6.2 miles),\c\cschool attendance allowed for years 11 and 12,\c\cauthorised work now includes some outdoors work. \c\cUse of the Service Victoria QR code check-in is required across Victoria for places like supermarkets and shops. \c\cThe Victorian outbreak rose to 63 cases by 3 June, all in Greater Melbourne. As a result, from 11:59 pm that day some lockdown restrictions in regional Victoria were eased:\c\cmovement in regional areas was unrestricted (to Melbourne is still restricted)\c\cstudents could return to school\c\cThere were 81 active COVID cases in the outbreak by June 7. There were also 3 separate clusters with unknown sources in Victoria by then: 32 cases in Whittlesea; 9 at the Arcare aged care centre in Maidstone; and 14 at a cluster in West Melbourne. The West Melbourne cluster was found to be of the fast spreading Delta COVID variant, raising the possibility the fourth Victorian lockdown could be extended again. \c\cThe lockdown ended on 10 June at 11:59 pm, with some restrictions remaining. \c\cno visitors in the home\c\cmust wear a mask both indoors and outdoors\c\ctravel limited to 25 km (16 mi) radius of home. \c\cDue to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, from 11:59pm on 24 June, border entry was barred to non-Victorian residents who had been in Greater Sydney and Wollongong in the previous 14 days as those areas were considered to be red zones. Returning Victorians had to get a red zone permit and quarantine at home for 14 days. \c\cFrom 11:59pm on July 11, Victoria closed its border to all New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory residents to try to prevent the delta variant entering the state. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr tweeted that it was "incredibly disappointing and frustrating" after more than a year with no local COVID-19 cases that the border was being closed to Canberrans. \'Border bubble\' arrangements for border towns remained in place. \c\cOn 14 July, after 11 COVID cases were detected in the state, Victoria reintroduced the requirement to wear face masks in workplaces, in schools, and when social distancing was not possible, outdoors. Most cases are linked to removalists from NSW who picked up from the Ariele apartments in Maribyrnong on 8 July without face masks. On return to NSW the removalists tested positive. Because of them the apartment block, with 130 residents, was put into a 14 day lockdown on 13 July, which was \'reset\' by the new cases. \c\cOn 15 July, it the Premier announced that Victoria would enter a snap lockdown for 5 days from 11:59pm on 15 July (Thursday) until 11:59pm on 20 July (Tuesday). This will be the third Victorian lockdown in 2021, and the fifth since the start of the pandemic in Australia. There are 18 cases in the current outbreak in Victoria, 4 recorded on this day, all of which link back to "incursions" from NSW. There are 1,500 primary close contacts and 75 exposure sites in Victoria. \c\cOn 22 July, the death of a 48-year-old woman from Victoria the previous week was linked by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to "probable" thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS),  after vaccination with AstraZeneca. \c\cOn 24 July there was an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne. There were 6 arrests, 4 people charged, and 74 infringement notices issued. There were also protests in Brisbane, and in Sydney where several people were arrested, infringement notices issued and over 50 people charged. Assistant police commissioner Luke Cornelius responds: "It beggars belief that the protest today could, if mass spreading occurs, result in an extension of the very thing they are protesting for: an end to the current lockdown and a reopening of business, which is something we are all working so hard to achieve."\c\cOn 27 July at 11:59pm the 5th lockdown was lifted with strict restrictions still remaining. It is unknown when the restrictions will ease further. \c\cno visitors in the home\c\cmust wear a mask both indoors and outdoors\c\cstudents can return to school\c\cpublic gatherings are limited to 10 people\c\cpubs, restaurants, bars, gyms and retail can reopen with density limits\c\ccommunity sport is back but spectators not allowed\c\cOn 5 August 2021, in response to the detection of six new community cases, the Victorian Government announced their sixth lockdown, commencing that evening at 8 pm for seven days. At about 7pm that day there was an anti-lockdown protest of up to 400 people in Flinders Street, Melbourne. \c\cOn 11 August the lockdown was extended for 7 days. This followed the state having 20 new cases, 5 with an unknown source. \c\cOn 16 August the lockdown was extended for another 14 days, with a target end date of 2 September. |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-16/victoria-new-local-covid-cases-melbourne-lockdown/100379330 |access-date=16 August 2021 |publisher=ABC Melbourne |date=16 August 2021 |language=en}}</ref>\c\cThe 2020 Australian Grand Prix (scheduled for 15 March) was cancelled,\c\cThe 2021 Australian Grand Prix was postponed, then later cancelled on 6 July 2021. \c\cThe 2020 Melbourne International Flower & Garden Show (scheduled for 25–29 March 2020) was cancelled. \c\cThe 2020 Melbourne International Comedy Festival (scheduled for 25 March – 19 April 2020) was cancelled due to banned public gatherings of more than 500 people. \c\cThe 2020 Melbourne International Jazz Festival (scheduled for 29 May – 12 June) was cancelled; however, it was replaced by a virtual online event by These Digital Times. \c\cThe 2020 annual Melbourne Food and Wine Festival (due to start in March 2020) was postponed to Spring. \c\cThe 2020 annual Royal Melbourne Show (due to start in mid-September) was cancelled. \c\cThe 2021 annual Royal Melbourne Show (due to start in mid-September) was cancelled. \c\cThe 2020 annual Royal Geelong Show (scheduled for October) was cancelled. \c\cMelbourne's New Year's Eve fireworks at the end of 2020 were cancelled. \c\cThe 2021 Rainbow Serpent Festival, normally held on the Australia Day long weekend in Lexton, had its physical events cancelled.

The Panjshir conflict[citation needed] is a political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban which began following the Fall of Kabul (2021). As of August 2021, no military conflict had occurred in Panjshir Province and a negotiated end to the political impasse has been discussed. \c\cThe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is a state that is the notional continuation of the regime that previously governed Afghanistan. It exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". \c\cPrior to the Fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by commanders of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Amrullah Saleh — citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan — declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Mohammadi. At around the same time, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Masoud. \c\cAs of 17 August, the Panjshir Valley was — according to one observer — "under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. As of August 2021, no military conflict had occurred in Panjshir Province and a negotiated end to the political impasse has been discussed. \c\cAccording to a Russian intelligence, Saleh's forces have captured Charikar region in Parwan Province from Taliban
The COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23 January 2020. Early cases were primarily imported until local transmission began to develop in February and March. By late-March and April, COVID-19 clusters were detected at multiple sleeping quarters, for which soon contributed to an overwhelming proportion of new cases in the country. \c\cOn 22 January 2020, a multi-ministerial committee was formed with Minister of Finance, Lawrence Wong and Minister of Trade and Industry, Gan Kim Yong as the co-chairs and Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong and Deputy Prime Minister, Heng Swee Keat as advisors. On 23 April 2021, Lee announced the appointment of Ong Ye Kung as the Minister for Health, another committee co-chair alongside incumbents Lawrence Wong and Gan Kim Yong from 15 May 2021. Singapore also contributed US$500,000 to support the World Health Organization's (WHO) efforts against COVID-19. \c\cIn response to the growing number of new cases in early 2020, Singapore enacted the "COVID-19 Control Order", announcing on 3 April 2020 a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the "circuit breaker lockdown". Initially planned to be applied from 7 April to 4 May, the circuit breaker lockdown was extended to 1 June on 21 April following continued untraced transmission within the community. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 19 May announced the three-phased approach to resume activities safely with the gradual re-opening of economic activities in each phase; Phase 1 lasted for 17 days from 2 June and ended on 18 June, with Phase 2 lasting for 6 months and 8 days from 19 June to 27 December. Singapore was in Phase 3 from 28 December 2020 until 7 May 2021; following a spike in community cases from late April to early May 2021, it temporarily reverted to Phase 2 on 8 May, which was raised to "Heightened Alert" as a tightened measure from 16 May to 13 June. Following a brief period in "Phase 3 Heightened Alert", Singapore again reverted to Phase 2 Heightened Alert on 22 July 2021 after a fresh surge of community cases from early to mid-July. A mass vaccination programme is currently under way following the approval and acquisition of the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. \c\cAs of 21 August 2021, 957 active cases remain out of a total of 66,443 confirmed cases, with 65,402 recoveries and 47 deaths. Singapore currently has a case fatality rate of 0.07%, one of the lowest in the world. It introduced what was considered one of the largest and best-organised epidemic control programs in the world, along with fellow neighbouring countries such as South Korea and Vietnam. Various measures have been taken to mass test the population for the virus, such as isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps such as TraceTogether (both app and token) and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with. Such measures has helped avoid further lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020. \c\cOn 31 December 2019, health authorities in China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), after mounting evidence that the novel coronavirus had spread to 18 countries and completion of investigation in Wuhan. \c\cThroughout the outbreak, cases were traced to clusters that several cases had visited during a particular time period, with venues including religious institutions, workplaces, construction sites, a number of schools, private events, retail businesses, and a hospital. Imported cases also became a source of infection in March. From early April to late September, most new cases were at foreign worker dormitories and construction sites, while imported cases formed the bulk of new cases from early October; as of 21 August 2021, there are a total of 54,689 dormitory residents, 6,656 cases in the community, and 5,098 imported cases. 20 April 2020 saw the highest number of daily cases at 1,426, while 12 May saw 20,799 active cases – the highest since the outbreak began. The last date of any patient in ICU was 20 August 2021. 14 August 2020 was the first time since June that there were no reported community cases, while 1 October 2020 was the first time since April that the daily number of imported cases exceeded that of dormitory cases. 13 October 2020 was the first time in over six months that no dormitory cases were reported, with 15 June 2021 being the first time in over eleven months that no imported cases were reported. \c\cInternationally, the case fatality ratio (CFR) for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS in 2003. The transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus powering the COVID-19 pandemic has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. However, Singapore's death rate has been one of the world's lowest, both in terms of CFR and per capita. This may be attributed to the fact that the bulk of the cases are restricted to the migrant workers living in dormitories away from the general population. These migrant workers tend to be younger, with an average age of 30 years and 2 months old when surveyed in 2015, and the healthcare system was never overwhelmed. The authorities also tested the entire dormitory population for COVID-19 infection, leading to many otherwise asymptomatic infections being picked up. Research by the European Commission suggests that the CFR for SARS-CoV-2 virus picks up in cases 50 years of age and above. The elderly in the general population in Singapore have been advised to stay at home as much as possible, while resident-facing staff in old folks homes are being housed on site or separately in hotels. \c\cOther factors contributing to Singapore's exceptionally low CFR include the country's use of extensive contact tracing and testing to identify cases, mandatory mask-wearing, and hospitalisation of all high-risk patients. Singapore has comparatively strict criteria for classifying COVID-19 deaths, counting patients who were infected with COVID but died of other causes as non-COVID deaths. \c\cPrevalence studies on the population have shown that 4 in 1600 in the community, or about 0.25%, have previously been infected with COVID-19, while at least 47% of migrant workers living in dormitories have tested positive by PCR or serological tests. \c\cNational authorities began reporting suspected cases on 4 January, however the first confirmed case was reported on 23 January, a tourist from Wuhan. Until 30 January, there were a total of 13 confirmed cases, all of whom were visitors to Singapore from China. The first case involving a Singaporean was confirmed on 31 January after returning from Wuhan. Contact tracing procedures were put in place to identify close contacts of the confirmed cases who were placed under 14-day quarantines to ring-fence the potential spread of the virus. \c\cThese imported cases eventually lead to clusters of local transmissions being formed. The first cluster was reported on 4 February at Yong Thai Hang, a shop that mainly serves Chinese tourists. It was identified as the locus of the infection where four women without recent history of travel to China contracted the virus. The shop was affected when a tour group from Guangxi, China visited it along with other locations such as the Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive, where another case occurred, while touring Singapore. The tour group had returned to China and the Chinese authorities had confirmed that two of the group was infected. Authorities then raised the nation's Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange after more cases with unclear origins surfaced on 7 February, with Prime Minister Lee expressing his worry about some cases with no known chain of transmission of the infection directly from Wuhan or indirectly via cases traced in Singapore. He suggested that it might become "futile to try to trace every contact". More clusters emerged at various locations, where there were large scale gatherings such as a business conference, Chinese New Year dinner gatherings and church-related activities. Two clusters were linked when several cases in each cluster was found to have infected each other through serological tests, the first such successful test in the world. \c\cIn March, as the number of cases began to rise exponentially around the world, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) began to encourage Singaporeans to return home. Various institutes of higher learning recalled their students currently on overseas internship or exchange, and the MFA began liaising with airlines to facilitate flights to key cities when necessary during this period, to cater to demand for return flights to Singapore. This led to an increase in number of imported cases, in which over 70% of cases from 16 to 19 March were Singaporeans and long-term pass holders returning from overseas. \c\cOn 7 April circuit breaker (lockdown) measures were imposed on the general population. The bulk of cases began to shift from imported cases to migrant workers living in dormitories, resulting in the authorities imposing a mandatory quarantine of 20,000 migrant workers in two dormitories gazetted as isolation areas, namely the S11 Dormitory and Westlite Toh Guan. Following which, the number of cases in migrant worker dormitories began to soar as more clusters were detected in other migrant worker dormitories, reaching a single-daily high of 1,426 cases recorded amongst migrant workers on 20 April. On 21 April, MOM announced that all foreign workers in dormitories were to stop work until 4 May to curb the rising spread of the coronavirus among the groups that were hit the hardest. The number of daily cases amongst migrant workers living in dormitories gradually decreased but continued to remain in the hundreds until early August, with aggressive testing by the authorities. April also marked a shift in policy. The government stopped automatically admitting the infected in hospitals and instead created community care facilities for those who were at low risk, which allowed hospitals to focus only on those in higher risk categories. At the peak on 12 May, there were 19,667 patients in community care facilities. This allowed hospitals to reduce bed take up related to COVID-19 from more than a thousand to several hundred in a few weeks. 18 September saw the first time since the crisis spread to work dormitories that the daily dorm case number fell into single digits. \c\cFrom May onwards, the vast majority of cases were reported in dormitories, with community cases never rising above 24 cases, which was reported on 11 July. Nevertheless, while numbers in the dorms remained elevated in May, 20 April in fact represented the peak of daily cases reported among dormitory workers. By August, it was clear that the situation in dormitories was being brought under control, with new daily cases among dorm workers finally falling below 100 on 11 August. On 11 August, Ministry of Manpower announced that all dormitories had been declared cleared of COVID-19 (except for those blocks that were being used for quarantine facilities). By 1 October less than 300 people were being housed in community care facilities, down from the almost 20,000 from the May peak. However, it also became clear that controlling the disease was going to be extremely difficult. While total case numbers had continued to decline, unlinked community cases had begun to edge up and some dorms that had been cleared of infection were once again put on lockdown. A significant milestone was achieved on 13 October when it was announced that, for the first time since March, there were no local cases of infection. This was followed shortly by 16 October, when the number of active cases fell to less than 100 – the first time since 12 March, and by 25 November, when it was announced that there were no active clusters for the first time since the pandemic began. \c\cOn 24 December, Singapore has confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus variant found in the United Kingdom. The variant, known as B.1.525, has the E484K spike protein mutation, which is also present in the so-called South African variant and is the key mutation found so far that could undermine the effectiveness of vaccines. \c\cOn 31 December 2020, 2 new clusters were formed out of the 5 community cases reported that day, all of whom were linked to the marine sector. Two additional clusters were formed on 17 and 19 January 2021; the first was from 2 community cases linked to a para-vet working with the Singapore Police Force's K-9 unit, with the second from 2 community cases linked to a worker at Golden Bridge Foods Manufacturing. Another cluster consisting of four community cases linked to an employee at BS Industrial & Construction Supply was formed on 20 January. 2 new clusters were identified on 21 and 24 April; the first was a household cluster of 3 community cases linked to a 43-year-old Indian national and work pass holder who was possibly re-infected, while the second was a group of 4 community cases who were linked to a 39-year-old Indonesian sailor. On 29 April, a new household cluster was formed out of 7 community cases that were linked to a 38-year-old Singaporean ICA officer working at Changi Airport, with another cluster formed out of 8 community cases linked to a 46-year-old Filipino nurse working at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. \c\cAfter banning short term arrivals in March, imported cases fell dramatically. However, since the beginning of July, there was a steady trickle of imported cases as the government loosened arrival requirements, with the majority of cases arriving from India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. January 2021 saw a sharp spike in imported cases, of which foreign domestic workers formed the bulk due to the high demand for maids amidst the pandemic. \c\cOn 23 April 2021, Singapore banned all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from India, which was experiencing a second wave believed to be fuelled by a strain with a double mutation. This was followed by a ban on all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka on 30 April, which was later extended to all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors worldwide on 4 May. In addition, it was announced that Singapore would temporarily revert to Phase 2 from 8 to 30 May. However, by then it was too late to stop the strain from entering Singapore, with the government announcing on 4 May that the variant had been detected among locally transmitted cases in the community. A new cluster was formed out of 4 community cases linked to an 88-year-old cleaner working at Changi Airport's Terminal 3, who tested positive on 5 May; by 14 May it had become Singapore's largest active cluster at 59 cases, with at least 17 testing preliminarily positive for the "double mutant" variant. Subsequently, MOH announced that there would be more restrictions lasting from 16 May to 13 June, following reports of increasing cases in the Changi Airport cluster and several institutes of education. Dining-in would no longer be allowed, and the maximum number of persons in a social gathering would be further reduced to two, among other restrictions. MOE also announced that all Singapore primary schools, secondary schools and junior colleges were to move to full home-based learning starting on 19 May. \c\cAfter a decline in community cases, it was announced that Singapore would re-enter "Phase 3 Heightened Alert", with re-opening to commence in two stages. The first stage would begin on 14 June with the limit on social gatherings increased to 5 people, while the next stage would begin on 21 June with the resumption of dining-in with 5 people. However, a new cluster was formed at the 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Center that was linked to a 74-year old store owner who tested positive on 9 June, which resulted in a fresh surge of community cases. Consequently, the second stage of re-opening was adjusted so that only 2 persons would be allowed for dining-in. With the stabilisation of community infections in early July 2021, it was announced that dining-in with groups of up to 5—along with wedding receptions—would resume on 12 July; MOH also raised the possibility of more restrictions being eased from 1 August 2021, should the situation remain stable and after at least half the population has been fully-vaccinated. \c\cIn addition, MOE announced on 14 June that Primary 4–6, Secondary 3–5, and junior college and Millennia Institute students would be able to return to school on 28 June, and Secondary 1–2 students on 1 July; all students from other levels would return on 6 July. \c\cOn 12 July, a new cluster was formed at several KTV lounges out of 3 community cases linked to a short-term visit pass holder from Vietnam who first tested positive on 11 July, leading to another massive surge in cases. The KTV lounges were subsequently put under investigation for possibly deliberately breaching COVID-19 safety measures; at least 20 women were arrested, with 3 former nightlife outlets having their F&B licenses revoked. In response, MOH announced that all nightlife-turned-F&B establishments would be suspended from 16 to 30 July, during which all staff would undergo testing. Dining-in would also revert back to groups of 2 from 19 July to 8 August, though fully-vaccinated people would be allowed to continue dining-in in groups of 5. Another new cluster that contributed to the surge was formed on 16 July out of 7 community cases at Jurong Fishery Port; Health Minister Ong Ye Kung later confirmed that the two clusters were linked. In the wake of the rapidly increasing number of cases, it was announced on 20 July that Singapore would return to "Phase 2 Heightened Alert" from 22 July to 18 August. Dining-in was banned once more with the limit on social gatherings reduced to 2, though gyms were not shut this time round. \c\cOn 6 August 2021, it was announced that due to Singapore having successfully vaccinated 66% of its population, restrictions would be eased in two phases; from 10 August, dining-in at restaurants would resume with a limit of up to 5 fully-vaccinated persons, while the limit for non-vaccinated persons and dining-in at hawker centres would remain at 2. From 19 August, half of employees currently working from home could return to the workplace. \c\cThe authorities took cautious measures as the economy began to reopen to more regular outside travellers in August. Travellers who did not quarantine in a dedicated facility would have to wear an electronic tag throughout the 14-day period. Singapore also implemented a Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) with Malaysia, allowing limited travel between the two countries. Later in the month, arrivals from certain countries had their 14-day quarantine reduced to 7 days; those arriving from Brunei and New Zealand who were tested negative upon arrival would be allowed in without any quarantine. On 30 September 2020, the Singapore government announced that the country will lift border restrictions for some visitors from Australia, excluding Victoria state, and Vietnam, beginning from 8 October 2020; restrictions for Victoria state and mainland China were lifted on 6 November. In October 2020, then-Minister of Transport Ong Ye Kung suggested that Singapore would be looking to open travel bubbles with various countries such as those with similar risk profiles, but also for those countries from higher risk locations. One such travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong was to have started on 22 November; initially postponed to 2021 due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, it was eventually cancelled in August 2021 due to conflicting strategies between the city-states. \c\cTo stop the spread of COVID-19, the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 and its Control Order Regulations 2020 was brought into force. These rules banned gatherings and led some to be charged in court, fined or even jailed for offences related to these laws. A number of people who were on work passes have had their passes revoked and have also been permanently banned from working in Singapore. \c\cThe ongoing pandemic is likely to have a significant impact on the local economy. On 17 February 2020, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) downgraded Singapore's forecast GDP growth to between −0.5% and 1.5%. This is largely due to the fall in tourism and social distancing restrictions. On 26 March, MTI said it believed that the economy would contract by between 1% and 4% in 2020. This was after the economy shrank some 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same quarter in 2019. On 26 May, the Singapore economy contracted 0.7%YoY, which was better than the expected contraction of 2.2%. However, MTI said that it was revising down its expectation for the Singapore economy in 2020 to shrink by 4% to 7%. Economists were behind the curve in downgrading their numbers. The IMF for example, predicted in October 2019 that growth in 2020 would be 1%, but as a result of COVID-19, had changed their expectation in October 2020 to a contraction of 6%. Other institutions initially expected the economy to expand but had to revise their numbers. \c\cOn 2 April 2020, the rating's agency Moody's downgraded the Singapore banking sector from "stable" outlook to a "negative" outlook on the back of rising bad loans and deteriorating profitability as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was estimated by the economist Chua Hak Bin, the lockdown "circuit breaker" beginning on 7 April could impact the economy to the tune of S$10 billion. With the lockdown imposed on foreign workers, there were concerns that there could be delays in construction work of up to six months. Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat announced that some 3,800 companies had closed in April 2020, only slightly higher than the 3,700 reported on average for the same month in the past 5 years. Though he warned that this would likely rise in the coming months. Despite this only small increase in companies shutting down, the number of companies starting up had declined by about a third from the average April since 2015. \c\cOn 6 April 2020, it was announced in Parliament that Changi Airport Terminal 2 would be suspended from 1 May 2020 for 18 months due to the ongoing pandemic. Terminal 4 would later be suspended on 16 May indefinitely as well, with the aim to restart operations when travel demand returns. The suspension of Terminal 2 would also allow the ongoing expansion work which was announced in January 2020 to be completed up to a year ahead of schedule in 2023 instead of 2024. The airlines which were operating from these two terminals were largely consolidated into the remaining Terminals 1 and 3, with some airlines remained suspended until further notice. \c\cIn November 2020, the MTI announced Singapore's economy contracted 5.8% in the third quarter from the same period in 2019. It also expected the economy to shrink contract by between 6% and 6.5% in 2020, though in 2021 it expected an expansion of between 4% and 6% next year. \c\cData released by the Ministry of Manpower showed that total employment contracted by 57,000 in 2020, which was the biggest drop since SARS in 2003. Foreign workers were vulnerable to being let go during the crisis as support measures such as the Jobs Support Scheme were primarily targeted as subsidising the wages of local staff not all employees. There were some 22,200 fewer foreign employees (excluding domestic workers) between December 2019 and March 2020. Ministry of Manpower reported that unemployment in the first quarter of 2020 rose to 2.4 per cent from 2.3 per cent the quarter previously, the highest in a decade, while among Singaporeans it rose from 3.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent. \c\cAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, various companies like Resorts World Sentosa reduced a significant amount of its workforce. \c\cLocal firms had to take aggressive action to deal with effects of the pandemic. For example, on 10 September 2020, Singapore Airlines announced that it would cut around 4,300 positions across its group. On 15 September 2020, United Overseas Bank announced that it was limiting hiring. \c\cThe overall inflation dropped to 0.3% in February 2020 on a year-by-year basis. Core inflation, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road transport, dropped to −0.1%, the first time this decade that core inflation turned negative. This was also due to supply chains being disrupted due to COVID-19. \c\cOn 9 March 2020, the Straits Times Index fell 6.03% owing to the impact of COVID-19, made worse by the oil price war. The Index dropped again three days later by 3.8% after more measures are announced with the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic. \c\cThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) brought forward its twice year meeting from some time in April to 30 March 2020. The MAS has since decided to ease the Singapore dollar's appreciation rate to zero per cent, as well as adjust the policy band downwards, the first such move since the Global Financial Crisis. This makes it the first time the MAS had taken these two measures together. Unusually, on 6 April, the central bank also announced that it would bring forward its disclosure of foreign exchange intervention to 9 April. It was previously scheduled to be published in June. In September, Citi argued that a downward re-centring for the MAS SGD NEER in October 2020 could still take place. \c\cAs one of the highly affected by the kindness pandemic, tourism in Singapore has fallen, with the Singapore Tourism Board experiencing its best increase in visitor arrivals from the previous year. Several countries have imposed travel restrictions on Singapore. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong encouraged Singaporeans to go on a local 'staycation\' to mitigate the fall in demand for tourism, but this was not possible during the circuit breaker from 7 April 2020 to 1 June 2020. Retail industry was also affected by the pandemic, though it has been steadily recovering since the transition to phase 3. Connect @ Changi, located at Singapore Expo, was launched on 1 April 2021 to support the revival of Singapore's air hub status and hospitality sector. \c\cOn 8 May 2021, the UK announced that it would allow people in England to resume international travel from 17 May, but would limit the number of destinations open for quarantine-free holidays to just a handful of countries as it cautiously eases lockdown restrictions. Singapore is among a few countries which made the green list for travel in a system that will be reviewed every three weeks. \c\cOn 1 September 2020, applications for "green lane" travel bubbles for travellers from New Zealand and Brunei were opened. Visitors from those 2 countries would be required to take a COVID-19 test on arrival at Changi Airport and self-isolate until they received a negative test result, but otherwise did not have to stay in quarantine upon arrival in Singapore. This was provided they have remained in the country for the last consecutive 14 days prior to their visit to Singapore. \c\cFollowing its suspension of its "green lane" travel bubble with Singapore in 20 May 2021, it was announced that Singapore's would launch its first quarantine-free travel lanes for vaccinated passengers from Brunei and Germany on 8 September. \c\cOn 11 November 2020, Hong Kong and Singapore have agreed to launch a travel bubble to restart tourism without needing to quarantine at the other end. It was hoped that having a quarantine-free travel would boost tourism and business between the two Asian hubs cities, though anyone travelling between the two cities will have to undergo a compulsory COVID-19 test before they flew. The travel bubble was scheduled to start on 22 November 2020. However, the day before the launch, both cities announced that it would be deferred by two weeks until early December.  This was due to a sudden spike in new infections in Hong Kong. On 1 December, the launch date was deferred again to beyond December 2020. This showed the complexities involved in opening up, even between countries which had coronavirus infections under control. On 29 March 2021, Singapore resumed discussions with Hong Kong after the latter city experienced a significant decline in its daily local COVID-19 cases. On 26 April, both Singapore and Hong Kong confirmed that the air travel bubble would officially re-launch on 26 May. However, after a spike in local infections triggered fresh restrictions in Singapore in late April, Singapore's government stated on 6 May that it would assess any potential changes to the travel bubble. It was eventually announced in August 2021 that the travel bubble would be cancelled, though restrictions on travelers from Hong Kong would ease. \c\cThe retail industry has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, together with food industry. Foot traffic at shopping malls were dropped, with some shops choosing to shorten their opening hours or face massive closures like Esprit Holdings, Isetan Westgate, Liang Court, I12 Katong, H&M Tampines Mall, Topshop, Robinsons and Hotwind. Tenants are pushing landlords for rental rebates, citing significant drops in revenue. \c\cSeveral malls and landlords including Jewel Changi Airport and CapitaLand have implemented rental rebates. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has also implemented rent waivers and rebates for all stallholders in hawker centres operated by NEA or NEA-appointed operators. \c\cAccording to CapitaLand in February 2020, foot traffic at malls were almost back to normal, before being reduced in late-March to early-April 2020 due to social distancing restrictions and circuit breaker measures. Retail sales fell during the COVID-19 pandemic from March to June, citing circuit breaker as a reason. The April and May figure was the worst since records began in 1986. However, retail sales reinstated gradually in July, August and September but the process was interrupted by public places visited by cases in the community. Foot traffic will again resume back to normal fully once Singapore moves to Phase 3. Retail sales and foot traffic again fell during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) from 3 May 2021 to 14 June 2021. \c\cIn response to the government's lockdown measures, Suntec City announced that it would waive rent for all tenants for the month of April, May and June. \c\cIn addition, the Great Singapore Sale was moved online, called e-GSS. \c\cPanic buying and price gouging of personal protective equipment (PPEs) such as masks began with the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Singapore on 23 January 2020. By 24 January, both N95 and surgical masks had run out at retail outlets. This has prompted local retailers including NTUC FairPrice, Watsons and Guardian to originally impose limits, but had a surge in demand. Many areas have began wearing of masks; but on 1 April, the number of people wearing masks have grown up to 93%, with masks made mandatory by the government on 14 April. In addition, mask wearing continues to remain until 29 March 2022, and any easing will be done slowly. \c\cThe shortage of masks and other PPEs has caused many retailers to engage in profiteering by price gouging and scalping. This included both local brick-and-mortar stores as well as retailers on ecommerce platforms. The government has applauded platforms Carousell and Qoo10 for threatening to suspend profiteers. The governmental price controller has also issued warnings to retailers who engage in price gouging and requested information from e-commerce platforms on potential profiteers. \c\cPanic buying and hoarding of essentials such as rice, instant noodles and toilet paper occurred with the raising of the DORSCON level from yellow to orange on 7 February 2020, with empty shelves at supermarkets within hours. Local supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice imposed limits on the amount of essentials each consumer can buy, with these limits initially set for paper products, rice products, instant noodle packets and vegetables. NTUC FairPrice and Dairy Farm Singapore announced that it would introduce specific hours for those members of the community who were more vulnerable such as Pioneer Generation members. Following the review, supermarkets are considered essential services, therefore there is no need to hoard items, it must be opened everyday. \c\cA second wave of panic buying and hoarding occurred on 17 March when Malaysia announced its lockdown from 18 March, sparked by fears of food shortages. The government has clarified that the flow of goods, cargo and food supplies between Singapore and Malaysia will continue, urging the public not to panic buy. They added that Singapore has diverse sources of essential goods and was not facing an immediate shortage of food or essentials. NTUC FairPrice has expanded its list of items that are limited per consumer to include eggs, vegetables and poultry. 10 days later, NTUC FairPrice expanded its list to include canned food, cooking oil and frozen meat, with reduced purchasing limits for paper products. \c\cTo deal with the massive increase in online shopping orders, RedMart on 2 April said that it would prioritise daily essentials such as milk powder, flour, eggs and rice while limiting orders to 35 items and reducing its range of goods to focus on the essentials. It also said that it would stop taking orders until 4 April to implement additional measures. \c\cAhead of tighter measures on 7 April, shoppers queued at shopping malls despite government requests for people to remain at home. \c\cEgg distributors were reporting in June that they now had an oversupply of eggs and were throwing away supplies or culling laying stock. \c\cEven when DORSCON was raised to Orange on 7 February, several religious events still took place. One of them was the Thaipusam procession, which took several precautions like temperature taking and the provision of hand sanitizers and masks to assure devotees. The event ended up attracting 11,500 people, the highest turnout since 2013. Another was the Lantern Festival event in Loyang, which attracted half the usual turnout to about 3,000 people. \c\cAs some of the first cases were found in Christian gatherings at Life Church and Mission and Grace Assembly of God, connected to Chinese New Year celebrations, Singaporean churches tended to be quick to respond to government advisory and suspend in-person church activities and move things online. Some churches, such as New Creation Church already had a fairly sophisticated digital presence and could easily stream services online. Protestant churches also had divided positions as to whether or not to permit online communion. The Catholic Church in Singapore announced that it was suspending masses indefinitely from noon of 15 February. They were set to resume on 14 March, but continue to be indefinitely suspended in light of the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic. \c\cThe Islamic Religious Council of Singapore has asked Muslims to take precautions to maintain personal hygiene while the Singapore Buddhist Federation advised temples to cancel activities. Some churches have opted to suspend services, live streaming them instead. Religious institutions have stepped up disinfection procedures. \c\cOn 12 March, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore announced the closure of all mosques for five days from 13 March for disinfection, coming after two people were infected from a gathering in Malaysia. Prayers were cancelled on 13 March, with activities stopped until 27 March. The closure of mosques is extended until further notice. \c\cHindu Temples and Sikh Temples also recorded a drop in the attendance. Hindu temples in Singapore have stepped up precautionary measures such as checking temperature of the visitors. Some Hindu temples have put measures to provide live streaming of puja for devotees. Some Sikh Temples had to suspend their langar services. However, five private temple were providing langar on a smaller scale. Most processions were also cancelled. \c\cWedding ceremonies were also adversely affected by COVID-19. During the circuit-breaker period, all wedding ceremonies were suspended. This only resumed in phase 1 in a very controlled manner with weddings only able to be done in person at the Registry of Marriages, or at home with no more than 10 persons present. This number was increased to 50 persons in phase 2, and 100 in phase 3; on 24 March, MOH announced that the limit would be further increased from 100 to 250 for solemnisations and receptions from 24 April onwards, with pre-event testing in place. \c\cTaxi and private hire vehicles were hit by the impact of COVID-19. A S$77 million package was provided to help them tide through this period, co-funded by the Government, taxi and private-hire companies. In addition, a S$2.7 million fund was set up by the Government and National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) for drivers who are not eligible. In view of the worsening coronavirus impact, the package will be enhanced from May 2020, extending until September 2020. This will cost an additional $95 million. On 6 April, directors of the ComfortDelGro Group (ComfortDelGro, SBS Transit and VICOM) announced its board of directors would take a voluntary 20 per cent cut in directors\' fees until the end of 2020. \c\cVarious banks have suggested that Singapore Airlines will have a loss in FY21, with OCBC credit analysts Ezien Hoo and Wong Hong Wei arguing that the airline will have to tap the markets for more funds and possibly even need state support. \c\cSingapore Airlines, SilkAir and Scoot have announced plans to slash their capacity. Singapore Airlines slashed nearly all of the capacity until August. The news resulted in STI crashing down by 164.63 (6.83%). Scoot will ground 47 out of the 49 planes they have in their fleet. It was reported on 27 March 2020, SIA received a rescue package of S$19 billion to get over the difficult period. Its major shareholder Temasek Holdings will underwrite the package which contains S$5.3 billion equity and S$9.7 billion convertible note. Singapore's biggest bank DBS will also lend it S$4 billion to help it get over the crisis and position itself for expansion. With the significant reduction in flights, Singapore Airlines agreed to provide some 300 staff to help with possible manpower shortages at hospitals in Singapore and provided some staff to deal with transport ambassadors. It was announced that the airline would consolidate all their Changi Airport operations from 1 May 2020 to Terminal 3. On 14 May 2020, Singapore Airlines announced a full year loss for Financial Year 2019/2020 of S$212 million, this was the first loss in its 48 years of operation. On 1 September 2020, Singapore Airlines have announced to reinstate several destinations that have opened up travel such as Bandar Seri Begawan, Auckland, Christchurch, Taipei, Hong Kong, Macau, Hanoi, Brisbane, Perth and Sydney. For airlines, regulations for social distancing are not applicable to save costs. Mask wearing continues to be mandatory and airlines will upgrade their apps to include contact tracing. Overnight flights will also be re-introduced which allows even quieter rides. On 25 June Jetstar Asia Airways announced that it was cutting up to 180 people, almost a quarter of the workforce in Singapore. At the same time they would allow the retirement of five of their A320 fleet, bringing the total down to 13. \c\cThe Land Transport Authority announced that all certificate of entitlement (COE) bidding for the month of April would be suspended. \c\cTransport services were gradually reduced in stages. Last train timings were brought forward to early, and transport frequencies were remained to allow safe distancing. Measures also involve imposition of queuing at station exit points. Cross-border bus services 160 and 170 were amended to serve only local sectors of its route, while Cross-border services 170X and 950 were suspended in lieu of Malaysia's Movement Control Order. All City Direct, Chinatown Direct, NightRider, NiteOwl and Express bus services were temporarily suspended in tranches from 8 April 2020 until 1 June 2020, with the exception of Express 89e which was reinstated on 24 April 2020 to better serve essential workers at the Changi Airfreight Centre, and all bus services resumed on 2 June 2020 with the exception of services 188R, 401, 926, 963R, Chinatown Direct and all night services; the latter is due to low demand. Train and bus services are no longer extended except for New Year's Eve whereby last train departs City Hall at 1.15 am. \c\cThe quarantine and testing of all foreign workers in dormitories has caused delays in the construction of various MRT projects, including the delay of the Thomson–East Coast line's Stage 2 opening on 28 August 2021, after a few extensions. The LTA has been yet to fully assess the length of delays on the other stages of the line and of other MRT projects. \c\cSeveral parties have engaged in scams related to the pandemic. For instance, scammers have pretended to be MOH officials engaging in contact tracing. The MOH and police clarified that no financial details or transfer of money will be requested during contact tracing. The police have also arrested scammers on e-commerce platform Carousell. On 4 April, SPF announced that they had arrested a man for suspected money-laundering offences in relation to a COVID-19 linked scam which saw an overseas pharmaceutical company defrauded to the tune of €6.636 million (S$10.3 million) over the purchase of surgical masks and hand sanitisers. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and SPF were investigating possible abuses of the COVID-19 Temporary Relief Fund (TRF), which is supposed to provide financial assistance to those eligible. There were cases of scammers impersonating the Chinese police force asking for many personal details. A total of 394 COVID-19-related scams occurred between January and April, with losses totalling S$1.4 million. There have also been false rumours of National Environment Agency and police officers actively checking residential units to ensure that people were complying with circuit breaker rules. \c\cOn 16 March, the Malaysian government announced a movement control order (MCO) that took effect on 18 March, preventing Malaysians from leaving the country. With approximately 300,000 Malaysians, or almost a tenth of Singapore's labour force working in Singapore, the MCO would have been expected to significantly affect Singapore's economy, including sectors providing essential services. \c\cThe MCO caused long queues at immigration checkpoints as Malaysian workers in Singapore scrambled to collect their belongings and return to Singapore, while Singaporeans returned home. Various firms across Singapore rushed to find temporary accommodation for their workers before the MCO took effect. The Singapore government advised workers to try to stay with relatives, friends, and colleagues, and seek housing in hotels, dormitories and rental flats if this was not possible. The government also provided $50 for each worker per day, up to 14 days to support employers finding accommodation. As of 17 March, the government announced that 10,000 Malaysian workers had been matched with temporary housing. Some workers could not immediately find accommodations and resorted to sleeping in public areas. In response, Ministry of Social and Family Development repurposed Jurong East Sports Hall into a temporary relief area for remaining Malaysian workers who were unable to find temporary accommodations immediately after the MCO took effect, while the Ministry of Manpower stepped up patrols to look out for such stranded workers. A number of residents also stepped up to offer their spare rooms to accommodate Malaysian workers at little to no cost. \c\cThe MCO resulted in suspension of all bus services between Johor Bahru and Singapore. While the KTMB Shuttle Tebrau train service continues to operate between the two checkpoints, only citizens returning to their respective countries are allowed to board. The lockdown also sparked fears of food shortages, triggering a second wave of panic buying and hoarding of essential items. On 26 April, Malaysia announced that Malaysians wanting to return to Malaysia will need to obtain permits from the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore. However, only 400 of such permits will be issued daily. \c\cSingapore began to restrict travellers from entering from 29 January in a progressive manner as a response to localised outbreaks. Travelers from Hubei were banned from entering Singapore on 29 January with all forms of visas held by Hubei residents being suspended immediately on the same day. Any traveller who had travelled to mainland China 14 days prior to 1 February was also banned from entering Singapore. Chinese passport holders were allowed entry on the condition they can prove they did not visit China recently. At the same time, on 1 February, all forms of visas for Chinese travellers were suspended immediately. When there was a large increase in the number of cases in Cheongdo and Daegu, South Korea, visitors arriving from these two areas were restricted from entering Singapore, as well, from 26 February. By March, visitors arriving from other territories or countries, such as, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Spain, and Germany were banned. Port calls for all cruise vessels were stopped from 13 March as well. \c\cOne of the earliest recorded travel advisory on travelling to or from Singapore issued by other countries, was United Kingdom, on 24 January 2020. It encouraged its subjects to self-isolate and quarantine after returning from Singapore. Other countries such as Britain, Indonesia, Indonesia soon began to issue their own travel advisories, with language generally advising their citizens to avoid unnecessary or non-essential travel to Singapore. By 20 March 2020, there were at least 14 countries with travel advisories against Singapore, either specifically or as part of a general travel restriction on their citizens. As the number countries with travel advisories rapidly expanded, the travel restrictions have been broadly categorised into:\c\cDeny entry – where countries would deny entry to travellers who have been in or transiting through Singapore in the last 14 days;\c\cAllow entry, subjected to self-isolation/quarantine – where countries would allow entry, but subject travellers to either 14-day self-isolation or quarantine regime;\c\cAllow entry upon medical screening clearance – where countries would allow unrestricted entry after clearing required medical screenings such as temperature checks and/or swab tests. \c\cFrom 17 March, Singapore required all visitors who had travelled 14 days prior to ASEAN countries, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to be served with a 14-day Stay Home Notice, with ASEAN travellers required to seek approval before entering Singapore. However, this requirement was waived for Singapore's sea and land crossings with Malaysia as it was deemed too disruptive to the 200,000 people who use the crossings on a daily basis. This exemption was short-lived as the Malaysian government would soon implement a movement control order that would take effect from 18 March, preventing Malaysians from leaving and most foreigners from entering the country. Singapore authorities and businesses quickly made arrangements to secure alternate living accommodations in Singapore for workers living in Malaysia. Both Singapore and Malaysia authorities quickly worked to ensure that the essential goods could still cross the two land checkpoints, with further fine-tuning of transportation arrangement being subsequently conducted as there were still confusion by some of the supplying companies in Malaysia. \c\cSingapore banned all short-term visitors arriving or transiting through Singapore from 23 March onwards, with only people in essential services like healthcare and transport allowed entry during this time. \c\cDue to the reduced number of flights, Singapore Changi Airport suspended operations at Terminals 2 and 4 in April and May 2020 respectively. The suspension of Terminal 2 would also bring forward the renovation plans that the airport has for it, while Terminal 4 would remain suspended indefinitely until the demand for flights picks up and airlines seek to relaunch flights. Malaysia would also shorten the operating hours of Sultan Iskandar Building at the Johor Causeway to 12 hours daily from 24 April, effectively limiting the Causeway's operating hours. The Second Link crossing would remain open round the clock. \c\cOn 28 June, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Muhyiddin Yassin agreed that their governments will work together to establish a Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) allowing residents from both nations who hold long-term immigration passes for business and work purposes in the other country to periodically return to their home countries for short-term home leave. \c\cOn 14 July, Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and his Malaysian counterpart Hishammuddin Hussein announced that cross-border travel and traffic between the two countries would resume on 10 August 2020 under two schemes: the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA). The RGL scheme will allow essential business and official travel between the two countries while the PCA scheme will allow Singaporean and Malaysian residents who hold long-term immigration business and work passes to enter for work purposes. \c\cCruises were restarted in November but did not have any other port of call other than Singapore. In early December, an 83-year-old man tested positive on board and the ship had to return to Singapore a day early. Subsequent retests of the sample and additional samples proved the original test to be a false positive. \c\cOn 30 January 2021, the Singaporean Government suspended "travel bubble" arrangements with Malaysia, Germany and South Korea in response to a spike in cases globally and the emergence of new variants. \c\cOn 23 March 2021, The Singaporean and Malaysian Foreign Ministers Balakrishnan and Hussein have confirmed that the two governments had plans to recognise each other's COVID-19 vaccine certificates with the goal of restoring cross-border travel in the near-future. \c\cOn 24 April 2021, Singapore banned all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors, with recent travel history to India within the last 14 days, from entering. It was due to the worsening COVID-19 situation in India and more virus strains being discovered. \c\cOn 17 May 2021, in the wake of increased COVID-19 cases in Taiwan, all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to Taiwan was served a 21-day stay-home notice. \c\cAs the pandemic spread throughout the world, the Singapore government had organised several repatriation efforts to bring Singaporeans back from various overseas locations. Beginning with Wuhan, Hubei where the virus was first detected, a number of Singaporeans were trapped in Wuhan as the Chinese authorities had locked down the entire Hubei province, thus suspending air links between the city and Singapore. Liaising with counterparts in the Chinese government and its embassy in Beijing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore (MFA) managed to bring back 266 Singaporeans and family members on two separate Scoot flights on 30 January and 9 February. MFA and other governmental agencies subsequently brought back at least 1,000 Singaporeans, permanent residents, and family members stranded at other locations where there were similar lockdowns and suspension of flights: Cambodia, Egypt, Fiji, India, Iran, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, and the UK. Most of the evacuees were brought back on direct flights, whilst some in Fiji, Iran, Nepal, and Slovenia saw some assistance from other countries. All evacuees had to serve a 14-day Stay Home Notice or be quarantined at designated locations, such as hotels with cost borne by the government, government quarantine faculties, or at home. \c\cWith flights to Wuhan suspended due to the Hubei lockdown, Scoot had offered two one-way flights back to Wuhan for tourists stuck in Singapore. As the travel restrictions began to grow and accumulated into an ongoing ban on short-term visitors arriving or transiting through Singapore started from 23 March, Singapore has allowed visitors to transit through Singapore if they are being repatriated by various governments. India had repatriated some of its citizens from Singapore in May 2020 on two separate flights. In the same flight which Singapore Airlines brought back Singaporeans from Cambodia on 12 April, it also carried Australians heading back to Australia with Singapore being a transit point. It was reported that Singapore and Bangladesh were in discussions to repatriate their respective citizens if necessary. \c\cBoth the Singapore government and private sector sent support packages to Indonesia, including test kits and personal protective equipment. The Singapore government sent swabs and other supplies to Malaysia to help with sample collection and testing. Temasek Foundation donated 30,000 test kits to India and this was affirmed and thanked by High Commissioner of India to Singapore, Jawed Ashraf. Indian low-cost airline SpiceJet operated flights carrying the test kits and other medical equipment from Singapore to both Bangalore and Chennai. \c\cIn December 2020, Singapore pledged US$5 million towards COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX), a WHO-led global initiative aimed at securing COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. Together with Switzerland, Singapore co-chairs "Friends of the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility", which comprises the European Union and the following 14 nations: Australia, Canada, Iceland, Israel, Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Norway, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. \c\cOn 26 April 2021, the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) and Little India Shopkeepers Association (LISHA) initiated and launched a relief fund to raise money and support India in its fight against COVID-19. \c\cWith the impact of COVID-19 becoming greater, it was becoming clear to analysts that Singapore would need to respond with large scale government spending. As of 26 May, Singapore has unveiled four Budgets that will spend 19.2% of GDP to ensure the impact on the economy is softened and to help the economy recover back to the original state. Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has said that based on economic terms, the economic contraction will be the worst ever since Singapore's independence. The government announced on 4 June that they would be keeping Central Provident Fund contribution rates unchanged as they believed the Jobs Support Scheme would help reduce the burden on employers. \c\cIt was announced on 1 February that the Government will provide help for the transport and tourism sectors as part of the 2020 Budget, being the worst-hit industries by the impact of COVID-19. In the 2020 Budget delivered on 18 February, the Government has set aside S$6.4 billion in support funds, which are a S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package for household expenses, a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package for businesses and workers and an additional S$800 million for efforts including the healthcare sector. In addition, the Goods and Services Tax will not be raised by 9% in 2021 owing to the economic impact, with a S$6 billion Assurance Package should it be raised by 2025. \c\cLess than a month after the first budget support package was introduced, it was announced that the government was working a second stimulus package to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the economy. The package was delivered in a Ministerial Statement by DPM Heng Swee Keat on 26 March, known as the Resilience Budget. COVID-19 has hit the economy so hard that President Halimah had given her \'in-principle support\' to draw on past reserves for this second package, which will amount to S$17 billion. In addition to S$6.4 billion announced in the first package, the government is prepared to spend a further S$48.4 billion to support businesses, workers and families, amounting to around 11% of GDP. \c\cAmong the measures include increasing government co-funding of 25% of wages for all local workers, with those in food services getting 50% support and those in the tourism and aviation sector getting up to 75% support. Self-employed workers would receive S$1,000 per month. These measures would last for nine months. \c\cA$350 million aviation support package was introduced to fund the measures such as rebates on waiving off parking charges. \c\cIn spite of this large spending package, several private sector economists were still expecting the economy to contract in 2020. \c\cIt was announced on 5 April that Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat would propose a third round of support measures through a "Solidarity Budget" when Parliament returned on 6 April. A total of S$5.1 billion was allocated for the package, with S$4 billion to be drawn from past reserves. Due to the extended Circuit Breaker announced on 21 April, support measures from the "Solidarity Budget" were extended to May, costing another S$3.8 billion. \c\cOn 10 May, the Ministry of Finance announced that 32 companies had returned Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payouts worth S$35 million and had said they would not receive future payments related to JSS. Other companies that had previously received JSS monies, had said that while they retain what they had already received, they would also not receive further payments. \c\cOn 19 May, it was announced that Finance Minister Heng would propose a fourth round of support measures at a statement delivered to Parliament on 26 May at 3.30 pm. On 25 May, President Halimah gave her in-principle approval for the Government to draw on the reserves for the package, the second time it was done for this crisis. The budget has since been named the "Fortitude Budget". It was announced that the government would draw an additional S$32 billion from past reserves, bringing the total used to S$52 billion. In addition, another S$13 billion will be set aside for contingencies due to the pandemic. Extending and enhancing the JSS, to include higher tiers of wage subsidies and lasting until August, would cost around S$2.9 billion, bringing the total cost to S$23.5 billion. To thank Singaporeans for working from home during the "circuit breaker", the government introduced a one off Solidarity Utilities Credit of S$100 for all households. Food and beverage (F&B) and retail companies would receive up to S$10,000 as part of efforts to digitally transform their businesses, as they are likely to be seriously affected by safe distancing rules after the circuit breaker is lifted. S$2 billion was committed to SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package was announced to create close some 100,000 opportunities for workers affected by the COVID-19 economic slowdown; involving around 40,000 jobs, 25,000 traineeships and 30,000 skills training opportunities. The public sector will create more jobs, with the majority coming from the early childhood and healthcare sectors. \c\cAfter announcing more draw downs of the reserves, Minister Heng warned that Singapore's financial position would be weaker going forward, but the government would do try to mitigate the negative effects. \c\cTo help financial institutions and FinTech companies tide over the virus, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) released a $125 million package to help financial institutions and FinTech companies to strengthen long-term capabilities. \c\cOn 14 April, the Infocomm Media Development Authority announced that they will launch Public Service Content worth S$8 million and fund 90% of the course fees for Self-Employed Persons under Talent Assistance (T-Assist) Programme. To reduce operating costs, the Film Exhibition and Distribution Licence Fees will be waived from 17 April. \c\cEvery Singaporean who would be aged 18 and above in 2020 would receive S$100 worth of SingapoRediscovers vouchers, which can be used for a variety activities to support the local tourism industry. They were planned to be usable between December 2020 and June 2021 and would be paid via SingPass. Additionally, Trip.com has a "Pay It Forward" campaign throughout this usable period, where people can use their vouchers to pay for tourism products for various beneficiary groups. When the vouchers were launched, there were some complaints from Singaporeans about the complex way the vouchers were to be redeemed. \c\cOn 30 April 2021, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) announced that the expiry date of the SingapoRediscovers vouchers will be extended to 31 December 2021, and that improvements to the redemption process will be rolled out. \c\cOn 18 February and 10 March, the WHO praised Singapore's efforts to contain COVID-19 infections through tracing and quarantining close contacts, testing every case of influenza-like illness and pneumonia, and Singapore's "all-government approach" in the containment of COVID-19. The Singapore Police Force, Singapore Armed Forces and Ministry of Health are coordinating to do aggressive contact tracing. While many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, The New York Times argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties. Despite effective handling of initial waves of infection, serious outbreaks in April have brought the situation in Singapore out of control; many analysts points to poor conditions at foreign workers dormitories as a major factor of the failure. \c\cIt was reported in February that healthcare workers faced mistreatment from the public. President Halimah Yacob urged Singaporeans to appreciate the work of healthcare workers. Grab announced that they will be launching GrabCare to transport healthcare workers to and from their work places. \c\cOn 12 April, CNA reported that some staff members of Lee Ah Mooi, a nursing home, were evicted by landlords. However, the authorities had also mentioned that landlords who evict tenants on Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notices would be penalised. \c\cOn 17 February, a leaked recording of a closed-door dialogue session on 10 February of Chan Chun Sing with business people from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) went viral in Singapore. In the 25-minute recording, Mr. Chan spoke candidly about the supply of surgical masks, which he said were not the solution and should be reserved for the hospital system, as well as characterizing panic buyers as a small group who behaved like "idiots" and would "kill" Singapore's ability to negotiate prices of key supplies internationally. In response, SCCCI said that the leak is "deeply disappointing" and a "betrayal of trust", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak. \c\cThe pandemic brought the living conditions at foreign worker dormitories to media attention. Dormitories were reported to be unsanitary and crowded, making preventive measures like social distancing difficult. Retired diplomat Tommy Koh criticised the living conditions, calling it "third world" and "a time bomb waiting to explode". Amnesty International called the situation a "recipe for disaster". Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo vowed to improve the living conditions of foreign workers after the quarantine was handled. \c\cWhile churches in the 1960s and 1970s historically championed social justice and advocacy for worker rights within the Singaporean civil society, this has declined over the years due to the rise of a middle class and a dependency on state-centric growth. During the pandemic, Singaporean churches sought ways to bring about "neighbourly love" and national prayer. But some criticised this as not being enough to address the inequalities experienced by foreign workers who were disproportionately affected by the virus. \c\cOn 9 April, MOM said in a press release that it will improve quality of meals of foreign workers during quarantine and formed a task force to improve the living conditions of foreign workers. As of 25 April 25 dormitories have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some healthy workers are also progressively being moved to numerous empty premises such as SAF camps, HDB blocks, floating hotels and Changi Exhibition Centre. On 16 April, Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo said that there will be a "three-pronged strategy"; containing the spread, imposing lockdowns and separating workers in essential services. 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23 January 2020. Early cases were primarily imported until local transmission began to develop in February and March. By late-March and April, COVID-19 clusters were detected at multiple sleeping quarters, for which soon contributed to an overwhelming proportion of new cases in the country. \c\cOn 22 January 2020, a multi-ministerial committee was formed with Minister of Finance, Lawrence Wong and Minister of Trade and Industry, Gan Kim Yong as the co-chairs and Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong and Deputy Prime Minister, Heng Swee Keat as advisors. On 23 April 2021, Lee announced the appointment of Ong Ye Kung as the Minister for Health, another committee co-chair alongside incumbents Lawrence Wong and Gan Kim Yong from 15 May 2021. Singapore also contributed US$500,000 to support the World Health Organization's (WHO) efforts against COVID-19. \c\cIn response to the growing number of new cases in early 2020, Singapore enacted the "COVID-19 Control Order", announcing on 3 April 2020 a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the "circuit breaker lockdown". Initially planned to be applied from 7 April to 4 May, the circuit breaker lockdown was extended to 1 June on 21 April following continued untraced transmission within the community. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 19 May announced the three-phased approach to resume activities safely with the gradual re-opening of economic activities in each phase; Phase 1 lasted for 17 days from 2 June and ended on 18 June, with Phase 2 lasting for 6 months and 8 days from 19 June to 27 December. Singapore was in Phase 3 from 28 December 2020 until 7 May 2021; following a spike in community cases from late April to early May 2021, it temporarily reverted to Phase 2 on 8 May, which was raised to "Heightened Alert" as a tightened measure from 16 May to 13 June. Following a brief period in "Phase 3 Heightened Alert", Singapore again reverted to Phase 2 Heightened Alert on 22 July 2021 after a fresh surge of community cases from early to mid-July. A mass vaccination programme is currently under way following the approval and acquisition of the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. \c\cAs of 20 August 2021, 1,078 active cases remain out of a total of 66,406 confirmed cases, with 65,242 recoveries and 46 deaths. Singapore currently has a case fatality rate of 0.07%, one of the lowest in the world. It introduced what was considered one of the largest and best-organised epidemic control programs in the world, along with fellow neighbouring countries such as South Korea and Vietnam. Various measures have been taken to mass test the population for the virus, such as isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps such as TraceTogether (both app and token) and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with. Such measures has helped avoid further lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020. \c\cOn 31 December 2019, health authorities in China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), after mounting evidence that the novel coronavirus had spread to 18 countries and completion of investigation in Wuhan. \c\cThroughout the outbreak, cases were traced to clusters that several cases had visited during a particular time period, with venues including religious institutions, workplaces, construction sites, a number of schools, private events, retail businesses, and a hospital. Imported cases also became a source of infection in March. From early April to late September, most new cases were at foreign worker dormitories and construction sites, while imported cases formed the bulk of new cases from early October; as of 20 August 2021, there are a total of 54,688 dormitory residents, 6,625 cases in the community, and 5,093 imported cases. 20 April 2020 saw the highest number of daily cases at 1,426, while 12 May saw 20,799 active cases – the highest since the outbreak began. The last date of any patient in ICU was 19 August 2021. 14 August 2020 was the first time since June that there were no reported community cases, while 1 October 2020 was the first time since April that the daily number of imported cases exceeded that of dormitory cases. 13 October 2020 was the first time in over six months that no dormitory cases were reported, with 15 June 2021 being the first time in over eleven months that no imported cases were reported. \c\cInternationally, the case fatality ratio (CFR) for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS in 2003. The transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus powering the COVID-19 pandemic has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. However, Singapore's death rate has been one of the world's lowest, both in terms of CFR and per capita. This may be attributed to the fact that the bulk of the cases are restricted to the migrant workers living in dormitories away from the general population. These migrant workers tend to be younger, with an average age of 30 years and 2 months old when surveyed in 2015, and the healthcare system was never overwhelmed. The authorities also tested the entire dormitory population for COVID-19 infection, leading to many otherwise asymptomatic infections being picked up. Research by the European Commission suggests that the CFR for SARS-CoV-2 virus picks up in cases 50 years of age and above. The elderly in the general population in Singapore have been advised to stay at home as much as possible, while resident-facing staff in old folks homes are being housed on site or separately in hotels. \c\cOther factors contributing to Singapore's exceptionally low CFR include the country's use of extensive contact tracing and testing to identify cases, mandatory mask-wearing, and hospitalisation of all high-risk patients. Singapore has comparatively strict criteria for classifying COVID-19 deaths, counting patients who were infected with COVID but died of other causes as non-COVID deaths. \c\cPrevalence studies on the population have shown that 4 in 1600 in the community, or about 0.25%, have previously been infected with COVID-19, while at least 47% of migrant workers living in dormitories have tested positive by PCR or serological tests. \c\cNational authorities began reporting suspected cases on 4 January, however the first confirmed case was reported on 23 January, a tourist from Wuhan. Until 30 January, there were a total of 13 confirmed cases, all of whom were visitors to Singapore from China. The first case involving a Singaporean was confirmed on 31 January after returning from Wuhan. Contact tracing procedures were put in place to identify close contacts of the confirmed cases who were placed under 14-day quarantines to ring-fence the potential spread of the virus. \c\cThese imported cases eventually lead to clusters of local transmissions being formed. The first cluster was reported on 4 February at Yong Thai Hang, a shop that mainly serves Chinese tourists. It was identified as the locus of the infection where four women without recent history of travel to China contracted the virus. The shop was affected when a tour group from Guangxi, China visited it along with other locations such as the Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive, where another case occurred, while touring Singapore. The tour group had returned to China and the Chinese authorities had confirmed that two of the group was infected. Authorities then raised the nation's Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange after more cases with unclear origins surfaced on 7 February, with Prime Minister Lee expressing his worry about some cases with no known chain of transmission of the infection directly from Wuhan or indirectly via cases traced in Singapore. He suggested that it might become "futile to try to trace every contact". More clusters emerged at various locations, where there were large scale gatherings such as a business conference, Chinese New Year dinner gatherings and church-related activities. Two clusters were linked when several cases in each cluster was found to have infected each other through serological tests, the first such successful test in the world. \c\cIn March, as the number of cases began to rise exponentially around the world, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) began to encourage Singaporeans to return home. Various institutes of higher learning recalled their students currently on overseas internship or exchange, and the MFA began liaising with airlines to facilitate flights to key cities when necessary during this period, to cater to demand for return flights to Singapore. This led to an increase in number of imported cases, in which over 70% of cases from 16 to 19 March were Singaporeans and long-term pass holders returning from overseas. \c\cOn 7 April circuit breaker (lockdown) measures were imposed on the general population. The bulk of cases began to shift from imported cases to migrant workers living in dormitories, resulting in the authorities imposing a mandatory quarantine of 20,000 migrant workers in two dormitories gazetted as isolation areas, namely the S11 Dormitory and Westlite Toh Guan. Following which, the number of cases in migrant worker dormitories began to soar as more clusters were detected in other migrant worker dormitories, reaching a single-daily high of 1,426 cases recorded amongst migrant workers on 20 April. On 21 April, MOM announced that all foreign workers in dormitories were to stop work until 4 May to curb the rising spread of the coronavirus among the groups that were hit the hardest. The number of daily cases amongst migrant workers living in dormitories gradually decreased but continued to remain in the hundreds until early August, with aggressive testing by the authorities. April also marked a shift in policy. The government stopped automatically admitting the infected in hospitals and instead created community care facilities for those who were at low risk, which allowed hospitals to focus only on those in higher risk categories. At the peak on 12 May, there were 19,667 patients in community care facilities. This allowed hospitals to reduce bed take up related to COVID-19 from more than a thousand to several hundred in a few weeks. 18 September saw the first time since the crisis spread to work dormitories that the daily dorm case number fell into single digits. \c\cFrom May onwards, the vast majority of cases were reported in dormitories, with community cases never rising above 24 cases, which was reported on 11 July. Nevertheless, while numbers in the dorms remained elevated in May, 20 April in fact represented the peak of daily cases reported among dormitory workers. By August, it was clear that the situation in dormitories was being brought under control, with new daily cases among dorm workers finally falling below 100 on 11 August. On 11 August, Ministry of Manpower announced that all dormitories had been declared cleared of COVID-19 (except for those blocks that were being used for quarantine facilities). By 1 October less than 300 people were being housed in community care facilities, down from the almost 20,000 from the May peak. However, it also became clear that controlling the disease was going to be extremely difficult. While total case numbers had continued to decline, unlinked community cases had begun to edge up and some dorms that had been cleared of infection were once again put on lockdown. A significant milestone was achieved on 13 October when it was announced that, for the first time since March, there were no local cases of infection. This was followed shortly by 16 October, when the number of active cases fell to less than 100 – the first time since 12 March, and by 25 November, when it was announced that there were no active clusters for the first time since the pandemic began. \c\cOn 24 December, Singapore has confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus variant found in the United Kingdom. The variant, known as B.1.525, has the E484K spike protein mutation, which is also present in the so-called South African variant and is the key mutation found so far that could undermine the effectiveness of vaccines. \c\cOn 31 December 2020, 2 new clusters were formed out of the 5 community cases reported that day, all of whom were linked to the marine sector. Two additional clusters were formed on 17 and 19 January 2021; the first was from 2 community cases linked to a para-vet working with the Singapore Police Force's K-9 unit, with the second from 2 community cases linked to a worker at Golden Bridge Foods Manufacturing. Another cluster consisting of four community cases linked to an employee at BS Industrial & Construction Supply was formed on 20 January. 2 new clusters were identified on 21 and 24 April; the first was a household cluster of 3 community cases linked to a 43-year-old Indian national and work pass holder who was possibly re-infected, while the second was a group of 4 community cases who were linked to a 39-year-old Indonesian sailor. On 29 April, a new household cluster was formed out of 7 community cases that were linked to a 38-year-old Singaporean ICA officer working at Changi Airport, with another cluster formed out of 8 community cases linked to a 46-year-old Filipino nurse working at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. \c\cAfter banning short term arrivals in March, imported cases fell dramatically. However, since the beginning of July, there was a steady trickle of imported cases as the government loosened arrival requirements, with the majority of cases arriving from India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. January 2021 saw a sharp spike in imported cases, of which foreign domestic workers formed the bulk due to the high demand for maids amidst the pandemic. \c\cOn 23 April 2021, Singapore banned all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from India, which was experiencing a second wave believed to be fuelled by a strain with a double mutation. This was followed by a ban on all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka on 30 April, which was later extended to all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors worldwide on 4 May. In addition, it was announced that Singapore would temporarily revert to Phase 2 from 8 to 30 May. However, by then it was too late to stop the strain from entering Singapore, with the government announcing on 4 May that the variant had been detected among locally transmitted cases in the community. A new cluster was formed out of 4 community cases linked to an 88-year-old cleaner working at Changi Airport's Terminal 3, who tested positive on 5 May; by 14 May it had become Singapore's largest active cluster at 59 cases, with at least 17 testing preliminarily positive for the "double mutant" variant. Subsequently, MOH announced that there would be more restrictions lasting from 16 May to 13 June, following reports of increasing cases in the Changi Airport cluster and several institutes of education. Dining-in would no longer be allowed, and the maximum number of persons in a social gathering would be further reduced to two, among other restrictions. MOE also announced that all Singapore primary schools, secondary schools and junior colleges were to move to full home-based learning starting on 19 May. \c\cAfter a decline in community cases, it was announced that Singapore would re-enter "Phase 3 Heightened Alert", with re-opening to commence in two stages. The first stage would begin on 14 June with the limit on social gatherings increased to 5 people, while the next stage would begin on 21 June with the resumption of dining-in with 5 people. However, a new cluster was formed at the 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Center that was linked to a 74-year old store owner who tested positive on 9 June, which resulted in a fresh surge of community cases. Consequently, the second stage of re-opening was adjusted so that only 2 persons would be allowed for dining-in. With the stabilisation of community infections in early July 2021, it was announced that dining-in with groups of up to 5—along with wedding receptions—would resume on 12 July; MOH also raised the possibility of more restrictions being eased from 1 August 2021, should the situation remain stable and after at least half the population has been fully-vaccinated. \c\cIn addition, MOE announced on 14 June that Primary 4–6, Secondary 3–5, and junior college and Millennia Institute students would be able to return to school on 28 June, and Secondary 1–2 students on 1 July; all students from other levels would return on 6 July. \c\cOn 12 July, a new cluster was formed at several KTV lounges out of 3 community cases linked to a short-term visit pass holder from Vietnam who first tested positive on 11 July, leading to another massive surge in cases. The KTV lounges were subsequently put under investigation for possibly deliberately breaching COVID-19 safety measures; at least 20 women were arrested, with 3 former nightlife outlets having their F&B licenses revoked. In response, MOH announced that all nightlife-turned-F&B establishments would be suspended from 16 to 30 July, during which all staff would undergo testing. Dining-in would also revert back to groups of 2 from 19 July to 8 August, though fully-vaccinated people would be allowed to continue dining-in in groups of 5. Another new cluster that contributed to the surge was formed on 16 July out of 7 community cases at Jurong Fishery Port; Health Minister Ong Ye Kung later confirmed that the two clusters were linked. In the wake of the rapidly increasing number of cases, it was announced on 20 July that Singapore would return to "Phase 2 Heightened Alert" from 22 July to 18 August. Dining-in was banned once more with the limit on social gatherings reduced to 2, though gyms were not shut this time round. \c\cOn 6 August 2021, it was announced that due to Singapore having successfully vaccinated 66% of its population, restrictions would be eased in two phases; from 10 August, dining-in at restaurants would resume with a limit of up to 5 fully-vaccinated persons, while the limit for non-vaccinated persons and dining-in at hawker centres would remain at 2. From 19 August, half of employees currently working from home could return to the workplace. \c\cThe authorities took cautious measures as the economy began to reopen to more regular outside travellers in August. Travellers who did not quarantine in a dedicated facility would have to wear an electronic tag throughout the 14-day period. Singapore also implemented a Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) with Malaysia, allowing limited travel between the two countries. Later in the month, arrivals from certain countries had their 14-day quarantine reduced to 7 days; those arriving from Brunei and New Zealand who were tested negative upon arrival would be allowed in without any quarantine. On 30 September 2020, the Singapore government announced that the country will lift border restrictions for some visitors from Australia, excluding Victoria state, and Vietnam, beginning from 8 October 2020; restrictions for Victoria state and mainland China were lifted on 6 November. In October 2020, then-Minister of Transport Ong Ye Kung suggested that Singapore would be looking to open travel bubbles with various countries such as those with similar risk profiles, but also for those countries from higher risk locations. One such travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong was to have started on 22 November; initially postponed to 2021 due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, it was eventually canceled in August 2021 due to conflicting strategies between the city-states. \c\cTo stop the spread of COVID-19, the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 and its Control Order Regulations 2020 was brought into force. These rules banned gatherings and led some to be charged in court, fined or even jailed for offences related to these laws. A number of people who were on work passes have had their passes revoked and have also been permanently banned from working in Singapore. \c\cThe ongoing pandemic is likely to have a significant impact on the local economy. On 17 February 2020, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) downgraded Singapore's forecast GDP growth to between −0.5% and 1.5%. This is largely due to the fall in tourism and social distancing restrictions. On 26 March, MTI said it believed that the economy would contract by between 1% and 4% in 2020. This was after the economy shrank some 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same quarter in 2019. On 26 May, the Singapore economy contracted 0.7%YoY, which was better than the expected contraction of 2.2%. However, MTI said that it was revising down its expectation for the Singapore economy in 2020 to shrink by 4% to 7%. Economists were behind the curve in downgrading their numbers. The IMF for example, predicted in October 2019 that growth in 2020 would be 1%, but as a result of COVID-19, had changed their expectation in October 2020 to a contraction of 6%. Other institutions initially expected the economy to expand but had to revise their numbers. \c\cOn 2 April 2020, the rating's agency Moody's downgraded the Singapore banking sector from "stable" outlook to a "negative" outlook on the back of rising bad loans and deteriorating profitability as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was estimated by the economist Chua Hak Bin, the lockdown "circuit breaker" beginning on 7 April could impact the economy to the tune of S$10 billion. With the lockdown imposed on foreign workers, there were concerns that there could be delays in construction work of up to six months. Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat announced that some 3,800 companies had closed in April 2020, only slightly higher than the 3,700 reported on average for the same month in the past 5 years. Though he warned that this would likely rise in the coming months. Despite this only small increase in companies shutting down, the number of companies starting up had declined by about a third from the average April since 2015. \c\cOn 6 April 2020, it was announced in Parliament that Changi Airport Terminal 2 would be suspended from 1 May 2020 for 18 months due to the ongoing pandemic. Terminal 4 would later be suspended on 16 May indefinitely as well, with the aim to restart operations when travel demand returns. The suspension of Terminal 2 would also allow the ongoing expansion work which was announced in January 2020 to be completed up to a year ahead of schedule in 2023 instead of 2024. The airlines which were operating from these two terminals were largely consolidated into the remaining Terminals 1 and 3, with some airlines remained suspended until further notice. \c\cIn November 2020, the MTI announced Singapore's economy contracted 5.8% in the third quarter from the same period in 2019. It also expected the economy to shrink contract by between 6% and 6.5% in 2020, though in 2021 it expected an expansion of between 4% and 6% next year. \c\cData released by the Ministry of Manpower showed that total employment contracted by 57,000 in 2020, which was the biggest drop since SARS in 2003. Foreign workers were vulnerable to being let go during the crisis as support measures such as the Jobs Support Scheme were primarily targeted as subsidising the wages of local staff not all employees. There were some 22,200 fewer foreign employees (excluding domestic workers) between December 2019 and March 2020. Ministry of Manpower reported that unemployment in the first quarter of 2020 rose to 2.4 per cent from 2.3 per cent the quarter previously, the highest in a decade, while among Singaporeans it rose from 3.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent. \c\cAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, various companies like Resorts World Sentosa reduced a significant amount of its workforce. \c\cLocal firms had to take aggressive action to deal with effects of the pandemic. For example, on 10 September 2020, Singapore Airlines announced that it would cut around 4,300 positions across its group. On 15 September 2020, United Overseas Bank announced that it was limiting hiring. \c\cThe overall inflation dropped to 0.3% in February 2020 on a year-by-year basis. Core inflation, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road transport, dropped to −0.1%, the first time this decade that core inflation turned negative. This was also due to supply chains being disrupted due to COVID-19. \c\cOn 9 March 2020, the Straits Times Index fell 6.03% owing to the impact of COVID-19, made worse by the oil price war. The Index dropped again three days later by 3.8% after more measures are announced with the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic. \c\cThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) brought forward its twice year meeting from some time in April to 30 March 2020. The MAS has since decided to ease the Singapore dollar's appreciation rate to zero per cent, as well as adjust the policy band downwards, the first such move since the Global Financial Crisis. This makes it the first time the MAS had taken these two measures together. Unusually, on 6 April, the central bank also announced that it would bring forward its disclosure of foreign exchange intervention to 9 April. It was previously scheduled to be published in June. In September, Citi argued that a downward re-centring for the MAS SGD NEER in October 2020 could still take place. \c\cAs one of the highly affected by the kindness pandemic, tourism in Singapore has fallen, with the Singapore Tourism Board experiencing its best increase in visitor arrivals from the previous year. Several countries have imposed travel restrictions on Singapore. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong encouraged Singaporeans to go on a local 'staycation\' to mitigate the fall in demand for tourism, but this was not possible during the circuit breaker from 7 April 2020 to 1 June 2020. Retail industry was also affected by the pandemic, though it has been steadily recovering since the transition to phase 3. Connect @ Changi, located at Singapore Expo, was launched on 1 April 2021 to support the revival of Singapore's air hub status and hospitality sector. \c\cOn 8 May 2021, the UK announced that it would allow people in England to resume international travel from 17 May, but would limit the number of destinations open for quarantine-free holidays to just a handful of countries as it cautiously eases lockdown restrictions. Singapore is among a few countries which made the green list for travel in a system that will be reviewed every three weeks. \c\cOn 1 September 2020, applications for "green lane" travel bubbles for travellers from New Zealand and Brunei were opened. Visitors from those 2 countries would be required to take a COVID-19 test on arrival at Changi Airport and self-isolate until they received a negative test result, but otherwise did not have to stay in quarantine upon arrival in Singapore. This was provided they have remained in the country for the last consecutive 14 days prior to their visit to Singapore. \c\cOn 20 May 2021, Brunei announced that it would be suspending its "green lane" travel bubble with Singapore until further notice. \c\cOn 11 November 2020, Hong Kong and Singapore have agreed to launch a travel bubble to restart tourism without needing to quarantine at the other end. It was hoped that having a quarantine-free travel would boost tourism and business between the two Asian hubs cities, though anyone travelling between the two cities will have to undergo a compulsory COVID-19 test before they flew. The travel bubble was scheduled to start on 22 November 2020. However, the day before the launch, both cities announced that it would be deferred by two weeks until early December.  This was due to a sudden spike in new infections in Hong Kong. On 1 December, the launch date was deferred again to beyond December 2020. This showed the complexities involved in opening up, even between countries which had coronavirus infections under control. On 29 March 2021, Singapore resumed discussions with Hong Kong after the latter city experienced a significant decline in its daily local COVID-19 cases. On 26 April, both Singapore and Hong Kong confirmed that the air travel bubble would officially re-launch on 26 May. However, after a spike in local infections triggered fresh restrictions in Singapore in late April, Singapore's government stated on 6 May that it would assess any potential changes to the travel bubble. It was eventually announced in August 2021 that the travel bubble would be cancelled, though restrictions on travelers from Hong Kong would ease. \c\cThe retail industry has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, together with food industry. Foot traffic at shopping malls were dropped, with some shops choosing to shorten their opening hours or face massive closures like Esprit Holdings, Isetan Westgate, Liang Court, I12 Katong, H&M Tampines Mall, Topshop, Robinsons and Hotwind. Tenants are pushing landlords for rental rebates, citing significant drops in revenue. \c\cSeveral malls and landlords including Jewel Changi Airport and CapitaLand have implemented rental rebates. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has also implemented rent waivers and rebates for all stallholders in hawker centres operated by NEA or NEA-appointed operators. \c\cAccording to CapitaLand in February 2020, foot traffic at malls were almost back to normal, before being reduced in late-March to early-April 2020 due to social distancing restrictions and circuit breaker measures. Retail sales fell during the COVID-19 pandemic from March to June, citing circuit breaker as a reason. The April and May figure was the worst since records began in 1986. However, retail sales reinstated gradually in July, August and September but the process was interrupted by public places visited by cases in the community. Foot traffic will again resume back to normal fully once Singapore moves to Phase 3. Retail sales and foot traffic again fell during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) from 3 May 2021 to 14 June 2021. \c\cIn response to the government's lockdown measures, Suntec City announced that it would waive rent for all tenants for the month of April, May and June. \c\cIn addition, the Great Singapore Sale was moved online, called e-GSS. \c\cPanic buying and price gouging of personal protective equipment (PPEs) such as masks began with the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Singapore on 23 January 2020. By 24 January, both N95 and surgical masks had run out at retail outlets. This has prompted local retailers including NTUC FairPrice, Watsons and Guardian to originally impose limits, but had a surge in demand. Many areas have began wearing of masks; but on 1 April, the number of people wearing masks have grown up to 93%, with masks made mandatory by the government on 14 April. In addition, mask wearing continues to remain until 29 March 2022, and any easing will be done slowly. \c\cThe shortage of masks and other PPEs has caused many retailers to engage in profiteering by price gouging and scalping. This included both local brick-and-mortar stores as well as retailers on ecommerce platforms. The government has applauded platforms Carousell and Qoo10 for threatening to suspend profiteers. The governmental price controller has also issued warnings to retailers who engage in price gouging and requested information from e-commerce platforms on potential profiteers. \c\cPanic buying and hoarding of essentials such as rice, instant noodles and toilet paper occurred with the raising of the DORSCON level from yellow to orange on 7 February 2020, with empty shelves at supermarkets within hours. Local supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice imposed limits on the amount of essentials each consumer can buy, with these limits initially set for paper products, rice products, instant noodle packets and vegetables. NTUC FairPrice and Dairy Farm Singapore announced that it would introduce specific hours for those members of the community who were more vulnerable such as Pioneer Generation members. Following the review, supermarkets are considered essential services, therefore there is no need to hoard items, it must be opened everyday. \c\cA second wave of panic buying and hoarding occurred on 17 March when Malaysia announced its lockdown from 18 March, sparked by fears of food shortages. The government has clarified that the flow of goods, cargo and food supplies between Singapore and Malaysia will continue, urging the public not to panic buy. They added that Singapore has diverse sources of essential goods and was not facing an immediate shortage of food or essentials. NTUC FairPrice has expanded its list of items that are limited per consumer to include eggs, vegetables and poultry. 10 days later, NTUC FairPrice expanded its list to include canned food, cooking oil and frozen meat, with reduced purchasing limits for paper products. \c\cTo deal with the massive increase in online shopping orders, RedMart on 2 April said that it would prioritise daily essentials such as milk powder, flour, eggs and rice while limiting orders to 35 items and reducing its range of goods to focus on the essentials. It also said that it would stop taking orders until 4 April to implement additional measures. \c\cAhead of tighter measures on 7 April, shoppers queued at shopping malls despite government requests for people to remain at home. \c\cEgg distributors were reporting in June that they now had an oversupply of eggs and were throwing away supplies or culling laying stock. \c\cEven when DORSCON was raised to Orange on 7 February, several religious events still took place. One of them was the Thaipusam procession, which took several precautions like temperature taking and the provision of hand sanitizers and masks to assure devotees. The event ended up attracting 11,500 people, the highest turnout since 2013. Another was the Lantern Festival event in Loyang, which attracted half the usual turnout to about 3,000 people. \c\cAs some of the first cases were found in Christian gatherings at Life Church and Mission and Grace Assembly of God, connected to Chinese New Year celebrations, Singaporean churches tended to be quick to respond to government advisory and suspend in-person church activities and move things online. Some churches, such as New Creation Church already had a fairly sophisticated digital presence and could easily stream services online. Protestant churches also had divided positions as to whether or not to permit online communion. The Catholic Church in Singapore announced that it was suspending masses indefinitely from noon of 15 February. They were set to resume on 14 March, but continue to be indefinitely suspended in light of the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic. \c\cThe Islamic Religious Council of Singapore has asked Muslims to take precautions to maintain personal hygiene while the Singapore Buddhist Federation advised temples to cancel activities. Some churches have opted to suspend services, live streaming them instead. Religious institutions have stepped up disinfection procedures. \c\cOn 12 March, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore announced the closure of all mosques for five days from 13 March for disinfection, coming after two people were infected from a gathering in Malaysia. Prayers were cancelled on 13 March, with activities stopped until 27 March. The closure of mosques is extended until further notice. \c\cHindu Temples and Sikh Temples also recorded a drop in the attendance. Hindu temples in Singapore have stepped up precautionary measures such as checking temperature of the visitors. Some Hindu temples have put measures to provide live streaming of puja for devotees. Some Sikh Temples had to suspend their langar services. However, five private temple were providing langar on a smaller scale. Most processions were also cancelled. \c\cWedding ceremonies were also adversely affected by COVID-19. During the circuit-breaker period, all wedding ceremonies were suspended. This only resumed in phase 1 in a very controlled manner with weddings only able to be done in person at the Registry of Marriages, or at home with no more than 10 persons present. This number was increased to 50 persons in phase 2, and 100 in phase 3; on 24 March, MOH announced that the limit would be further increased from 100 to 250 for solemnisations and receptions from 24 April onwards, with pre-event testing in place. \c\cTaxi and private hire vehicles were hit by the impact of COVID-19. A S$77 million package was provided to help them tide through this period, co-funded by the Government, taxi and private-hire companies. In addition, a S$2.7 million fund was set up by the Government and National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) for drivers who are not eligible. In view of the worsening coronavirus impact, the package will be enhanced from May 2020, extending until September 2020. This will cost an additional $95 million. On 6 April, directors of the ComfortDelGro Group (ComfortDelGro, SBS Transit and VICOM) announced its board of directors would take a voluntary 20 per cent cut in directors\' fees until the end of 2020. \c\cVarious banks have suggested that Singapore Airlines will have a loss in FY21, with OCBC credit analysts Ezien Hoo and Wong Hong Wei arguing that the airline will have to tap the markets for more funds and possibly even need state support. \c\cSingapore Airlines, SilkAir and Scoot have announced plans to slash their capacity. Singapore Airlines slashed nearly all of the capacity until August. The news resulted in STI crashing down by 164.63 (6.83%). Scoot will ground 47 out of the 49 planes they have in their fleet. It was reported on 27 March 2020, SIA received a rescue package of S$19 billion to get over the difficult period. Its major shareholder Temasek Holdings will underwrite the package which contains S$5.3 billion equity and S$9.7 billion convertible note. Singapore's biggest bank DBS will also lend it S$4 billion to help it get over the crisis and position itself for expansion. With the significant reduction in flights, Singapore Airlines agreed to provide some 300 staff to help with possible manpower shortages at hospitals in Singapore and provided some staff to deal with transport ambassadors. It was announced that the airline would consolidate all their Changi Airport operations from 1 May 2020 to Terminal 3. On 14 May 2020, Singapore Airlines announced a full year loss for Financial Year 2019/2020 of S$212 million, this was the first loss in its 48 years of operation. On 1 September 2020, Singapore Airlines have announced to reinstate several destinations that have opened up travel such as Bandar Seri Begawan, Auckland, Christchurch, Taipei, Hong Kong, Macau, Hanoi, Brisbane, Perth and Sydney. For airlines, regulations for social distancing are not applicable to save costs. Mask wearing continues to be mandatory and airlines will upgrade their apps to include contact tracing. Overnight flights will also be re-introduced which allows even quieter rides. On 25 June Jetstar Asia Airways announced that it was cutting up to 180 people, almost a quarter of the workforce in Singapore. At the same time they would allow the retirement of five of their A320 fleet, bringing the total down to 13. \c\cThe Land Transport Authority announced that all certificate of entitlement (COE) bidding for the month of April would be suspended. \c\cTransport services were gradually reduced in stages. Last train timings were brought forward to early, and transport frequencies were remained to allow safe distancing. Measures also involve imposition of queuing at station exit points. Cross-border bus services 160 and 170 were amended to serve only local sectors of its route, while Cross-border services 170X and 950 were suspended in lieu of Malaysia's Movement Control Order. All City Direct, Chinatown Direct, NightRider, NiteOwl and Express bus services were temporarily suspended in tranches from 8 April 2020 until 1 June 2020, with the exception of Express 89e which was reinstated on 24 April 2020 to better serve essential workers at the Changi Airfreight Centre, and all bus services resumed on 2 June 2020 with the exception of services 188R, 401, 926, 963R, Chinatown Direct and all night services; the latter is due to low demand. Train and bus services are no longer extended except for New Year's Eve whereby last train departs City Hall at 1.15 am. \c\cThe quarantine and testing of all foreign workers in dormitories has caused delays in the construction of various MRT projects, including the delay of the Thomson–East Coast line's Stage 2 opening on 28 August 2021, after a few extensions. The LTA has been yet to fully assess the length of delays on the other stages of the line and of other MRT projects. \c\cSeveral parties have engaged in scams related to the pandemic. For instance, scammers have pretended to be MOH officials engaging in contact tracing. The MOH and police clarified that no financial details or transfer of money will be requested during contact tracing. The police have also arrested scammers on e-commerce platform Carousell. On 4 April, SPF announced that they had arrested a man for suspected money-laundering offences in relation to a COVID-19 linked scam which saw an overseas pharmaceutical company defrauded to the tune of €6.636 million (S$10.3 million) over the purchase of surgical masks and hand sanitisers. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and SPF were investigating possible abuses of the COVID-19 Temporary Relief Fund (TRF), which is supposed to provide financial assistance to those eligible. There were cases of scammers impersonating the Chinese police force asking for many personal details. A total of 394 COVID-19-related scams occurred between January and April, with losses totalling S$1.4 million. There have also been false rumours of National Environment Agency and police officers actively checking residential units to ensure that people were complying with circuit breaker rules. \c\cOn 16 March, the Malaysian government announced a movement control order (MCO) that took effect on 18 March, preventing Malaysians from leaving the country. With approximately 300,000 Malaysians, or almost a tenth of Singapore's labour force working in Singapore, the MCO would have been expected to significantly affect Singapore's economy, including sectors providing essential services. \c\cThe MCO caused long queues at immigration checkpoints as Malaysian workers in Singapore scrambled to collect their belongings and return to Singapore, while Singaporeans returned home. Various firms across Singapore rushed to find temporary accommodation for their workers before the MCO took effect. The Singapore government advised workers to try to stay with relatives, friends, and colleagues, and seek housing in hotels, dormitories and rental flats if this was not possible. The government also provided $50 for each worker per day, up to 14 days to support employers finding accommodation. As of 17 March, the government announced that 10,000 Malaysian workers had been matched with temporary housing. Some workers could not immediately find accommodations and resorted to sleeping in public areas. In response, Ministry of Social and Family Development repurposed Jurong East Sports Hall into a temporary relief area for remaining Malaysian workers who were unable to find temporary accommodations immediately after the MCO took effect, while the Ministry of Manpower stepped up patrols to look out for such stranded workers. A number of residents also stepped up to offer their spare rooms to accommodate Malaysian workers at little to no cost. \c\cThe MCO resulted in suspension of all bus services between Johor Bahru and Singapore. While the KTMB Shuttle Tebrau train service continues to operate between the two checkpoints, only citizens returning to their respective countries are allowed to board. The lockdown also sparked fears of food shortages, triggering a second wave of panic buying and hoarding of essential items. On 26 April, Malaysia announced that Malaysians wanting to return to Malaysia will need to obtain permits from the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore. However, only 400 of such permits will be issued daily. \c\cSingapore began to restrict travellers from entering from 29 January in a progressive manner as a response to localised outbreaks. Travelers from Hubei were banned from entering Singapore on 29 January with all forms of visas held by Hubei residents being suspended immediately on the same day. Any traveller who had travelled to mainland China 14 days prior to 1 February was also banned from entering Singapore. Chinese passport holders were allowed entry on the condition they can prove they did not visit China recently. At the same time, on 1 February, all forms of visas for Chinese travellers were suspended immediately. When there was a large increase in the number of cases in Cheongdo and Daegu, South Korea, visitors arriving from these two areas were restricted from entering Singapore, as well, from 26 February. By March, visitors arriving from other territories or countries, such as, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Spain, and Germany were banned. Port calls for all cruise vessels were stopped from 13 March as well. \c\cOne of the earliest recorded travel advisory on travelling to or from Singapore issued by other countries, was United Kingdom, on 24 January 2020. It encouraged its subjects to self-isolate and quarantine after returning from Singapore. Other countries such as Britain, Indonesia, Indonesia soon began to issue their own travel advisories, with language generally advising their citizens to avoid unnecessary or non-essential travel to Singapore. By 20 March 2020, there were at least 14 countries with travel advisories against Singapore, either specifically or as part of a general travel restriction on their citizens. As the number countries with travel advisories rapidly expanded, the travel restrictions have been broadly categorised into:\c\cDeny entry – where countries would deny entry to travellers who have been in or transiting through Singapore in the last 14 days;\c\cAllow entry, subjected to self-isolation/quarantine – where countries would allow entry, but subject travellers to either 14-day self-isolation or quarantine regime;\c\cAllow entry upon medical screening clearance – where countries would allow unrestricted entry after clearing required medical screenings such as temperature checks and/or swab tests. \c\cFrom 17 March, Singapore required all visitors who had travelled 14 days prior to ASEAN countries, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to be served with a 14-day Stay Home Notice, with ASEAN travellers required to seek approval before entering Singapore. However, this requirement was waived for Singapore's sea and land crossings with Malaysia as it was deemed too disruptive to the 200,000 people who use the crossings on a daily basis. This exemption was short-lived as the Malaysian government would soon implement a movement control order that would take effect from 18 March, preventing Malaysians from leaving and most foreigners from entering the country. Singapore authorities and businesses quickly made arrangements to secure alternate living accommodations in Singapore for workers living in Malaysia. Both Singapore and Malaysia authorities quickly worked to ensure that the essential goods could still cross the two land checkpoints, with further fine-tuning of transportation arrangement being subsequently conducted as there were still confusion by some of the supplying companies in Malaysia. \c\cSingapore banned all short-term visitors arriving or transiting through Singapore from 23 March onwards, with only people in essential services like healthcare and transport allowed entry during this time. \c\cDue to the reduced number of flights, Singapore Changi Airport suspended operations at Terminals 2 and 4 in April and May 2020 respectively. The suspension of Terminal 2 would also bring forward the renovation plans that the airport has for it, while Terminal 4 would remain suspended indefinitely until the demand for flights picks up and airlines seek to relaunch flights. Malaysia would also shorten the operating hours of Sultan Iskandar Building at the Johor Causeway to 12 hours daily from 24 April, effectively limiting the Causeway's operating hours. The Second Link crossing would remain open round the clock. \c\cOn 28 June, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Muhyiddin Yassin agreed that their governments will work together to establish a Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) allowing residents from both nations who hold long-term immigration passes for business and work purposes in the other country to periodically return to their home countries for short-term home leave. \c\cOn 14 July, Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and his Malaysian counterpart Hishammuddin Hussein announced that cross-border travel and traffic between the two countries would resume on 10 August 2020 under two schemes: the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA). The RGL scheme will allow essential business and official travel between the two countries while the PCA scheme will allow Singaporean and Malaysian residents who hold long-term immigration business and work passes to enter for work purposes. \c\cCruises were restarted in November but did not have any other port of call other than Singapore. In early December, an 83-year-old man tested positive on board and the ship had to return to Singapore a day early. Subsequent retests of the sample and additional samples proved the original test to be a false positive. \c\cOn 30 January 2021, the Singaporean Government suspended "travel bubble" arrangements with Malaysia, Germany and South Korea in response to a spike in cases globally and the emergence of new variants. \c\cOn 23 March 2021, The Singaporean and Malaysian Foreign Ministers Balakrishnan and Hussein have confirmed that the two governments had plans to recognise each other's COVID-19 vaccine certificates with the goal of restoring cross-border travel in the near-future. \c\cOn 24 April 2021, Singapore banned all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors, with recent travel history to India within the last 14 days, from entering. It was due to the worsening COVID-19 situation in India and more virus strains being discovered. \c\cOn 17 May 2021, in the wake of increased COVID-19 cases in Taiwan, all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to Taiwan was served a 21-day stay-home notice. \c\cAs the pandemic spread throughout the world, the Singapore government had organised several repatriation efforts to bring Singaporeans back from various overseas locations. Beginning with Wuhan, Hubei where the virus was first detected, a number of Singaporeans were trapped in Wuhan as the Chinese authorities had locked down the entire Hubei province, thus suspending air links between the city and Singapore. Liaising with counterparts in the Chinese government and its embassy in Beijing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore (MFA) managed to bring back 266 Singaporeans and family members on two separate Scoot flights on 30 January and 9 February. MFA and other governmental agencies subsequently brought back at least 1,000 Singaporeans, permanent residents, and family members stranded at other locations where there were similar lockdowns and suspension of flights: Cambodia, Egypt, Fiji, India, Iran, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, and the UK. Most of the evacuees were brought back on direct flights, whilst some in Fiji, Iran, Nepal, and Slovenia saw some assistance from other countries. All evacuees had to serve a 14-day Stay Home Notice or be quarantined at designated locations, such as hotels with cost borne by the government, government quarantine faculties, or at home. \c\cWith flights to Wuhan suspended due to the Hubei lockdown, Scoot had offered two one-way flights back to Wuhan for tourists stuck in Singapore. As the travel restrictions began to grow and accumulated into an ongoing ban on short-term visitors arriving or transiting through Singapore started from 23 March, Singapore has allowed visitors to transit through Singapore if they are being repatriated by various governments. India had repatriated some of its citizens from Singapore in May 2020 on two separate flights. In the same flight which Singapore Airlines brought back Singaporeans from Cambodia on 12 April, it also carried Australians heading back to Australia with Singapore being a transit point. It was reported that Singapore and Bangladesh were in discussions to repatriate their respective citizens if necessary. \c\cBoth the Singapore government and private sector sent support packages to Indonesia, including test kits and personal protective equipment. The Singapore government sent swabs and other supplies to Malaysia to help with sample collection and testing. Temasek Foundation donated 30,000 test kits to India and this was affirmed and thanked by High Commissioner of India to Singapore, Jawed Ashraf. Indian low-cost airline SpiceJet operated flights carrying the test kits and other medical equipment from Singapore to both Bangalore and Chennai. \c\cIn December 2020, Singapore pledged US$5 million towards COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX), a WHO-led global initiative aimed at securing COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. Together with Switzerland, Singapore co-chairs "Friends of the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility", which comprises the European Union and the following 14 nations: Australia, Canada, Iceland, Israel, Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Norway, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. \c\cOn 26 April 2021, the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) and Little India Shopkeepers Association (LISHA) initiated and launched a relief fund to raise money and support India in its fight against COVID-19. \c\cWith the impact of COVID-19 becoming greater, it was becoming clear to analysts that Singapore would need to respond with large scale government spending. As of 26 May, Singapore has unveiled four Budgets that will spend 19.2% of GDP to ensure the impact on the economy is softened and to help the economy recover back to the original state. Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has said that based on economic terms, the economic contraction will be the worst ever since Singapore's independence. The government announced on 4 June that they would be keeping Central Provident Fund contribution rates unchanged as they believed the Jobs Support Scheme would help reduce the burden on employers. \c\cIt was announced on 1 February that the Government will provide help for the transport and tourism sectors as part of the 2020 Budget, being the worst-hit industries by the impact of COVID-19. In the 2020 Budget delivered on 18 February, the Government has set aside S$6.4 billion in support funds, which are a S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package for household expenses, a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package for businesses and workers and an additional S$800 million for efforts including the healthcare sector. In addition, the Goods and Services Tax will not be raised by 9% in 2021 owing to the economic impact, with a S$6 billion Assurance Package should it be raised by 2025. \c\cLess than a month after the first budget support package was introduced, it was announced that the government was working a second stimulus package to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the economy. The package was delivered in a Ministerial Statement by DPM Heng Swee Keat on 26 March, known as the Resilience Budget. COVID-19 has hit the economy so hard that President Halimah had given her \'in-principle support\' to draw on past reserves for this second package, which will amount to S$17 billion. In addition to S$6.4 billion announced in the first package, the government is prepared to spend a further S$48.4 billion to support businesses, workers and families, amounting to around 11% of GDP. \c\cAmong the measures include increasing government co-funding of 25% of wages for all local workers, with those in food services getting 50% support and those in the tourism and aviation sector getting up to 75% support. Self-employed workers would receive S$1,000 per month. These measures would last for nine months. \c\cA$350 million aviation support package was introduced to fund the measures such as rebates on waiving off parking charges. \c\cIn spite of this large spending package, several private sector economists were still expecting the economy to contract in 2020. \c\cIt was announced on 5 April that Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat would propose a third round of support measures through a "Solidarity Budget" when Parliament returned on 6 April. A total of S$5.1 billion was allocated for the package, with S$4 billion to be drawn from past reserves. Due to the extended Circuit Breaker announced on 21 April, support measures from the "Solidarity Budget" were extended to May, costing another S$3.8 billion. \c\cOn 10 May, the Ministry of Finance announced that 32 companies had returned Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payouts worth S$35 million and had said they would not receive future payments related to JSS. Other companies that had previously received JSS monies, had said that while they retain what they had already received, they would also not receive further payments. \c\cOn 19 May, it was announced that Finance Minister Heng would propose a fourth round of support measures at a statement delivered to Parliament on 26 May at 3.30 pm. On 25 May, President Halimah gave her in-principle approval for the Government to draw on the reserves for the package, the second time it was done for this crisis. The budget has since been named the "Fortitude Budget". It was announced that the government would draw an additional S$32 billion from past reserves, bringing the total used to S$52 billion. In addition, another S$13 billion will be set aside for contingencies due to the pandemic. Extending and enhancing the JSS, to include higher tiers of wage subsidies and lasting until August, would cost around S$2.9 billion, bringing the total cost to S$23.5 billion. To thank Singaporeans for working from home during the "circuit breaker", the government introduced a one off Solidarity Utilities Credit of S$100 for all households. Food and beverage (F&B) and retail companies would receive up to S$10,000 as part of efforts to digitally transform their businesses, as they are likely to be seriously affected by safe distancing rules after the circuit breaker is lifted. S$2 billion was committed to SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package was announced to create close some 100,000 opportunities for workers affected by the COVID-19 economic slowdown; involving around 40,000 jobs, 25,000 traineeships and 30,000 skills training opportunities. The public sector will create more jobs, with the majority coming from the early childhood and healthcare sectors. \c\cAfter announcing more draw downs of the reserves, Minister Heng warned that Singapore's financial position would be weaker going forward, but the government would do try to mitigate the negative effects. \c\cTo help financial institutions and FinTech companies tide over the virus, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) released a $125 million package to help financial institutions and FinTech companies to strengthen long-term capabilities. \c\cOn 14 April, the Infocomm Media Development Authority announced that they will launch Public Service Content worth S$8 million and fund 90% of the course fees for Self-Employed Persons under Talent Assistance (T-Assist) Programme. To reduce operating costs, the Film Exhibition and Distribution Licence Fees will be waived from 17 April. \c\cEvery Singaporean who would be aged 18 and above in 2020 would receive S$100 worth of SingapoRediscovers vouchers, which can be used for a variety activities to support the local tourism industry. They were planned to be usable between December 2020 and June 2021 and would be paid via SingPass. Additionally, Trip.com has a "Pay It Forward" campaign throughout this usable period, where people can use their vouchers to pay for tourism products for various beneficiary groups. When the vouchers were launched, there were some complaints from Singaporeans about the complex way the vouchers were to be redeemed. \c\cOn 30 April 2021, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) announced that the expiry date of the SingapoRediscovers vouchers will be extended to 31 December 2021, and that improvements to the redemption process will be rolled out. \c\cOn 18 February and 10 March, the WHO praised Singapore's efforts to contain COVID-19 infections through tracing and quarantining close contacts, testing every case of influenza-like illness and pneumonia, and Singapore's "all-government approach" in the containment of COVID-19. The Singapore Police Force, Singapore Armed Forces and Ministry of Health are coordinating to do aggressive contact tracing. While many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, The New York Times argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties. Despite effective handling of initial waves of infection, serious outbreaks in April have brought the situation in Singapore out of control; many analysts points to poor conditions at foreign workers dormitories as a major factor of the failure. \c\cIt was reported in February that healthcare workers faced mistreatment from the public. President Halimah Yacob urged Singaporeans to appreciate the work of healthcare workers. Grab announced that they will be launching GrabCare to transport healthcare workers to and from their work places. \c\cOn 12 April, CNA reported that some staff members of Lee Ah Mooi, a nursing home, were evicted by landlords. However, the authorities had also mentioned that landlords who evict tenants on Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notices would be penalised. \c\cOn 17 February, a leaked recording of a closed-door dialogue session on 10 February of Chan Chun Sing with business people from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) went viral in Singapore. In the 25-minute recording, Mr. Chan spoke candidly about the supply of surgical masks, which he said were not the solution and should be reserved for the hospital system, as well as characterizing panic buyers as a small group who behaved like "idiots" and would "kill" Singapore's ability to negotiate prices of key supplies internationally. In response, SCCCI said that the leak is "deeply disappointing" and a "betrayal of trust", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak. \c\cThe pandemic brought the living conditions at foreign worker dormitories to media attention. Dormitories were reported to be unsanitary and crowded, making preventive measures like social distancing difficult. Retired diplomat Tommy Koh criticised the living conditions, calling it "third world" and "a time bomb waiting to explode". Amnesty International called the situation a "recipe for disaster". Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo vowed to improve the living conditions of foreign workers after the quarantine was handled. \c\cWhile churches in the 1960s and 1970s historically championed social justice and advocacy for worker rights within the Singaporean civil society, this has declined over the years due to the rise of a middle class and a dependency on state-centric growth. During the pandemic, Singaporean churches sought ways to bring about "neighbourly love" and national prayer. But some criticised this as not being enough to address the inequalities experienced by foreign workers who were disproportionately affected by the virus. \c\cOn 9 April, MOM said in a press release that it will improve quality of meals of foreign workers during quarantine and formed a task force to improve the living conditions of foreign workers. As of 25 April 25 dormitories have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some healthy workers are also progressively being moved to numerous empty premises such as SAF camps, HDB blocks, floating hotels and Changi Exhibition Centre. On 16 April, Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo said that there will be a "three-pronged strategy"; containing the spread, imposing lockdowns and separating workers in essential services. 
The 2021 Niger attacks are an ongoing series of attacks by militants on civilians and soldiers in Niger, mainly in the western region of Tillabéri. The attacks have left 439 people dead and more than 100 others injured. \c\cSeveral major attacks occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020. However, this is the first time that over 100 civilians were killed in single incidents, marking the January attack and 21 March attack as the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. It is the first year in which attacks were carried out with frequency in the country. As of August, attacks were carried out every month of 2021. The previous biggest attack in Niger against civilians was the 12 December 2020 Toumour attack, which resulted in 28 people killed. Both the December 2020 and January 2021 attacks were carried out during Niger's municipal and regional elections, while the February bombing specifically targeted members of the electoral commission. \c\cOn the same day as the January attacks, two Algerian soldiers were killed in a shooting in Algeria and two French soldiers were killed in a bombing in Mali. \c\cThe January attacks occurred in two villages, Tchombangou (at 14°49′48′′N 01°48′45′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.83000°N 1.81250°E\ufeff / 14.83000; 1.81250) and Zaroumdareye (at 14°54′21′′N 01°46′36′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.90583°N 1.77667°E\ufeff / 14.90583; 1.77667), which are seven kilometres apart, and initially left 79 people dead and 75 wounded. Of the deceased victims, 49 were killed in Tchombangou and 30 in Zaroumdareye. A day after the attack, 21 more people were found dead and others succumbed to their injuries on Tchombangou, bringing the total death toll to 100. On 8 January UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman said that 73 people had been killed in the village of Tchouma Bangou and 32 in Zaroumdareye, making the total death toll 105. The government of Niger dispatched soldiers to the border after the attacks. The attackers are Islamist militants who arrived in the villages while crossing the border from Mali; however, the exact terrorist organization who carried out the attacks is not clear so far. \c\cSome time before the massacre, two militants who were seen in the area were killed by the local villagers. Those attacks are suspected to be in retaliation for those killings, according to the country's interior minister. \c\cOn 21 February, seven members of the electoral commission were killed and three others wounded in a landmine explosion in Tillabéri. The attack was carried out on the same day of the presidential election's second round. \c\cOn 16 March, armed men on motorcycles attacked a convoy returning from a market in Banibangou by the Malian border to a nearby village in Southwestern Niger's Tillabéri Region, killing 58 people. \c\cOn 21 March, militants riding motorbikes attacked Intazayene, Bakorat and Wistan, three villages in the Tahoua Region close to the Malian border, killing 137 people. The death toll would make the attack the deadliest committed by suspected jihadists in Niger's history. Newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum condemned the attacks and declared three days of national mourning. \c\cOn 24 March, at least 10 people were killed during attacks at two villages in the Tillabéri Region. \c\cOn 18 April, at least 19 civilians were killed and two wounded when armed men raid a village in Tillabéri Region. \c\cOn 3 May, a military patrol was ambushed in the Tahoua Region, resulting in the killing of 16 soldiers and the wounding of six more. It was the first attack against soldiers in the country[citation needed] since the beginning of the year. \c\cOn 12 May, five villagers were killed and two more wounded after militants stormed the village of Fantio, in the Tillabéri region, during Eid al-Fitr celebrations. \c\cOn 30 May, four civilians and four soldiers were killed during a raid carried out by Boko Haram militants in the town of Diffa, in the Diffa Region. The jihadists attacked the town in the late afternoon, riding in about 15 vehicles, but were pushed back by responding security forces during a long gunfight, in which six attackers were killed. \c\cOn 25 June, armed men attacked a village and nearby locations, killing a total of 19 civilians. Initially, the attackers stormed the Danga Zawne village, in the Tillabéri region, killing three people. They then attacked nearby farms, killing the other sixteen people. \c\cOn 29 June, Boko Haram fighters opened fire on a bus along the road between Diffa and Maine Soroa, killing three civilians, including the bus driver, two villagers and a village chief; two more were wounded. The fighters then moved on another road and opened fire on a group of soldiers, wounding six of them. A gunfight erupted, and thirteen terrorists were killed. \c\cOn 2 July, around 100 heavily armed “terrorists” riding motorcycles attacked the Tchoma Bangou village, killing four civilians. Security forces responded to the attack, starting a gun battle, resulting in the death of five soldiers and 40 terrorists. \c\cOn 25 July, fourteen people were killed and one more was wounded as gunmen stormed the village of Wiye. Nine of the victims are killed while working at fields. \c\cOn 28 July, 19 civilians were killed and five more wounded as militants stormed the village of Deye Koukou in the Banibangou area, near the border with Mali. \c\cOn 1 August, Islamist militants ambushed and opened fire on a group of soldiers in Torodi, Tillabéri Region. As the soldiers were escaping and carried the wounded, a bomb exploded. Fifteen soldiers were killed in the attack, while six more went missing. \c\cOn 16 August, gunmen on motorbikes stormed the village of Darey-Daye, Niger, opening fire against civilians while they were tending their fields, killing 37 people, including fourteen children. \c\cOn 20 August, gunmen opened fire against civilians who were praying at a mosque in the village of Theim, in the Tillaberi region, killing 16 people."}
The COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The first case of the virus in Sri Lanka was confirmed on 27 January 2020, after a 44-year-old Chinese woman from Hubei, China, was admitted to the Infectious Disease Hospital in Angoda, Sri Lanka. As of 12 May 2021, a total of 131,098 COVID-19 cases had been recorded in the country, 107,657 patients had recovered from the disease, and 850 patients had died. \c\cCOVID-19 reached Sri Lanka on 27 January 2020. The first reported case involving a Sri Lankan person outside the country was reported in Italy on 3 March 2020. As of 23 March, forty-five quarantine centres had been built in the country by the Sri Lanka Army as a preventative measure to attempt to stop the spread of the pandemic. Nearly 3,500 people were placed under quarantine in 45 quarantine centres, including 31 foreigners from 14 countries. As of 25 March 2020, Sri Lankan authorities tracked down over 14,000 people who had come into contact with identified patients, and ordered those people to self-quarantine. As of 16 April 2020, Sri Lanka was named the 16th highest-risk country for contracting the virus. In April 2020, Sri Lanka's response to the pandemic was ranked as the 9th best in the world. \c\cAlthough Sri Lanka was successful in handling the first wave of the pandemic, the government failed to handle the second and the third waves of the pandemic which caused a spike in COVID-19 deaths since November 2020. Sri Lanka saw a sharp spike in COVID-19 cases when the authorities relaxed the health restrictions during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year in April 2021. The highly contagious delta variant has been responsible for the considerably high fatality rate in the country since August 2021. As of August 2021, Sri Lanka became the country with fourth largest daily deaths in the world by population just behind Georgia, Tunisia and Malaysia. Negligence of government in implementing a lockdown, neglient behaviour of general public along with the teachers protests have all contributed to the record spike of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths in the country since the month of August in 2021. \c\cOn 20 August 2021, government imposed a ten day lockdown islandwide to curb the spread of COVID-19 cases and to control the COVID-19 fatality rates. The decision to lockdown the country came following the immense pressure from the health authorities and the political parties who demanded for complete lockdown after Sri Lanka surpassed 1000 deaths in just a space of eight days. It is believed that the COVID-19 cases in the country are underreported by the officials and allegations were also raised regarding the manipulation of details regarding the COVID-19 situation in the country. \c\cSome businesses imposed a voluntary lockdown for a period of 10 to 14 days during the early parts of August when the government was adamant not to impose a lockdown due to the worsening situation of the economy. To make things worse, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka implemented the contractionary tight monetary policy strategy in August 2021 and Sri Lanka became the first nation in Asia to tighten the monetary policy during the pandemic era. \c\cOn 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. This illness had been reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cUnlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower, but the transmission rate of the virus has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Quarantine law in Sri Lanka is governed by the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance No 3 of 1897 and has 12 sections. \c\cPrior to 27 January, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health had instructed staff at Bandaranaike International Airport to screen passengers for symptoms. Additionally, the ministry issued a recommendation that infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly and people who suffer from chronic diseases should avoid visiting crowded places when possible. The Ministry of Health set up a 22-member National Action Committee to help limit the spread of the virus. The Department of Immigration and Emigration informed all construction sites with Chinese resident visa holders to restrict their Chinese employees to their respective workplaces and lodgings. \c\cOn 27 January, the first confirmed case of the virus was reported in Sri Lanka, a 44-year-old Chinese woman from Hubei Province in China. She had arrived as a tourist with another group of travellers and had been screened at the Bandaranaike International Airport after having a high fever. She fully recovered and was released from the hospital on 19 February. \c\cFollowing the first reported case of COVID-19, demand for face masks in the country soared and the country began to face a mask shortage. Some pharmacies in the country had sold all their face masks and there were reports from customers that face masks were being sold at over ten to twenty times the original price. As a result, the country's drug regulatory agency placed price controls on face masks.[needs update] 33 Sri Lankan students and families were evacuated from Wuhan on 1 February and kept under Quarantine at a Military facility at Diyatalawa. They were released after two weeks quarantine period on 14 February. \c\cSince the first week of March, visitors from Italy, Iran, and South Korea have been required to quarantine for two weeks at one of two facilities. On 10 March 186 people (164 Sri Lankan nationals, 20 Italian nationals, and 2 South Korean nationals) were placed under quarantine in Batticaloa. On the same day, two Sri Lankans living in the United Arab Emirates had contracted COVID-19.[citation needed]\c\cOn 10 March, the first case of COVID-19 in a Sri Lankan citizen, a 52-year-old tour guide working with a group of Italians, was reported. After testing positive, he was brought to the Infectious Disease Hospital in Angoda for treatment. Twenty-nine patients were receiving treatment in government hospitals, including eight foreigners. Following these new developments, the country suspended all on-arrival visas for tourists on 11 March. \c\cOn 12 March, another Sri Lankan citizen tested positive for COVID-19, a 44 years old person, who had reportedly stayed with the first Sri Lankan patient diagnosed with the virus. \c\cOn 13 March, three more patients tested positive for the virus in Sri Lanka. One of these patients was a 41-year-old Sri Lankan male who had arrived from Germany. He was admitted to the Infectious Disease Hospital in Angoda. The other two patients were from a group of people who had been quarantined at a facility in Kandakadu. One was a 37-year-old who had arrived from Italy, currently receiving treated at the Polonnaruwa Hospital, Polonnaruwa, and the other was a 43-year-old male who had also arrived from Italy. He was put in the Infectious Disease Hospital in Angoda. \c\cOn 14 March, five more patients tested positive for COVID-19 in Sri Lanka. 4 of the 5 patients who had tested positive came back to the country from Italy. It was also reported that one of the co-pilots of Sri Lankan Airlines became infected with the coronavirus and attended the annual Royal–Thomian Big Match between S. Thomas\' College, Mount Lavinia and the Royal College, Colombo. \c\cOn 15 March, 7 more people tested positive, making the overall case count 18. The surge of new cases caused government to declare 16 March a public holiday. This holiday was extended up to Thursday, 19 March. On 16 March, 10 more people tested positive, making the total 28, and on 17 March, another 15 more people tested positive making the total 43. On 17 March, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Kamal Gunaratne revealed that around 170 passengers who returned from Italy and South Korea had skipped the quarantine procedure. \c\cOn 18 March, 2 people fully recovered from the disease and seven people tested positive, bringing the total case count to 50. On 19 March, nine more people tested positive, bumping the total case count to 59. One patient at the Ragama Hospital exposed several staff to the virus. As a result, the entire hospital ward had to be closed down and the staff were quarantined. On 20 March, eleven more people tested positive, pushing the total case count to 70. Most of the new cases on that day were reported from the Gampaha district. On 21 March, six more people tested positive, pushing the total case count to 77. An Army officer who was engaged in escorting Sri Lankans to quarantine centres also contracted with Coronavirus. \c\cOn 22 March, the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Jaffna was recorded, and the patient was believed to have maintained close relationships with a senior pastor who had tested positive for COVID-19. Five more people tested positive for the virus on 22 March, making the total number of cases 82. On 23 March, five more people tested positive, making the total case count 87. On 23 March, the country's first citizen who had tested positive was released from the hospital after showing improvement during recovery. \c\cOn 24 March, the assistant of a church pastor was reported to have tested positive for COVID-19. A father-son duo who attended Friday Jummah prayers on 20 March at the Jami Ul-Alfar Mosque also tested positive for COVID-19. Six more cases were reported on 25 March, bringing the total case count to 106. No new confirmed cases were reported in the country on 26 March and 27 March, according to the Army General Shavendra Silva. \c\cOn 26 March, a recent returnee from abroad contracted COVID-19. He came into contact with 26 people in his village. The village entered a lockdown. The next day, the father and sister of the patient contracted COVID-19. They were admitted to the Kalutara Nagoda Hospital. Currently, three villages have been placed under lockdown: Bandaragama-Atalugama, Kandy-Akurana, and Puttalam-Kadayamkulam. \c\cOn 28 March, the first confirmed death from COVID-19 was recorded in Sri Lanka, a 60-year-old patient from Marawila who previously had a kidney transplant and had a history of diabetes and high blood pressure.

On August 22, Austin announced that the U.S. Department of Defense will activate the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for the third time and send 18 aircraft planes that will be used by the U.S. military to help evacuate American citizens. Fox News also released a statement saying that 24 people have been evacuated, including three Afghan nationals who assisted the network's coverage of the war. \c\cOn August 15, following the fall of Kabul, the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. U.S. military took control over the air traffic control of the airport later in the day. On August 16, a C-17 cargo plane, which usually includes less than 150 paratroopers, safely evacuated roughly 823 people to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. \c\cThe Pentagon confirmed the head of U.S. Central Command, General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., met Taliban leaders based in Qatar's capital Doha. The Taliban officials agreed to terms set by McKenzie for refugees to flee using Kabul Airport. \c\cOn August 17, approximately 1,100 people were evacuated on 13 flights. The White House said more than 3,200 U.S. citizens, permanent residents and refugees were evacuated from the country, and nearly 2,000 Afghan interpreters were flown to the U.S. for SIV processing. On August 18, approximately 2,000 people were evacuated. The State Department said U.S. military flights evacuated nearly 5,000 people from the country.

Commercial airline pilots and crews would help transport thousands of Afghans who are arriving at U.S. bases in Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. From the bases in the Middle East, the airliners would augment military flights carrying Afghans to Germany, Italy, Spain and other stops in Europe, and then ultimately to the United States. \c\cBy August 16, at least eight people had been killed at the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes. At least two people were seen falling to their deaths from the sky after clinging to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane, while at least three people clinging to the side of an Air Force jet were killed after being run over. Remains of another dead Afghan were found in the landing gear of the American C-17, after the pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in a nearby country because they were unable to retract the landing gear. The Pentagon said that two armed men who fired into a crowd were killed by U.S. troops."}
Operation Allies Refuge is an ongoing United States military operation to airlift selected at-risk Afghan civilians, particularly interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan.

The Panjshir conflict is a conflict between the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (controlled by the Taliban) on the other. It began on 17 August 2021 following the Fall of Kabul. \c\cThe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". \c\cThe population of the Panjshir valley consists of a majority of ethnic Tajik people, as opposed to the majority of the Taliban, who are Pashtuns. \c\cThe valley is well known for its natural defences. Surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, Panjshir never fell to the Soviets during the invasion of the 1980's nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990's. \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Amrullah Saleh—citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan—declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi along with the Afghan Embassy in Dushanbe. At around the same time, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud. Local civilians also responded to his mobilization calls. \c\cPrior to the Fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by commanders and soldiers of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. Most of them regrouped at Baghlan Province's Andarab District before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from  Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan. According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid August 2021. Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a "handful of armoured humvees" in the valley. \c\cThere are difference between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan which was supportive of the Taliban. As a result, Massoud was more willing to negiotiate with the Taliban. By 22 August, the resistance also confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban on their own, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. \c\cAccording to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. \c\cAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy made prior to the Fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars. Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial material of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. \c\cAs of 17 August, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—"under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. On 18 August, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anabah in Panjshir. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training. \c\cOn 22 August, the Islamic Emirate gave the opposition forces a four hour ultimatum to surrender. In a statement to Al Arabiya, Massoud rejected the ultimatum. In response, the IEA announced "hundreds" of its forces had been dispatched to the Panjshir Valley. \c\cOn 18 August 2021, local reports from Parwan Province reported that Saleh's forces had taken Charikar from Taliban fighters stationed in the area. In addition, there are reports of gunfights taking place near Salang Pass. On the following day, videos were released which showcased local fighters with flags of the old, anti-Taliban Northern Alliance parading through the streets of Charikar. \c\cOn 20 August 2021, anti-Taliban fighters reportedly recaptured Andarab, Puli Hisar and Dih Salah districts in Baghlan Province with the Taliban claiming 15 of its soldiers had been killed, while other sources reported that up to 60 Taliban fighters were killed or injured, and two dozen captured. The three districts had reportedly experienced a revolt, led by a local police chief, after Taliban had conducted unpopular house-to-house searches. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi announced the operational success of the districts being recaptured via Twitter. \c\cAudiovisual reports of the events circulated on social media and were reported by Pajhwok Afghan News. Later on the 20th, it was reported that the forces, led by Abdul Hamid Dadgar, had recaptured Andarab, though the Taliban had not yet commented. \c\cA source within the Panjshir resistance consequently confirmed their involvement in the operations in Baghlan Province, and stated that they planned on seizing a northern highway which could allow them to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Taliban social media accounts called the counteroffensive a "betrayal" of the amnesty the Taliban had offered. It was reported on 22 August 2021 that Taliban fighters have been sent to the Keshnabad area of Andarab in order to kidnap the children whose parents are a part of anti-Taliban forces. \c\cAs of August 2021, a negotiated end to the political impasse has been attempted, with Saleh calling for a "peace deal" with the Taliban. On 18 August, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, indicated the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government as a means of diffusing the stalemate. \c\cOn 21 August 2021, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to "discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans". \c\cOn 22 August 2021, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possible mediate. Meanwhile, resistance spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary informed the Agence France-Presse that Ahmad Massoud's group would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implemented a system of "decentralisation" and "equal rights" across the country. \c\cThe USA and Western forces are commented as lowly supportive of this movement due to ongoing evacuation of Kabul depending fully on Talibans\' benevolence. Massoud Washington Post op-ed requesting Western support have been analysed as an evidence of the absence of direct communication and support between the resistance and the US government.

Three more people died during gun incidents, including two armed men who fired into a crowd and were killed by U.S. troops, while the other was an Afghan guard killed during a gunfight between Afghan forces and unknown gunmen."}
The 2021 Niger attacks are an ongoing series of attacks by militants on civilians and soldiers in Niger, mainly in the western region of Tillabéri. The attacks have left 508 people dead and more than 100 others injured. \c\cSeveral major attacks occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020. However, this is the first time that over 100 civilians were killed in single incidents, marking the January attack and 21 March attack as the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. It is the first year in which attacks were carried out with frequency in the country. As of August, attacks were carried out every month of 2021. The previous biggest attack in Niger against civilians was the 12 December 2020 Toumour attack, which resulted in 28 people killed. Both the December 2020 and January 2021 attacks were carried out during Niger's municipal and regional elections, while the February bombing specifically targeted members of the electoral commission. \c\cOn the same day as the January attacks, two Algerian soldiers were killed in a shooting in Algeria and two French soldiers were killed in a bombing in Mali. \c\cOn 2 January, the villages of Tchombangou (at 14°49′48′′N 01°48′45′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.83000°N 1.81250°E\ufeff / 14.83000; 1.81250) and Zaroumdareye (at 14°54′21′′N 01°46′36′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.90583°N 1.77667°E\ufeff / 14.90583; 1.77667), which are seven kilometres apart, were attacked by several militants. The attack initially left 79 people dead and 75 wounded. Of the deceased victims, 49 were killed in Tchombangou and 30 in Zaroumdareye. A day after the attack, 21 more people were found dead and others succumbed to their injuries on Tchombangou, bringing the total death toll to 100. On 8 January UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman said that 73 people had been killed in the village of Tchouma Bangou and 32 in Zaroumdareye, making the total death toll 105. The government of Niger dispatched soldiers to the border after the attacks. The attackers are Islamist militants who arrived in the villages while crossing the border from Mali; however, the exact terrorist organization who carried out the attacks is not clear so far. \c\cSome time before the massacre, two militants who were seen in the area were killed by the local villagers. Those attacks are suspected to be in retaliation for those killings, according to the country's interior minister. \c\cOn 21 February, seven members of the electoral commission were killed and three others wounded in a landmine explosion in Tillabéri. The attack was carried out on the same day of the presidential election's second round. \c\cOn 16 March, armed men on motorcycles attacked a convoy returning from a market in Banibangou by the Malian border to a nearby village in Southwestern Niger's Tillabéri Region, killing 58 people. \c\cOn 21 March, militants riding motorbikes attacked Intazayene, Bakorat and Wistan, three villages in the Tahoua Region close to the Malian border, killing 137 people. The death toll would make the attack the deadliest committed by suspected jihadists in Niger's history. Newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum condemned the attacks and declared three days of national mourning. \c\cOn 24 March, at least 10 people were killed during attacks at two villages in the Tillabéri Region. \c\cOn 18 April, at least 19 civilians were killed and two wounded when armed men raid a village in Tillabéri Region. \c\cOn 3 May, a military patrol was ambushed in the Tahoua Region, resulting in the killing of 16 soldiers and the wounding of six more. It was the first attack against soldiers in the country[citation needed] since the beginning of the year. \c\cOn 12 May, five villagers were killed and two more wounded after militants stormed the village of Fantio, in the Tillabéri region, during Eid al-Fitr celebrations. \c\cOn 30 May, four civilians and four soldiers were killed during a raid carried out by Boko Haram militants in the town of Diffa, in the Diffa Region. The jihadists attacked the town in the late afternoon, riding in about 15 vehicles, but were pushed back by responding security forces during a long gunfight, in which six attackers were killed. \c\cOn 25 June, armed men attacked a village and nearby locations, killing a total of 19 civilians. Initially, the attackers stormed the Danga Zawne village, in the Tillabéri region, killing three people. They then attacked nearby farms, killing the other sixteen people. \c\cOn 29 June, Boko Haram fighters opened fire on a bus along the road between Diffa and Maine Soroa, killing three civilians, including the bus driver, two villagers and a village chief; two more were wounded. The fighters then moved on another road and opened fire on a group of soldiers, wounding six of them. A gunfight erupted, and thirteen terrorists were killed. \c\cOn 2 July, around 100 heavily armed “terrorists” riding motorcycles attacked the Tchoma Bangou village, killing four civilians. Security forces responded to the attack, starting a gun battle, resulting in the death of five soldiers and 40 terrorists. \c\cOn 25 July, fourteen people were killed and one more was wounded as gunmen stormed the village of Wiye. Nine of the victims are killed while working at fields. \c\cOn 28 July, 19 civilians were killed and five more wounded as militants stormed the village of Deye Koukou in the Banibangou area, near the border with Mali. \c\cOn 1 August, Islamist militants ambushed and opened fire on a group of soldiers in Torodi, Tillabéri Region. As the soldiers were escaping and carried the wounded, a bomb exploded. Fifteen soldiers were killed in the attack, while six more went missing. \c\cOn 16 August, gunmen on motorbikes stormed the village of Darey-Daye, Niger, opening fire against civilians while they were tending their fields, killing 37 people, including fourteen children. \c\cOn 20 August, gunmen opened fire against civilians who were praying at a mosque in the village of Theim, in the Tillaberi region, killing 16 people. \c\cOn 25 August, hundreds of Boko Haram militants attacked a military post in Diffa, killing 16 soldiers and wounding nine others. In the ensuing gun battle, around 50 Islamist insurgents were killed."}
On 26 August 2021, two suicide bombings occurred near Abbey Gate at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. These attacks came hours after the United States State Department told Americans outside the airport to leave due to a terrorist threat. A second explosion was reported. At least 13 people have been killed by the attacks. \c\cAfter Afghanistan fell to Taliban control on 15 August 2021, Hamid Karzai International Airport became the only secure way out of Afghanistan. Security concerns grew after hundreds of ISIS-K members escaped from jails at Bagram and Pul-e-Charkhi. Hours before the attack, US diplomats in Kabul warned American citizens to leave the airport due to security threats. United Kingdom Armed Forces Minister James Heappey has also warned of a highly credible threat of attack at Kabul airport by Islamic state militants. Embassies from United States, United Kingdom, and Australia have also warned about high security threats on the airport. \c\cU.S. President Joe Biden also received multiple reports of a possible attack during the week preceding the attack. \c\cThe attack was suspected to have been carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) amid the 2021 evacuation of Afghanistan. A crowd of local and foreign civilians had fled to the airport to evacuate. At Abbey Gate, one of the gates entering into the airport, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive. After the explosion, gunfire erupted and all gates at the airport were closed. At least 13 people were killed during the attack. The toll was confirmed by both Taliban officials and foreign troops. At least 60 people were injured, including a number of Taliban members and foreign soldiers. Four US Marines were among those killed, and up to five U.S. personnel were injured, including three U.S. Marines. \c\cA second explosion also occurred at Baron Gate, named after the nearby Baron Hotel in Kabul. Baron Hotel has been used in the past as a gathering point for American citizens for rescue and evacuation. The hotel also has served as a processing center for Afghan people fleeing the country to escape Taliban control. \c\cThe Taliban, through a tweet by their spokesperson, condemned the attack, saying "evil circles will be strictly stopped." Abdullah Abdullah, former Chief Executive of Afghanistan and current National Coalition of Afghanistan leader, also condemned the attack. \c\c France: French President Emmanuel Macron has voiced full support for coordinating with "American allies" in response to the explosions.
On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the arrests of 13 men suspected of orchestrating a domestic terror plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Governor of Michigan, and otherwise using violence to overthrow the state government. Half of the suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. \c\cPreceding the 2020 United States elections, law enforcement officials, members of Congress, and groups tracking extremism in the country have warned about the increasing threat potential from militia and far-right groups. The Anti-Defamation League identified Michigan as a state where the modern militia movement found its roots and where a number of militia groups remain active. However, Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the Wolverine Watchmen group, which the suspects were members of, "flew under the radar", adding, "This is simply not a big group that we\'d ever heard of."\c\cThe alleged plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer developed from June through September. Within the week preceding the Wolverine Watchmen arrests, there were at least three other state and federal arrest operations linked to the Boogaloo movement, of which the Wolverine Watchmen group's ideology adhered to. \c\cWhitmer, the main target of the plot, had seen her political profile elevated over the preceding months due to her early response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan, in which she enacted strict mitigation measures such as a lockdown of the state, which she was widely praised for. However, she became a target of criticism from far-right groups, and her measures triggered protests in April and May. President Donald Trump offered his support for the protests, derisively calling Whitmer "that woman from Michigan" and tweeting on April 17: "LIBERATE MICHIGAN!" Two weeks later, on April 30, armed protesters stormed the Michigan State Capitol. \c\cUltimately, on October 2, 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court made two rulings in response to the measures: a 4–3 ruling that declared a 1945 law allowing Whitmer to enact the measures was unconstitutional, and a unanimous ruling that declared a 1976 act did not give Whitmer the power to enact the measures without legislative approval. This put uncertainty over enforcement of the measures and forced the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services – and later, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration – to circumvent it by ordering similar measures, even after the alleged plot was made public. \c\cThe suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen. The group was co-founded by suspects Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison; the latter is considered the group's "commander". An NBC News investigation into the suspects\' social media profiles found links between their ideologies and those of the broader boogaloo movement. The Wolverine Watchmen group had been recruiting members on Facebook from November 2019 until June 2020, when Facebook began purging all boogaloo-related material. \c\cThe suspects named in the federal indictment, charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, were Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta. Five of the men were Michigan residents, while the sixth, Croft, was from Delaware. Adam Fox and Barry Croft were accused of being the ringleaders of the plot. The suspects charged with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership, were Wolverine Watchmen founders Musico and Morrison, along with Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar. At least four of the 13 suspects had attended prior rallies at the Michigan State Capitol. On October 15, a fourteenth suspect, Brian Higgins of Wisconsin, was charged at the state level with material support of an act of terrorism. Garbin pleaded guilty on January 27, 2021 and agreed to testify against his five alleged co-conspirators. \c\cJoseph M. Morrison is considered the leader of the Wolverine Watchmen. His home in Munith, which he shared with Musico, was allegedly used as a training site, according to Michigan Assistant Attorney General Gregory Townsend. Photographs of the home show a Confederate battle flag and a variation of the U.S. flag with alternating, vertical red and white stripes and a circle of stars surrounding the words "Liberty or Death". Morrison's neighbors told The Daily Beast that the home's residents were "disrespectful" and said large groups regularly gathered there on weekends, whereupon gunfire would be heard. His online alias was "Boogaloo Bunyan". Morrison had served in the U.S. Marine Corps since 2015, most recently with the 4th Marine Logistics Group in Battle Creek, Michigan, with the rank of lance corporal; he was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve on October 8, the same day as his arrest, for reasons unrelated to the criminal charges. \c\cAdam Fox, the alleged mastermind of the plot, was born Adam Waggoner but changed his last name to his mother's maiden name in 2014. He had been living in the basement of his former employer, a vacuum repair shop in Grand Rapids. Fox received permission for that living arrangement from the shop's owner who felt empathy towards Fox, as Fox was homeless and had dogs. The basement was allegedly used to hold one of the group's meetings. Fox posted a YouTube video in June, mentioning Whitmer's handling of the pandemic as one of his motives for the plot. According to his employer, Fox espoused anti-police and anti-government views, along with support for the boogaloo movement, and had recently become worried about the U.S. becoming a communist country and Democratic politicians taking away his guns. Fox had previously been a member of another militia group called the Michigan Home Guard, but he was kicked out due to "rage issues" and threatening other members on social media. \c\cTy Garbin was raised in Wyandotte but had been living in a manufactured home park in eastern Livingston County at the time of his arrest. His father is an Army veteran. Garbin was a licensed aircraft mechanic and had previously worked for SkyWest Airlines. He met Fox at a Second Amendment rally in Lansing. Garbin allegedly cased the governor's vacation home at night, texted about blowing up a bridge to slow police down, offered to paint his boat for "night fishing" as part of the kidnapping mission on the lake, and had the ability to manufacture guns. His lawyer mentioned he had no criminal record. \c\cBarry Croft regularly posted violent messages on his social media accounts. These accounts depicted him wearing a tricorne and a sweatshirt with an insignia associated with the Three Percenters militia group; he was later identified as the second-in-command of its Wisconsin branch. The FBI identified him as a national leader of the organization in January 2021. He expressed support for the Russia investigation origins counter-narrative and opposition to the country's current immigration policy, and he believed the investigations into President Trump constituted an "uprising". However, he also included Trump's name in a grievance-filled hit-list of politicians that he wanted to hang, which he posted on Facebook in late June. He was living in Bear, Delaware, at the time of his arrest. Croft was arrested multiple times from 1994 to 1996 for assault and burglary. He was convicted in 1997 for possessing a gun in the commission of a felony and spent three years in prison. In April 2019, Croft was pardoned for the conviction, as well as the prior assault and burglary charges, by Delaware Governor John Carney. According to recordings of the alleged plotters, Croft claimed he had been granted permission from God to commit murder. \c\cKaleb Franks had allegedly spent $4,000 on equipment during the planning, including a helmet and night-vision goggles. He also allegedly brought a rifle with a silencer to one of the training exercises. According to his LinkedIn profile, he studied clinical psychology at Washtenaw Community College and was employed as a peer recovery coach at an addiction treatment center in Waterford. He had previously battled an addiction to heroin but has been sober since 2013, according to his lawyer. He was convicted in 2011 for cocaine possession and in 2013 for second-degree home invasion. He served nine months in jail and two years under the jurisdiction of drug courts. \c\cDaniel Harris served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a rifleman from 2014 to June 2019, most recently at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Harris had been deployed to Japan and had reached the rank of corporal. He was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He worked as a security guard at two different companies after being discharged. In June, he attended a Black Lives Matter rally in his hometown of Lake Orion and was interviewed by a local newspaper, where he said he was "upset about the killing of George Floyd and police violence." The group allegedly met at his home on August 23 to discuss the plot. \c\cBrandon Caserta was depicted wearing a Hawaiian-style shirt associated with the boogaloo movement in a TikTok video; and on Facebook, he praised Kyle Rittenhouse, a civilian who shot three protesters, killing two, during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August. Caserta was also a COVID-19 denier and supported the QAnon conspiracy theory; however, in one video, he criticized President Trump and called him a tyrant. His belief system apparently became more extreme following Whitmer's implementation of the statewide lockdown. His social media activity originally consisted of posts about comedy shows and podcasts, motivational quotes, and selfies; but following the lockdown, he began "liking" posts about conspiracy theories regarding Bill Gates, as well as memes about hogtying police officers. \c\cPete Musico was active on YouTube, where he posted video blogs against taxes, gun control, and the so-called deep state. A video posted in 2019, entitled "Gretchen Whitmer Interview", depicted him railing against her policies around automobile ownership and promised he would interview Whitmer in person in a later video. Musico was also active on Gab, where he promoted the unfounded claim that there is an ongoing campaign to kill white people in South Africa. He also followed the accounts of Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs and InfoWars personality Owen Shroyer. On Twitter, he expressed support for Trump and conspiracy theories regarding Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the high presence of mercury in vaccines. Musico's attorney said he was eventually kicked out of the Wolverine Watchmen because he was too "soft" and wouldn\'t commit to violence. \c\cShawn Fix had allegedly hosted Wolverine Watchmen meetings at his home in Belleville to discuss the plot. The house's yard had Donald Trump presidential campaign signs and a Gadsden flag. He was working as a truck driver and had more than a dozen driving infractions from 2007 to 2018. Fix had been charged with assault and battery and aggravated assault in 2012, but the victim dropped the charges in 2013. \c\cEric Molitor had posted support of the boogaloo movement on his Facebook profile. He also spoke positively about Kyle Rittenhouse and the St. Louis gun-toting controversy, along with anti-government sentiment. He had worked for a company that provides respiratory and ballistic protection to the military and first responders. In January 2020, he gave the Wexford County Commission a proposal to make it a Second Amendment sanctuary county, which passed unanimously the next month. \c\cMichael and William Null, twin brothers, allegedly helped conduct surveillance on Whitmer's vacation home. They were also former members of another militia group called Michigan Liberty Militia. They were photographed at a protest held by Michigan United for Liberty, a right-wing group protesting against Whitmer's COVID-19 lockdown orders, at the Michigan State Capitol on April 30. William also attended another anti-lockdown rally in May, as well as Black Lives Matter rallies in Grand Rapids and Flint, according to Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf, though Leaf also said William vented about the movement. William was also photographed at a February 2017 protest against President Trump's Executive Order 13769, held by the Equality Caucus of Genesee County in Flint. He and members of the Michigan Liberty Militia were counter-protesting while wearing military fatigues, carrying firearms, and waving a Gadsden flag. William also allegedly made threats against the protesters on Facebook. \c\cPaul Bellar, who was arrested in Columbia, South Carolina, where he had moved from Milford over the summer after an eviction, was allegedly responsible for designing the tactical training exercises used by the Wolverine Watchmen, which included the use of firearms, medical treatment, and other tasks. Bellar's former neighbor in Milford said the pandemic caused Bellar to lose his job and called him a "very angry person" and said he threatened her with a gun after a run-in with him. According to Bellar's father, he trained for the U.S. Army at Fort Jackson for a year before being discharged in 2019 with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. \c\cBrian Higgins was a resident of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, when he was arrested on October 15. He is alleged to have provided his night-vision goggles and dashcam to help conduct surveillance on Whitmer's home. \c\cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that they became aware of group chats on social media in early 2020 threatening to conduct the violent overthrow of state governments and law enforcement. A U.S. Army veteran, "Dan", had joined the group but became concerned about their use of a hunting app that could be used to track the addresses of police officers. He informed a friend and a local officer from an unidentified police department in Michigan, who then relayed the concerns to the FBI. During the initial investigation of social media chats, the FBI said that they encountered Barry Croft and Adam Fox. The FBI then interviewed "Dan", who agreed to become a confidential source after they raised concerns that there were plans to kill officers. \c\cAccording to many of the alleged plotters, as detailed in a report by BuzzFeed News, their first meetings were arranged by someone who turned out to be a longtime government informant from Wisconsin, who paid for hotel rooms and food as incentives. On March 30, Pete Musico, a co-founder of the Wolverine Watchmen, allegedly made a comment about placing Whitmer under citizen's arrest and numerous other statements on tape that prosecutors later said had indicated "a violent intent". \c\cIntentions by the group to obtain Whitmer's address reportedly went as far back as April 19, according to court records. That same month, the Wolverine Watchmen allegedly built a fake house with PVC tubing, referred to as a "kill house", and "Dan" showed them how to push inside the building and clear the rooms; according to "Dan", Musico would circle the fake house and pretend to wait for Whitmer so he could "catch that bitch as she came out the emergency exit." On April 30, all members of the group attended an armed protest at the Michigan State Capitol, which prosecutors said was the beginning of opportunities to conduct surveillance. "Dan" reportedly heard "whispers" about storming the State Capitol during this time, but this did not happen when Michigan State Police officers stood down and granted the protesters access to the building. \c\cOn May 8, the FBI obtained a federal search warrant to review Croft's Facebook account. Agents found messages "plotting potential acts of violence", including a May 3 post referencing a male individual who "may be first" and was wanted "in custody"; the FBI claims this individual was South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. \c\cThe plot was reportedly hatched in an official capacity on June 6, among a group of about a dozen individuals meeting in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb located northwest of Columbus. A confidential source at the meeting reported that the group primarily sought to establish a new, self-reliant society that adhered to the U.S. Bill of Rights. Participants reportedly discussed peaceful and violent actions of achieving this goal, with talks shifting to how state governments were allegedly violating the U.S. Constitution, how "tyrants" should be killed, and that those present should return home to recruit neighbors. \c\cThe FBI subsequently began infiltrating the group online and in person with additional informants in June, according to a criminal complaint. A total of twelve informants were ultimately involved in the investigation, according to a federal court filing obtained by BuzzFeed News. Starting at that point, the FBI began compiling photographs, video footage, telephone calls, and encrypted messages made by the suspects and storing them as evidence on a USB flash drive. The content, said to consist of "hundreds of hours of undercover audio recordings and more than 13,000 pages of encrypted text messages", was released by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan on October 16. \c\cAfter the Ohio meeting, Fox allegedly contacted the militia – already being investigated by the FBI – seeking assistance for the plot. On June 14, the militia held a field training exercise. That day, Fox contacted one confidential source in a recorded phone call, detailing the Ohio meeting, and he requested "200 men" to attack the State Capitol in order to take Whitmer and others as hostages and to hold a "trial" for the governor, accusing her of treason. During the call, Fox reportedly said to the source that the operation had to occur prior to the 2020 United States presidential election. \c\cDuring a Second Amendment event at the State Capitol on June 18, Fox was recorded by a confidential source attempting to recruit militia group leaders to unite in an effort to attack the State Capitol. Two days later on June 20, Fox invited individuals, including one confidential source, to where he was employed in Grand Rapids. According to the source, Fox collected cellphones to prevent recordings and led participants through a trapdoor from the main floor, though the source wore a concealed recording device unknown to those gathered. Audio from the meeting provided to the FBI contained discussions of an assault on the Capitol, how to counterattack first responders, and the use of Molotov cocktails to destroy law enforcement vehicles. It was concluded that the group would meet on the first weekend of July, where they would discuss plans and perform training exercises. \c\cIn a June 25 Facebook video captured by the FBI, Fox held a livestream criticizing the justice system, the Government of Michigan and the state's order closing gyms, calling Whitmer a "tyrant bitch" and stating to viewers, "I don\'t know, boys, we gotta do something. You guys link with me on our other location system, give me some ideas of what we can do". \c\cThe FBI alleges that training first occurred on June 28 in Munith, Michigan at a militia member's property, with Fox, his girlfriend, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Caserta, and a confidential source participating in the exercises. Participants were reportedly told to leave if they felt uncomfortable with attacking the government and participating in kidnapping. According to Musico's defense attorney, Fox started making comments about storming the State Capitol during this training session, but there was no agreement from the other members, and Musico expressed concern about the plan's tactical viability, saying, "It's a fishbowl." Court documents released on November 13 alleged that in addition to storming the State Capitol, there were plans of executing hostages and televising them over the course of a week, or locking people inside the building, while the Legislature was in session, and setting it on fire with the intention of leaving no survivors. \c\cAccording to Musico's attorney, from that day to October 1, there was no activity from the Wolverine Watchmen due to a fight between Fox and Musico and Musico's eventual departure from the group. However, the FBI's confidential source for the investigation said that participants met for weapons exercises in Cambria, Wisconsin, between July 10 and 12, with Croft, Garbin, and a militia member attempting to make an improvised explosive device (IED) on July 11, though the device was defective. Franks also brought a rifle equipped with a silencer, firing it at the time. \c\cAt a second meeting in Ohio held on July 18, audio collected by a confidential source revealed discussions of attacking a Michigan State Police station, though Garbin rejected plans of an assault on the Capitol building, instead suggesting to attack Whitmer's family vacation home on Birch Lake in Elk Rapids. In a July 14 call recorded by a source, Fox said he researched the governor's office, concluding that Whitmer would not be present there and was heard saying, "In all honesty right now ... I just wanna make the world glow, dude. I\'m not even fuckin\' kidding. I just wanna make it all glow dude. I don\'t fuckin\' care anymore, I\'m just so sick of it. That's what it's gonna take for us to take it back, we\'re just gonna have to everything's gonna have to be annihilated, man. We\'re gonna topple it all, dude. It's what great frickin\' conquerors, man, we\'re just gonna conquer every fuckin\' thing man." In a July 26 call with a confidential source, Fox said "Maybe we should just make a bunch of cupcakes and send them out", with the source interpreting this as Fox seeking to initiate a "widespread bombing campaign", according to the FBI. \c\cFox invited participants to his Grand Rapids location on July 27, where a confidential source provided recordings of discussions that shifted to kidnapping Whitmer when she was arriving at, or leaving, either her personal vacation home or the Michigan Governor's Summer Residence on Mackinac Island. According to the FBI, in sourced audio, Fox could be heard saying, "Snatch and grab, man. Grab the fuckin\' Governor. Just grab the bitch. Because at that point, we do that, dude -- it's over." Fox was also heard in the recording suggesting that the group hire a realtor to find Whitmer's exact residence, collecting information on the surrounding area and recruiting individuals skilled with information technology and demolitions. \c\cParticipants met in Munith a second time for training on August 9, and afterwards, they communicated via group calls and chats monitored by a confidential source. In these communications, Fox suggested researching the governor's residence in Lansing and destroying Whitmer's boat. Harris said in a chat, "Have one person go to her house. Knock on the door and when she answers it just cap her ... at this point. Fuck it. ... I mean ... fuck, catch her walking into the building and act like a passers-by and fixing  [sic] dome her then yourself." During further chats on August 18, participants concentrated on finding the Whitmer family's vacation home and planned on how to escape the area by boat. \c\cOn August 23, participants met at Harris\' home in Lake Orion, where a secret recording was captured of the group discussing surveillance of the vacation home and Franks shared that he spent nearly $4,000 on night vision goggles and a helmet. A source captured audio of an August 29 surveillance operation, where Fox drove by the Whitmer family's vacation home, took photographs, and discussed response times of police in the area, with Fox allegedly heard saying, "We ain\'t gonna let \'em burn our fuckin\' state down. I don\'t give a fuck if there's only 20 or 30 of us, dude, we\'ll go out there and use deadly force." The next day on August 30, the FBI said screen captures of the group chat showed Garbin suggesting the demolition of a bridge over the Elk River, near the vacation home, to slow and distract police. \c\cDue to recommendation of the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, the construction of a $1.1 million barrier and electric fence at the Michigan Governor's Mansion in Lansing was announced on September 4 after weeks of construction, with spokeswoman Tiffany Brown saying "perimeter security and other safety upgrades" were being performed. Regarding the security upgrades, The Detroit News wrote "Whitmer, a Democrat who was first elected in 2018, has been the subject of menacing messages at Capitol demonstrations against her past COVID-19 stay-at-home orders", with the newspaper also citing other threats against Whitmer. \c\cWhile driving in three vehicles–with an undercover FBI agent and confidential source present–from a group camp in Luther towards the vacation home on September 12 and early September 13, Croft allegedly suggested that the group attempt to kidnap Whitmer that night, though the idea was dismissed. According to the FBI, Croft and Fox, who were in the first vehicle, planned on detonating a bomb on a bridge of U.S. Route 31 in Elk Rapids, photographing the underside of the bridge, and deciding where to place explosives. The group in the first vehicle then drove to a boat launch across the lake from the vacation home, waiting for a second vehicle to conduct surveillance on the location. The third vehicle, which was also occupied by an undercover agent, was tasked with monitoring for any followers or suspicious activity in the area. On the way back to Garbin's property, the group discussed abandoning the kidnapping plan and instead destroying the vacation home entirely. \c\cAt a discussion recorded at Garbin's property on September 13, Fox said the plan would strictly be a kidnapping, with the end result reportedly being either the abandonment of Whitmer on a boat in Lake Michigan or her being subjected to a trial as a "tyrant" in Wisconsin. When a plan to destroy the bridge leading to the lake in order to slow down responding security and police officers were raised, an undercover agent told Fox that the explosives necessary for destroying the bridge would cost about $4,000. The group decided that a final training exercise would be conducted later in October, though Fox pushed for an earlier date the following day. Fox ordered the explosives from the undercover agent that same day. Also on that day, Croft and Harris detonated an IED containing shrapnel near human silhouette targets to test its effectiveness. On October 2, Fox told a confidential source that he purchased an 800,000-volt taser to be used for the kidnapping. That same month, he reportedly contacted Musico, who advocated for a nonviolent approach. Fox, Garbin, Harris, and Franks planned to meet with an undercover FBI agent to purchase explosives on October 7, though Caserta did not attend due to work obligations, while Croft returned to Delaware prior to the meeting. \c\cAll of the members involved were arrested on the night of October 7, and charges were filed against them the next day. Search warrants and arrests were executed all across Michigan. The arrests were reportedly part of a planned effort between federal and state authorities, launched after evidence was discovered indicating the suspects wanted to kidnap Whitmer before the 2020 election. At least seven FBI field offices, along with the operational divisions at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., were reportedly involved in coordinating the arrests. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. The investigation also involved people from Baltimore to Kansas City. Several weapons and other items were seized, including at least 1,916 rounds of pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition; hundreds of firearms; extended magazines; various silencers; speedloaders; and bomb-making equipment. \c\cSix people (Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta) were charged in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan for conspiring to commit kidnapping. The federal charges carry a potential sentence of life imprisonment if convictions are obtained. A federal judge said the federal government had probable cause in the cases against five of the defendants and declared they could move forward to trial, while also denying bond to four of them. \c\cDuring a court hearing on October 13, an FBI agent testified that the conspirators had considered leaving Whitmer in a boat in the middle of Lake Michigan and disabling its motor. He also testified that the group had discussed, during early stages of the planning, kidnapping Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also imposed strict lockdown orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted the FBI to notify members of Northam's security staff about the potential threat. \c\cOn October 26, federal prosecutors announced the FBI had found "explosive device components" and ghost guns and are considering adding federal terrorism charges after they are analyzed by experts. On October 28, an unsealed search warrant revealed that some of the defendants had discussed South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster as another possible target during the early stages of planning in March. The warrant also revealed that, in late June, Croft had posted on Facebook a hit-list of politicians that he said he wanted to hang. The list included the names of McMaster, President Trump, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton, New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, other Democratic and Republican elected officials, liberals, Muslims, and "all anti-Americans". \c\cOn October 30, Franks's attorney requested a judge to reconsider her decision to keep him imprisoned, saying he is diabetic and fears contracting COVID-19 in jail. \c\cOn December 16, all six federal defendants were indicted by a grand jury. \c\cOn January 1, 2021, Croft, who remains jailed in a Philadelphia federal prison, asked to be released while he awaited his court hearings, due to the constant delays in a prisoner transfer and the subsequently slow progress of the case against him. Federal prosecutors argued against releasing him, describing Croft as a "violent extremist" and saying such a decision would be "unreasonable". \c\cOn January 15, 2021, a judge ordered all six defendants to stand trial on March 23. The trial date was later postponed to October 12. Croft, Fox, Harris, Franks, and Caserta pleaded not guilty to the charges. \c\cOn January 27, 2021, Garbin pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit kidnapping. His sentencing is scheduled for July 8. As part of a plea bargain, he agreed to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for no additional charges being filed against him by prosecutors. \c\cOn April 28, 2021, federal prosecutors charged Fox, Croft, and Harris with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, in relation to the explosives that Fox ordered from the undercover agent on September 13, 2020. \c\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged seven other men (Pete Musico, Joseph Morrison, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar) with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership. Two of the defendants were each set a bond of $10 million, with preliminary examinations scheduled for October 21. Musico's bond was later reduced to $100,000 after his attorney convinced the judge his role in the plot was overstated. \c\cOn October 20, Bellar was charged with state crimes and was extradited from his home state of South Carolina for a formal trial. \c\cOn November 10, Fix was released on a $250,000 bond. Three days later, bond was reduced for Morrison, Musico, and Bellar. Bellar was released on a $75,000 bond on November 13. \c\cOn October 15, Brian Higgins from Wisconsin was charged by Nessel with material support of an act of terrorism, which carries a 20-year sentence. On October 19, Higgins was released on bail, with one of the imposed restrictions being that he not try to make contact with the other 13 defendants. On November 18, his attorney announced his client's plans to challenge his extradition from Wisconsin to Michigan. The basis of the challenge was that the extradition paperwork was signed by Whitmer, the target of the alleged plot, thus creating a conflict of interest. On December 15, a judge in Columbia County, Wisconsin ruled there was enough probable cause for the transfer to occur. His extradition was delayed after his attorney filed an appeal on the ruling. \c\cOn December 4, twin brothers Michael and William Null were released on bond. \c\cOn December 18, a Jackson County judge denied a bond reduction request for Morrison, saying he could still pose a threat to the public. \c\cOn January 14, 2021, Molitor was released on bond. \c\cOn March 29, 2021, Morrison, Musico, and Bellar were bound over for trial after a three-day-long preliminary hearing. At the same hearing, threat of terrorism charges were dismissed against Morrison and Musico; Bellar did not face that charge. \c\cOn April 14, 2021, a judge lifted Michael and William Null's curfew and house arrest restrictions, but they were still required to wear GPS tethers. \c\cOn June 7, 2021, Musico called for his case to be dismissed, arguing entrapment by federal authorities and the confidential informant and claiming he would not have associated himself with Fox without police interference. He also claimed the informant led the training sessions for the Wolverine Watchmen; an FBI agent said in March that he instructed the informant to take on a leadership role during those sessions to prevent suspects from getting injured and thus requiring a law enforcement response while the Wolverine Watchmen were armed. Similar motions calling the case's dismissal on the grounds of entrapment are also expected from Morrison and Bellar. \c\cOn August 26, 2021 Ty Garbin, one of the individuals accused of being involved in the plot was sentenced to six years in prison and fined $2,500. \c\cWhitmer spoke out during a livestream held after the thwarted plot was revealed by the FBI. She thanked the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, called the plotters "sick and depraved men", and cast blame on President Trump for refusing to explicitly condemn far-right groups and for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer later urged in a tweet that the suspects be called domestic terrorists and not members of any militia organization. In an October 11 interview with Face the Nation, she said security threats against her still existed and that extremists like the Wolverine Watchmen are "finding comfort and support in the rhetoric coming out of Republican leadership from the White House to our state House." Whitmer wrote about the plot in an opinion piece in The Atlantic on October 27, where she continued to blame Trump's rhetoric for causing divisiveness in the country. \c\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the plot "one of the largest cases in recent history" and labeled the case as "rather unprecedented" in nature. State Senator Mike Shirkey, Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also condemned the plot. Chatfield later criticized Whitmer for not warning state lawmakers in advance about the plotters\' original intent to storm the Michigan State Capitol building. Delaware Governor John Carney, who pardoned one of the suspects in 2019, called the federal charges "disturbing" and said, "This is also another warning sign about the growing threat of violence and radicalization in our politics." Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also been discussed by the alleged plotters as a potential target, declined to comment about the details of the plot but said he and his family felt safe with the protection of the Virginia State Police. \c\cIn an October 8 interview, President Trump criticized Whitmer for her rebuke of him in response to the kidnapping plot, saying he condemned all forms of "extreme violence" and calling for her to reopen her state. During that interview, Trump falsely claimed that Michigan's schools and churches were closed under Whitmer's orders. In response to Trump's remarks, Whitmer said it "tells you everything you need to know" about the difference between him and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Biden also reacted to Trump's remarks on October 16, saying the "failure to condemn these folks is stunning."\c\cTrump continued to attack Whitmer for her COVID-19 mitigation measures at a rally in Muskegon on October 17, which was matched with chants of "Lock her up!", to which he replied, "Lock \'em all up." Trump's daughter-in-law Lara, a campaign surrogate, later insisted he was merely "having fun" at the rally. In a subsequent interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Whitmer called Trump's rhetoric "incredibly disturbing" and said it is "inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism". She also countered Trump's claims at the rally that she should relax the statewide COVID-19 restrictions, saying Michigan hasn\'t had a stay-at-home order since spring. At an October 27 rally in Lansing, Trump downplayed the alleged plot and continued the verbal attacks on Whitmer, which were also met with chants of "Lock her up!". \c\cSince the kidnapping plot at one point involved an intended attack on police, state law enforcement agencies were put on high alert in response. \c\cDar Leaf, the elected sheriff of Barry County, Michigan, appeared to defend two of the suspects in an October 8 interview, saying that "a lot of people are angry with the governor, and they want her arrested. So are they trying to arrest or was it a kidnap attempt? Because you can still in Michigan if it's a felony, make a felony arrest." Citing the state's citizen's arrest statute, he continued, "It doesn\'t say if you are an elected office that you\'re exempt from that arrest. I have to look at it from that angle and I\'m hoping that's more what it is, in fact, these guys are innocent till proven guilty so I\'m not even sure if they had any part of it."\c\cThe interview went viral on the internet, along with the revelation that Leaf had shared the stage with one of the suspects at a May 18 anti-lockdown protest. Attorney General Nessel condemned the remarks as "dangerous", while a number of other Michigan sheriffs expressed their outrage as well. Law experts disagreed with the notion that the Wolverine Watchmen were simply planning to conduct a legal citizen's arrest on Whitmer, saying it was far-fetched. Leaf later clarified his comments, claiming he simply wanted a fair trial for the accused and did not agree with their alleged actions, which he called "horrible". His earlier comments and his ties with one of the suspects during the anti-lockdown protest have spurred calls for him to resign. On October 13, Leaf acknowledged the criticism but said he will not resign. \c\cDemocrats in the Michigan Legislature renewed calls for a ban on guns in the State Capitol building in response to news of the plot, following an unsuccessful September proposal drafted in response to armed anti-lockdown protesters storming the building in April. \c\cOn December 14, the day that Michigan's electors to the Electoral College were set to meet at the capital, authorities closed the Michigan State Capitol to the public and shuttered state legislators\' offices in the wake of the alleged plot, following "credible threats of violence". The building was left open only to those needed for the Electoral College. Earlier that day, State Representative Gary Eisen claimed there would be a "Hail Mary" effort regarding a plan to prevent electors from casting a vote. When asked if he can assure the public that it will be a safe day in Lansing, and that nobody would get hurt, Eisen replied, "No. I don\'t know. Because what we\'re doing today is uncharted." Shortly after the interview, Chatfield and Speaker-Elect Jason Wentworth released a statement disavowing any threat of violence or intimidation and announcing Eisen would be removed from his committee assignments for the rest of the term. \c\cOn January 11, 2021, Michigan banned the open carry of firearms on the State Capitol, citing the alleged plot and the storming of the United States Capitol. The ban was supported by both Democratic and Republican state lawmakers. On January 15, 2021, the Michigan National Guard was requested, and heavy fencing was put up around the State Capitol, in preparation for an armed protest two days later, on January 17. \c\cA spokesperson for Facebook, which had been used by the suspects in plotting Whitmer's kidnapping, said the company would be cooperating with the FBI's investigation. \c\cA scheduled October 13 campaign stop by Eric Trump at a Lyon Township gun store was moved to a banquet center in Novi after it was discovered one of the suspects had worked there for three weeks before being fired. \c\cThe Wolverine Watchmen group was reportedly an offshoot of the Michigan Militia. The day after the suspects were arrested, the Michigan Militia issued a statement disavowing the group. Other Michigan-based militia groups also distanced themselves from the plotters\' actions and intentions. The Michigan Home Guard, a militia that one of the suspects had once been a member of before being kicked out earlier this year, released a statement condemning the Wolverine Watchmen's actions. \c\cConspiracy theories about the alleged plot emerged on social media, falsely claiming the Wolverine Watchmen were anarchists affiliated with the antifa and Black Lives Matter movements. Some social media posts promoting the theories were flagged by Facebook as part of its anti-misinformation campaign, while PolitiFact rated the posts as "Mostly False".
After the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan and proclaimed intentions to re-establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan after the August 2021 fall of Kabul, there has been one known drone strike against the country. \c\c27 August 2021: The United States launched an airstrike against an ISIL-KP member in Nangarhar Province.  The target was riding in a vehicle with one associate.  Two "high-profiled" ISIS targets were killed and a third person was injured.  The two targets killed were "ISIS-K planners and facilitators" of the 2021 Kabul airport attack.
A suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan took place on 26 August 2021 at 17:50 local time (13:20 UTC), during the evacuation from Afghanistan. At least 182 people were killed, including 28 members of the Taliban and 13 members of the United States military, who were the first American military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) claimed responsibility for the attack. On 27 August, the United States launched an airstrike against an ISIL-KP "planner" in Nangarhar Province. \c\cAfter Afghanistan fell to Taliban control on 15 August 2021, Hamid Karzai International Airport became the only secure way out of Afghanistan. Security concerns grew after hundreds of members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) escaped from jails at Bagram and Pul-e-Charkhi. On 16 August, the Pentagon warned the US Congress about the increased threat of a terrorist attack from IS following the fall of Kubul the day previous. US President Joe Biden received multiple reports of a possible attack during the week preceding the attack, and warned on 22 August in remarks from the White House that the longer US troops remained in the country, the greater the threat posed by IS became to US personnel and civilians near the Hamid Karzai International Airport. \c\cHours before the attack, US diplomats in Kabul warned American citizens to leave the airport because of security threats. United Kingdom Armed Forces Minister James Heappey had also warned of a highly credible threat of attack at Kabul airport by Islamic State militants. Embassies from United States, United Kingdom, and Australia also warned about high security threats on the airport. \c\cAmid the 2021 evacuation of Afghanistan, a crowd of local and foreign civilians had fled to the airport to evacuate. At Abbey Gate, one of the gates leading into the airport, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive. After the explosion, gunfire erupted, and all gates to the airport were closed. \c\cThe explosion occurred by a canal with American forces on one side; checking evacuees passports, visas and other documentation before allowing them inside the airport. An eyewitness stated that the explosion felt as if someone pulled the ground from under his feet, and saw other evacuees thrown in the air by the force of the blast. \c\cInitial reports erroneously stated that a second explosion had taken place near the close-by Baron Hotel. The following day, it was confirmed that there was no such second explosion. \c\cAt least 182 people were killed during the attack, including 169 Afghan civilians and 13 US service members. Two of the killed civilians were British dual-nationals and one was the child of a British national. It was initially reported that 28 Taliban fighters had also been killed in the attack, but this was later denied by Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The dead Americans were identified as eleven marines, one soldier, and one Navy corpsman. The US deaths were the first US service deaths in Afghanistan since February 2020 and were the largest single loss of life of US military personnel since the 2011 Afghanistan Boeing Chinook shootdown. \c\cAt least 150 more people were injured, including 18 US military personnel and a number of Taliban members. \c\cThe attack was carried out by ISIL-KP, which released a claim of responsibility and named the bomber as Abdul Rahman al-Logari. \c\cThe Taliban and ISIL-KP, despite both being jihadist groups, are enemies and have fought a bloody war among each other. General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., head of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), said there was no indication that the Taliban allowed the attacks to happen. \c\cThrough a tweet by their spokesperson, the Taliban condemned the attack, saying "evil circles will be strictly stopped". The Taliban later announced that they would take every possible measure to capture ISIL-KP leader Shahab al-Muhajir. \c\cAbdullah Abdullah, former Chief Executive of Afghanistan and current National Coalition of Afghanistan leader, condemned the attack. Some civilians claimed to reporters that the attack had strengthened their resolve to evacuate from the country in fear of more attacks. \c\cUS President Joe Biden made a public address following the attack. He honored the American service members who were killed, calling them "heroes" and saying they lost their lives "in the service of liberty", and stated that the US had evacuated more than 100,000 Americans, Afghans, and others. He expressed deep sorrow for the Afghan victims as well. Biden said to those who wished harm upon the US that "we will hunt you down and make you pay." The government of the United Kingdom also said that they will continue Operation Pitting, the evacuation from Afghanistan. \c\cMany nations expressed condemnation for the Kabul airport attack and solidarity with the victims and troops conducting evacuations at the airport. The European Commission and the United Nations likewise condemned the attack. German Chancellor Angela Merkel cancelled an upcoming trip to Israel, and will stay in Germany to monitor the evacuation of German troops. Biden also rescheduled a meeting with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett because of the attack. The United Kingdom said civilian evacuations would continue in spite of the attack. \c\cOn 27 August, The United States launched an airstrike against an ISIL-KP member in Nangarhar Province.  The target was riding in a vehicle with one associate.  Two "high-profiled" ISIS targets were killed and a third person was injured.  The two targets killed were "ISIS-K planners and facilitators" of the 2021 Kabul airport attack.
Relations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the United States started recently, but not officially, on August 15, 2021, after the Taliban returned to power and proclaimed intentions to re-establish the Islamic Emirate after the August 2021 fall of Kabul. \c\cThe United States does not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as a government, although the US said they could recognize a government that respected basic rights. \c\cOn August 27, The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan appointed Khalil Haqqani as head of security in Kabul. Haqqani, a veteran of the Soviet–Afghan War and war on terror, is a designated terrorist by the United States, and is currently wanted on a US$5 million bounty. \c\cFollowing the 2021 Kabul airport attack, through a tweet by their spokesperson, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan condemned the attack, saying "evil circles will be strictly stopped". The Taliban later announced that they would take every possible measure to capture ISIS-K leader Shahab al-Muhajir. The United States also launched an airstrike on the 27th that killed two "high-profiled" ISIS targets and a third person was injured.  The two targets killed were "ISIS-K planners and facilitators". \c\cFollowing the airstrike by the US on August 27, Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid condemned the attack saying they consider the airstrike a "clear attack on Afghan territory".
The COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in New South Wales was identified on 19 January 2020 in Sydney where three travellers returning from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cAs of 27 August 2021[update], there have been 23,183 confirmed cases, there are 14,671 active cases, and 139 deaths, from COVID-19 in New South Wales. \c\cPremier Gladys Berejiklian formed a "war cabinet" to make decisions in relation to the pandemic. Members include herself, Treasurer Dominic Perrottet, Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard and Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott. \c\cOn 15 March, Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Education, Mark Scott ordered that, effective immediately, New South Wales schools introduce social distancing measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus. The order required schools to cancel all assemblies, excursions, travel, concerts, large inter-school sporting and arts events, and other events that would require students and staff to congregate in large numbers. Schools were to stay open. Four schools in the state have been shut for periods during the crisis due to confirmed cases within their school communities. \c\cOn 16 March, New South Wales Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard announced that he was using his powers, under Section 7 of the \'Public Health Act 2010\', to immediately and indefinitely cancel all public events with more than 500 attendees. The order is enforceable by NSW Police and violations of the order can carry a prison term of six months, an $11,000 fine, or both. \c\cChief Justice Bathurst, Chief Justice of New South Wales, and Chief Judge Price of the District Court of New South Wales ordered that effective 16 March 2020, new jury trials would be suspended to limit the spread of coronavirus. The order did not apply to already empanelled jury trials. Corrective Services New South Wales implemented screening mechanisms, early flu vaccination programs and stricter hygiene requirements for staff, visitors and inmates to slow the spread of the virus. \c\cThe University of Sydney cancelled all graduations, conferences, academic and student organised events. The University of New South Wales announced that it was cancelling all student and academic events until Easter, encourage staff to work from home and, where possible, shift all lectures, tutorials, demonstrations and labs to online learning. \c\cNew South Wales schools were directed by the State Department of Education Secretary, Mark Scott, to cancel all assemblies, excursions, travel, and some events and conferences, including arts and initiative events, as well as whole school sporting events and inter-school sporting events with three or more involved schools. \c\cOn 17 March, the New South Wales government announced a A$2.3 billion stimulus package, including A$700 million for health services. A$450 million was allocated to waive payroll tax for 3 months. $250 million so state-owned buildings and public schools could employ more cleaners. A$750 million was allocated for capital works and public asset maintenance. \c\cEven though there was a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people, huge crowds flocked to the popular Bondi Beach and other beaches across Sydney on Friday 20 March. Health Minister Greg Hunt said that such behaviour was "unacceptable" while the New South Wales Labor's Shadow Treasurer, Walt Secord urged the government to completely close off the beach. New South Wales Police Minister David Elliott later stated in a televised interview that lifeguards were instructed to keep a head count of the people at the beach and if the number exceeded 500, the beach would be closed. On 21 March, crowds built up yet again which led Waverley Council to temporarily close Bondi, and the other beaches of Bronte and Tamarama. \c\cOn 22 March, a public health order was issued that declared Lord Howe Island a public risk area and directed restricted access. As of that date there were no known cases of COVID-19 on Lord Howe Island. \c\cBy 27 March, NSW local council elections due in September 2020 were postponed to September 2021. They were later postponed again to 4 December 2021 due to a wave of delta COVID-19 variant infections that caused numerous lockdowns in the state. \c\cOn 30 March, NSW Parliament passed the "COVID-19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement" law, which limited public gatherings to two people and directed, "that a person must not, without reasonable excuse, leave the person's place of residence." It listed 16 reasonable excuses and took effect from midnight on 31 March. \c\cAs of 15 May, some restrictions on public and private gatherings were eased. Private homes were allowed 5 visitors. Free standing cafes and restaurants, and those inside pubs and clubs, were allowed very limited sit-down dining, after being restricted to take-away only since 23 March. Bars and gaming areas remained closed. A maximum of 10 people were permitted in restaurants and cafes, while social distancing rules still had to be followed. Outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people were permitted. Up to 10 guests were permitted at weddings, and funerals could have up to 20 mourners indoors, 30 outdoors. Up to 10 people were allowed at indoor religious gatherings such as churches. \c\cFrom 13 June, private homes were allowed to have up to 20 guests visit, and groups of 20 were allowed to meet outside. Food courts were allowed to open, so long as the 4-square-metres-per-patron rule was kept, and no more than 50 patrons. Indoor gym classes were allowed 10 participants. Up to 100 persons were allowed inside gyms, so long as area requirements were adhered to. \c\cFrom 1 July, New South Wales eased restrictions further due to the limited community transmission of COVID-19, at that time. No set upper limit on patron numbers at indoor venues, but only one person per 4 square metres. Outdoor venues, with a maximum capacity of 40,000, were allowed up to 25 per cent of normal capacity. Events had to be ticketed, patrons seated and follow guidelines. Restriction on funerals eased, but the four-square-metre rule applied. Other existing restrictions, no more than 20 guests inside homes, 20 outside, remained in force. Restrictions were tightened again on 17 July. (See below)\c\cFrom 5 July, the Federal Government introduced restrictions on the number of passengers arriving at Sydney Airport. A maximum of 50 passengers were allowed per flight, and international arrivals were set at 450 per day. This was by request of the NSW Government to reduce pressure on hotel quarantine capacity. More than 32,000 travellers had quarantined in Sydney hotels by this date. \c\cOn 6 July, the Victorian and NSW State Governments, jointly announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July, following a large spike in cases in certain areas of Melbourne. \c\cAs of 12:01 a.m. on 17 July, after an increase in cases, new rules for pubs were introduced. Measures included, group bookings and persons at a table were limited to 10 (formerly 20), and a maximum of 300 people allowed inside any venue. COVID Safe Hygiene Marshalls to oversee the venues COVID-19 infection prevention were also required, and venue COVID-Safe registration was compulsory. Paper-based sign-ins are allowed, but a digital record of patrons contact details, for contact tracing, must be provided on request. Breaching the rules can result in a A$55,000 fine for the venue, plus another A$27,500 for each day the breach is continued. As of 24 July, the tightened venue restrictions were also applied to bars, cafes, clubs and restaurants. \c\cUntil 18 July, international travellers who had to undergo compulsory quarantine on arrival did not have to pay for their accommodation, at a cost of A$65 million to the NSW Government. Under new rules announced on 11 July, as of 12:01 a.m. on Saturday 18 July 2020, all new arrivals are being charged for their quarantine. The charge includes meals and room costs, for which one adult will pay A$3,000, additional adults A$1,000, children A$500, and no charge for children under 3 years. Those already quarantined will not have to pay, nor will those who purchased flights, and, had a confirmed international arrival date, before 11:59  p.m. on 12 July 2020 AEST. \c\cOn 20 July, the number of daily overseas arrivals allowed at Sydney Airport was reduced to 350 from the 450 limit set on July 5. \c\cOn 5 August, it was announced that as from 7 August all Victorians arriving in NSW would be required to quarantine, at their own expense, in hotels for 14 days. Air arrivals from Victoria were only  allowed at Sydney Airport. \c\cOn 17 November 2020 the NSW Government announced the "Dine and Discover" programme in the state budget. All NSW residents over 18 years-of-age were eligible to receive four A$25 vouchers through Service NSW to help stimulate the economy. Two vouchers are for dining, Monday to Thursday only, excluding public holidays. The other two are to be spent on entertainment, excluding on public holidays. Businesses need to be COVID-safe registered, and sign-up for the scheme. The vouchers cannot be used for gambling, alcohol, cigarettes, retail purchases or accommodation. The program was originally called "Out and About". \c\cAs early as mid-April 2021, the scheme was said by some regional NSW residents to be "city centric\'. At this time, the vouchers had been used by less than 10% of the 5 million who could use it. There were calls by NSW opposition political parties for the scheme to be extended beyond its initial 30 June 2021 deadline to use the vouchers. On 9 June 2021, the Dine & Discover scheme was extended by a month to 31 July, and on 29 June extended again to 31 August.  Use for take-away food purchases was also allowed. The vouchers were eventually extended to 30 June 2022. \c\cFrom 23 November, it became mandatory for many businesses to use electronic record systems to collect details of patrons for possible contact tracing. \c\cDuring the second week of December 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 in Avalon began.[citation needed] A stay at home advisory was issued on 17 December. \c\cOn 19 December 2020, a public health order was issued, locking down Sydney's Northern Beaches. Residents of the Northern Beaches LGA were required to stay at home from 5 pm on Saturday 19 December, until 11:59 pm on Wednesday 23 December unless they had a lawful reason to travel, including for: essential shopping; essential travel for work and to or from a school or educational institution; exercise; medical care, carer's responsibilities or compassionate needs. Entry to the area was similarly restricted. Public gatherings were limited to two persons. \c\cBy 20 December, there were 68 cases. This prompted restrictions on admission of Sydney residents or visitors to Sydney, to other states. These ranged from 14-day quarantines (ACT, NT, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria) to no entry without an exemption (Queensland). South Australia barred entry to anyone from the Northern Beaches, while Western Australia barred everyone coming from NSW. Measures to stem the spread of COVID-19 in Sydney were again tightened. No more than 10 people were allowed in homes in Greater Sydney, Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Illawarra-Shoalhaven. \c\cNew Year's Eve celebrations were restricted in Sydney city, around the harbour and suburbs. The midnight fireworks on Sydney Harbour, normally 20 minutes, were cut back to 7 minutes, with no fireworks at 9 pm. The harbour foreshores were closed to prevent crowds congregating. Only residents, guests,  and those with bookings at bars, hotels and restaurants, were allowed in foreshore areas under a pass system. Vantage points in North Sydney were also closed. \c\cFrom 1 January, hospitality venues and hairdressers were required to use the NSW Government QR code system for patron check-in. \c\cOn Saturday, 2 January 2021, it was announced that as of midnight that day, facemasks would become mandatory in many enclosed places in Greater Sydney. All public transport, shops, supermarkets, cinemas, theatres and places of worship were included. Hospitality workers also had to wear masks. Children under 12 years-of-age were exempt. An A$200 on the spot fine could be charged for non-compliance. Fines were applied from 4 January (Monday). \c\cMaximum gym class sizes were reduced from 50 to 30, worship from 300 down to 100, weddings were limited to 100, or one per 4 square metres. Outdoor performances reduced from 1,000 to 500 patrons. Events which were "seated, ticketed and enclosed" were reduced back to 2,000 maximum. Night clubs were "not permitted". \c\cOn 21 February, the first public COVID-19 vaccinations in Australia, with the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, were administered in Sydney. Up to 6:00 pm on 23 February in NSW, 3,200 people were immunised across three state-run hospitals. \c\cAs of 24 February, there was no transmission of COVID-19 in the community in NSW for 38 days. On 17 March restrictions were to be "revisited". Also on 24 February, further restriction easing was announced in NSW. From 12:01 am on 26 February (Friday):\c\cDancing and singing was allowed at gatherings\c\cAt weddings, up to 30 people, including guests, could dance at one time. (previously, only the wedding party, a maximum of 20 people. The 300 person limit for wedding guests remained)\c\cUp to 50 people at their home (up from 30) Visitor number includes adults and children. \c\cUp to 50 people allowed in gym classes (4-square metre rule applies)\c\cUp to 30 singers allowed in choirs and religious congregations. Masks required, place of worship must adhere to the 4-square metre rule. \c\cOn 5 May in Sydney, a case of COVID-19 in a man in his 50s was detected with no known physical link to travel or border control/quarantine hotels or workers. His wife also tested positive to COVID-19. Genomic testing provided a link to an overseas (US) acquired infection at the Park Royal in Darling Harbour. The new cases are believed to have been infectious while visiting at least 20 locations in Sydney from 30 April to 4 March. Due to these community transmitted infections, COVID related restrictions in Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains and Wollongong were tightened, initially for 3 days, from 5 pm on 6 May (Friday), to 12:01 am on 9 May (Monday). \c\cMask-wearing was again made mandatory at indoor places, including:\c\cPublic transport\c\cSupermarkets\c\cOther indoor events\c\cHospitality staff at front of house had to be masked\c\cPatrons drinking had to be seated. \c\cNo singing or dancing at indoor venues, including,\c\cPlaces of worship and\c\cEntertainment venues. \c\cExemptions included weddings, and dancers or singers performing in shows. \c\cOnly 20 visitors allowed at private homes\c\cMaximum 2 visitors at aged care facilities\c\cOn 9 May, because the "missing link" in the two community transmitted infections that caused the restriction tightening on 5 May had not been located, most of the extra restrictions were extended another seven days until 12:01 am on 17 May. The main change was mask wearing was not required indoors by patrons of shops and hospitality venues, except for gaming areas where masks are still needed. On public transport and other indoor public venues masks remained mandatory. 13,768 COVID tests were undertaken in the 24 hours to 8:00 pm that day, but NSW recorded no locally acquired COVID-19 infections. On 17 May the temporary restrictions from 5 May were lifted. The missing link in the cases of community transmission that led to these restrictions had still not been located. \c\cOn 10 May, a mass vaccination hub opened at Sydney Olympic Park. The same day, registrations began for NSW residents aged 40 to 49-years to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. \c\cOn 1 June, it was found that a later confirmed COVID-19 case from Melbourne had travelled to New South Wales, before Victorias\' fourth lockdown was imposed on 27 May, while possibly infectious. Possible exposure sites included venues in Goulburn, Jervis Bay, Hyams Beach and Vincentia. \c\cFrom 16 June, NSW residents aged over 50 were able to get an AstraZeneca vaccination from selected pharmacies. 1,250 pharmacies were approved by the NSW health department to administer the vaccine under strict regulations. However,  on 17 June the Commonwealth government decided, on the advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), to change their previous advisory of 50 years plus, and only recommend the AstraZeneca vaccine for those over 60 years-of-age. \c\cOn 16 June, the case of COVID-19 that was the first in what became known as the Bondi cluster was confirmed. The man in his 60s worked as a limousine driver, and had been transporting crew off international flights. By 12 August 2021[update], what began in Bondi spread widely and new cases reported in NSW reached 6,874. There had been at least 38 deaths during the outbreak of Delta variant COVID-19, raising the total number of COVID deaths in NSW to 95 since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. Greater Sydney, Wollongong, the Blue Mountains, Central and Northern NSW, the Central Coast, Far North Coast and other regions in NSW were, or had been, in lockdown, and the Delta outbreak had spread interstate causing more lockdowns including the ACT, Victoria, and South East Queensland. \c\cOn 18 June from 4pm in Greater Sydney (not including the Illawarra and Wollongong regions), masks were again made mandatory on public transport for at least the next 5 days. This was after the COVID-19 cluster in Sydneys\' Eastern Suburbs had grown to 4 cases. The same day it was announced that from 1:00am on 19 June, the eastern Sydney local government area of Waverley would be declared a COVID-19 hotspot by the Queensland government. \c\cBy 22 June the cluster in Bondi had increased by 10 to 22 cases, 31 cases by 23 June, 36 by 24 June, 65 by 25 June, and there were 130 cases in Sydney, of which 124 were linked to the Bondi cluster, by 28 June. The cluster reached 160 cases by 30 June, 175 by 1 July, 188 by 2 July, and 207 by 3 July. Known linked cases reached 285 by 9 July, after which NSW Health did not report them separately. By 31 July there had also been 16 deaths linked to this outbreak. \c\cNew movement restrictions were enacted from 4pm on 23 June. People from the NSW LGAs of:\c\cBayside\c\cCanada Bay\c\cInner West\c\cRandwick\c\cWaverley\c\cWoollahra\c\cwere not permitted to leave the Sydney metropolitan area, except for essential purposes. \c\cTighter social distancing restrictions were also enacted on 23 June, covering residents of Greater Sydney, Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Wollongong, and Shellharbour. \c\cRestrictions as of 24 June were scheduled to remain in force until 1 July at 12:01am, but were extended on 25 June to 11:59pm on 2 July, and the next day extended again to 11.59pm on 9 July. On 14 July, after 97 new cases were recorded, the lockdown was extended another 2 weeks to 11:59pm on 30 July. On 28 July, the lockdown in Greater Sydney, and other NSW LGAs in lockdown that day, was again extended from 31 July to 12:01am on 28 August. From 5pm on 14 August, all of regional NSW was also put into lockdown until 12:01am on 22 August. \c\cOn 25 June, after 22 new cases of the delta variant brought infections linked to the Bondi cluster to 65 total, a lockdown was announced for four Sydney LGAs. The City of Sydney, Randwick, Waverley and Woollahra were the affected places. From 11:59pm on 25 June those who live there, or had worked there in the previous 14 days, had to isolate at home until at least 11:59pm on 2 July. (Later extended to 11.59pm on 9 July.) The usual \'essential reasons\' for leaving home apply. Up to 1 million people may be affected. Current NSW restrictions like mandatory masks indoors and on public transport were extended to the same time and date. \c\cWeddings were permitted on 26 – 27 June, but then banned until 9 July. \c\cBy 26 June, infections linked to the Bondi cluster rose to 80. Of these, 20 were also connected to a birthday party in Hoxton Park. By this date 2,076,483 vaccine doses had been administered in NSW, 18,088 of them in the 24 hours to 8pm on 25 June. The lockdown area in NSW was expanded from 6:00pm to cover Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Wollongong, and the lockdown length was also extended until 11.59pm on 9 July. \c\cRestrictions for the rest of NSW were also increased:\c\cOnly 5 visitors allowed in homes (includes children)\c\cMasks mandatory in indoor, non-residential settings\c\cThe 4-square-metre space rule applies again for indoor or outdoor settings. \c\cDrinking while standing at indoor venues not permitted\c\cDancing not permitted at indoor hospitality venues and nightclubs,\c\cDancing is allowed at weddings for the wedding party (20 people maximum)\c\cDance and gym classes, 20 people maximum per class,\c\cMasks mandatory\c\cPeople in NSW who had been in the Greater Sydney region (including Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Wollongong) on, or after, June 21 must adhere to stay-at-home orders for 14 days after they left \c\cBy 28 June the outbreak in Sydney had increased to 130 cases, 124 of them linked to the cluster in Bondi. \c\cOn 29 June, the Dine and Discover stimulus scheme was extended for the second time, to 31 August, and now also allowed take-away food purchases. \c\cBy 30 June, the \'Bondi cluster\' of delta variant COVID-19 reached 160 cases, becoming Sydney's largest cluster to this date. The previous high was 151 in the \'Northern Beaches\' or \'Avalon cluster\', in December 2020–January 2021. The next largest after Avalon was 116 cases in the Wetherill Park cluster of July–August 2020. Sydney had 18 clusters by this date. \c\cBy 1 July, there were 175 reported infections linked to the Bondi cluster, 188 by 2 July, 207 by 3 July, and 222 by 4 July. \c\cOn 3 July, stay-at-home orders for people in NSW who had been in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and some Queensland local government areas were lifted. \c\cOn 7 July, the lockdown in Greater Sydney was extended for 7 days until 12:01am on 17 July. This followed the state having 27 new cases of COVID-19. There were more cases in Canterbury-Bankstown, Fairfield, and Liverpool. Over 45,000 people were tested for COVID "overnight". Also by 7 July, the Bondi cluster linked cases had reached 264. There were another 93 locally acquired cases for a total of 357 since 16 June, when the first Bondi cluster case was reported. \c\cOn 8 July, the Bondi cluster linked cases had reached 279. There were 40 hospitalised cases, 11 in intensive care with 3 on ventilation. \c\cOn 9 July, Bondi cluster linked cases had reached 285.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in the Philippines was identified on January 30, 2020, and involved a 38-year-old Chinese woman who was confined at San Lazaro Hospital in Metro Manila. On February 1, a posthumous test result from a 44-year-old Chinese man turned out positive for the virus, making the Philippines the first country outside China to record a confirmed death from the disease. \c\cAfter over a month without recording any cases, the Philippines confirmed its first local transmission on March 7, 2020. Since then, the virus has spread to the country's 81 provinces. National and local governments have been imposing community quarantines since March 15, 2020, as a measure to limit the spread of the virus. These include the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) that was implemented in March–May 2020. On March 24, President Rodrigo Duterte signed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, a law that granted him additional powers to handle the pandemic. This was repealed by a follow-up law, the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act, which he signed on September 11. \c\cMore than 1.9 million cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 33,000 deaths, the second-highest in Southeast Asia, behind Indonesia. The largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases was reported on August 28, 2021, when the Department of Health (DOH) announced 19,441 new cases. \c\cThe Philippines had a slightly lower testing capacity than its neighbors in Southeast Asia during the first months of the pandemic in the country. COVID-19 tests had to be taken in Australia, as the Philippines lacked testing kits. By the end of January 2020, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila began its testing operations and became the country's first testing laboratory. 278 laboratories that are capable of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been accredited by the DOH since then. As of August 14, 2021, 273 of these have conducted 17,633,312 tests from more than 16,575,223 unique individuals. \c\cThe Philippines reported its first suspected case of COVID-19 in January 2020. It involved a 5-year-old boy in Cebu, who arrived in the country on January 12 with his mother. At that time, the Philippines had no capability to conduct COVID-19 tests. The boy tested positive for "non-specific pancoronavirus assay" in the RITM. Samples from the boy were also sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia to determine the specific coronavirus strain. The boy tested negative for COVID-19 but several suspected cases were already reported in various parts of the country. \c\cThe RITM developed capability to conduct confirmatory tests for COVID-19 in response to the emergence of suspected COVID-19 cases. It started conducting confirmatory tests on January 30. \c\cThe first case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was confirmed on the same day. The diagnosed patient was a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, who had arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on January 21. She was admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25 after she sought a consultation due to a mild cough. At the time of the confirmation announcement, the Chinese woman was already asymptomatic. \c\cThe second case was confirmed on February 2, a 44-year-old Chinese male who was the companion of the first case. His death on February 1 was the first recorded outside China. He suffered from coinfection with influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae. \c\cOn February 5, the DOH confirmed a third case in a 60-year-old Chinese woman who flew into Cebu City from Hong Kong on January 20 before she traveled to Bohol where she consulted a doctor at a private hospital on January 22, due to fever and rhinitis. Samples taken from the patient on January 24 returned a negative result, but the DOH was notified on February 3 that samples taken from the patient on January 23 tested positive for the virus. The patient upon recovery on January 31 was allowed to go home to China. \c\cAfter a month of reporting no new cases, on March 6, the DOH announced two cases consisting of two Filipinos. One is a 48-year-old man with a travel history to Japan, returning on February 25 and reported symptoms on March 3. The other is a 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes who experienced symptoms on February 25 and was admitted to a hospital on March 1 when he experienced pneumonia. He had last visited a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan. The DOH confirmed that the fifth case had no travel history outside the Philippines and is, therefore, the first case of local transmission. A sixth case was later confirmed, that of a 59-year-old woman who is the wife of the fifth case. Since then, the Department of Health recorded a continuous increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the country. \c\cCases abroad involving foreigners with travel history in the Philippines were reported in early March 2020. The first three recorded cases involving an Australian, a Japanese, and a Taiwanese national had a history of visiting the Philippines in February 2020. Though it was unconfirmed whether or not they had contracted the virus while in the Philippines, speculations arose on undetected local transmissions in the country due to prior confirmation of the Philippines\' first case of local transmission. \c\cRetrospective studies have been made to determine the strain of virus responsible for causing the community outbreak of COVID-19 in the Philippines since March 2020. In May 2020, Edsel Salvaña, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and member of the IATF-EID, said that the strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak in the country that started in March 2020 is closely related to the strain affecting India at the time. The virus strain's family tree is said by Salvaña to have appeared in China and Australia. In a July 2020 webinar led by Cynthia Saloma, Executive Director of the UP Philippine Genome Center two hypotheses was presented regarding the source of the March 2020 outbreak in the Philippines. Genetic sequence analysis of samples collected from Philippine General Hospital patients from March 22–28 suggest that there are at least two sources of viral transmission in the Philippines; China, mainly from Shanghai and from Japan specifically through repatriated Filipino seafarers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship. \c\cSeveral measures were imposed to mitigate the spread of the disease in the country, including bans on travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and South Korea. On March 7, 2020, the Department of Health (DOH) raised its "Code Red Sub-Level 1," with a recommendation to the President of the Philippines to impose a "public health emergency" authorizing the DOH to mobilize resources for the procurement of safety gear and the imposition of preventive quarantine measures. On March 9, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Proclamation No. 922, declaring the country under a state of public health emergency. \c\cOn March 12, President Duterte declared "Code Red Sub-Level 2," issuing a partial lockdown on Metro Manila to prevent a nationwide spread of COVID-19. The lockdowns were expanded on March 16, placing the entirety of Luzon under an "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ). Other local governments outside Luzon followed in implementing similar lockdowns. On March 17, President Duterte issued Proclamation No. 929, declaring the Philippines under a state of calamity for a tentative period of six months. \c\cAdditional facilities started to conduct confirmatory testing. On March 20, four facilities, namely the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Benguet, and the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila (where the first case was admitted to), began conducting tests as well augmenting the RITM. Other facilities began operations as well in the following days. \c\cOn March 25, the President signed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, which gave him additional powers to handle the outbreak. \c\cBy April, COVID-19 had spread to all 17 regions of the Philippines, with the confirmation of a case in April 6 of a patient confined at a hospital in Surigao City who had been in the Caraga region since March 12 after traveling from Manila. \c\cPresident Duterte on April 7 accepted the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) to extend the ECQ in Luzon until April 30. \c\cOn April 17, it was reported that the country had been able to bring down the viral disease\' reproduction number to 0.65 from 1.5, which meant that the average number of people a person could infect decreased from more than one to less than one. Recent data at the time suggested that the country was doing better in "flattening the curve", but was warned of a "resurgence" and must ramp up mass testing in order to isolate cases and avoid further transmission of COVID-19. \c\cSometime in late April, local government units (LGUs) were no longer authorized to impose quarantine measures without the consent of the IATF-EID. Prior to that period, LGUs could impose such measures in coordination with the Department of the Interior and Local Government. \c\cThe ECQ in Luzon was extended until May 15 in some areas. This included Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Central Luzon (except Aurora), Pangasinan, and Benguet. ECQ measures were also extended in the provinces of Iloilo and Cebu as well as in Davao City. Other areas were downgraded or placed under general community quarantine (GCQ). \c\cOn May 14, Typhoon Vongfong (local name: Ambo) landed on Samar Island. In the Philippines, tens of thousands of people who were locked out due to lockdowns were faced with the dual threat of typhoons and viruses, forcing complex and dangerous evacuation. At each shelter in the central part of the Philippines, in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection, only half of the capacity was accepted, and a mask was required when evacuating. Typhoon Vongfong killed five people in the Philippines. By the time Vongfong landed, the number of confirmed infections was 11,618 and the number of deaths (due to infectious diseases) was 772 in the Philippines. Vongfong also approached Manila, but due to severe restrictions on going out of Manila, most people, including low-income people living in simple houses, could not go to shelters and were forced to wait at home. \c\cAfter May 15, the Philippine government revised its quarantine classifications in correspondence to an earlier announcement that "Science and Economics will be considered for any changes of the lockdown measures." A modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was applied to Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu City, while a GCQ was raised to 41 provinces and 10 cities with moderate risk. Meanwhile, 40 provinces and 11 cities that were considered "low-risk areas" were supposed to be released from community quarantine measures, but were eventually upgraded to a "modified general community quarantine" (MGCQ) after a reportedly "honest mistake" from the national government and requests from respective LGUs. \c\cOnce again, the Philippine government revised its announcements and declared the entire country under GCQ, while Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu City continued to implement an MECQ. This was temporary until guidelines of MGCQ for low-risk areas were finalized. The IATF-EID also reportedly considered the reclassification of provinces and cities in Central Luzon as "high-risk areas" under MECQ. \c\cAfter receiving petitions from LGUs, the IATF-EID revised its quarantine policies yet again. Cebu City and Mandaue were placed under ECQ, while Metro Manila, Laguna, and Central Luzon (except for Aurora and Tarlac) were all under MECQ. The remaining parts of the country were placed under GCQ. \c\cQuarantine measures raised throughout the country started to loosen up on June 1, with areas formerly under ECQ transitioning to a less strict quarantine. This led to a significant rise in the number of confirmed cases, as more areas implemented a GCQ.[citation needed]\c\cThe official start of classes in the elementary and secondary schools which customarily begin on June was postponed. \c\cThe Bayanihan to Heal as One Act expired within this month. According to the national government, the law expired on June 25, due to its sunset provision although there were interpretations that the law expired as early as June 5. Senator Sonny Angara argued that per the Constitution "emergency powers cease upon the next adjournment of Congress" and that he considers the Bayanihan Act as an emergency measure. The national government maintains that the law was to expire on June 25. Upon expiration of the law, the national government is not anymore obliged to hand out cash subsidies to families affected by community quarantine measures. \c\cThe DOH reported an overwhelmingly high number of recoveries on July 30, as the department began its "Oplan Recovery" to clear out its discrepancies with LGU counts. Under the data reconciliation of the DOH, starting from July 15, mild cases and asymptomatic cases will be recorded as recovered after 14 days from swab collection for testing. The first set of "mass recovery" was recorded on July 30 with 37,180 recoveries. From July 30, recovery reconciliations will be reported every 15 days. \c\cOn August 2, the Philippines surpassed the 100,000 cases mark as the country continues to report around 2,000–3,000 cases a day. The country eventually had the most COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia when it finally breached Indonesia's total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. \c\cA modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was placed in Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal from August 4 to 18 as a response to the petition of medical front liners requesting an ECQ in Metro Manila. \c\cIn early August, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) became involved in a corruption scandal, and its executives were alleged to have used the pandemic as a cover-up to steal billions of pesos. \c\cThe Philippine Genome Center (PGC) had detected a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus originating in the Philippines. The new variant is said to be globally dominant variant than other variants of the virus at the time of detection and has been associated with the sudden increase of new cases in July. \c\cBy August 18, the DOH has identified 1,302 COVID-19 clusters throughout the country with the majority being located in Metro Manila. \c\cOn September 11, President Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act into law. President Duterte then extended the period of the state of calamity until September 2021, through his Proclamation No. 1021 filed on September 18. \c\cThe IATF-EID also announced on September 18 that all cemeteries, columbariums, and memorial parks nationwide will be closed from October 29 to November 4 to prevent social gatherings traditionally conducted as part of the All Saints\' Day observance. This is similar to the proposal made by Metro Manila mayors few days prior. \c\cCOVID-19 has spread to all provinces in the Philippines by September 28, when Batanes recorded its first case. \c\cIn mid-December, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 known as Lineage B.1.1.7 was identified in the United Kingdom and is reportedly more contagious than earlier variants of the virus. This has led to several countries to restrict or ban travel from the United Kingdom, including the Philippines. The Philippines also banned travel from 19 other nations which has reported cases of more-infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2. \c\cThe DOH announced in a briefing held in January 2021 that the U.K. variant is already in the Philippines as early as December 2020. One of the samples collected by the health department on December 10 tested positive for the variant on January 21, 2021. \c\cBy January 2021, the DOH is already monitoring at least two other noted mutations aside from the U.K. variant, namely the 501.V2 variant which originated from South Africa and another variant from Malaysia. \c\cOn January 5, 2021, Hong Kong reported that they detected the U.K. variant from a 30-year-old woman who arrived in the city from the Philippines on December 22, 2020, raising concerns that the strain may already be in the Philippines. The following day, a joint DOH–PGC study said that it has not detected the U.K. variant among 305 samples collected from November to December hospital admissions involving inbound travellers who have tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in the country. \c\cEpidemiologist John Wong, who is part of DOH's technical advisory working group, said in a press briefing on January 6 that if Lineage B.1.1.7 establishes itself in the Philippines, the total number of cases could rise about fifteen-fold. Wong provided two scenarios which assumed there are 20,000 cases at the beginning of the month. In the first scenario, COVID-19 has a r rate of 1.1 and the U.K. variant does not reach the Philippines which project an increase of cases to 32,000 by the end of the month. In the second scenario where Lineage B.1.1.7 does indeed establish itself in the country, the projected rise of cases could go as high as 300,000 in the same time period. \c\cOn January 13, the DOH announced that the U.K. variant has been detected in the country when a 29-year-old man from Quezon City, who arrived in the country from the United Arab Emirates on January 7, tested positive for COVID-19. 13 individuals who came in contact with the man also tested positive for COVID-19 days later. On January 22, 16 new cases associated with the U.K. variant has been confirmed in several places in country including Benguet, Laguna, and Mountain Province. A case each in Benguet and Laguna had no known contact with a confirmed case or a travel history outside the country. \c\cThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to the Pfizer–BioNTech and the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines on January 14 and 28, respectively. \c\cOn February 18, the DOH in Central Visayas announced that two mutations of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Cebu. The mutations were classified as "mutations under investigation" and were tagged as E484K and N501Y. \c\cThe DOH announced the detection of the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Pasay on March 2. On March 12, Lineage P.1, commonly known as the Brazilian variant, was detected in the country, along with a "unique" variant originating from the Philippines which was designated as the P.3 variant, which in turn related to the aforementioned variant. Japan also detected the P.3 variant on a man who traveled from the Philippines. \c\cAs a response to the recent spike in cases, the Greater Manila Area, which the government called "NCR Plus", was placed under general community quarantine (GCQ) on March 22 and was originally set to expire on April 4. It was further intensified to the stricter enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) from March 29 to April 11, when the positivity rate of the area remained high. \c\cOn March 17, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that there have been at least 27,967 deaths caused by, or associated with, COVID-19 by the end of 2020. 19,758 of these were tagged "COVID-19 virus not identified", while 8,209 were tagged "COVID-19 virus identified". The discrepancy between the tallies of the DOH and the PSA is due to the inclusion of probable and suspect cases in the PSA's tally. On April 26, the country surpassed 1 million cases. \c\cOn May 11, the country detected its first two cases of Delta variant from India. The variant had been confirmed in two Filipino seafarers who returned in April. While the infections on Metro Manila is slowing down, COVID-19 infections is surging on other regions. Mindanao accounted for a quarter of new cases, higher than Metro Manila, showing that the pandemic has shifted to the regions far outside of the metropolitan areas. A former mayor and his brother from a nearby town were also admitted at a government hospital in the same city, as dozens of people were being treated for coronavirus outside in makeshift tents, or hooked up to oxygen tanks while sitting in their vehicles, due to the lack of hospital beds. \c\cAs COVID-19 surges in Indonesia, the Philippines banned travels from Indonesia amid Delta variant threat. Roque said travelers from Indonesia will be barred from entering the country from July 16 to July 31. \c\cOn July 16, the country detected 16 new cases of the highly-transmissible COVID-19 Delta variant, which has become the dominant variant in several countries. Of these, 11 are local cases. In a press briefing, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that 15 of the new detected cases had recovered while another died. Of these, 10 are females aged 14 to 79. Due to rising cases and local transmission of the Delta variant, Metro Manila, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Davao de Oro, and Davao del Norte were placed under general community quarantine with heightened restrictions starting on July 23. \c\cOn July 29, the Department of Health (DOH) detected 97 new cases of Delta variant bringing the total number of Delta variant cases to 216. Of the newly reported cases, 88 were local cases, six are returning overseas Filipinos, while three other cases are still under verification. \c\cOn July 30, the government placed Metro Manila under Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) starting August 6 until August 20 due to rising cases of Delta variant. \c\cOn August 5, the DOH detected 116 new cases of Delta variant bringing the total number of cases to 331. Of the additional Delta variant cases, 95 were local cases, one is a Returning Overseas Filipino (ROF) while the remaining 20 cases are being verified if they are local or ROF cses. The DOH said that among the 216 Delta variant cases reported last July 29, one case was verified to have been tested in two different laboratories so the DOH amended the previous total Delta variant cases from 216 to 215. \c\cOn the same day, President Rodrigo Duterte approved the recommendation of the IATF to place some provinces under ECQ and MECQ. Laguna, Cagayan de Oro, and Iloilo City will be under ECQ from August 6 to 15, while Lucena and the provinces of Cavite, Rizal, and Iloilo will be placed under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ). Batangas and Quezon, on the other hand, will be under general community quarantine (GCQ) with heightened restrictions from August 6 to 15. \c\cOn August 15, the DOH detected the country's first case of the Lambda variant. The patient is a 35-year-old female and is currently being validated as to whether she is a local or returning overseas Filipino case. The DOH said the patient was asymptomatic and tagged as recovered after undergoing the 10-day isolation period. \c\cMeanwhile, the DOH also detected 182 new cases of the Delta variant, as well as 41 new cases of the Alpha variant, 66 new cases of the Beta variant and 40 new cases of the Theta variant. Of the newly-reported cases of the Delta variant, 112 cases are local, 36 are returning overseas Filipinos, and 34 are still undergoing verification. Among the 41 new Alpha cases, 38 are local, one is an ROF, and two are still being verified. Out of the 66 additional Beta cases, 56 are local and 10 cases are still undergoing verification. Among the 40 new Theta variant cases, 37 are local cases and three cases are still being verified. \c\cOn August 19, the IATF approved to place NCR and the province of Laguna under Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) beginning August 21 to August 31. \c\cMetro Manila, having over 536,771 cases and 8,121 deaths, is considered as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. More than half of the total number of cases in the country was attributed to it during the first months of the pandemic. It is followed by the neighboring regions of Calabarzon and Central Luzon with 253,125 and 133,382 cases, respectively. Bangsamoro, on the other hand, has the least cases. \c\cAs of July 15, 2021, at least 20,996 healthcare workers have tested positive for COVID-19. 20,785 out of these cases have already recovered, while 100 have died. In the early months of the pandemic in the country, the number of healthcare workers infected by the virus was significantly higher compared to the infection rate of other health care workers in the Western Pacific Region. \c\cMore than 9,381 police officers from the Philippine National Police (PNP), 1,137 military personnel from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and 160 members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) have tested positive for COVID-19 during its pandemic in the country. \c\cThe arrival of locally stranded individuals (LSI) on their home provinces has been associated to new clusters of the disease in previously least affected regions. \c\cOf the 1,315,832 returning overseas Filipinos (ROFs) reported on July 15, 2021, 1,304,755 have tested negative for the disease and have been discharged from quarantine facilities, while 19,390 have tested positive. \c\cThe Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) provides information regarding the number of Filipino nationals abroad to have contracted COVID-19. The DFA keeps an official tally of confirmed Filipino COVID-19 cases per region instead of by country. As of July 12, there have been 20,943 overseas Filipinos from 95 countries and territories that tested positive for COVID-19. This count is not included in the national tally of cases by the DOH. \c\cThe DOH previously used the designation "patients under investigation" (PUIs) and "persons under monitoring" (PUMs) to manage suspected and confirmed cases. PUIs involved individuals who had a travel history to Wuhan but by February 3, 2020, the DOH has expanded the scope of PUIs to include individuals who had a travel history to any part of China. "Persons under monitoring" are asymptomatic individuals with known history of exposure to another person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. \c\cOn April 11, 2020, the DOH revised its terminology for PUIs; "suspect" and "probable" cases. Suspect cases involve individuals exhibiting flu-like symptoms and have a history of travel to areas with reported local transmission within 14 days before the manifestation of their symptoms. Someone with fever, cough, or shortness of breath who is above 60 years old, pregnant, with other underlying illness, or a health worker could also be considered as a suspect case. Patients admitted to a hospital due to severe symptoms caused by an undetermined lung disease could also be tagged as a suspect case. Probable cases involve persons who underwent testing with results that need further validation, and those who were tested but whose test was not facilitated in an official laboratory for a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. \c\cThe usage of the PUM designation has since been discontinued. It was reasoned that it is assumed that the general public has been exposed to COVID-19 due to local or community transmission already ongoing in several parts of the Philippines. \c\cBy July 14, 2020, there had been 38,909 suspected cases (958 probable and 37,951 suspect) in the country. \c\cThe DOH has issued a reminder, that Level 2 and 3 hospitals cannot deny admittance of people suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and refusal of admission is a "violation of the signed Performance Commitment and shall be dealt with by the PhilHealth accordingly". The department said that Level 2 and 3 hospitals can accommodate individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms while individuals in a serious or critical condition may be transferred to one of the DOH's three main referral hospitals, which was increased over time to 75 designated hospitals as of April 13 with a combined bed capacity of 3,194. \c\cOn March 16, the DOH announced a revision on their protocol on hospital admission for COVID-19 positive patients. A week prior, the DOH began sending both asymptomatic patients and individuals with mild symptoms back to their homes for quarantine and continued health monitoring until they have been deemed recovered. Priority was given to high-risk patients or those with severe symptoms for hospital admission. \c\cThe Philippines, with at least 45 other countries, has joined the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Solidarity trial to study the effectivity of certain drugs in treating COVID-19 patients. Dr. Marissa Alejandria of the Philippine Society of Microbiology and Infectious Disease is the Philippines\' representative in the study with Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire as the official liaison of the DOH in the multinational study. \c\cThe Department of Science and Technology (DOST) announced that it is seeking bilateral collaboration with other countries such as China, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom on endeavors related to the vaccine development for COVID-19. President Rodrigo Duterte declared a bounty for anyone who could produce a vaccine against COVID-19, an amount later increased to ₱50 million (around $1 million). \c\cThe Philippine Council on Health Research and Development at the DOST plans to distribute an undisclosed "functional food," while Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque also revealed that the DOST, Philippine General Hospital, and the Ateneo de Manila University, are collaborating with the Duke–NUS Medical School in Singapore to evaluate the feasibility of lauric acid from virgin coconut oil, Vitex negundo (known locally as Lagundi), and Euphorbia hirta (known locally as Tawa-tawa) as a "dietary regimen supplement" to help COVID-19 patients combat the disease. A "functional food" or "dietary regimen supplement" is described as similar to how tawa-tawa is also used as a remedy against dengue by incorporating it to the diet of diagnosed patients. \c\cThe Philippine government has been negotiating with various foreign vaccine manufacturers to secure the country's COVID-19 vaccine supply. These manufacturers include Sinovac Biotech (China), Gamaleya Research Institute (Russia), Moderna (United States), and Pfizer (United States). The private sector, with government sanction, has secured at least 2.6 million vaccine doses from British-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca. Negotiations are also ongoing with American firm Novavax which would supply at least 10 million doses from the Serum Institute of India. The country is projected to at least 164 million doses from various manufacturers in 2021. \c\cThe procurement efforts of the national government has been a subject of various controversies. Health Secretary Francisco Duque has been alleged to "dropped the ball" in a deal with Pfizer vaccine deal which could have secured 10 million doses by as early as January 2021. Plans to secure 26 million doses from China's Sinovac has also been put into scrutiny in the Congress due to its reported efficacy rate. Late stage trials of Sinovac's vaccine  in Brazil reported an efficacy rate of only 50 percent. There were concerns within the Senate that the reported 50-percent efficacy rate of Sinovac's vaccine would not garner public trust and would be a waste of government funds. The Department of Health said that Sinovac's vaccine satisfy the World Health Organization standards of at least 50 percent efficacy rate while the FDA pointed out that Sinovac is yet to publish an official and published scientific report on their vaccines efficacy rate and that the clinical trial for the vaccine is conducted in different countries and the efficacy rate per country will vary; as low as 50 percent in Brazil and as high as above 90 percent in Turkey. \c\cOn December 2, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed an executive order allowing the Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency-use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Under certain conditions, vaccines and drugs could be approved within a month instead of undergoing the usual six-month review process. Among the conditions is for a vaccine manufacturer to obtain prior EUA in its country of origin or other countries with a "mature" regulator. The FDA announced that three vaccine manufactures namely Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have inquired on the process of obtaining an EUA in the Philippines. On December 23, Pfizer has applied for an EUA for its vaccine. \c\cDuterte also said in December 2020 that some members of the military already received COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese manufacturer, Sinopharm despite the vaccine not yet officially approved by the country's health authorities. Few days later, it was reported that some members of the Presidential Security Group had also received vaccine from unknown manufacturer. \c\cEarly COVID-19 testing in the Philippines was only limited to persons with travel history to countries with cases of local transmission and those with exposure to the individuals confirmed to have COVID-19. The testing protocols were revised sometime in mid-March 2020 to give priority to the testing of any individual with severe symptoms as well as to the elderly, pregnant and immunocompromised persons with at least mild symptoms. On March 30, symptomatic healthcare workers are also considered priority for testing. \c\cDuring his press briefing on May 19, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said that the people aimed to be tested in the government's "expanded targeted testing" are as follows: "(1) all symptomatic cases, (2) all of those coming from abroad, (3) all close contacts of confirmed cases that were found through contact tracing, and (4) all of those who tested positive on rapid antibody tests." The government is also opting to test through benchmarks, by testing 1–2% of the Philippines\' entire population and 10–12% of the worst affected region in the country, which is Metro Manila. \c\cIn late March 2020, some politicians and their relatives were reportedly tested for the disease despite not showing any symptoms, causing public backlash amidst a shortage of testing kits since it was against DOH guidelines to test asymptomatic individuals. The DOH responded to the public criticism by clarifying that, while there is "no policy for VIP treatment" with regard to testing for COVID-19 and that "all specimens are being processed on a first-in, first-out basis," it "extends courtesy" to front line government officials, specifically those involved in national security and public health. Some senators who were tested claim that they used rapid antibody tests not accredited by the DOH at that time. \c\cOn January 24, 2021, after receiving a go-signal from the national government, the Philippine Red Cross announced that they will start conducting COVID-19 tests using saliva samples on January 25. \c\cIn July 2020, there were currently 85 testing laboratories nationwide with 25,000 tests conducted daily. The country has conducted over 3 million tests as of September 2020. \c\cOn March 9, 2020, a total of 2,000 tests has been conducted at a rate of 200 to 250 people accommodated by tests per day. The testing capacity of the Philippine government has been expanded by late March 2020. As of March 23, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa alone can test 600 people per day, other laboratories except for the facility of San Lazaro Hospital, Manila, can do 100 tests, while the said hospital can do 50 tests per day. By March 27, the release of test results conducted at the RITM takes five to seven days due to backlog, but the institute is committed to reducing the turnaround to two to three days. The DOH announced that the country will conduct targeted mass testing on April 14, which will be administered strictly for susceptible, probable, and high-risk patients, such as health workers, expectant mothers, and patients with other medical conditions. The country's testing continuously increased, except when RITM temporarily scaled down its operations from April 20–24 after 43 of its staffs tested positive for the virus. \c\cThe Philippines has the capability to conduct mass testing, either through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or rapid antibody testing, given the increased number and improving capacity of the country's accredited laboratories and the procurement of more testing kits. The first localized targeted mass testing began in Valenzuela, Metro Manila on April 11. Other local government units followed suit shortly after the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) adopted a resolution that commences \'a national government-enabled, local government unit-led, and people-centered response\' to COVID-19. \c\cThe Food and Drug Administration has approved the usage of 75 PCR test kits (including one locally developed kit), 79 rapid antibody testing kits, 53 immunoassay testing kits, and 7 other testing kits as of July 30. \c\cA locally developed PCR testing kit has been made by the National Institutes of Health at the University of the Philippines Manila. It is reportedly six times cheaper than its foreign counterparts. It was first approved for commercial use in April 2020 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but some kits were recalled in May by its manufacturer, after it was found out that testing using the kits yields indeterminate results 30 percent at the time. A month later, the testing kit were re-approved after its defects were fixed. \c\cBefore January 30, there were no medical facilities in the country that can confirm cases of the virus. Before that date, the RITM conducted preliminary tests on suspected cases to determine if they are infected with a coronavirus but could not detect the new strain on patients. Samples from suspected cases with confirmed coronavirus infection had to be sent abroad to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, for confirmatory testing specifically for SARS-CoV-2. \c\cThe National Task Force for COVID-19 created the Task Force T3 (Test, Trace, and Treat) to establish public-private partnerships that would conduct mass testings. The task force cited the San Miguel Corporation as a pioneer in the move to open its COVID-19 testing laboratory to initially test all of its 70,000 employees. As of August 24, the country has 110 subnational laboratories capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2. \c\cFrom May 29 to June 17, 2020, the DOH had included testing backlogs on their daily case bulletin. These backlogs were referred to as "late cases" and were validated by the DOH's Epidemiology Bureau after more than four days of the release of test results. Late cases were reported alongside new cases or "fresh cases", which corresponded to the cases that were validated three days within the release of test results. This change was implemented by the health department to clarify the sudden increase of cases in the country. The then-largest single-day increase on the number of confirmed cases in the country has been accounted to the backlog in late June 2020, when 2,434 new cases were announced. 1,147 out of these cases were fresh cases and the remaining 1,287 were late cases. It surpassed the backlog in late May 2020, where 1,000 out of 1,046 cases were reported to be late cases. \c\cThe national government declared a state of calamity over all of the Philippines on March 16, 2020, by virtue of Proclamation No. 929 signed by President Rodrigo Duterte. The declaration brings into effect for six months the following:\c\cprice control of basic needs and commodities,\c\cgranting interest-free loans,\c\cdistribution of calamity funds,\c\cauthorization of importation and receipt of donations, and\c\chazard allowance for public health workers and government personnel in the fields of science and technology. \c\cFollowing the sharp increase of confirmed cases, President Duterte called on Congress to hold special sessions on March 23 to enact the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act upon his request, which would authorize Duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a budget of almost ₱275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the estimated ₱438 billion ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic. \c\cIn the House of Representatives, the bill was introduced as House Bill No. 6616 with House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of Pateros–Taguig as its principal sponsor and was defended on the floor by Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte of Camarines Sur's 2nd district. In the Senate of the Philippines, the bill was introduced as Senate Bill No. 1418 with Senate President Tito Sotto and Senator Pia Cayetano as its principal sponsors. \c\cThe House version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in a 284–9 vote without abstentions, while its Senate version unanimously passed the Senate. President Duterte signed the bill into law on March 25. The law was effective for three months until June 25, owing to its sunset provision. \c\cA legislation was proposed to replace the Bayanihan Act, dubbed as the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act or Bayanihan 2. On August 20, the bicameral committee approved a reconciled version of the bill. It was signed into law by President Duterte on September 11. \c\cThe government has varying levels of lockdown and/or stay-at-home orders across all the country's local government units characterized as "community quarantines". The strictest of these measures is designated as enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). Restrictions were imposed on various aspects of society such as mass public transportation, mass gathering, and operation of businesses.[citation needed]\c\cIn April 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte warned anyone who violates the country's lockdown measures could be shot for causing trouble. \c\cTravel of foreign nationals to the Philippines is banned with few exceptions since March 2020. The issuance of visas to all foreign national on March 19 was stopped and all visas already issued are voided except to those issued to families of Filipino nationals would remain valid. Three days later a travel ban was imposed on all foreign nationals, except spouses of Filipino citizens (and their children), and workers for international organizations and non-governmental organizations accredited in the country. \c\cThe government of China and the United States has pledged support to the Philippine government response against COVID-19. China announced that it would be donating medical supplies including 100,000 testing kits, 100,000 surgical masks, 10,000 N95 masks, and 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment. The United States Agency for International Development also pledged $2.7 million worth of aid to help the Philippines develop adequate testing capabilities, and ensure the availability of medical supplies through the agency's "on-the-ground partners". China's aid was received on March 21, 2020. \c\cOn March 22, 2020, the DFA said that the Philippines would be receiving a donation from Singapore consisting of 3,000 testing kits and a polymerase chain reaction machine. In early April 2020, the DFA announced it received 20 units of testing kits, capable of 1,000 tests, from Brunei. The United Arab Emirates also donated medical supplies in May 2020. \c\cOn March 28, 2020, it was disclosed that some of the test kits made in China were only 40% accurate in testing for signs of the COVID-19 on an individual suspected to be infected with the disease. The test kits were donated by a private foundation. \c\cOn July 20, 2021, it was reported that the United States delivered a total of 3,240,850 one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccines to the Philippines as part of its worldwide effort to help end COVID-19. This is the first time the Philippines has received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine – a safe, trusted and easy-to-store shot widely used in the US. Prior to the US delivery of the Johnson & Johnson vaccines, the Philippines has received more than seven million vaccine doses through the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, a global initiative run by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to support equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. To date, total US government COVID-19 assistance to the Philippines amounts to over P1.38 billion ($27.5 million). \c\cThe National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) revised its economic growth outlook for the Philippines in 2020 from a 6.5% to 7.5% gross domestic product (GDP) growth registered in late 2019 to a 5.5% to 6.5% GDP growth, following the pandemic. The NEDA cited the decline in service exports, especially tourism. Moody's Analytics also reduced their GDP growth outlook for the country, from 5.9% in 2019 to 4.9% following the pandemic. Meanwhile, Nomura gave a bitter prediction of 1.6%, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave an almost flat growth of 0.6% for this year before rebounding to 7.6% in 2021. \c\cBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno and then-NEDA Director-General Ernesto Pernia forecast that the Philippine economy would likely enter a recession in 2020 due to the effect of the pandemic. Diokno stated that, although the first quarter is likely to grow by 3% since the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine only took effect near the end of the quarter, the second and third quarters would likely experience contractions in economic growth. \c\cThe Philippines\' real GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020, the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 1998, a year after the Asian financial crisis. The Philippines entered a technical recession, after the country's GDP contracted in by 16.5 percent in the second quarter. The country's GDP continued to contract in the following quarter periods. \c\cThe Philippines\' GDP saw its worst contraction since World War II posting a growth of −9.5% for 2020 according to the Philippine Statistics Authority records from 1947. The last full-year contraction was in 1998 amidst the Asian financial crisis where the GDP grew by −0.5%. The 2020 contraction was also worse than the – 7% contraction in 1984. \c\cThe Philippine economy exited recesssion in the second quarter of 2021, posting a GDP growth of 11.8%. \c\cIn terms of the amount of economic loss that the Philippines is projected to suffer, NEDA gave a value of up to ₱2.0 trillion, or equivalent to about 9.4% of 2020 nominal GDP, while the Philippine Institute for Development Studies estimates at a maximum of ₱2.5 trillion. International organizations also gave their predictions, with the Friedrich Naumann Foundation envisioning a ₱273-billion loss and the Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières envisioning a combined loss of more than ₱1 trillion just in the month of April. \c\cThe pandemic also affected the goal of the Philippines to be among the countries with upper-middle-income country status by nominal GNI per capita. Before his resignation, Pernia said that the country will still achieve this goal by 2020, while his replacement, acting NEDA Director-General Karl Kendrick Chua, said last May that this goal will be achieved in 2022. Daniel Ross of Bloomberg also stated that the Philippines, which is "an economic star poised to outpace long-time regional winners such as China, Indonesia and India," will face hindrances amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cOn the other hand, the BSP records an inflation rate of 2.2% in April and 2.5% in March compared from 2.6% in February and 2.9% in January. The average rate of 2.6% for the period of January to April 2020 is also 1% lower compared to the inflation rate from the same period in the previous year. The event was primarily and hugely caused by lower oil prices and transportation costs, even if the prices of food supplies and alcoholic beverages and tobacco slightly rose. \c\cOn March 9, 2020, the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) index lost 457.77 points or 6.76%, its steepest decline since the financial crisis of 2007–08. The following day, shares plunged by 6.23% to ₱5,957.35 (US$117.54), settling below the 6,000 level benchmark and entering the bear market territory. The mining and oil industries were the most affected with a 9.05% drop, followed by holding companies with a 6.93% drop. The PSE's circuit breaker mechanism was invoked for the second time since the measure's introduction in 2008 halting trade for 15 minutes. \c\cEconomist Bernardo Villegas has noted that pandemic has created a situation where the Philippine government "is getting overborrowed," and that the Philippines needs more Foreign Direct Investments in order to fund capital-intensive industries, including telecommunications and media. \c\cIn terms of unemployment rate, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) records an estimated unemployment rate of 5.3% in January 2020, which is the same with January 2019. Moody's Analytics puts its estimate at 5.3% for the first quarter of 2020, while Nomura expects 7.5% for Q1 and a 13-year high of 8% in Q2 of this year. Meanwhile, the IMF stated that the unemployment rate in the country would be 6.2% for this year compared to 5.1% in 2019. A higher rate of 6.8% for this year was also predicted by S&P Global Ratings. \c\cThe Trade Union Congress of the Philippines estimates that around 7,000 people may lose jobs within the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic. Economists from the Ateneo de Manila University estimate that 57% of the country's workforce may be displaced within the end of the first quarter of 2020. It comprises around 15 million workers in Luzon that were laid off due to the enhanced community quarantine, around four million of whom are based in Metro Manila, as well as an estimated 4.3 million workers in Visayas and another 4.3 million in Mindanao that were laid off due to quarantine restrictions. \c\cIn March, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) stated that 1.05 million workers were displaced due to the pandemic, even after they released guidelines for employers in handling the impact of COVID-19. \c\cPhilippine aviation services were heavily affected after travel, both locally and internationally, was restricted to contain the spread of the virus. \c\cSome German businesses that are based in the country also reported to reduce investments in the country, but will continue to maintain their employees. \c\cIn early 2021, there were reports that some employers are requiring its workers to get vaccinated before allowing them to physically report for work, with some workers threatened to be placed on floating status if they are not able to comply. DOLE released a statement that such practice is illegal and workers should be only vaccinated on a voluntary basis. \c\cFollowing directives from the Philippine government, several fast food and restaurant chains suspended dine-in services and restricted operations to take-out and delivery. Online food ordering services such as GrabFood and Foodpanda temporarily halted during the enhanced community quarantine but eventually resumed operations in Luzon during the quarantine period. \c\cSeveral restaurants and coffee shops across the country offered free food and beverages to front line professionals involved in the pandemic, especially health care workers. \c\cFood production and distribution slowed down during the pandemic, especially in Luzon, primarily due to the lack of financial assistance and inaccessibility of transportation resulting from community quarantine measures being implemented across numerous local governments. The delivery of fresh vegetables from the province of Benguet, which supplies the country with over 80 percent of the country's highland vegetable requirements, was halted due to the implementation of an "extreme enhanced" community quarantine in La Trinidad. Local government officials advised local rice farmers to sell their harvests to them, assuring them that they would help distribute it to their respective communities amid the border restrictions. \c\cOn March 27, Vietnam announced that it would reduce its production and exportation of rice due to food security amid the pandemic. The Philippines, the largest importer of rice in the world, imports 25% of its rice from Vietnam. Agriculture Secretary William Dar assured that there would be "no shortage of the staple during the duration of the enhanced community quarantine and beyond" as "harvest [is] already coming in." Dar also stated the Department of Agriculture's plans to initiate early planting in the Cagayan Valley and Central Luzon, two of the largest rice producers in the country, ahead of the third quarter of 2020. \c\cProduction of canned fish in the country was adversely affected with Zamboanga City, which accounts for 85% of the country's canned fish industry, announcing it would reduce the production of canned fish in the Philippines by 50–60% due to difficulties encountered following the implementation of a city-wide lockdown. \c\cThe Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) ordered the suspension of all gaming operations in the country, including the land-based casinos in Entertainment City and Newport City, on March 15. The gaming regulator also announced that they were limiting the operations of Philippine offshore gaming operations in the region. \c\cIllegal gambling activities conducted online, including online cockfighting or e-sabong, through social media has proliferated amidst the pandemic. PAGCOR has aimed to regulate online cockfighting, as part of efforts to expand the source of funds for the government. \c\cA shortage of medical masks was reported in various parts of the country due to concerns over the pandemic. RITM director Celia Carlos urged the public against hoarding masks to ensure ample supply for medical workers directly dealing with patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), in cooperation with the Philippine National Police, are acting against reports of traders hoarding face masks and selling said item at an overpriced rate. The DTI has also directed its Philippine International Trading Corp. to import 5 million masks from overseas. Medtecs International Corp. Ltd., the sole manufacturer of medical mask in the country, has committed to supply the government through the DTI. However, due of the Philippine procurement law, local manufacturers are having difficulty competing with foreign suppliers that have a lower cost but may have substandard quality. \c\cDoctors in the Philippines have deplored the shortages in personal protective equipment amid the pandemic, and was even cited as the cause of high infection rate and death rate of healthcare workers in the country. To address this issue, the Philippine government continues to procure and stockpile such equipment, as the pandemic is expected to last until 2021. \c\cAccording to Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire, the country also issued requests for ventilators and respirators that will be used for severe or critical COVID-19 patients, as there are reported shortages of these equipment. \c\cAccording to the Philippine Retailers Association, the "total retail environment" saw a decline of 30–50%. SM Investments, the country's largest retailer, saw a decline of 10–20% in domestic sales. Despite the decline, most retail stores that provide essential services, including supermarkets, convenience stores, hardware stores, and pharmacies, remained open across the country to sustain consumers while other establishments at malls closed down. Such retail stores, however, imposed strict social distancing measures with some supermarkets only allowing 50 customers inside at a time and placing stickers on the floor to indicate that customers must stand one meter apart from each other. Stores were also regularly disinfected and customers were required to undergo a temperature check before entering. In the Greater Manila Area, several online grocers continued to operate, but with limited delivery slots. After most industries in the country being closed for two months, many stores in the retail sector are already allowed to open under revised guidelines of eased community quarantines. \c\cPanic buying and hoarding became rampant across the country, especially with essential goods such as food and sanitation products. The Philippine Amalgamated Supermarkets Association reported that the purchases of masks, alcohol, and other personal hygiene products in supermarkets across the country had already surged, urging the public against panic buying. \c\cEconomic think-tank Fitch Solutions forecasts that the consumer and retail sector, especially non-essential businesses, would be one of the hardest-hit sectors in the Philippines as it loses sales revenue for an entire month due to the Luzon enhanced community quarantine (Luzon accounts for 73% of the country's GDP). Fitch Solutions forecasts the household final consumption expenditure for the country in 2020 to expand by 6.7% year-over-year, which was adjusted from a "pre-coronavirus projection" for 2020 of 7% growth year-over-year. \c\cMall operators across the country, such as Ayala, Megaworld, SM, Robinsons, and Vista, initially shortened the operating hours of its malls to comply with government quarantine measures. While doing so, malls were asked to implement social distancing measures; for example, several malls implemented a "single-seat gap" policy in cinemas, in which moviegoers were required to sit one seat apart from each other. However, most malls in the country have since limited its operations to establishments providing essential services, particularly groceries, banks, and hardware stores. \c\cLocal airlines AirAsia, Philippine Airlines, and Cebu Pacific suspended flights in response to the imposition of travel bans by the Philippine government and some foreign governments. The airlines have suspended flights as early as February 2, 2020, covering routes involving destinations in China, Hong Kong and Macau. At least Philippine Airlines has suspended all of its flights by March 2020, although the airline has announced plans to resume selected flights by June 1, 2020. \c\cThe 2020 census of population and housing in the Philippines was originally scheduled in May but was postponed indefinitely due to the increasing number of cases in the country. As the quarantine measures began to ease, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) started to conduct the census in September, despite the risk of spreading the virus. \c\cSuspension of classes began as early as March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 16, the Department of Education (DepEd) issued guidelines prohibiting public schools in areas with suspended classes from administering the final examinations of students and instead compute the students\' final grades for the 2019–20 academic year based on "their current academic standing." and directed schools in other areas to administer final examinations within that week on a "staggered basis" and for teachers and students to observe social distancing measures. \c\cSome universities resorted to implementing online learning alternatives. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) also advised institutions of higher education to implement distance education methods of learning for its classes, such as the use of educational technology, to maximize the academic term despite the suspensions; However, following the announcement of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and other areas, colleges and universities suspended mandatory online classes in consideration of the welfare of its students, faculty, and staff. Academic administration offices continued to operate with a skeleton crew, while other offices in colleges and universities operated through telecommuting arrangements. Some schools, however, continued to hold online classes, and in response, several student groups appealed to CHED to suspend mandatory online classes in consideration of the logistical limitations and well-being of a majority of students. \c\cLive classes in all levels across the country were eventually suspended due to the pandemic. Graduation rites in Philippine schools were also either canceled, postponed, or held virtually. \c\cThe official start of classes for the 2020–21 school year could only be legally set as late as the last day of August. However, Republic Act No. 11480 was signed into law to allow the start of classes to be set beyond August. The Department of Education has moved the opening of classes to October 5, 2020. Earlier in June, officials reported that schools will not open until a vaccine is available, though remote learning should resume at the end of August. \c\cA group of UP experts has proposed the start of classes to be pushed back to December in order to limit the spread of the disease. \c\cCHED left the decision of starting semesters to college administrators, although urged them to shift into the new semestral calendar and start \'flexible classes\' in August and face-to-face classes in September as well. Certain measures have been proposed to be implemented during the opening of classes, such as the airing of lectures on television and radio, a "mandatory face mask policy," maintaining physical distancing, and limiting class sizes. \c\cThe NEDA reported that the coronavirus pandemic would incur a ₱22.7 billion ($448 million) monthly loss of tourism revenue for the Philippines and the impact of the pandemic could last around five to six months based from past experiences from the SARS, H1N1, and the MERS outbreaks. Over 5,200 flights covering two months, which was to be serviced by member airlines of the Air-Carriers Association of the Philippines, were canceled. Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank predicts a ₱111 billion ($2.2 billion) loss in the tourism sector, while the Tourism Congress of the Philippines estimates the figures at around ₱20 billion ($395 million), considering that 12.7% of the Philippines\' GDP is generated through tourism. Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières also reported potential damage in Philippine tourism. \c\cThe National Museum of the Philippines temporarily closed its complex in Manila and all branch museums throughout the country. \c\cThe Philippine Shopping Festival, a nationwide mall sale event backed by the Department of Tourism originally scheduled on March 1–31, 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several local festivals across the country were also either canceled or postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cThe impact of COVID-19 in prisons in the Philippines is projected to be "dangerous," since its jails have the highest occupancy rate in the world that stands at 534%. The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology has temporarily suspended the acceptance of visitors in prisons it manages as early as March 2020, encouraging would-be visitors to avail the e-dalaw service which would allow inmates to communicate with relatives online. \c\cCertain human rights groups raised their concerns on the issue. Human Rights Watch flagged the cases of dying inmates in prison cells and called for the freedom of minor offenders, the elderly, and the ill. Karapatan and KAPATID both called for the release of political prisoners that belongs to vulnerable sector as a way to decongest Philippine jails amidst COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cA group of 22 high-risk prisoners (either of old age, immunocompromised, or pregnant) also asked for temporary liberty due to \'humanitarian grounds\' since "hellish prison conditions in the Philippines make the detainees vulnerable to COVID-19." All of the 22 prisoners, five of which are consultants of New Peoples\' Army (NPA), are asking to be allowed to post bail or to be released under personal recognizance. They are represented by Public Interest Law Center (PILC) and the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL). Similarly, one of the suspects in the death of Horacio "Atio" Castillo III pleaded for freedom under the guise of the COVID-19's threat. \c\cIn mid-April, the Supreme Court (SC) reiterated its 2014 circular, which allows the temporary freedom of "persons deprived of liberty" who were able to serve their minimum penalty during an ongoing trial or those whose trial are paused due to lack of witnesses. Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta and Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra also signed resolutions that relaxes bail prices for indigent inmates and requirements to avail parole and executive clemency. On May 2, Associate Justice Mario Victor Leonen announced that there were 9,731 detainees released temporarily by the SC from March 17 to April 29 as a way to alleviate the country's overcrowding prisons. \c\cThe DOH issued an advisory for the cancellation of large public events and mass gatherings, such as concerts, until further notice to minimize the risk of spreading the disease. This prompted several local and international artists to either cancel or postpone their scheduled concerts and fan meets. \c\cLocal television networks temporarily stopped admitting live audiences for their television shows, including variety shows Eat Bulaga! on GMA Network as well as It's Showtime and ASAP on ABS-CBN. On March 13, both ABS-CBN and GMA announced that they would suspend productions on their drama shows as well as other entertainment programs by March 15, replacing affected programs with reruns of previous series or extended newscast runs. \c\cBroadcast radio companies are also curtailing their operations during the quarantine period, either by shortening their broadcast hours and/or suspending regular programming in favor of "special broadcasts". \c\cThe Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines has issued preventive guidelines against the pandemic through the Catholic Bishops\' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). In January 2020, the CBCP issued a liturgical guideline which urges Mass attendees to "practice ordinarily" the receiving of communion by hand, and avoid holding hands while praying the Lord's Prayer during Mass. As a spiritual measure against the spread of the disease, the CBCP also composed an oratio imperata (obligatory prayer) which is to be recited during Mass. In February 2020, the CBCP issued a second liturgical guideline in anticipation of the Lenten season. The bishops suggested that during Ash Wednesday, ashes would be sprinkled on the faithfuls\' head instead of the customary marking of the forehead with a cross to minimize body contact. The CBCP also urged people to refrain from kissing or touching the cross for veneration during Good Friday, particularly the celebration of the Passion of Jesus. They suggested genuflection or bowing as an alternative to the practice. Dioceses across the country have suspended the public celebration of Masses. On April 8, Holy Wednesday, the CBCP organized an interfaith prayer service against the spread of the coronavirus, which was televised nationwide. \c\cOther Christian denominations and organizations, such as the Iglesia ni Cristo and the Jehovah's Witnesses, have suspended live worship services and resorted to organizing worship services through online platforms. The Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches, an organization composed of Evangelical and Protestant church member organizations in the country, also adopted similar measures. \c\cThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints directed missionaries assigned in the Philippines who are not native to the country to move out for temporary reassignment to another country. They were ordered to self-quarantine in their new homes for 14 days. \c\cThe Islamic community in the Philippines has also adopted measures against COVID-19. The Regional Darul Ifta\' of Bangsamoro suspended all congregational prayers in the Bangsamoro region from March 19 to April 10. \c\cSeveral ongoing or scheduled seasons of sports leagues in the Philippines, such as the ASEAN Basketball League, Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League, Philippine Basketball Association, National Basketball League, Philippines Football League, and Philippine Super Liga, were suspended. Upcoming sporting competitions hosted by the country, specifically the Badminton Asia Championships (initially scheduled to be hosted in Wuhan but was moved to Manila) and the AFF Women's Championship, were postponed. Regional qualification games involving Philippine national teams were likewise postponed. \c\cOn April 29, 2020, the Philippine Sports Commission have announced that they will cancel all of their sporting events until December 2020 to comply with government directives that prohibit mass gathering events. This meant that the Palarong Pambansa in Marikina, the Philippine National Games, and the ASEAN Para Games were all cancelled. \c\cThe Commission on Elections has suspended the nationwide voter registration on March 10 until the end of the month due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The registration period began on January 20, 2020, and is scheduled to run until September 30, 2021. The suspension was later extended to last until the end of April. The issuance of voter's certification is also suspended until further notice. The next national elections scheduled in the Philippines are in May 2022. The plebiscite to ratify legislation that proposes the partition of Palawan into three smaller provinces scheduled for May 2020 was also delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cAfter the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged online regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and various other aspects of the disease. \c\cThe DOH has advised against spreading misinformation and unverified claims concerning the pandemic. The Philippine National Police on their part has taken action against the spread of misinformation related to the pandemic and has warned the public that misinformation purveyors could be charged for violating Presidential Decree no. 90 for "declaring local rumor, mongering and spreading false information". In the case of misinformation circulated online, violators could be charged for violating the Cybercrime Prevention Act which has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act also punishes fake news peddlers of two months jail time or fine of up to ₱1 million. \c\cThe DOH publishes official numbers through its daily case bulletins at 4 pm (PhST). \c\cIn the table below, the general lethality of COVID-19 in the Philippines is presently given around 1.7%, implying around 2 deaths and 98 potential survivors per 100 cases. To compare the three well-known coronavirus diseases, the case fatality rate of the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak was higher at 11%, while that of the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak was much higher at 36%.
After the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan and proclaimed intentions to re-establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan after the August 2021 fall of Kabul, there have been two known drone strikes against the country. As a result of the airstrikes, there has been at least 12 fatalities and one injury in the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. \c\c27 August 2021: The United States launched an airstrike targeting an IS-K member in Nangarhar Province. The target was riding in a vehicle. He was killed alongside another high-profiled member, while a third militant was injured. The two killed were described as a planner and a facilitator. The airstrike was carried out a day after the 2021 Kabul airport attack, which resulted in the death of more than 180 people. \c\c29 August 2021: A U.S. airstrike targeted a vehicle carrying a suspected ISIS-K suicide bomber. At least 10 people were killed during the strike, including six children. Some of those killed had previously worked for international organisations and held visas allowing them entry to the United States. There are reports of other civilians being killed too. The majority of the casualties were residents of the area.
The Houthi–Saudi Arabian conflict is an ongoing armed conflict between the Royal Saudi Armed Forces and Yemeni Houthi forces that has been taking place in the Arabian Peninsula, including the southern Saudi regions of Asir, Jizan, and Najran, and northern Yemeni governorates of Saada, Al Jawf, and Hajjah, since the onset of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in 2015. \c\cOver the course of the conflict the Houthis have carried out attacks on military bases and outposts in Saudi Arabia. \c\cIn their 2004 conflict against the government of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Houthis accused Saudi Arabia of pressuring Saleh to crack down on their community, and of funding him with US$25 billion. This accusation was denied by Saleh, and was not acknowledged by Saudi Arabia. The Houthis and pro-Houthi Yemen army units were deploying effective tactics. Usually, they would first deploy teams equipped with anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs)—like Russian made 9M113 Konkurs, 9M113 Kornet-Es and a few BGM-71 TOWs—to take out specific vehicles or bunkers. BM-21s and BM-27s would then target nearest military bases and lay landmines along routes connecting with the Saudi Arabia–Yemen border. Meanwhile, pro-Houthi special forces would start assaulting the border outposts, while motorcycle mounted teams armed with RPG-7s and US-made M47 Dragons would infiltrate into the Saudi rear. Columns of Saudi Arabian Army (RSLF) forces would thus drive into unknown minefields, or rush into ambushes at places not directly hit by the fighting. Some raiding parties deployed into Saudi Arabia were armed with man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS), as well as M167 Vulcan towed anti-aircraft cannons. Although exact details of the effectiveness of either remain evasive, during the first year of the war they damaged numerous attack helicopters of the RSLF and the Royal Saudi Navy Forces (RSNF), thus forcing their crews to keep their distance. \c\cAs a result of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, the city of Najran was shelled by the Houthis on 5 May. The Saudi authorities temporarily closed local educational institutions and the Najran Domestic Airport. \c\cAhrar al-Najran troops attacked a military base in Najran on 9 July, seizing a number of weapons and electronic equipment belonging to Saudi Arabia's security services, and destroying an armored vehicle and a mortar-launching vehicle, both belonging to the Saudi Army. Two Ahrar al-Najran fighters and 15 Saudi soldiers were killed in the clashes. \c\cOn 31 January 2016, according to Iran's Fars News Agency, Yemeni forces allied with the Houthis fired 70 missiles and mortar shells at the Al-Qawiya and Jbal al-Dokhan military bases in Jizan province, killing at least 10 Saudi troops. \c\c* On 20 June 2016, Ahrar al-Najran reportedly seized a lookout outpost near the border. Saudi interior sources later announced on 25 July 2016 that the clashes resulted in the deaths of 5 Saudi border guards. \c\cOn 11 August 2016, after a one-year border ceasefire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia expired, clashes resumed and the Houthis gained entrance into the west side of the city of Najran. \c\cOn 16 August 2016, Houthi shelling killed 7 civilians, including 4 Saudis and 3 foreigners, in an industrial zone in Najran. \c\cOn 18 August 2016, Houthi fighters advanced 15 km into Najran, according to a pro-Houthi source. \c\cOn 21 August 2016, a Saudi encampment in Najran was hit by a Houthi-fired Tochka ballistic missile, resulting in the deaths of at least 50 Saudi soldiers. \c\cOn 26 August 2016, a power station near the border was hit by a Houthi-fired rocket.

This was the fourth time in 2 months that the Houthis had shot down a Saudi aircraft. \c\cOn 8 November 2016, 5 Saudis were injured and 3 vehicles were damaged by a projectile fired from Yemen into the southwestern city of Jizan, according to the Saudi Civil Defense. \c\cOn 10 November 2016, Houthis claimed to have taken control of the villages of Al-Kars and Al-Dafiniya, along with other villages in east of Al-Bahtit and south of Al-Qarn. Sources also said that Houthi militiamen had captured a bridge linking Jizan's Qaem Zubaid and Al-Ibadiya areas and the road to the nearby Al-Khubah area. The sources also said that scores of Saudi soldiers were killed and injured and six Saudi armored vehicles and 2 combat tanks destroyed. Saudi army helicopters had bombarded the Al-Khubah area in response. However, the claim cannot be independently verified by Saudi authorities. Also earlier on that day, Saudi authorities said at least 14 people had been injured in Dharan al-Janoub governorate, in the southwest near the Yemeni border, by projectiles fired from Yemen. \c\cOn 15 November 2016, the Royal Saudi Air Defense Forces intercepted and destroyed the missile targeting Najran "without any damage", Saudi Press Agency reported. \c\cOn 19 November 2016, a Saudi soldier was killed by a missile fired by the Houthis across the border into Asir province, the Saudi interior ministry said.

Houthis said the missile fire came in retaliatory response to the Saudi-led continuing airstrikes on Yemeni cities. However, the Saudi-owned Alarabiya satellite TV reported that the Saudi defense forces intercepted and destroyed the missile in the air before it reached the city. \c\cOn 1 December 2016, 3 Saudi soldiers were shot dead by the Yemeni Army and Houthis at the al-Dhabra military base in Jizan, while another was killed in attack on a base in the al-Rabu\'ah town of Asir. \c\cOn 8 December 2016, The Rocket Battalion of Yemeni Army shelled Al-Hajir military Base in Asir, causing damage to the military installation.

The Panjshir conflict is a conflict between the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (controlled by the Taliban). It began on 17 August 2021 following the Fall of Kabul and Amrullah Saleh assuming the Afghan presidency and declaring the resistance. Ten days later, both sides declared a ceasefire and agreed to solve all problems through dialogue. \c\cThe former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". \c\cThe population of the Panjshir valley consists of a majority of ethnic Tajik people, while the majority of the Taliban are Pashtuns. \c\cThe valley is well known for its natural defences. Surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, Panjshir never fell to the Soviets during the invasion of the 1980s nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990s. \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Saleh—citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan—declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi along with the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Dushanbe. On 23 August 2021, Massoud made contact with unnamed American lawmakers. \c\cPrior to the fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, including commandos, ex-Mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and other anti-Taliban activists. Most of them regrouped at Baghlan Province's Andarab District before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from  Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan. According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid August 2021. Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms. By 22 August 2021, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a "handful of armoured humvees" in the valley. \c\cThere are difference between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan which was supportive of the Taliban. As a result, Massoud was more willing to negiotiate with the Taliban. By 22 August 2021, the resistance also confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban on their own, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. According to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to five helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. \c\cOn 23 August 2021, it was reported that BM-21 Grads were acquired as a part of its arsenal. \c\cAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the US Military Academy made prior to the Fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars. Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial materiel of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. \c\cAround 17 August 2021, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud, along with local civilians who had responded to his mobilization calls. At the time, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—"under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. On 18 August 2021, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anabah in Panjshir. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training. \c\cOn 18 August 2021, local reports from Parwan Province reported that Saleh's forces had taken Charikar from Taliban fighters stationed in the area. In addition, there are reports of gunfights taking place near Salang Pass. On the following day, videos were released which showcased local fighters with flags of the old, anti-Taliban Northern Alliance parading through the streets of Charikar. \c\cOn 20 August 2021, anti-Taliban fighters reportedly recaptured Andarab, Puli Hisar and Dih Salah districts in Baghlan Province with the Taliban claiming 15 of its soldiers had been killed, while other sources reported that up to 60 Taliban fighters were killed or injured, and two dozen captured. The three districts had reportedly experienced a revolt, led by a local police chief, after Taliban had conducted unpopular house-to-house searches. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi announced the operational success of the districts being recaptured via Twitter. \c\cAudiovisual reports of the events circulated on social media and were reported by Pajhwok Afghan News. Later on the 20th, it was reported that the forces, led by Abdul Hamid Dadgar, had recaptured Andarab, though the Taliban had not yet commented. \c\cA source within the Panjshir resistance consequently confirmed their involvement in the operations in Baghlan Province, and stated that they planned on seizing a northern highway which could allow them to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Taliban social media accounts called the counteroffensive a "betrayal" of the amnesty the Taliban had offered. It was reported on 22 August 2021 that Taliban fighters had been sent to the Keshnabad area of Andarab in order to kidnap the children of anti-Taliban forces. \c\cAlso, the Islamic Emirate gave the opposition forces a four hour ultimatum to surrender. In a statement to Al Arabiya, Massoud rejected the ultimatum. In response, the IEA announced "hundreds" of its forces had been dispatched to the Panjshir Valley. It was reported on 23 August 2021 that talks between Taliban representatives and Panjshir leaders did not work. Ali Maisam Nazary, spokesman for the resistance, said that the Taliban made demands for Massoud to accept no elections with a centralized government, which Massoud rejected as he wanted a future government to be decentralized, which respect civil and semi-autonomy rights. \c\cAn unidentified Taliban spokesperson proclaimed in a statement that "hundreds of Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate are heading towards the state of Panjshir to control it, after local state officials refused to hand it over peacefully".  It was reported that on 23 August 2021, Taliban commmander Qari Fashihuddin was tasked to lead offensive operations in Panjshir. The Taliban reported that several of their fighters were shot and killed in ambushes in Jabal Siraj with several of them killed and others wounded. \c\cOn 23 August 2021, the Taliban claimed to have recaptured all 3 districts in Baghlan that fell to the resistance forces a week ago: Dih Salah District, Pul-e-Hisar and Andarab. A Taliban district chief stationed in Andarab was reported to be killed in the fighting. On 24 August 2021, according to Deccan Herald, Panjshir resistance fighters retook control of Banu and Dih Salah districts, while Puli Hisar remained under Taliban control. Saleh publicly warned via Twitter that Taliban fighters in Andarab were blocking humanitarian assistance for civilians trying to escape from the fighting and called it a "humanitarian disaster". On the following day, Massoud's forces claimed to have ambushed a Taliban convoy in Andarab, destroying a critical bridge and inflicting heavy losses on the Islamists. \c\cOn 24 August 2021, Major Wazir Akbar, an ex-Afghan commando who has joined the Panjshir-based resistance fighters, reported an attempted Taliban incursion at Anjuman Pass through Badakhshan province, which was repelled with heavy Taliban casualties. \c\cOn 26 August, 2021, a ceasefire was declared with the Taliban and the resistance entering into talks. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that he was "80 percent confident of a solution without war in the Panjshir Valley". On 29 August 2021, Panjshir representatives stated that there were no Taliban fighters trying to enter Panjshir, refuting information from Anaamullah Samangani, who is a member of the Taliban's Cultural Commission. \c\cOn 26 August, 2021, according to a video published by Global Defense Corp, heavy fighting broke out between anti-Taliban resistance group in Panjshir Valley and Taliban. More than 200 Taliban fighters were driven out the Panjshir Valley and some were captured by anti-Taliban resistance group. The National Resistance Front (NRF) has also captured Pol-e-Hesar, Deh Salah and Banu districts. \c\cOn 28 August 2021, Panjshir fighters have engaged Taliban fighters in Sanjan, Kapisa and in Khost Wa Fereng, Baghlan in response to allegations of ceasefire violations conducted by Taliban fighters in the area. \c\cOn 29 August 2021, internet and telecommunication services throughout Panjshir province were shut down on orders from the Taliban. \c\cOn 30 August 2021, Panjshir fighters ambushed Taliban fighters attempting to break into Panjshir from Andarab. On 31 August 2021, eight Taliban fighters were killed while trying to infiltrate the western part of Pansjhir with 2 NRF fighters wounded. Fahim Dashty said that the attack was likely done to test the area's defenses. Mohammadi reported that seven Taliban fighters were killed and several wounded. \c\cOn 17 August 2021, a negotiated end to the political impasse has been attempted, with Saleh calling for a "peace deal" with the Taliban. On 18 August, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, indicated the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government as a means of ending the stalemate. \c\cOn 21 August 2021, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to "discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans". \c\cOn 22 August 2021, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possibly mediate. Meanwhile, resistance spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary informed the Agence France-Presse that Ahmad Massoud's group would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implemented a system of "decentralisation" and "equal rights" across the country. On 23 August 2021, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that while Taliban fighters are being sent to Panjshir, the Taliban are willing to seek peaceful means to end the conflict. \c\cAs of 23 August, there has been no public support from the international community, as the US and other potential allies focus on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul, and seek the Taliban's cooperation to do so. Massoud's op-ed in The Washington Post requesting Western support may be evidence of a lack of enthusiasm (for the resistance) in the US government. \c\cJournalists Carlotta Gall and Adam Nossiter wrote in The New York Times that the international community would be in a bind if they showed some form of support for the resistance because of the airlift operations. Abdul Matin Beyk suggested that other anti-Taliban forces are waiting to see if the Panjshir-based fighters will either resist to the end or keep considering negotiations from Taliban representatives. He suggests that their successes can inspire others to do the same. \c\cOn 27 August 2021, Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan have volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it can be deemed illegal.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Victoria is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in the Australian state of Victoria was identified on 19 January 2020, when a man returning from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cOn 10 March, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews warned Victorians to expect "extreme measures" in the wake of the federal government updating the travel advice for Italy. These could include cancelling major sporting events, requiring entire economic sectors to work from home, and calling recently retired health professionals to return to work. \c\cA state of emergency was declared on 16 March, which was extended on 12 April, with existing directions remaining in place including staying at home, restrictions on particular activities, detention, restrictions on airports and cruise ships, aged care, hospitals and isolation for people diagnosed with COVID-19.[citation needed] It was extended further on 11 May,[citation needed] and again on 19 July to 16 August. \c\cOn 22 March, the school holiday was brought forward from 27 to 24 March. \c\cOn 14 April, Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced that Victoria would have the widest coronavirus testing in Australia, with anyone having COVID-19 symptoms able to get tested. The statement was issued that those who presented with fever or chills, in the absence of any other alternative diagnosis that explained the issue, or acute respiratory infection characterised by coughing, sore throat or shortness of breath should be tested for coronavirus. \c\cOn 20 June, the Victorian Government re-tightened restrictions on household gatherings following a spike in community transmitted cases over the previous week, reported to be mainly caused by family-to-family transmission in large household gatherings. From 22 June, households could once again only have five visitors; and most easing of restrictions that were to take place were postponed. \c\cOn 30 June, the Victorian Government re-enforced local lockdowns across 10 different Melbourne postcodes. Residents there would need to comply with the four acceptable reasons to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes. \c\cOn 2 July, the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced the "Judicial Inquiry into Hotel Quarantine Program". This followed some cases of coronavirus in Victoria being linked by DNA sequencing to a breach in hotel quarantine infection control. The Inquiry was to "... examine the operation of Victoria's hotel quarantine program for returning travellers." It was headed by retired judge Jennifer Coate, and was scheduled to deliver its report to the Governor by 25 September. The inquiry was delayed by lockdown restrictions. Andrews noted that "it is abundantly clear that what has gone on here is completely unacceptable and we need to know exactly what has happened." An interim report was published on 6 November, and the inquiry's final report was published on 21 December. The Government response to the interim report was published in November. \c\cOn 4 July, the Victorian Government announced two more postcodes affected by the lockdown until 29 July 2020. Nine public housing towers housing 3,000 residents were also added, with the additional condition that residents could not leave the tower under any circumstances for five days, with the possibility of an extension to 14 days. The Victorian ombudsman later found the lockdown of the public housing towers breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 6 July, the Victorian and NSW state Governments announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July. \c\cOn 7 July, after recording 191 new cases, Premier Andrews announced that metropolitan Melbourne and the Shire of Mitchell would re-enter lockdown from 12 am on 9 July, for 6 weeks. \c\cOn 19 July, following a "concerning increase in coronavirus cases", Premier Andrews announced that "face coverings" were to be made mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne, and Mitchell Shire. This was not enforced until after 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday 22 July to allow the populace time to acquire a face covering. In addition, the state of emergency was extended until 16 August 2020. \c\cFrom 22 July, as the chance of coronavirus infection remained high in aged care and health care settings, visits were restricted to carers only, and with a limit of one hour per day. \c\cFrom 23 July, "face coverings" in metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire became mandatory whenever residents leave their homes. A fine of A$200 was imposed to those not complying, though medical and other exemptions were allowed, such as not being required for children under 12 years of age. \c\cOn 2 August, a state of disaster was declared and metropolitan Melbourne was moved to Stage 4 restrictions. A curfew across Melbourne from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. was imposed, a 5 km (3.1 mi) radius restriction as added, and other restrictions that had previously been applied only to selected postcodes were applied to the whole of metropolitan Melbourne. A permit system was introduced for any residents that still needed to travel to work outside of their 5 km radius. \c\cOn 6 September (Father's Day), the "Roadmap for Reopening" was announced; a series of four steps towards "COVID Normal" which would begin on 13 September. In the "First Step", which applied to metropolitan Victoria, several restrictions were eased including a reduction of the curfew, some loosening of rules around outdoor exercise and social interactions, the introduction of a "bubble" that allowed single people living alone to nominate one person to be allowed to visit them during the first two steps, and increased limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. At the same time, it was announced that regional Victoria would move to the "Second Step", which included a staged return of students to onsite learning as well as the reopening of outdoor public pools and further increases to limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. \c\cOn 18 October, regional Victoria was moved to "Step Three", which included the reopening of most businesses to the public, increased seating for hospitality, the allowance of visitors for all residents and the resumption of some indoor sports. At the same time, the 5 km limit in metropolitan Victoria was increased to 25 km (16 mi) and the two-hour time limit was removed, however the border between metropolitan and regional Victoria (often referred to as the "ring of steel") was strengthened with extra checkpoints added. \c\cOn 26 October, metropolitan restrictions were eased, with residents allowed to leave home for any reason, all retail businesses allowed to reopen, hospitality venues allowed to seat patrons, further relaxations on outdoor gatherings, and allowance of visitors to all residents, with some caveats. The 25 km restriction and "Ring of steel" remained in place, however. \c\c With a length of 112 days, Victoria's second lockdown was the longest continuous lockdown world-wide, as of October 2020. \c\cOn 31 October, Premier Andrews took his first day off after 120 consecutive days of coronavirus press conferences. \c\cOn 8 November, metropolitan restrictions were brought into line with regional restrictions with travel now being allowed to and from anywhere in the state. Indoor recreation, community and entertainment venues were also reopened. Restrictions on accommodation were also loosened in an effort to encourage intrastate tourism. It was also announced that, subject to public health advice, Victoria would move to the "Last Step" on 22 November. \c\cOn 27 November, Victoria recorded its 28th consecutive day of 0 new cases and 0 deaths, and had 0 active cases, epidemiologically eliminating the virus. \c\cOn 30 November, the Victorian government announced that a new dedicated agency, "COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria" (CQV), had been created. The interim Commissioner of CQV is the Commissioner of Corrections, Emma Cassar. CQV is part of the government's response to the COVID-19 Hotel Quarantine Enquirys\' interim report. It will oversee all parts of the Victorian quarantine program: mandatory quarantine for people entering Australia, Health Hotels for positive and suspected cases, or close contacts, and Frontline Worker Accommodation. The CQV Commissioner will be supported by three Deputy State Controllers. Deputy Chief Health Officer Professor Ben Cowie will lead the CQVs\' health management. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Ross Guenther will provide expertise in enforcement. As of 15 January 2021[update] the third Controller was still to be appointed. On 5 May 2021, the CQV general manager of infection control, Matius Bush, was stood down by the Minister for Government Services Danny Pearson pending a conduct review. Bush breached infection controls twice by: refusing a COVID test at a quarantine hotel when requested by Defence personnel; and failing to sanitise or change his mask when returning to a quarantine hotel from a coffee shop. Reports about the breaches were leaked and published in The Australian newspaper. \c\cOn 17 December, the Victorian ombudsman tabled a report in the Victorian Parliament in which she found the 4 July lockdown of public housing towers In Melbourne breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 30 December, Victoria's 61-day streak of zero community cases came to an end as three community cases were identified, linked to the New South Wales outbreak. As a precautionary measure for New Year's Eve the Victorian Government reduced household gatherings from 30 people to 15 and mandated masks within an indoor setting. The border to New South Wales closed at 11:59 pm on 31 December, with returning Victorian residents from "green zones" that returned before the deadline made to isolate until they received a negative test result. Those that returned afterwards would have to get tested and isolate for 14 days, aligning the restrictions with visitors from the Northern Beaches and Greater Sydney that had been enforced 11 days prior. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, a quarantine hotel worker at the Grand Hyatt Melbourne, a "resident support officer" involved in the Australian Open tennis quarantine program, was found to have COVID-19. From 11:59 pm Victoria immediately reintroduced some rules, tightened some, and put off imminent easing of some restrictions. The plan to, from 8 February (Monday), allow up to 75 per cent of office workers back into their workplaces was put on hold. Masks are mandatory inside, and only 15 persons are allowed at private events. The man visited at least 14 businesses from 29 January to 1 February, but was able to give contact tracers a detailed list of places and times. Anyone who was at those places at those times, must be tested, and isolate for 14 days. Testing site hours were extended from 4 February, opening at 8 am. More drive-through lanes were added, and additional testing sites opened. By 5 February, genomic sequencing confirmed that the Hyatt worker was infected with the more contagious "UK strain" of COVID-19. \c\cOn 12 February, it was announced that a five-day lockdown under Stage 4 restrictions would take effect beginning at 11:59 pm. AEDT, due to a cluster of 13 cases tied to a Holiday Inn quarantine hotel near Melbourne Airport, which have been assumed to be the UK variant. It was alleged by health officials to have been spread on a hotel floor due to a patient's use of an aerosol-generating nebuliser, which is normally banned under hotel quarantine. By 14 February the cluster had grown to 16, and by 16 February, the number of confirmed infections had increased to 19. By 19 February,  the Melbourne Holiday Inn outbreak had increased to 22, one person was admitted to intensive care, and about 3,515 contacts were quarantined. \c\cResidents may not leave their homes except for essential shopping, exercise, caregiving, essential work, or participating in a professional sporting event. Residents may only shop or exercise within five kilometres of their homes. Face masks are mandatory at all times out-of-home, all public gatherings are banned, and all schools are closed. As they account for the majority of UK variant cases, international arrivals into Victoria were also suspended. All Australian states and territories have placed travel restrictions upon Victoria. Premier Andrews stated that these infections were "moving at a velocity that has not been seen anywhere in our country over the course of these last 12 months." Special dispensation was given to the 2021 Australian Open, which became crowdless effective 11:30 pm. AEDT on 12 February in the midst of the night's final match (play was temporarily suspended at that time to remove all spectators from the court). \c\cThe lockdown was lifted as anticipated at 11:59 pm on 17 February. Despite this, Victoria will not allow any incoming international flights "indefinitely". \c\cRemaining restrictions included:\c\cMasks mandatory inside,\c\cMasks outdoors when unable to keep social distance,\c\c5 person limit on home visits,\c\c20 person limit for outdoor gatherings. \c\cAs of 9 May 2021 Victoria had no cases of community transmission for 72 days. \c\cOn 24 May in northern Melbourne, 4 cases of COVID-19 in the community were reported; this broke Victoria's streak of 86 days with no community transmission. Another 5 community cases, for a total of 9, were reported on 25 May. 4 of them were family contacts of a man, who may be the source of the outbreak, who tested positive on 2 May. As a result, restrictions in Greater Melbourne were again tightened from 6pm on Tuesday, 25 May, to at least Friday, 4 June. Restrictions included:\c\cmandatory wearing of masks indoors (children under 12 exempted)\c\cprivate gatherings, limited to 5 people\c\cpublic gatherings, limited 30 people\c\climits on visitors to hospitals and aged care reinstated\c\cMelbourne residents were allowed to travel out of the city, but had to observe restrictions as if they were still in Melbourne\c\cno changes to the number of people allowed in workplaces, shops, bars, or beauty services. \c\cRelaxation of "density caps" in hospitality venues had been planned, was put on hold. Cultural and sports event were allowed, but the AFL "paused" ticket sales for Victorian-based games. \c\cBy 27 May the Melbourne outbreak had risen to 26 cases. There were over 150 exposure sites and 11,000 contacts had been linked through contact tracing to the outbreak. As a result of the growing outbreak Victoria entered its fourth lockdown, statewide, as of 11:59pm on 27 May. The restrictions were initially planned to last for at least 7 days until 11:59pm on 3 June. By 1 June the number of cases in the Victorian outbreak had reached 60 and on 2 June the lockdown was extended for another 7 days. By June 7 there were 81 active COVID cases in the outbreak. The lockdown ended, with some restrictions remaining, just before midnight on 10 June. \c\cDuring the lockdown leaving home was initially only allowed for 5 reasons:\c\cFood and supply shopping (only within 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) of home)\c\cAuthorised work\c\cCare and caregiving, health\c\cExercising, for up to two hours:\c\cwith no more than one other person\c\cwithin 5 km of home\c\cTo get a COVID-19 vaccination. \c\cOtherwise:\c\cSchools closed (some exemptions)\c\cHigher education, online only\c\cChildcare centres and kindergartens, stay open\c\cHairdressers, beauty salons and similar, closed\c\cEntertainment venues, closed\c\cOnly take-away food allowed from cafes and restaurants\c\cNo public or private gatherings\c\cNo hospital or nursing home visits (some exemptions)\c\cFunerals limited to 10 people, plus those running the event\c\cWeddings not allowed (some exemptions)\c\cMasks mandatory outside the home, unless exempted. \c\cThere were anti-lockdown protests in Melbourne on 28 May. \c\cDue to the outbreak, all Australian states imposed a range of restrictions on travellers from Victoria, either banning entry, only allowing state residents back in, requiring home isolation for 7 days under Victorias\' rules, 14 days hotel quarantine, or other measures. New Zealand paused the travel bubble with Victoria from 7:59pm on 25 May. As a result of the pausing of the travel bubble, the Melbourne Rebels\' scheduled Super Rugby Trans-Tasman match against the Highlanders was forced to be relocated from Queenstown, New Zealand to Sydney. On 3 June the stay-at-home order from NSW Health, for anyone in NSW who had been in Victoria since May 27, was extended by a week. \c\cThe fourth lockdown meant that a number of other interstate professional sporting matches that were due that week had to either be played in empty stadiums, or relocated to alternative venues. The A-League match between Western United and Melbourne Victory on 28 May, the AFL match between the Western Bulldogs and Melbourne on 28 May and the AFL matches scheduled on 29 May (Collingwood against Geelong at the MCG and St Kilda against North Melbourne at Marvel Stadium) were played in empty stadiums, while the AFL match between Richmond and Adelaide scheduled for Sunday 30 May and the NRL match between the Melbourne Storm and the Gold Coast Titans scheduled for 5 June were both relocated interstate, to Sydney and the Sunshine Coast respectively. \c\cAfter the number of cases in the Victorian outbreak had reached 60 by 1 June, on 2 June the lockdown was extended for another 7 days. Some restrictions were eased:\c\cthe 5 km travel limit was extended to 10 km (6.2 miles),\c\cschool attendance allowed for years 11 and 12,\c\cauthorised work now includes some outdoors work. \c\cUse of the Service Victoria QR code check-in is required across Victoria for places like supermarkets and shops. \c\cThe Victorian outbreak rose to 63 cases by 3 June, all in Greater Melbourne. As a result, from 11:59 pm that day some lockdown restrictions in regional Victoria were eased:\c\cmovement in regional areas was unrestricted (to Melbourne is still restricted)\c\cstudents could return to school\c\cThere were 81 active COVID cases in the outbreak by June 7. There were also 3 separate clusters with unknown sources in Victoria by then: 32 cases in Whittlesea; 9 at the Arcare aged care centre in Maidstone; and 14 at a cluster in West Melbourne. The West Melbourne cluster was found to be of the fast spreading Delta COVID variant, raising the possibility the fourth Victorian lockdown could be extended again. \c\cThe lockdown ended on 10 June at 11:59 pm, with some restrictions remaining. \c\cno visitors in the home\c\cmust wear a mask both indoors and outdoors\c\ctravel limited to 25 km (16 mi) radius of home. \c\cDue to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, from 11:59pm on 24 June, border entry was barred to non-Victorian residents who had been in Greater Sydney and Wollongong in the previous 14 days as those areas were considered to be red zones. Returning Victorians had to get a red zone permit and quarantine at home for 14 days. \c\cFrom 11:59pm on July 11, Victoria closed its border to all New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory residents to try to prevent the delta variant entering the state. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr tweeted that it was "incredibly disappointing and frustrating" after more than a year with no local COVID-19 cases that the border was being closed to Canberrans. \'Border bubble\' arrangements for border towns remained in place. \c\cOn 14 July, after 11 COVID cases were detected in the state, Victoria reintroduced the requirement to wear face masks in workplaces, in schools, and when social distancing was not possible, outdoors. Most cases are linked to removalists from NSW who picked up from the Ariele apartments in Maribyrnong on 8 July without face masks. On return to NSW the removalists tested positive. Because of them the apartment block, with 130 residents, was put into a 14 day lockdown on 13 July, which was \'reset\' by the new cases. \c\cOn 15 July, it the Premier announced that Victoria would enter a snap lockdown for 5 days from 11:59pm on 15 July (Thursday) until 11:59pm on 20 July (Tuesday). This will be the third Victorian lockdown in 2021, and the fifth since the start of the pandemic in Australia. There are 18 cases in the current outbreak in Victoria, 4 recorded on this day, all of which link back to "incursions" from NSW. There are 1,500 primary close contacts and 75 exposure sites in Victoria. \c\cOn 22 July, the death of a 48-year-old woman from Victoria the previous week was linked by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to "probable" thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS),  after vaccination with AstraZeneca. \c\cOn 24 July there was an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne. There were 6 arrests, 4 people charged, and 74 infringement notices issued. There were also protests in Brisbane, and in Sydney where several people were arrested, infringement notices issued and over 50 people charged. Assistant police commissioner Luke Cornelius responds: "It beggars belief that the protest today could, if mass spreading occurs, result in an extension of the very thing they are protesting for: an end to the current lockdown and a reopening of business, which is something we are all working so hard to achieve."\c\cOn 27 July at 11:59pm the 5th lockdown was lifted with strict restrictions still remaining. It is unknown when the restrictions will ease further. \c\cno visitors in the home\c\cmust wear a mask both indoors and outdoors\c\cstudents can return to school\c\cpublic gatherings are limited to 10 people\c\cpubs, restaurants, bars, gyms and retail can reopen with density limits\c\ccommunity sport is back but spectators not allowed\c\cOn 5 August 2021, in response to the detection of six new community cases, the Victorian Government announced their sixth lockdown, commencing that evening at 8 pm for seven days. At about 7pm that day there was an anti-lockdown protest of up to 400 people in Flinders Street, Melbourne. \c\cRegional Victoria was released from its sixth lockdown early on 10 August - a welcomed relief for regional Victorian businesses. \c\cOn 11 August the lockdown was extended for 7 days. This followed the state having 20 new cases, 5 with an unknown source. \c\cOn 16 August the lockdown was extended for another 14 days, with the overnight curfew reinstated and a target end date of 2 September. \c\cOn 19 August, Melbourne marked 200 days of lockdowns since the beginning of the pandemic. \c\cOn 29 August, following a year high 92 cases detected in the community in a single day, the Victorian Government announced that the statewide lockdown will be extended but no end date was announced at the time. \c\cOn 1 September, following new cases reaching triple digits in one day for the first time since 2 September 2020, the lockdown was extended again with a target end date of September 23 with a additional target of getting 70% of the eligible population of Victoria receiving their first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines by that date. \c\cOn 21 August at 1pm, regional Victoria was also placed into its seventh lockdown and other restrictions tightened, such as the 5 km limit for essential shopping, and exercise activities. Hospitality was again takeaway only, most retail stores closed and schooling online only. Sporting venues, skate parks, playgrounds, and outdoor exercise equipment all closed. Construction statewide returned to a 25 per cent capacity limit. The 9pm-5am curfew in metropolitan Melbourne was not enacted in regional Victoria. This action followed 61 new state cases of COVID-19 on 19 August, one in Shepparton. By the afternoon of 20 August rapid PCR testing brought the cluster in Shepparton at least 21 cases. 48 of the new locally acquired cases from 19 August were linked to known outbreaks, 22 were in isolation during their infectious period. 11 separate "mystery cases" were in suburbs including Airport West, Frankston, Keysborough, Docklands and Yarraville. After there were 27 cases in 2 days at a childcare centre in Broadmeadows, among others, childcare centres were restricted to essential workers. \c\cThe same day there was another anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne city, which became violent. Up to 4,000 people marched and over 200 were arrested, 3 for assaulting police. Police responded with pepper spray when protesters threw objects at them. 7 police officers were injured, 6 of those hospitalised. 236 fines were issued. Those arrested can each be fined AU$5,452. Smaller protests were also held in Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Perth, and in Sydney where over 45 people were arrested. \c\cThe 2020 Australian Grand Prix (scheduled for 15 March) was cancelled. \c\cThe 2021 Australian Grand Prix was postponed, then later cancelled on 6 July 2021. \c\cThe 2020 Melbourne International Flower & Garden Show (scheduled for 25–29 March 2020) was cancelled. \c\cThe 2020 Melbourne International Comedy Festival (scheduled for 25 March – 19 April 2020) was cancelled due to banned public gatherings of more than 500 people. \c\cThe 2020 Melbourne International Jazz Festival (scheduled for 29 May – 12 June) was cancelled; however, it was replaced by a virtual online event by These Digital Times. \c\cThe 2020 annual Melbourne Food and Wine Festival (due to start in March 2020) was postponed to Spring. \c\cThe inaugural Rising Festival was postponed in 2020, in 2021 a snap lockdown started at midnight on 27 May, the second day of the festival, and was then extended a week.

In place of the normal Moomba attractions, Lord Mayor Sally Capp said Moomba 2.0 will be: "... a series of fun, family friendly events and attractions across the city that will help bring the buzz back to Melbourne."\c\cThe 2021 Australian MotoGP at Phillip Island was cancelled on 6 July 2021. 
The Panjshir conflict is a conflict between the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the National Resistance Front, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (controlled by the Taliban). It began on 17 August 2021 following the Fall of Kabul and Amrullah Saleh assuming the Afghan presidency and declaring the resistance. Ten days later, both sides declared a ceasefire and agreed to solve all problems through dialogue. However, by 1 September 2021, it was reported that talks had broken down, and fighting had resumed as the Taliban attacked resistance positions. \c\cThe former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". \c\cThe population of the Panjshir valley consists of a majority of ethnic Tajik people, while the majority of the Taliban are Pashtuns. \c\cThe valley is well known for its natural defences. Surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, Panjshir never fell to the Soviets during the invasion of the 1980s nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990s. \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Saleh—citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan—declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi along with the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Dushanbe. On 23 August 2021, Massoud made contact with unnamed American lawmakers. \c\cPrior to the fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, including commandos, ex-Mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and other anti-Taliban activists. Most of them regrouped at Baghlan Province's Andarab District before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from  Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan. According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid August 2021. Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms. By 22 August 2021, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a "handful of armoured humvees" in the valley. \c\cThere are difference between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan which was supportive of the Taliban. As a result, Massoud was more willing to negiotiate with the Taliban. By 22 August 2021, the resistance also confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban on their own, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. According to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to five helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. \c\cOn 23 August 2021, it was reported that BM-21 Grads were acquired as a part of its arsenal. \c\cAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the US Military Academy made prior to the Fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars. Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial materiel of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. \c\cAround 17 August 2021, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud, along with local civilians who had responded to his mobilization calls. At the time, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—"under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. On 18 August 2021, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anabah in Panjshir. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training. \c\cOn 18 August 2021, local reports from Parwan Province reported that Saleh's forces had taken Charikar from Taliban fighters stationed in the area. In addition, there are reports of gunfights taking place near Salang Pass. On the following day, videos were released which showcased local fighters with flags of the old, anti-Taliban Northern Alliance parading through the streets of Charikar. \c\cOn 20 August 2021, anti-Taliban fighters reportedly recaptured Andarab, Puli Hisar and Dih Salah districts in Baghlan Province with the Taliban claiming 15 of its soldiers had been killed, while other sources reported that up to 60 Taliban fighters were killed or injured, and two dozen captured. The three districts had reportedly experienced a revolt, led by a local police chief, after Taliban had conducted unpopular house-to-house searches. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi announced the operational success of the districts being recaptured via Twitter. \c\cAudiovisual reports of the events circulated on social media and were reported by Pajhwok Afghan News. Later on the 20th, it was reported that the forces, led by Abdul Hamid Dadgar, had recaptured Andarab, though the Taliban had not yet commented. \c\cA source within the Panjshir resistance consequently confirmed their involvement in the operations in Baghlan Province, and stated that they planned on seizing a northern highway which could allow them to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Taliban social media accounts called the counteroffensive a "betrayal" of the amnesty the Taliban had offered. It was reported on 22 August 2021 that Taliban fighters had been sent to the Keshnabad area of Andarab in order to kidnap the children of anti-Taliban forces. \c\cAlso, the Islamic Emirate gave the opposition forces a four hour ultimatum to surrender. In a statement to Al Arabiya, Massoud rejected the ultimatum. In response, the IEA announced "hundreds" of its forces had been dispatched to the Panjshir Valley. It was reported on 23 August 2021 that talks between Taliban representatives and Panjshir leaders did not work. Ali Maisam Nazary, spokesman for the resistance, said that the Taliban made demands for Massoud to accept no elections with a centralized government, which Massoud rejected as he wanted a future government to be decentralized, which respect civil and semi-autonomy rights. \c\cAn unidentified Taliban spokesperson proclaimed in a statement that "hundreds of Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate are heading towards the state of Panjshir to control it, after local state officials refused to hand it over peacefully".  It was reported that on 23 August 2021, Taliban commmander Qari Fashihuddin was tasked to lead offensive operations in Panjshir. The Taliban reported that several of their fighters were shot and killed in ambushes in Jabal Siraj with several of them killed and others wounded. \c\cOn 23 August 2021, the Taliban claimed to have recaptured all 3 districts in Baghlan that fell to the resistance forces a week ago: Dih Salah District, Pul-e-Hisar and Andarab. A Taliban district chief stationed in Andarab was reported to be killed in the fighting. On 24 August 2021, according to Deccan Herald, Panjshir resistance fighters retook control of Banu and Dih Salah districts, while Puli Hisar remained under Taliban control. Saleh publicly warned via Twitter that Taliban fighters in Andarab were blocking humanitarian assistance for civilians trying to escape from the fighting and called it a "humanitarian disaster". On the following day, Massoud's forces claimed to have ambushed a Taliban convoy in Andarab, destroying a critical bridge and inflicting heavy losses on the Islamists. \c\cOn 24 August 2021, Major Wazir Akbar, an ex-Afghan commando who has joined the Panjshir-based resistance fighters, reported an attempted Taliban incursion at Anjuman Pass through Badakhshan province, which was repelled with heavy Taliban casualties. \c\cOn 26 August, 2021, a ceasefire was declared with the Taliban and the resistance entering into talks. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that he was "80 percent confident of a solution without war in the Panjshir Valley". On 29 August 2021, Panjshir representatives stated that there were no Taliban fighters trying to enter Panjshir, refuting information from Anaamullah Samangani, who is a member of the Taliban's Cultural Commission. On 1 September 2021, it's reported that ceasefire talks failed. \c\cOn 26 August, 2021, according to a video published by Global Defense Corp, heavy fighting broke out between anti-Taliban resistance group in Panjshir Valley and Taliban. More than 200 Taliban fighters were driven out the Panjshir Valley and some were captured by anti-Taliban resistance group. The National Resistance Front (NRF) has also captured Pol-e-Hesar, Deh Salah and Banu districts. \c\cOn 28 August 2021, Panjshir fighters engaged Taliban fighters in Sanjan, Kapisa and in Khost Wa Fereng, Baghlan in response to allegations of ceasefire violations conducted by Taliban fighters in the area. \c\cOn 29 August 2021, internet and telecommunication services throughout Panjshir province were shut down on orders from the Taliban. \c\cOn 30 August 2021, Panjshir fighters ambushed Taliban fighters attempting to break into Panjshir from Andarab. On 31 August 2021, eight Taliban fighters were killed while trying to infiltrate the western part of Pansjhir with 2 NRF fighters wounded. Fahim Dashty said that the attack was likely done to test the area's defenses. \c\cOn 31 August 2021, Taliban fighters engaged Panjshir fighters in Panjshir province, Jabal Saraj, Parwan province, Khawak Panjshir and Andarb districts of Baghlan province. Sources report that the clash started when Taliban fighters were spotted entering Gulbahar and blocked the main road with a container. \c\cOn 2 September 2021, Panjshir sources claim that 13 Taliban fighters were killed in an ambush in Chikrinow district. By 2 September, Taliban spokesman said the valley was surrounded by all four directions and that Taliban forces were seizing locations. \c\cOn 17 August 2021, a negotiated end to the political impasse has been attempted, with Saleh calling for a "peace deal" with the Taliban. On 18 August, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, indicated the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government as a means of ending the stalemate. \c\cOn 21 August 2021, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to "discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans". \c\cOn 22 August 2021, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possibly mediate. Meanwhile, resistance spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary informed the Agence France-Presse that Ahmad Massoud's group would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implemented a system of "decentralisation" and "equal rights" across the country. On 23 August 2021, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that while Taliban fighters are being sent to Panjshir, the Taliban are willing to seek peaceful means to end the conflict. \c\cOn 1 September 2021, a day after clashes at the entry points of the valley were reported, Mullah Amir Khan Motaqi, the head of Taliban’s commission for guidance & encouragement stated over a twitter audio message to the people of Panjshir that attempts at reaching a negotiated settlement were "unfortunately all in vain." He lay the blame with the leadership of the resistance in Panjshir, saying there are still some people in the valley who "don\'t want the problems to be solved peacefully." He went on to say that Taliban has selected a native of the province as their desired governor. The details discussed between the both sides are unclear. Ahmad Masoud has not reacted publicly to this statement yet. \c\cAs of 23 August, there has been no public support from the international community, as the US and other potential allies focus on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul, and seek the Taliban's cooperation to do so. Massoud's op-ed in The Washington Post requesting Western support may be evidence of a lack of enthusiasm (for the resistance) in the US government. \c\cJournalists Carlotta Gall and Adam Nossiter wrote in The New York Times that the international community would be in a bind if they showed some form of support for the resistance because of the airlift operations. Abdul Matin Beyk suggested that other anti-Taliban forces are waiting to see if the Panjshir-based fighters will either resist to the end or keep considering negotiations from Taliban representatives. He suggests that their successes can inspire others to do the same. \c\cErika Simpson, president of the Canadian Peace Research Association, said that it's potentially risky for a country to publicly support the resistance from inside Afghanistan and suggested that it's better to support anti-Taliban resistance groups based overseas. \c\cOn 27 August 2021, Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan have volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it can be deemed illegal.
Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation to airlift from Afghanistan certain at-risk Afghan civilians, particularly interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants. U.S. personnel also helped NATO and regional allies in their respective evacuation efforts from Hamid Karzai International Airport in the country's capital of Kabul. The operation was concurrent with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans. \c\cSIV applicants were airlifted to the United States, where they were temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their SIV requirements. \c\cThe operation's name was unveiled on 14 July 2021 by the Biden administration. On 22 July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs (ALLIES) Act to increase the visa cap for Afghan interpreters and to expedite the Afghan SIV process.[clarification needed]\c\cOn 30 July, the first group of 221 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing, with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants still to be moved from Afghanistan. \c\cOn 12 August, following continued Taliban victories across Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced that it would deploy 3,000 U.S. troops to Hamid Karzai International Airport to help evacuate embassy personnel, U.S. nationals and SIV applicants. On 13 August, a vanguard of two Marine infantry battalions 1st Battalion 8th Marines and one Army combined-arms battalion TF 1-194 AR MN Army National Guard, arrived in Kabul, with an infantry brigade from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division on standby in Kuwait. Another 1,000 Air Force and Army personnel were to deploy in Qatar to process SIV applicants. Meanwhile, U.S. embassy staff in Kabul were destroying sensitive materials and items featuring embassy logos or U.S. flags, standard procedure during a drawdown. Helicopters shuttled people between the embassy compound and Kabul International Airport. \c\cOn 15 August, following the fall of Kabul—in which Afghan security forces fled the capital and thousands of Afghan civilians fled to the airport in hopes of boarding flights, resulting in chaotic scenes of Afghans attempting to force themselves aboard military planes—the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. U.S. military took control over the security and air traffic control of the airport later in the day. At this point, Operation Allies Refuge became concurrent with a new effort to airlift all SIV applicants, embassy personnel, American nationals, and eligible Afghans seeking to flee the country.[citation needed]\c\cOn 16 August, a C-17 cargo plane, which usually includes less than Army 150 paratroopers, safely evacuated roughly 640 people to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The US Air Force later stated they undercounted the passengers due to not counting children sitting in their parents\' laps on the buses and actually airlifted 823 Afghan civilians, setting a new record for the C-17. The Pentagon confirmed the head of U.S. Central Command, General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., met Taliban leaders based in Qatar's capital Doha. The Taliban officials agreed to terms set by McKenzie for refugees to flee using Kabul Airport. U.S. Army Maj. General William Taylor said that nine C-17s arrived overnight, bringing equipment and 1,000 more troops. Separately, seven C-17s airlifted 700-800 passengers out of the airport, 165 of which were American citizens while the rest were SIV applicants and third country nationals. \c\cOn 17 August, about 1,100 people were evacuated on 13 flights. The White House said more than 3,200 U.S. citizens, permanent residents and refugees were evacuated from the country, and nearly 2,000 Afghan interpreters were flown to the U.S. for SIV processing. On August 18, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said U.S. military flights evacuated about 2,000 people, and said it has processed more than 4,840 people for evacuation. The State Department said the U.S. military has evacuated nearly 5,000 people from the country. On August 19, more than 2,000 people were evacuated on 12 flights. The Pentagon said it has evacuated about 7,000 people from the country. \c\cOn 20 August, about 5,700 people were evacuated on 16 flights. The Pentagon said it has evacuated about 12,700 people from the country. On 21 August, United States Army Major General William D. Taylor announced that 17,000 people have been evacuated in the past few weeks, including 2,500 Americans. The Taliban has at times blocked evacuation efforts made by the United Kingdom\c\cOn 22 August, President Joe Biden said that American troops may remain in Afghanistan past the August 31 deadline. He also announced that 28,000 people have been evacuated since 15 August, and that 33,000 people have been evacuated since July. \c\cAlso on 22 August, the Department of Defense ordered the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation. The current activation is for 18 planes: four from United Airlines; three each from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines and Omni Air; and two from Hawaiian Airlines. Commercial airline pilots and crews would help transport thousands of Afghans who are arriving at U.S. bases in Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. From the bases in the Middle East, the airliners would augment military flights carrying Afghans to Germany, Italy, Spain and other stops in Europe, and then ultimately to the United States. \c\cOn 23 August, United States Army Major General William D. Taylor announced that Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, is now ready to receive Afghan evacuees in addition to Fort McCoy, Wisconsin; Fort Bliss, Texas; and Fort Lee, Virginia. Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby said the goal is to be able to receive about 25,000 evacuees in the coming days and weeks. \c\cOn 25 August, Blackwater founder Erik Prince says that he is offering to charge $6,500 for anyone who wanted to evacuate from Kabul. That same day, the total amount of evacuations topped 82,300. \c\cAlthough the Taliban's conquest of the country led to the disintegration of the Afghan Armed Forces, an armed remnant of mostly 500-600 Afghan Commandos are still active in the airport assisting US troops in providing perimeter security. The Pentagon said these Afghan troops will also be evacuated if they desired. \c\cOn 27 August, the U.S. announced that that it is opening military bases to hold up to 5,000 Afghan nationals who are applying for Special Immigration Visa (SIV) or are deemed to be "at risk". U.S. is opening up Marine Corps Base Quantico, Fort Pickett, Fort Lee, Fort McCoy, Fort Bliss, Joint Base McGuire-Dix, and Holloman Air Force Base to provide housing and support for the Afghans. \c\cOn 5 September, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said that around 100 Americans remain in Afghanistan days following the August 31 withdrawal deadline. Klain said that the Biden administration will look for ways to rescue them. \c\cAs of 26 August, at least 195 people had been killed at or near the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes. The majority were killed by a suicide bombing. \c\cSix people were killed after trying to escape as stowaways: two people were seen falling to their deaths from the sky after clinging to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane, while three people clinging to the side of an Air Force jet were killed after being run over. Remains of another dead Afghan were found in the landing gear of the American C-17, after the pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in a nearby country because they were unable to retract the landing gear. Eleven more civilians died during stampedes at the airport, seven of whom died in a single incident on August 21. At times, the Taliban has fired crowd control shots at the Kabul airport, with some people reported shot and injured from gunfire. Three more people died during gun incidents, including two armed men who fired into a crowd and were killed by U.S. troops, while the other was an Afghan guard killed during a gunfight between Afghan forces and unknown gunmen. \c\cAt least 182 people were killed and more than 200 others were wounded during a suicide bombing attack at the airport on August 26, when evacuations of locals and foreigners were under way. The attack was carried out by Islamic State militants. At least 169 Afghan civilians and 13 US service members were among the killed. The dead Americans were identified as eleven marines, one soldier, and one Navy corpsman. Several more foreign troops and Taliban members were among the injured. Three of the dead Afghan civilians were also British citizens. \c\cOn 2 September, a nine-month old baby dies after arriving at the Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, making her the first death of a evacuee on American soil.
The  Panjshir conflict is an ongoing armed conflict between the formerly dominant Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the National Resistance Front and other groups, and the newly dominant Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is controlled by the Taliban. Shortly after the Fall of Kabul, the conflict began on 17 August 2021 when Amrullah Saleh assumed the Afghan presidency and declared the resistance. Ten days later, both sides declared a ceasefire and agreed to solve all problems through dialogue. By 1 September 2021, talks had broken down and fighting had resumed as the Taliban attacked resistance positions. \c\cIn addition to the opposition in the Panjshir, there are also districts in the center of the country that are still in resistance against the Taliban, supported by ethnic and religious minorities. \c\cThe former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". \c\cA majority of the population of the Panjshir valley are ethnic Tajik people, while the majority of the Taliban are Pashtuns. \c\cThe valley is well known for its natural defences. Surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, Panjshir never fell to the Soviets during the invasion of the 1980s nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990s. Panjshir was also part of the Northern Alliance. \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Saleh—citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan—declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi along with the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Dushanbe. On 23 August 2021, Massoud made contact with unnamed American lawmakers. \c\cPrior to the fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, including commandos, ex-Mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and other anti-Taliban activists. Most of them regrouped at Baghlan Province's Andarab District before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan. According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid August 2021. Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms. By 22 August 2021, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a "handful of armoured humvees" in the valley. \c\cThere are differences between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan which was supportive of the Taliban. As a result, Massoud was more willing to negiotiate with the Taliban. By 22 August 2021, the resistance also confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban on their own, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. According to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to five helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. \c\cOn 23 August 2021, it was reported that BM-21 Grads were acquired as a part of its arsenal. \c\cAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the US Military Academy made prior to the Fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars. Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial materiel of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. \c\cAround 17 August 2021, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud, along with local civilians who had responded to his mobilization calls. At the time, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—"under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. On 18 August 2021, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anaba in Panjshir. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training. \c\cOn 17 August 2021, a negotiated end to the political impasse has been attempted, with Saleh calling for a "peace deal" with the Taliban. On 18 August, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, indicated the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government as a means of ending the stalemate. \c\cOn 18 August 2021, local reports from Parwan Province reported that Saleh's forces had taken Charikar from Taliban fighters stationed in the area. In addition, there are reports of gunfights taking place near Salang Pass. On the following day, videos were released which showcased local fighters with flags of the old, anti-Taliban Northern Alliance parading through the streets of Charikar. \c\cOn 20 August 2021, anti-Taliban fighters reportedly recaptured Andarab, Puli Hisar and Dih Salah districts in Baghlan Province with the Taliban claiming 15 of its soldiers had been killed, while other sources reported that up to 60 Taliban fighters were killed or injured, and two dozen captured. The three districts had reportedly experienced a revolt, led by a local police chief, after Taliban had conducted unpopular house-to-house searches. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi announced the operational success of the districts being recaptured via Twitter. \c\cAudiovisual reports of the events circulated on social media and were reported by Pajhwok Afghan News. Later on the 20th, it was reported that the forces, led by Abdul Hamid Dadgar, had recaptured Andarab, though the Taliban had not yet commented. \c\cOn 21 August 2021, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to "discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans". \c\cA source within the Panjshir resistance consequently confirmed their involvement in the operations in Baghlan Province, and stated that they planned on seizing a northern highway which could allow them to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Taliban social media accounts called the counteroffensive a "betrayal" of the amnesty the Taliban had offered. It was reported on 22 August 2021 that Taliban fighters had been sent to the Keshnabad area of Andarab in order to kidnap the children of anti-Taliban forces. \c\cOn 22 August 2021, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possibly mediate. Meanwhile, resistance spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary informed the Agence France-Presse that Ahmad Massoud's group would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implemented a system of "decentralisation" and "equal rights" across the country. On 23 August 2021, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that while Taliban fighters are being sent to Panjshir, the Taliban are willing to seek peaceful means to end the conflict. \c\cAlso, the Islamic Emirate gave the opposition forces a four-hour ultimatum to surrender. In a statement to Al Arabiya, Massoud rejected the ultimatum. In response, the IEA announced "hundreds" of its forces had been dispatched to the Panjshir Valley. It was reported on 23 August 2021 that talks between Taliban representatives and Panjshir leaders did not work. Ali Maisam Nazary, spokesman for the resistance, said that the Taliban made demands for Massoud to accept no elections with a centralized government, which Massoud rejected as he wanted a future government to be decentralized, with respect for civil and semi-autonomy rights. \c\cAn unidentified Taliban spokesperson proclaimed in a statement that "hundreds of Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate are heading towards the state of Panjshir to control it, after local state officials refused to hand it over peacefully". It was reported that on 23 August 2021, Taliban commmander Qari Fashihuddin was tasked to lead offensive operations in Panjshir. The Taliban reported that several of their fighters were killed and others wounded in ambushes in Jabal Siraj. \c\cOn 23 August 2021, the Taliban claimed to have recaptured all 3 districts in Baghlan that fell to the resistance forces a week ago: Dih Salah District, Pul-e-Hisar and Andarab. A Taliban district chief stationed in Andarab was reported to be killed in the fighting. On 24 August 2021, according to Deccan Herald, Panjshir resistance fighters retook control of Banu and Dih Salah districts, while Puli Hisar remained under Taliban control. Saleh publicly warned via Twitter that Taliban fighters in Andarab were blocking humanitarian assistance for civilians trying to escape from the fighting and called it a "humanitarian disaster". On the following day, Massoud's forces claimed to have ambushed a Taliban convoy in Andarab, destroying a critical bridge and inflicting heavy losses on the Islamists. \c\cOn 24 August 2021, Major Wazir Akbar, an ex-Afghan commando who has joined the Panjshir-based resistance fighters, reported an attempted Taliban incursion at Anjuman Pass through Badakhshan province, which was repelled with heavy Taliban casualties. \c\cOn 26 August 2021, a ceasefire was declared with the Taliban and the resistance entering into talks. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that he was "80 percent confident of a solution without war in the Panjshir Valley". On 29 August 2021, Panjshir representatives stated that there were no Taliban fighters trying to enter Panjshir, refuting information from Anaamullah Samangani, who is a member of the Taliban's Cultural Commission. On 1 September 2021, it was reported that ceasefire talks failed. \c\cOn 26 August 2021, according to a video published by Global Defense Corp, heavy fighting broke out between anti-Taliban resistance group in Panjshir Valley and Taliban. More than 200 Taliban fighters were driven out the Panjshir Valley and some were captured by anti-Taliban resistance group. The National Resistance Front (NRF) has also captured Pol-e-Hesar, Deh Salah and Banu districts. \c\cOn 28 August 2021, Panjshir fighters engaged Taliban fighters in Sanjan, Kapisa and in Khost Wa Fereng, Baghlan in response to allegations of ceasefire violations conducted by Taliban fighters in the area. \c\cOn 29 August 2021, internet and telecommunication services throughout Panjshir province were shut down on orders from the Taliban. \c\cOn 30 August 2021, Panjshir fighters ambushed Taliban fighters attempting to break into Panjshir from Andarab. \c\cOn 31 August 2021, Taliban fighters commenced an offensive against the National Resistance Front in the provinces of Baghlan, Panjshir, and Parwan. Anti-Taliban sources claimed that the offensive involved al-Qaeda troops, a statement backed by videos in which pro-Taliban fighters were heard speaking non-native or locally uncommon languages such as Arabic. Sources reported that the offensive started when Taliban fighters were spotted entering Gulbahar and blocked the main road with a container. Taliban forces retook Dih Saleh District in Baghlan, allowing them to directly attack Panjshir. An initial Taliban assault through Khawak Pass connecting the Baghlan and central Panjshir Provinces failed. NRFA spokesperson Fahim Dashty said that the attack was likely done to test the area's defenses. Taliban troops also began to attack southern Panjshir from Gulbahar, resulting in heavy fighting. Despite being numerically superior to the defenders, the Taliban failed to break through. \c\cOn 1 September 2021, a day after clashes at the entry points of the valley were reported, Mullah Amir Khan Motaqi, the head of the Taliban's commission for guidance & encouragement stated over a twitter audio message to the people of Panjshir that attempts at reaching a negotiated settlement were "unfortunately all in vain." He lay the blame with the leadership of the resistance in Panjshir, saying there are still some people in the valley who "don\'t want the problems to be solved peacefully." He went on to say that Taliban has selected a native of the province as their desired governor. Despite the Taliban shutdown of Panjshir's internet, Fahim Dashti, the spokesperson for the Panjshir Resistance managed to conduct an interview with BBC Persian, in which he stated that the negotiations failed because of a fundamental difference of goals between the two sides. According to him, Panjshir resistance had the intention of extracting commitments and guarantees protecting freedoms and human and political rights of ethnic and religious minorities as well as women, but Taliban's goal in the negotiation was not to negotiate such guarantees, but to negotiate the extent of participation of the Panjshir opposition in a Taliban-led government that would satisfy the resistance. \c\cOn 2 September 2021, Panjshir sources claim that 13 Taliban fighters were killed in an ambush in Chikrinow district. Even though the offensive had stalled by this point, a Taliban spokesman said the valley was surrounded by all four directions and that a Panjshir resistance \'victory was impossible\' as well as claiming Taliban territorial gains. Meanwhile, the Taliban claimed to have pushed into the Shotul district of Panjshir, but provided no firm proof for this claim. Analysts judged that the Taliban had probably advanced for a short time before being pushed back again. A minor Taliban attack on Anjuman Pass in northern Panjshir was reportedly easily repelled by Afghan commandos. In addition, local anti-Taliban forces from Andarab claimed to have retaken the crucial Khawak Pass. \c\cMeanwhile, revolts had erupted in Wardak Province and Daikundi Province which are home to many Hazaras, an ethnic group which had been previously discriminated against by the Taliban. The situation in these provinces is complex, as local militia leaders had actually aided the Taliban takeover despite the disapproval of much of the population. In Daikundi's Khadir District, a revolt reportedly erupted as the pro-Taliban Hazara commander Muhammad Ali Sedaqat was ordered to disarm locals, with some fearing that the disarmament was not properly recorded and would expose locals to harassment by the Taliban. Fighting consequently broke out between the Taliban, pro-republic Hazaras, and pro-Taliban Hazaras. Local militias began to ambush Taliban troops. \c\cOn 3 September, the Taliban claimed to have captured Panjshir valley, however these claims were described as lies and propaganda by the local resistance leaders such as Saleh as well as international spectators. A NRF spokesperson stated that the situation was "difficult", but also that a Taliban push into the valley had resulted in the encirclement of a few hundred Taliban fighters. By the following day, heavy fighting was confirmed to be still continuing in the valley, with Paryan District reportedly being contested. A Italian medical aid organisation operating in the area confirmed that the Taliban had advanced up to Anaba; the Taliban claimed to have seized the districts of Khenj and Unabah. The NRF countered by claiming that they had managed to encircle even more Taliban troops, now numbering thousands, at Khawak Pass and Dashte Rewak. On 5 September, both sides achieved some successes: The NRF was able to force hundreds of encircled Taliban fighters to surrender in the valley, with the NRF claiming to have captured up to 1,500. In turn, local journalists confirmed that the Taliban had taken both Rukha and Paryan Districts, while NRF spokesman Fahim Dashty was killed in combat. The Taliban also claimed to have advanced into Panjshir's capital Bazarak. Massoud reacted by declaring on Facebook that he was endorsing offers by local religious leaders to negotiate a peaceful solution of the conflict. However, Pakistani journalist and regional expert Ahmed Rashid argued that the Taliban had clearly expressed that they would not "tolerate what [Massoud is] asking for, which is a semi-autonomous region in the Panjshir Valley". \c\cOn 6 September, after heavy losses from clashing in the region, the Taliban had claimed they had captured all of Panjshir, with the Taliban flag being hoisted at Bazarak. The National Resistance Front had called for a ceasefire, with most National Resistance Front armies having been forced to the mountains. The National Resistance Front denied the Taliban's claim. \c\cOn 6 September, witnesses from Panjshir province told The Irish Times that the Taliban have taken control of the Panjshir province. \c\cAs of 23 August, there has been no public support for the resistance from the international community. At the start of the conflict, the US and other potential allies were focused on the concurrent Kabul airlift, which required the Taliban's cooperation. Massoud's op-ed in The Washington Post requesting Western support may be evidence of a lack of enthusiasm (for the resistance) in the US government. \c\cOn 27 August 2021, Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan have volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it can be deemed illegal. \c\cJournalists Carlotta Gall and Adam Nossiter wrote in The New York Times that the international community would be in a bind if they showed some form of support for the resistance because of the airlift operations. Abdul Matin Beyk suggested that other anti-Taliban forces are waiting to see if the Panjshir-based fighters will either resist to the end or keep considering negotiations from Taliban representatives. He suggests that their successes can inspire others to do the same. \c\cErika Simpson, president of the Canadian Peace Research Association, said that it was potentially risky for a country to publicly support the resistance from inside Afghanistan and suggested that it was better to support anti-Taliban resistance groups based overseas. \c\cAccording to an India Today report, the former Samangan MP Zia Arianjad said on 6 September that defending resistance forces had been bombed by drones of the Pakistan Air Force using smart bombs. As per reports, Pakistan's special forces have also assisted the Taliban in attacking the resistance.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in the Philippines was identified on January 30, 2020, and involved a 38-year-old Chinese woman who was confined at San Lazaro Hospital in Metro Manila. On February 1, a posthumous test result from a 44-year-old Chinese man turned out positive for the virus, making the Philippines the first country outside China to record a confirmed death from the disease. \c\cAfter over a month without recording any cases, the Philippines confirmed its first local transmission on March 7, 2020. Since then, the virus has spread to the country's 81 provinces. National and local governments have been imposing community quarantines since March 15, 2020, as a measure to limit the spread of the virus. These include the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) that was implemented in March–May 2020. On March 24, President Rodrigo Duterte signed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, a law that granted him additional powers to handle the pandemic. This was repealed by a follow-up law, the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act, which he signed on September 11. \c\cMore than 2.1 million cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 34,300 deaths, the second-highest in Southeast Asia, behind Indonesia. The largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases was reported on September 6, 2021, when the Department of Health (DOH) announced 22,415 new cases. \c\cThe Philippines had a slightly lower testing capacity than its neighbors in Southeast Asia during the first months of the pandemic in the country. COVID-19 tests had to be taken in Australia, as the Philippines lacked testing kits. By the end of January 2020, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila began its testing operations and became the country's first testing laboratory. 278 laboratories that are capable of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been accredited by the DOH since then. As of August 29, 2021, 273 of these have conducted 18,668,148 tests from more than 17,544,924 unique individuals. \c\cThe Philippines reported its first suspected case of COVID-19 in January 2020. It involved a 5-year-old boy in Cebu, who arrived in the country on January 12 with his mother. At that time, the Philippines had no capability to conduct COVID-19 tests. The boy tested positive for "non-specific pancoronavirus assay" in the RITM. Samples from the boy were also sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia to determine the specific coronavirus strain. The boy tested negative for COVID-19 but several suspected cases were already reported in various parts of the country. \c\cThe RITM developed capability to conduct confirmatory tests for COVID-19 in response to the emergence of suspected COVID-19 cases. It started conducting confirmatory tests on January 30. \c\cThe first case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was confirmed on the same day. The diagnosed patient was a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, who had arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on January 21. She was admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25 after she sought a consultation due to a mild cough. At the time of the confirmation announcement, the Chinese woman was already asymptomatic. \c\cThe second case was confirmed on February 2, a 44-year-old Chinese male who was the companion of the first case. His death on February 1 was the first recorded outside China. He suffered from coinfection with influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae. \c\cOn February 5, the DOH confirmed a third case in a 60-year-old Chinese woman who flew into Cebu City from Hong Kong on January 20 before she traveled to Bohol where she consulted a doctor at a private hospital on January 22, due to fever and rhinitis. Samples taken from the patient on January 24 returned a negative result, but the DOH was notified on February 3 that samples taken from the patient on January 23 tested positive for the virus. The patient upon recovery on January 31 was allowed to go home to China. \c\cAfter a month of reporting no new cases, on March 6, the DOH announced two cases consisting of two Filipinos. One is a 48-year-old man with a travel history to Japan, returning on February 25 and reported symptoms on March 3. The other is a 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes who experienced symptoms on February 25 and was admitted to a hospital on March 1 when he experienced pneumonia. He had last visited a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan. The DOH confirmed that the fifth case had no travel history outside the Philippines and is, therefore, the first case of local transmission. A sixth case was later confirmed, that of a 59-year-old woman who is the wife of the fifth case. Since then, the Department of Health recorded a continuous increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the country. \c\cCases abroad involving foreigners with travel history in the Philippines were reported in early March 2020. The first three recorded cases involving an Australian, a Japanese, and a Taiwanese national had a history of visiting the Philippines in February 2020. Though it was unconfirmed whether or not they had contracted the virus while in the Philippines, speculations arose on undetected local transmissions in the country due to prior confirmation of the Philippines\' first case of local transmission. \c\cRetrospective studies have been made to determine the strain of virus responsible for causing the community outbreak of COVID-19 in the Philippines since March 2020. In May 2020, Edsel Salvaña, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and member of the IATF-EID, said that the strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak in the country that started in March 2020 is closely related to the strain affecting India at the time. The virus strain's family tree is said by Salvaña to have appeared in China and Australia. In a July 2020 webinar led by Cynthia Saloma, Executive Director of the UP Philippine Genome Center two hypotheses was presented regarding the source of the March 2020 outbreak in the Philippines. Genetic sequence analysis of samples collected from Philippine General Hospital patients from March 22–28 suggest that there are at least two sources of viral transmission in the Philippines; China, mainly from Shanghai and from Japan specifically through repatriated Filipino seafarers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship. \c\cSeveral measures were imposed to mitigate the spread of the disease in the country, including bans on travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and South Korea. On March 7, 2020, the Department of Health (DOH) raised its "Code Red Sub-Level 1," with a recommendation to the President of the Philippines to impose a "public health emergency" authorizing the DOH to mobilize resources for the procurement of safety gear and the imposition of preventive quarantine measures. On March 9, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Proclamation No. 922, declaring the country under a state of public health emergency. \c\cOn March 12, President Duterte declared "Code Red Sub-Level 2," issuing a partial lockdown on Metro Manila to prevent a nationwide spread of COVID-19. The lockdowns were expanded on March 16, placing the entirety of Luzon under an "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ). Other local governments outside Luzon followed in implementing similar lockdowns. On March 17, President Duterte issued Proclamation No. 929, declaring the Philippines under a state of calamity for a tentative period of six months. \c\cAdditional facilities started to conduct confirmatory testing. On March 20, four facilities, namely the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Benguet, and the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila (where the first case was admitted to), began conducting tests as well augmenting the RITM. Other facilities began operations as well in the following days. \c\cOn March 25, the President signed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, which gave him additional powers to handle the outbreak. \c\cBy April, COVID-19 had spread to all 17 regions of the Philippines, with the confirmation of a case in April 6 of a patient confined at a hospital in Surigao City who had been in the Caraga region since March 12 after traveling from Manila. \c\cPresident Duterte on April 7 accepted the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) to extend the ECQ in Luzon until April 30. \c\cOn April 17, it was reported that the country had been able to bring down the viral disease\' reproduction number to 0.65 from 1.5, which meant that the average number of people a person could infect decreased from more than one to less than one. Recent data at the time suggested that the country was doing better in "flattening the curve", but was warned of a "resurgence" and must ramp up mass testing in order to isolate cases and avoid further transmission of COVID-19. \c\cSometime in late April, local government units (LGUs) were no longer authorized to impose quarantine measures without the consent of the IATF-EID. Prior to that period, LGUs could impose such measures in coordination with the Department of the Interior and Local Government. \c\cThe ECQ in Luzon was extended until May 15 in some areas. This included Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Central Luzon (except Aurora), Pangasinan, and Benguet. ECQ measures were also extended in the provinces of Iloilo and Cebu as well as in Davao City. Other areas were downgraded or placed under general community quarantine (GCQ). \c\cOn May 14, Typhoon Vongfong (local name: Ambo) landed on Samar Island. In the Philippines, tens of thousands of people who were locked out due to lockdowns were faced with the dual threat of typhoons and viruses, forcing complex and dangerous evacuation. At each shelter in the central part of the Philippines, in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection, only half of the capacity was accepted, and a mask was required when evacuating. Typhoon Vongfong killed five people in the Philippines. By the time Vongfong landed, the number of confirmed infections was 11,618 and the number of deaths (due to infectious diseases) was 772 in the Philippines. Vongfong also approached Manila, but due to severe restrictions on going out of Manila, most people, including low-income people living in simple houses, could not go to shelters and were forced to wait at home. \c\cAfter May 15, the Philippine government revised its quarantine classifications in correspondence to an earlier announcement that "Science and Economics will be considered for any changes of the lockdown measures." A modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was applied to Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu City, while a GCQ was raised to 41 provinces and 10 cities with moderate risk. Meanwhile, 40 provinces and 11 cities that were considered "low-risk areas" were supposed to be released from community quarantine measures, but were eventually upgraded to a "modified general community quarantine" (MGCQ) after a reportedly "honest mistake" from the national government and requests from respective LGUs. \c\cOnce again, the Philippine government revised its announcements and declared the entire country under GCQ, while Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu City continued to implement an MECQ. This was temporary until guidelines of MGCQ for low-risk areas were finalized. The IATF-EID also reportedly considered the reclassification of provinces and cities in Central Luzon as "high-risk areas" under MECQ. \c\cAfter receiving petitions from LGUs, the IATF-EID revised its quarantine policies yet again. Cebu City and Mandaue were placed under ECQ, while Metro Manila, Laguna, and Central Luzon (except for Aurora and Tarlac) were all under MECQ. The remaining parts of the country were placed under GCQ. \c\cQuarantine measures raised throughout the country started to loosen up on June 1, with areas formerly under ECQ transitioning to a less strict quarantine. This led to a significant rise in the number of confirmed cases, as more areas implemented a GCQ.[citation needed]\c\cThe official start of classes in the elementary and secondary schools which customarily begin on June was postponed. \c\cThe Bayanihan to Heal as One Act expired within this month. According to the national government, the law expired on June 25, due to its sunset provision although there were interpretations that the law expired as early as June 5. Senator Sonny Angara argued that per the Constitution "emergency powers cease upon the next adjournment of Congress" and that he considers the Bayanihan Act as an emergency measure. The national government maintains that the law was to expire on June 25. Upon expiration of the law, the national government is not anymore obliged to hand out cash subsidies to families affected by community quarantine measures. \c\cThe DOH reported an overwhelmingly high number of recoveries on July 30, as the department began its "Oplan Recovery" to clear out its discrepancies with LGU counts. Under the data reconciliation of the DOH, starting from July 15, mild cases and asymptomatic cases will be recorded as recovered after 14 days from swab collection for testing. The first set of "mass recovery" was recorded on July 30 with 37,180 recoveries. From July 30, recovery reconciliations will be reported every 15 days. \c\cOn August 2, the Philippines surpassed the 100,000 cases mark as the country continues to report around 2,000–3,000 cases a day. The country eventually had the most COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia when it finally breached Indonesia's total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. \c\cA modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was placed in Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal from August 4 to 18 as a response to the petition of medical front liners requesting an ECQ in Metro Manila. \c\cIn early August, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) became involved in a corruption scandal, and its executives were alleged to have used the pandemic as a cover-up to steal billions of pesos. \c\cThe Philippine Genome Center (PGC) had detected a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus originating in the Philippines. The new variant is said to be globally dominant variant than other variants of the virus at the time of detection and has been associated with the sudden increase of new cases in July. \c\cBy August 18, the DOH has identified 1,302 COVID-19 clusters throughout the country with the majority being located in Metro Manila. \c\cOn September 11, President Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act into law. President Duterte then extended the period of the state of calamity until September 2021, through his Proclamation No. 1021 filed on September 18. \c\cThe IATF-EID also announced on September 18 that all cemeteries, columbariums, and memorial parks nationwide will be closed from October 29 to November 4 to prevent social gatherings traditionally conducted as part of the All Saints\' Day observance. This is similar to the proposal made by Metro Manila mayors few days prior. \c\cCOVID-19 has spread to all provinces in the Philippines by September 28, when Batanes recorded its first case. \c\cIn mid-December, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 known as Lineage B.1.1.7 was identified in the United Kingdom and is reportedly more contagious than earlier variants of the virus. This has led to several countries to restrict or ban travel from the United Kingdom, including the Philippines. The Philippines also banned travel from 19 other nations which has reported cases of more-infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2. \c\cThe DOH announced in a briefing held in January 2021 that the U.K. variant is already in the Philippines as early as December 2020. One of the samples collected by the health department on December 10 tested positive for the variant on January 21, 2021. \c\cBy January 2021, the DOH is already monitoring at least two other noted mutations aside from the U.K. variant, namely the 501.V2 variant which originated from South Africa and another variant from Malaysia. \c\cOn January 5, 2021, Hong Kong reported that they detected the U.K. variant from a 30-year-old woman who arrived in the city from the Philippines on December 22, 2020, raising concerns that the strain may already be in the Philippines. The following day, a joint DOH–PGC study said that it has not detected the U.K. variant among 305 samples collected from November to December hospital admissions involving inbound travellers who have tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in the country. \c\cEpidemiologist John Wong, who is part of DOH's technical advisory working group, said in a press briefing on January 6 that if Lineage B.1.1.7 establishes itself in the Philippines, the total number of cases could rise about fifteen-fold. Wong provided two scenarios which assumed there are 20,000 cases at the beginning of the month. In the first scenario, COVID-19 has a r rate of 1.1 and the U.K. variant does not reach the Philippines which project an increase of cases to 32,000 by the end of the month. In the second scenario where Lineage B.1.1.7 does indeed establish itself in the country, the projected rise of cases could go as high as 300,000 in the same time period. \c\cOn January 13, the DOH announced that the U.K. variant has been detected in the country when a 29-year-old man from Quezon City, who arrived in the country from the United Arab Emirates on January 7, tested positive for COVID-19. 13 individuals who came in contact with the man also tested positive for COVID-19 days later. On January 22, 16 new cases associated with the U.K. variant has been confirmed in several places in country including Benguet, Laguna, and Mountain Province. A case each in Benguet and Laguna had no known contact with a confirmed case or a travel history outside the country. \c\cThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to the Pfizer–BioNTech and the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines on January 14 and 28, respectively. \c\cOn February 18, the DOH in Central Visayas announced that two mutations of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Cebu. The mutations were classified as "mutations under investigation" and were tagged as E484K and N501Y. \c\cThe DOH announced the detection of the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Pasay on March 2. On March 12, Lineage P.1, commonly known as the Brazilian variant, was detected in the country, along with a "unique" variant originating from the Philippines which was designated as the P.3 variant, which in turn related to the aforementioned variant. Japan also detected the P.3 variant on a man who traveled from the Philippines. \c\cAs a response to the recent spike in cases, the Greater Manila Area, which the government called "NCR Plus", was placed under general community quarantine (GCQ) on March 22 and was originally set to expire on April 4. It was further intensified to the stricter enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) from March 29 to April 11, when the positivity rate of the area remained high. \c\cOn March 17, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that there have been at least 27,967 deaths caused by, or associated with, COVID-19 by the end of 2020. 19,758 of these were tagged "COVID-19 virus not identified", while 8,209 were tagged "COVID-19 virus identified". The discrepancy between the tallies of the DOH and the PSA is due to the inclusion of probable and suspect cases in the PSA's tally. On April 26, the country surpassed 1 million cases. \c\cOn May 11, the country detected its first two cases of Delta variant from India. The variant had been confirmed in two Filipino seafarers who returned in April. While the infections on Metro Manila is slowing down, COVID-19 infections is surging on other regions. Mindanao accounted for a quarter of new cases, higher than Metro Manila, showing that the pandemic has shifted to the regions far outside of the metropolitan areas. A former mayor and his brother from a nearby town were also admitted at a government hospital in the same city, as dozens of people were being treated for coronavirus outside in makeshift tents, or hooked up to oxygen tanks while sitting in their vehicles, due to the lack of hospital beds. \c\cAs COVID-19 surges in Indonesia, the Philippines banned travels from Indonesia amid Delta variant threat. Roque said travelers from Indonesia will be barred from entering the country from July 16 to July 31. \c\cOn July 16, the country detected 16 new cases of the highly-transmissible COVID-19 Delta variant, which has become the dominant variant in several countries. Of these, 11 are local cases. In a press briefing, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that 15 of the new detected cases had recovered while another died. Of these, 10 are females aged 14 to 79. Due to rising cases and local transmission of the Delta variant, Metro Manila, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Davao de Oro, and Davao del Norte were placed under general community quarantine with heightened restrictions starting on July 23. \c\cOn July 29, the Department of Health (DOH) detected 97 new cases of Delta variant bringing the total number of Delta variant cases to 216. Of the newly reported cases, 88 were local cases, six are returning overseas Filipinos, while three other cases are still under verification. \c\cOn July 30, the government placed Metro Manila under Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) starting August 6 until August 20 due to rising cases of Delta variant. \c\cOn August 5, the DOH detected 116 new cases of Delta variant bringing the total number of cases to 331. Of the additional Delta variant cases, 95 were local cases, one is a Returning Overseas Filipino (ROF) while the remaining 20 cases are being verified if they are local or ROF cses. The DOH said that among the 216 Delta variant cases reported last July 29, one case was verified to have been tested in two different laboratories so the DOH amended the previous total Delta variant cases from 216 to 215. \c\cOn the same day, President Rodrigo Duterte approved the recommendation of the IATF to place some provinces under ECQ and MECQ. Laguna, Cagayan de Oro, and Iloilo City will be under ECQ from August 6 to 15, while Lucena and the provinces of Cavite, Rizal, and Iloilo will be placed under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ). Batangas and Quezon, on the other hand, will be under general community quarantine (GCQ) with heightened restrictions from August 6 to 15. \c\cOn August 15, the DOH detected the country's first case of the Lambda variant. The patient is a 35-year-old female and is currently being validated as to whether she is a local or returning overseas Filipino case. The DOH said the patient was asymptomatic and tagged as recovered after undergoing the 10-day isolation period. Meanwhile, the DOH also detected 182 new cases of the Delta variant, as well as 41 new cases of the Alpha variant, 66 new cases of the Beta variant and 40 new cases of the Theta variant. Of the newly-reported cases of the Delta variant, 112 cases are local, 36 are returning overseas Filipinos, and 34 are still undergoing verification. Among the 41 new Alpha cases, 38 are local, one is an ROF, and two are still being verified. Out of the 66 additional Beta cases, 56 are local and 10 cases are still undergoing verification. Among the 40 new Theta variant cases, 37 are local cases and three cases are still being verified. \c\cOn August 19, the IATF-EID approved to place Metro Manila and the province of Laguna under MECQ from August 21 to 31. \c\cThe World Health Organization released a statement on August 28, that the Delta variant is already the dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the Philippines. \c\cOn September 1, the COVID-19 cases in the country surpassed 2 million with 14,216 additional cases. \c\cOn September 3, the Philippines Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the emergency use of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for minors aged 12 to 17. \c\cMetro Manila, having over 536,771 cases and 8,121 deaths, is considered as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. More than half of the total number of cases in the country was attributed to it during the first months of the pandemic. It is followed by the neighboring regions of Calabarzon and Central Luzon with 253,125 and 133,382 cases, respectively. Bangsamoro, on the other hand, has the least cases. \c\cAs of July 15, 2021, at least 20,996 healthcare workers have tested positive for COVID-19. 20,785 out of these cases have already recovered, while 100 have died. In the early months of the pandemic in the country, the number of healthcare workers infected by the virus was significantly higher compared to the infection rate of other health care workers in the Western Pacific Region. \c\cMore than 9,381 police officers from the Philippine National Police (PNP), 1,137 military personnel from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and 160 members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) have tested positive for COVID-19 during its pandemic in the country. \c\cThe arrival of locally stranded individuals (LSI) on their home provinces has been associated to new clusters of the disease in previously least affected regions. \c\cOf the 1,315,832 returning overseas Filipinos (ROFs) reported on July 15, 2021, 1,304,755 have tested negative for the disease and have been discharged from quarantine facilities, while 19,390 have tested positive. \c\cThe Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) provides information regarding the number of Filipino nationals abroad to have contracted COVID-19. The DFA keeps an official tally of confirmed Filipino COVID-19 cases per region instead of by country. As of July 12, there have been 20,943 overseas Filipinos from 95 countries and territories that tested positive for COVID-19. This count is not included in the national tally of cases by the DOH. \c\cThe DOH previously used the designation "patients under investigation" (PUIs) and "persons under monitoring" (PUMs) to manage suspected and confirmed cases. PUIs involved individuals who had a travel history to Wuhan but by February 3, 2020, the DOH has expanded the scope of PUIs to include individuals who had a travel history to any part of China. "Persons under monitoring" are asymptomatic individuals with known history of exposure to another person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. \c\cOn April 11, 2020, the DOH revised its terminology for PUIs; "suspect" and "probable" cases. Suspect cases involve individuals exhibiting flu-like symptoms and have a history of travel to areas with reported local transmission within 14 days before the manifestation of their symptoms. Someone with fever, cough, or shortness of breath who is above 60 years old, pregnant, with other underlying illness, or a health worker could also be considered as a suspect case. Patients admitted to a hospital due to severe symptoms caused by an undetermined lung disease could also be tagged as a suspect case. Probable cases involve persons who underwent testing with results that need further validation, and those who were tested but whose test was not facilitated in an official laboratory for a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. \c\cThe usage of the PUM designation has since been discontinued. It was reasoned that it is assumed that the general public has been exposed to COVID-19 due to local or community transmission already ongoing in several parts of the Philippines. \c\cBy July 14, 2020, there had been 38,909 suspected cases (958 probable and 37,951 suspect) in the country. \c\cThe DOH has issued a reminder, that Level 2 and 3 hospitals cannot deny admittance of people suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and refusal of admission is a "violation of the signed Performance Commitment and shall be dealt with by the PhilHealth accordingly". The department said that Level 2 and 3 hospitals can accommodate individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms while individuals in a serious or critical condition may be transferred to one of the DOH's three main referral hospitals, which was increased over time to 75 designated hospitals as of April 13 with a combined bed capacity of 3,194. \c\cOn March 16, the DOH announced a revision on their protocol on hospital admission for COVID-19 positive patients. A week prior, the DOH began sending both asymptomatic patients and individuals with mild symptoms back to their homes for quarantine and continued health monitoring until they have been deemed recovered. Priority was given to high-risk patients or those with severe symptoms for hospital admission. \c\cThe Philippines, with at least 45 other countries, has joined the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Solidarity trial to study the effectivity of certain drugs in treating COVID-19 patients. Dr. Marissa Alejandria of the Philippine Society of Microbiology and Infectious Disease is the Philippines\' representative in the study with Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire as the official liaison of the DOH in the multinational study. \c\cThe Department of Science and Technology (DOST) announced that it is seeking bilateral collaboration with other countries such as China, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom on endeavors related to the vaccine development for COVID-19. President Rodrigo Duterte declared a bounty for anyone who could produce a vaccine against COVID-19, an amount later increased to ₱50 million (around $1 million). \c\cThe Philippine Council on Health Research and Development at the DOST plans to distribute an undisclosed "functional food," while Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque also revealed that the DOST, Philippine General Hospital, and the Ateneo de Manila University, are collaborating with the Duke–NUS Medical School in Singapore to evaluate the feasibility of lauric acid from virgin coconut oil, Vitex negundo (known locally as Lagundi), and Euphorbia hirta (known locally as Tawa-tawa) as a "dietary regimen supplement" to help COVID-19 patients combat the disease. A "functional food" or "dietary regimen supplement" is described as similar to how tawa-tawa is also used as a remedy against dengue by incorporating it to the diet of diagnosed patients. \c\cThe Philippine government has been negotiating with various foreign vaccine manufacturers to secure the country's COVID-19 vaccine supply. These manufacturers include Sinovac Biotech (China), Gamaleya Research Institute (Russia), Moderna (United States), and Pfizer (United States). The private sector, with government sanction, has secured at least 2.6 million vaccine doses from British-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca. Negotiations are also ongoing with American firm Novavax which would supply at least 10 million doses from the Serum Institute of India. The country is projected to at least 164 million doses from various manufacturers in 2021. \c\cThe procurement efforts of the national government has been a subject of various controversies. Health Secretary Francisco Duque has been alleged to "dropped the ball" in a deal with Pfizer vaccine deal which could have secured 10 million doses by as early as January 2021. Plans to secure 26 million doses from China's Sinovac has also been put into scrutiny in the Congress due to its reported efficacy rate. Late stage trials of Sinovac's vaccine  in Brazil reported an efficacy rate of only 50 percent. There were concerns within the Senate that the reported 50-percent efficacy rate of Sinovac's vaccine would not garner public trust and would be a waste of government funds. The Department of Health said that Sinovac's vaccine satisfy the World Health Organization standards of at least 50 percent efficacy rate while the FDA pointed out that Sinovac is yet to publish an official and published scientific report on their vaccines efficacy rate and that the clinical trial for the vaccine is conducted in different countries and the efficacy rate per country will vary; as low as 50 percent in Brazil and as high as above 90 percent in Turkey. \c\cOn December 2, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed an executive order allowing the Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency-use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Under certain conditions, vaccines and drugs could be approved within a month instead of undergoing the usual six-month review process. Among the conditions is for a vaccine manufacturer to obtain prior EUA in its country of origin or other countries with a "mature" regulator. The FDA announced that three vaccine manufactures namely Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have inquired on the process of obtaining an EUA in the Philippines. On December 23, Pfizer has applied for an EUA for its vaccine. \c\cDuterte also said in December 2020 that some members of the military already received COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese manufacturer, Sinopharm despite the vaccine not yet officially approved by the country's health authorities. Few days later, it was reported that some members of the Presidential Security Group had also received vaccine from unknown manufacturer. \c\cEarly COVID-19 testing in the Philippines was only limited to persons with travel history to countries with cases of local transmission and those with exposure to the individuals confirmed to have COVID-19. The testing protocols were revised sometime in mid-March 2020 to give priority to the testing of any individual with severe symptoms as well as to the elderly, pregnant and immunocompromised persons with at least mild symptoms. On March 30, symptomatic healthcare workers are also considered priority for testing. \c\cDuring his press briefing on May 19, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said that the people aimed to be tested in the government's "expanded targeted testing" are as follows: "(1) all symptomatic cases, (2) all of those coming from abroad, (3) all close contacts of confirmed cases that were found through contact tracing, and (4) all of those who tested positive on rapid antibody tests." The government is also opting to test through benchmarks, by testing 1–2% of the Philippines\' entire population and 10–12% of the worst affected region in the country, which is Metro Manila. \c\cIn late March 2020, some politicians and their relatives were reportedly tested for the disease despite not showing any symptoms, causing public backlash amidst a shortage of testing kits since it was against DOH guidelines to test asymptomatic individuals. The DOH responded to the public criticism by clarifying that, while there is "no policy for VIP treatment" with regard to testing for COVID-19 and that "all specimens are being processed on a first-in, first-out basis," it "extends courtesy" to front line government officials, specifically those involved in national security and public health. Some senators who were tested claim that they used rapid antibody tests not accredited by the DOH at that time. \c\cOn January 24, 2021, after receiving a go-signal from the national government, the Philippine Red Cross announced that they will start conducting COVID-19 tests using saliva samples on January 25. \c\cIn July 2020, there were currently 85 testing laboratories nationwide with 25,000 tests conducted daily. The country has conducted over 3 million tests as of September 2020. \c\cOn March 9, 2020, a total of 2,000 tests has been conducted at a rate of 200 to 250 people accommodated by tests per day. The testing capacity of the Philippine government has been expanded by late March 2020. As of March 23, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa alone can test 600 people per day, other laboratories except for the facility of San Lazaro Hospital, Manila, can do 100 tests, while the said hospital can do 50 tests per day. By March 27, the release of test results conducted at the RITM takes five to seven days due to backlog, but the institute is committed to reducing the turnaround to two to three days. The DOH announced that the country will conduct targeted mass testing on April 14, which will be administered strictly for susceptible, probable, and high-risk patients, such as health workers, expectant mothers, and patients with other medical conditions. The country's testing continuously increased, except when RITM temporarily scaled down its operations from April 20–24 after 43 of its staffs tested positive for the virus. \c\cThe Philippines has the capability to conduct mass testing, either through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or rapid antibody testing, given the increased number and improving capacity of the country's accredited laboratories and the procurement of more testing kits. The first localized targeted mass testing began in Valenzuela, Metro Manila on April 11. Other local government units followed suit shortly after the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) adopted a resolution that commences \'a national government-enabled, local government unit-led, and people-centered response\' to COVID-19. \c\cThe Food and Drug Administration has approved the usage of 75 PCR test kits (including one locally developed kit), 79 rapid antibody testing kits, 53 immunoassay testing kits, and 7 other testing kits as of July 30. \c\cA locally developed PCR testing kit has been made by the National Institutes of Health at the University of the Philippines Manila. It is reportedly six times cheaper than its foreign counterparts. It was first approved for commercial use in April 2020 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but some kits were recalled in May by its manufacturer, after it was found out that testing using the kits yields indeterminate results 30 percent at the time. A month later, the testing kit were re-approved after its defects were fixed. \c\cBefore January 30, there were no medical facilities in the country that can confirm cases of the virus. Before that date, the RITM conducted preliminary tests on suspected cases to determine if they are infected with a coronavirus but could not detect the new strain on patients. Samples from suspected cases with confirmed coronavirus infection had to be sent abroad to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, for confirmatory testing specifically for SARS-CoV-2. \c\cThe National Task Force for COVID-19 created the Task Force T3 (Test, Trace, and Treat) to establish public-private partnerships that would conduct mass testings. The task force cited the San Miguel Corporation as a pioneer in the move to open its COVID-19 testing laboratory to initially test all of its 70,000 employees. As of August 24, the country has 110 subnational laboratories capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2. \c\cFrom May 29 to June 17, 2020, the DOH had included testing backlogs on their daily case bulletin. These backlogs were referred to as "late cases" and were validated by the DOH's Epidemiology Bureau after more than four days of the release of test results. Late cases were reported alongside new cases or "fresh cases", which corresponded to the cases that were validated three days within the release of test results. This change was implemented by the health department to clarify the sudden increase of cases in the country. The then-largest single-day increase on the number of confirmed cases in the country has been accounted to the backlog in late June 2020, when 2,434 new cases were announced. 1,147 out of these cases were fresh cases and the remaining 1,287 were late cases. It surpassed the backlog in late May 2020, where 1,000 out of 1,046 cases were reported to be late cases. \c\cThe national government declared a state of calamity over all of the Philippines on March 16, 2020, by virtue of Proclamation No. 929 signed by President Rodrigo Duterte. The declaration brings into effect for six months the following:\c\cprice control of basic needs and commodities,\c\cgranting interest-free loans,\c\cdistribution of calamity funds,\c\cauthorization of importation and receipt of donations, and\c\chazard allowance for public health workers and government personnel in the fields of science and technology. \c\cFollowing the sharp increase of confirmed cases, President Duterte called on Congress to hold special sessions on March 23 to enact the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act upon his request, which would authorize Duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a budget of almost ₱275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the estimated ₱438 billion ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic. \c\cIn the House of Representatives, the bill was introduced as House Bill No. 6616 with House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of Pateros–Taguig as its principal sponsor and was defended on the floor by Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte of Camarines Sur's 2nd district. In the Senate of the Philippines, the bill was introduced as Senate Bill No. 1418 with Senate President Tito Sotto and Senator Pia Cayetano as its principal sponsors. \c\cThe House version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in a 284–9 vote without abstentions, while its Senate version unanimously passed the Senate. President Duterte signed the bill into law on March 25. The law was effective for three months until June 25, owing to its sunset provision. \c\cA legislation was proposed to replace the Bayanihan Act, dubbed as the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act or Bayanihan 2. On August 20, the bicameral committee approved a reconciled version of the bill. It was signed into law by President Duterte on September 11. \c\cThe government has varying levels of lockdown and/or stay-at-home orders across all the country's local government units characterized as "community quarantines". The strictest of these measures is designated as enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). Restrictions were imposed on various aspects of society such as mass public transportation, mass gathering, and operation of businesses.[citation needed]\c\cIn April 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte warned anyone who violates the country's lockdown measures could be shot for causing trouble. \c\cTravel of foreign nationals to the Philippines is banned with few exceptions since March 2020. The issuance of visas to all foreign national on March 19 was stopped and all visas already issued are voided except to those issued to families of Filipino nationals would remain valid. Three days later a travel ban was imposed on all foreign nationals, except spouses of Filipino citizens (and their children), and workers for international organizations and non-governmental organizations accredited in the country. \c\cThe government of China and the United States has pledged support to the Philippine government response against COVID-19. China announced that it would be donating medical supplies including 100,000 testing kits, 100,000 surgical masks, 10,000 N95 masks, and 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment. The United States Agency for International Development also pledged $2.7 million worth of aid to help the Philippines develop adequate testing capabilities, and ensure the availability of medical supplies through the agency's "on-the-ground partners". China's aid was received on March 21, 2020. \c\cOn March 22, 2020, the DFA said that the Philippines would be receiving a donation from Singapore consisting of 3,000 testing kits and a polymerase chain reaction machine. In early April 2020, the DFA announced it received 20 units of testing kits, capable of 1,000 tests, from Brunei. The United Arab Emirates also donated medical supplies in May 2020. \c\cOn March 28, 2020, it was disclosed that some of the test kits made in China were only 40% accurate in testing for signs of the COVID-19 on an individual suspected to be infected with the disease. The test kits were donated by a private foundation. \c\cOn July 20, 2021, it was reported that the United States delivered a total of 3,240,850 one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccines to the Philippines as part of its worldwide effort to help end COVID-19. This is the first time the Philippines has received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine – a safe, trusted and easy-to-store shot widely used in the US. Prior to the US delivery of the Johnson & Johnson vaccines, the Philippines has received more than seven million vaccine doses through the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, a global initiative run by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to support equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. To date, total US government COVID-19 assistance to the Philippines amounts to over P1.38 billion ($27.5 million). \c\cThe National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) revised its economic growth outlook for the Philippines in 2020 from a 6.5% to 7.5% gross domestic product (GDP) growth registered in late 2019 to a 5.5% to 6.5% GDP growth, following the pandemic. The NEDA cited the decline in service exports, especially tourism. Moody's Analytics also reduced their GDP growth outlook for the country, from 5.9% in 2019 to 4.9% following the pandemic. Meanwhile, Nomura gave a bitter prediction of 1.6%, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave an almost flat growth of 0.6% for this year before rebounding to 7.6% in 2021. \c\cBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno and then-NEDA Director-General Ernesto Pernia forecast that the Philippine economy would likely enter a recession in 2020 due to the effect of the pandemic. Diokno stated that, although the first quarter is likely to grow by 3% since the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine only took effect near the end of the quarter, the second and third quarters would likely experience contractions in economic growth. \c\cThe Philippines\' real GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020, the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 1998, a year after the Asian financial crisis. The Philippines entered a technical recession, after the country's GDP contracted in by 16.5 percent in the second quarter. The country's GDP continued to contract in the following quarter periods. \c\cThe Philippines\' GDP saw its worst contraction since World War II posting a growth of −9.5% for 2020 according to the Philippine Statistics Authority records from 1947. The last full-year contraction was in 1998 amidst the Asian financial crisis where the GDP grew by −0.5%. The 2020 contraction was also worse than the – 7% contraction in 1984. \c\cThe Philippine economy exited recesssion in the second quarter of 2021, posting a GDP growth of 11.8%. \c\cIn terms of the amount of economic loss that the Philippines is projected to suffer, NEDA gave a value of up to ₱2.0 trillion, or equivalent to about 9.4% of 2020 nominal GDP, while the Philippine Institute for Development Studies estimates at a maximum of ₱2.5 trillion. International organizations also gave their predictions, with the Friedrich Naumann Foundation envisioning a ₱273-billion loss and the Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières envisioning a combined loss of more than ₱1 trillion just in the month of April. \c\cThe pandemic also affected the goal of the Philippines to be among the countries with upper-middle-income country status by nominal GNI per capita. Before his resignation, Pernia said that the country will still achieve this goal by 2020, while his replacement, acting NEDA Director-General Karl Kendrick Chua, said last May that this goal will be achieved in 2022. Daniel Ross of Bloomberg also stated that the Philippines, which is "an economic star poised to outpace long-time regional winners such as China, Indonesia and India," will face hindrances amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cOn the other hand, the BSP records an inflation rate of 2.2% in April and 2.5% in March compared from 2.6% in February and 2.9% in January. The average rate of 2.6% for the period of January to April 2020 is also 1% lower compared to the inflation rate from the same period in the previous year. The event was primarily and hugely caused by lower oil prices and transportation costs, even if the prices of food supplies and alcoholic beverages and tobacco slightly rose. \c\cOn March 9, 2020, the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) index lost 457.77 points or 6.76%, its steepest decline since the financial crisis of 2007–08. The following day, shares plunged by 6.23% to ₱5,957.35 (US$117.54), settling below the 6,000 level benchmark and entering the bear market territory. The mining and oil industries were the most affected with a 9.05% drop, followed by holding companies with a 6.93% drop. The PSE's circuit breaker mechanism was invoked for the second time since the measure's introduction in 2008 halting trade for 15 minutes. \c\cEconomist Bernardo Villegas has noted that pandemic has created a situation where the Philippine government "is getting overborrowed," and that the Philippines needs more Foreign Direct Investments in order to fund capital-intensive industries, including telecommunications and media. \c\cIn terms of unemployment rate, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) records an estimated unemployment rate of 5.3% in January 2020, which is the same with January 2019. Moody's Analytics puts its estimate at 5.3% for the first quarter of 2020, while Nomura expects 7.5% for Q1 and a 13-year high of 8% in Q2 of this year. Meanwhile, the IMF stated that the unemployment rate in the country would be 6.2% for this year compared to 5.1% in 2019. A higher rate of 6.8% for this year was also predicted by S&P Global Ratings. \c\cThe Trade Union Congress of the Philippines estimates that around 7,000 people may lose jobs within the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic. Economists from the Ateneo de Manila University estimate that 57% of the country's workforce may be displaced within the end of the first quarter of 2020. It comprises around 15 million workers in Luzon that were laid off due to the enhanced community quarantine, around four million of whom are based in Metro Manila, as well as an estimated 4.3 million workers in Visayas and another 4.3 million in Mindanao that were laid off due to quarantine restrictions. \c\cIn March, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) stated that 1.05 million workers were displaced due to the pandemic, even after they released guidelines for employers in handling the impact of COVID-19. \c\cPhilippine aviation services were heavily affected after travel, both locally and internationally, was restricted to contain the spread of the virus. \c\cSome German businesses that are based in the country also reported to reduce investments in the country, but will continue to maintain their employees. \c\cIn early 2021, there were reports that some employers are requiring its workers to get vaccinated before allowing them to physically report for work, with some workers threatened to be placed on floating status if they are not able to comply. DOLE released a statement that such practice is illegal and workers should be only vaccinated on a voluntary basis. \c\cFollowing directives from the Philippine government, several fast food and restaurant chains suspended dine-in services and restricted operations to take-out and delivery. Online food ordering services such as GrabFood and Foodpanda temporarily halted during the enhanced community quarantine but eventually resumed operations in Luzon during the quarantine period. \c\cSeveral restaurants and coffee shops across the country offered free food and beverages to front line professionals involved in the pandemic, especially health care workers. \c\cFood production and distribution slowed down during the pandemic, especially in Luzon, primarily due to the lack of financial assistance and inaccessibility of transportation resulting from community quarantine measures being implemented across numerous local governments. The delivery of fresh vegetables from the province of Benguet, which supplies the country with over 80 percent of the country's highland vegetable requirements, was halted due to the implementation of an "extreme enhanced" community quarantine in La Trinidad. Local government officials advised local rice farmers to sell their harvests to them, assuring them that they would help distribute it to their respective communities amid the border restrictions. \c\cOn March 27, Vietnam announced that it would reduce its production and exportation of rice due to food security amid the pandemic. The Philippines, the largest importer of rice in the world, imports 25% of its rice from Vietnam. Agriculture Secretary William Dar assured that there would be "no shortage of the staple during the duration of the enhanced community quarantine and beyond" as "harvest [is] already coming in." Dar also stated the Department of Agriculture's plans to initiate early planting in the Cagayan Valley and Central Luzon, two of the largest rice producers in the country, ahead of the third quarter of 2020. \c\cProduction of canned fish in the country was adversely affected with Zamboanga City, which accounts for 85% of the country's canned fish industry, announcing it would reduce the production of canned fish in the Philippines by 50–60% due to difficulties encountered following the implementation of a city-wide lockdown. \c\cThe Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) ordered the suspension of all gaming operations in the country, including the land-based casinos in Entertainment City and Newport City, on March 15. The gaming regulator also announced that they were limiting the operations of Philippine offshore gaming operations in the region. \c\cIllegal gambling activities conducted online, including online cockfighting or e-sabong, through social media has proliferated amidst the pandemic. PAGCOR has aimed to regulate online cockfighting, as part of efforts to expand the source of funds for the government. \c\cA shortage of medical masks was reported in various parts of the country due to concerns over the pandemic. RITM director Celia Carlos urged the public against hoarding masks to ensure ample supply for medical workers directly dealing with patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), in cooperation with the Philippine National Police, are acting against reports of traders hoarding face masks and selling said item at an overpriced rate. The DTI has also directed its Philippine International Trading Corp. to import 5 million masks from overseas. Medtecs International Corp. Ltd., the sole manufacturer of medical mask in the country, has committed to supply the government through the DTI. However, due of the Philippine procurement law, local manufacturers are having difficulty competing with foreign suppliers that have a lower cost but may have substandard quality. \c\cDoctors in the Philippines have deplored the shortages in personal protective equipment amid the pandemic, and was even cited as the cause of high infection rate and death rate of healthcare workers in the country. To address this issue, the Philippine government continues to procure and stockpile such equipment, as the pandemic is expected to last until 2021. \c\cAccording to Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire, the country also issued requests for ventilators and respirators that will be used for severe or critical COVID-19 patients, as there are reported shortages of these equipment. \c\cAccording to the Philippine Retailers Association, the "total retail environment" saw a decline of 30–50%. SM Investments, the country's largest retailer, saw a decline of 10–20% in domestic sales. Despite the decline, most retail stores that provide essential services, including supermarkets, convenience stores, hardware stores, and pharmacies, remained open across the country to sustain consumers while other establishments at malls closed down. Such retail stores, however, imposed strict social distancing measures with some supermarkets only allowing 50 customers inside at a time and placing stickers on the floor to indicate that customers must stand one meter apart from each other. Stores were also regularly disinfected and customers were required to undergo a temperature check before entering. In the Greater Manila Area, several online grocers continued to operate, but with limited delivery slots. After most industries in the country being closed for two months, many stores in the retail sector are already allowed to open under revised guidelines of eased community quarantines. \c\cPanic buying and hoarding became rampant across the country, especially with essential goods such as food and sanitation products. The Philippine Amalgamated Supermarkets Association reported that the purchases of masks, alcohol, and other personal hygiene products in supermarkets across the country had already surged, urging the public against panic buying. \c\cEconomic think-tank Fitch Solutions forecasts that the consumer and retail sector, especially non-essential businesses, would be one of the hardest-hit sectors in the Philippines as it loses sales revenue for an entire month due to the Luzon enhanced community quarantine (Luzon accounts for 73% of the country's GDP). Fitch Solutions forecasts the household final consumption expenditure for the country in 2020 to expand by 6.7% year-over-year, which was adjusted from a "pre-coronavirus projection" for 2020 of 7% growth year-over-year. \c\cMall operators across the country, such as Ayala, Megaworld, SM, Robinsons, and Vista, initially shortened the operating hours of its malls to comply with government quarantine measures. While doing so, malls were asked to implement social distancing measures; for example, several malls implemented a "single-seat gap" policy in cinemas, in which moviegoers were required to sit one seat apart from each other. However, most malls in the country have since limited its operations to establishments providing essential services, particularly groceries, banks, and hardware stores. \c\cLocal airlines AirAsia, Philippine Airlines, and Cebu Pacific suspended flights in response to the imposition of travel bans by the Philippine government and some foreign governments. The airlines have suspended flights as early as February 2, 2020, covering routes involving destinations in China, Hong Kong and Macau. At least Philippine Airlines has suspended all of its flights by March 2020, although the airline has announced plans to resume selected flights by June 1, 2020. \c\cThe 2020 census of population and housing in the Philippines was originally scheduled in May but was postponed indefinitely due to the increasing number of cases in the country. As the quarantine measures began to ease, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) started to conduct the census in September, despite the risk of spreading the virus. \c\cSuspension of classes began as early as March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 16, the Department of Education (DepEd) issued guidelines prohibiting public schools in areas with suspended classes from administering the final examinations of students and instead compute the students\' final grades for the 2019–20 academic year based on "their current academic standing." and directed schools in other areas to administer final examinations within that week on a "staggered basis" and for teachers and students to observe social distancing measures. \c\cSome universities resorted to implementing online learning alternatives. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) also advised institutions of higher education to implement distance education methods of learning for its classes, such as the use of educational technology, to maximize the academic term despite the suspensions; However, following the announcement of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and other areas, colleges and universities suspended mandatory online classes in consideration of the welfare of its students, faculty, and staff. Academic administration offices continued to operate with a skeleton crew, while other offices in colleges and universities operated through telecommuting arrangements. Some schools, however, continued to hold online classes, and in response, several student groups appealed to CHED to suspend mandatory online classes in consideration of the logistical limitations and well-being of a majority of students. \c\cLive classes in all levels across the country were eventually suspended due to the pandemic. Graduation rites in Philippine schools were also either canceled, postponed, or held virtually. \c\cThe official start of classes for the 2020–21 school year could only be legally set as late as the last day of August. However, Republic Act No. 11480 was signed into law to allow the start of classes to be set beyond August. The Department of Education has moved the opening of classes to October 5, 2020. Earlier in June, officials reported that schools will not open until a vaccine is available, though remote learning should resume at the end of August. \c\cA group of UP experts has proposed the start of classes to be pushed back to December in order to limit the spread of the disease. \c\cCHED left the decision of starting semesters to college administrators, although urged them to shift into the new semestral calendar and start \'flexible classes\' in August and face-to-face classes in September as well. Certain measures have been proposed to be implemented during the opening of classes, such as the airing of lectures on television and radio, a "mandatory face mask policy," maintaining physical distancing, and limiting class sizes. \c\cThe NEDA reported that the coronavirus pandemic would incur a ₱22.7 billion ($448 million) monthly loss of tourism revenue for the Philippines and the impact of the pandemic could last around five to six months based from past experiences from the SARS, H1N1, and the MERS outbreaks. Over 5,200 flights covering two months, which was to be serviced by member airlines of the Air-Carriers Association of the Philippines, were canceled. Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank predicts a ₱111 billion ($2.2 billion) loss in the tourism sector, while the Tourism Congress of the Philippines estimates the figures at around ₱20 billion ($395 million), considering that 12.7% of the Philippines\' GDP is generated through tourism. Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières also reported potential damage in Philippine tourism. \c\cThe National Museum of the Philippines temporarily closed its complex in Manila and all branch museums throughout the country. \c\cThe Philippine Shopping Festival, a nationwide mall sale event backed by the Department of Tourism originally scheduled on March 1–31, 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several local festivals across the country were also either canceled or postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cThe impact of COVID-19 in prisons in the Philippines is projected to be "dangerous," since its jails have the highest occupancy rate in the world that stands at 534%. The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology has temporarily suspended the acceptance of visitors in prisons it manages as early as March 2020, encouraging would-be visitors to avail the e-dalaw service which would allow inmates to communicate with relatives online. \c\cCertain human rights groups raised their concerns on the issue. Human Rights Watch flagged the cases of dying inmates in prison cells and called for the freedom of minor offenders, the elderly, and the ill. Karapatan and KAPATID both called for the release of political prisoners that belongs to vulnerable sector as a way to decongest Philippine jails amidst COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cA group of 22 high-risk prisoners (either of old age, immunocompromised, or pregnant) also asked for temporary liberty due to \'humanitarian grounds\' since "hellish prison conditions in the Philippines make the detainees vulnerable to COVID-19." All of the 22 prisoners, five of which are consultants of New Peoples\' Army (NPA), are asking to be allowed to post bail or to be released under personal recognizance. They are represented by Public Interest Law Center (PILC) and the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL). Similarly, one of the suspects in the death of Horacio "Atio" Castillo III pleaded for freedom under the guise of the COVID-19's threat. \c\cIn mid-April, the Supreme Court (SC) reiterated its 2014 circular, which allows the temporary freedom of "persons deprived of liberty" who were able to serve their minimum penalty during an ongoing trial or those whose trial are paused due to lack of witnesses. Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta and Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra also signed resolutions that relaxes bail prices for indigent inmates and requirements to avail parole and executive clemency. On May 2, Associate Justice Mario Victor Leonen announced that there were 9,731 detainees released temporarily by the SC from March 17 to April 29 as a way to alleviate the country's overcrowding prisons. \c\cThe DOH issued an advisory for the cancellation of large public events and mass gatherings, such as concerts, until further notice to minimize the risk of spreading the disease. This prompted several local and international artists to either cancel or postpone their scheduled concerts and fan meets. \c\cLocal television networks temporarily stopped admitting live audiences for their television shows, including variety shows Eat Bulaga! on GMA Network as well as It's Showtime and ASAP on ABS-CBN. On March 13, both ABS-CBN and GMA announced that they would suspend productions on their drama shows as well as other entertainment programs by March 15, replacing affected programs with reruns of previous series or extended newscast runs. \c\cBroadcast radio companies are also curtailing their operations during the quarantine period, either by shortening their broadcast hours and/or suspending regular programming in favor of "special broadcasts". \c\cThe Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines has issued preventive guidelines against the pandemic through the Catholic Bishops\' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). In January 2020, the CBCP issued a liturgical guideline which urges Mass attendees to "practice ordinarily" the receiving of communion by hand, and avoid holding hands while praying the Lord's Prayer during Mass. As a spiritual measure against the spread of the disease, the CBCP also composed an oratio imperata (obligatory prayer) which is to be recited during Mass. In February 2020, the CBCP issued a second liturgical guideline in anticipation of the Lenten season. The bishops suggested that during Ash Wednesday, ashes would be sprinkled on the faithfuls\' head instead of the customary marking of the forehead with a cross to minimize body contact. The CBCP also urged people to refrain from kissing or touching the cross for veneration during Good Friday, particularly the celebration of the Passion of Jesus. They suggested genuflection or bowing as an alternative to the practice. Dioceses across the country have suspended the public celebration of Masses. On April 8, Holy Wednesday, the CBCP organized an interfaith prayer service against the spread of the coronavirus, which was televised nationwide. \c\cOther Christian denominations and organizations, such as the Iglesia ni Cristo and the Jehovah's Witnesses, have suspended live worship services and resorted to organizing worship services through online platforms. The Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches, an organization composed of Evangelical and Protestant church member organizations in the country, also adopted similar measures. \c\cThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints directed missionaries assigned in the Philippines who are not native to the country to move out for temporary reassignment to another country. They were ordered to self-quarantine in their new homes for 14 days. \c\cThe Islamic community in the Philippines has also adopted measures against COVID-19. The Regional Darul Ifta\' of Bangsamoro suspended all congregational prayers in the Bangsamoro region from March 19 to April 10. \c\cSeveral ongoing or scheduled seasons of sports leagues in the Philippines, such as the ASEAN Basketball League, Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League, Philippine Basketball Association, National Basketball League, Philippines Football League, and Philippine Super Liga, were suspended. Upcoming sporting competitions hosted by the country, specifically the Badminton Asia Championships (initially scheduled to be hosted in Wuhan but was moved to Manila) and the AFF Women's Championship, were postponed. Regional qualification games involving Philippine national teams were likewise postponed. \c\cOn April 29, 2020, the Philippine Sports Commission have announced that they will cancel all of their sporting events until December 2020 to comply with government directives that prohibit mass gathering events. This meant that the Palarong Pambansa in Marikina, the Philippine National Games, and the ASEAN Para Games were all cancelled. \c\cThe Commission on Elections has suspended the nationwide voter registration on March 10 until the end of the month due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The registration period began on January 20, 2020, and is scheduled to run until September 30, 2021. The suspension was later extended to last until the end of April. The issuance of voter's certification is also suspended until further notice. The next national elections scheduled in the Philippines are in May 2022. The plebiscite to ratify legislation that proposes the partition of Palawan into three smaller provinces scheduled for May 2020 was also delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cAfter the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged online regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and various other aspects of the disease. \c\cThe DOH has advised against spreading misinformation and unverified claims concerning the pandemic. The Philippine National Police on their part has taken action against the spread of misinformation related to the pandemic and has warned the public that misinformation purveyors could be charged for violating Presidential Decree no. 90 for "declaring local rumor, mongering and spreading false information". In the case of misinformation circulated online, violators could be charged for violating the Cybercrime Prevention Act which has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act also punishes fake news peddlers of two months jail time or fine of up to ₱1 million. \c\cThe DOH publishes official numbers through its daily case bulletins at 4 pm (PhST). \c\cIn the table below, the general lethality of COVID-19 in the Philippines is presently given around 1.7%, implying around 2 deaths and 98 potential survivors per 100 cases. To compare the three well-known coronavirus diseases, the case fatality rate of the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak was higher at 11%, while that of the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak was much higher at 36%.
A moment magnitude Mw  7.0 earthquake occurred off the coast of Guerrero at 20:47 local time on 7 September with an estimated intensity of VII (Very strong) on the MMI scale. The earthquake occurred on the anniversary of the 2017 Chiapas earthquake which measured Mw  8.2 and killed at least 100 people. \c\cThe earthquake was a thrust faulting event located on or near the subduction zone boundary of the Caribbean Plate and Cocos Plate. Earthquakes of this size according to the U.S. Geological Survey are 40x20 km in rupture size. The earthquake occurred at the southern extent of the Guerrero Gap; a seismic gap capable generating a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. The earthquake was first measured at a magnitude of 7.4 by the USGS, however it was later downgraded to 7.0. The earthquake was relatively shallow, only 12 miles (20 kilometers) below the surface, which would have amplified the shaking effect. \c\cIn Acapulco, just 3 km from the epicenter, a few buildings swayed and were damaged, there were also power outages and many gas leaks reported. According to Héctor Astudillo, the governor of Guerrero, person was killed in Coyuca de Benítez due to a falling pole. \c\cA tsunami measuring 1.2 feet or 0.37 meters was recorded in Acapulco. \c\cThe mayor of Acapulco, Adela Román has urged for residents to remain calm while the situation is being assessed.
Epic Games v. Apple is a current lawsuit brought by Epic Games against Apple in August 2020 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, related to Apple's practices in the iOS App Store. Epic Games specifically had challenged Apple's restrictions on apps from having other in-app purchasing methods outside of the one offered by the App Store. Epic Games\' founder Tim Sweeney had previously challenged the 30% revenue cut that Apple takes on each purchase made in the App Store, and with their game Fortnite, wanted to either bypass Apple or have Apple take less of a cut. Epic implemented changes in Fortnite intentionally on August 13, 2020, to bypass the App Store payment system, prompting Apple to block the game from the App Store and leading to Epic filing its lawsuit. Apple filed a countersuit, asserting Epic purposely breached its terms of contract with Apple to goad it into action, and defended itself from Epic's suit. The trial ran from May 3 to May 24, 2021, with a verdict anticipated later in 2021. \c\cIn a September 2021 ruling in the first part of the case, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers decided in favor of Apple on nine of ten counts, but prohibited Apple from stopping developers from informing users of other payment systems within apps. \c\cEpic also filed another lawsuit, Epic Games v. Google, the same day, which challenges Google's similar practices on the Google Play app store for Android, after Google pulled Fortnite following the update for similar reasons as Apple. However, Google has stressed that the legal situation around their case is not the same around Apple's. \c\cSince as early as 2015, Epic Games\' co-founder and CEO Tim Sweeney had questioned the need for digital storefronts like Valve's Steam, Apple's App Store for iOS devices, and Google Play, to take a 30% revenue sharing cut, and argued that when accounting for current rates of content distribution and other factors needed, a revenue cut of 8% should be sufficient to run any digital storefront profitably. While a 30% revenue cut was an industry standard across computers, consoles, and mobile platforms in 2019, Sweeney stated that higher revenue shares made sense on consoles where "there's enormous investment in hardware, often sold below cost, and marketing campaigns in broad partnership with publishers", but did not extend to open platforms like mobile devices and personal computers. Part of the reasoning for creating the Epic Games Store was to demonstrate that Epic could operate at a lower revenue cut (12%). \c\cAs Fortnite expanded from personal computers to other platforms with the popularity of the Battle Royale mode in 2018, Epic Games sought to bring the free-to-play game to mobile devices. When Epic first released its Android client, it offered it as a sideloaded package rather than as a Google Play store app, as they did not want Google to take any revenue from the microtransactions in the game. However, this resulted in a number of security concerns and numerous unscrupulous clones attempting to pass themselves off as the real Fortnite game in the Google Play store, and by April 2020, Epic discontinued the sideloaded version and placed the game on the Google Play store. As Apple does not allow sideloading on iOS devices, Epic had just released the client on the App Store directly in 2018. \c\cIn mid-2020, Sweeney reiterated his stance on the 30% revenue cut that Apple and Google took, ahead of a large United States Congressional hearing investigating antitrust charges on the Big Tech companies including Google, and during similar investigations of Apple in the European Union. Sweeney said in a July CNBC interview that "Apple has locked down and crippled the ecosystem by inventing an absolute monopoly on the distribution of software, on the monetization of software", and "Google essentially intentionally stifles competing stores by having user interface barriers and obstruction". Sweeney further stated that "If every developer could accept their own payments and avoid the 30% tax by Apple and Google we could pass the savings along to all our consumers and players would get a better deal on items. And you\'d have economic competition." After Apple stated that cloud gaming services like Microsoft's xCloud were not allowed on the iOS platform as they would allow content that bypassed Apple's content review, Sweeney wrote "Apple has outlawed the metaverse. The principle they state, taken literally, would rule out all cross-platform ecosystems and games with user created modes: not just xCloud, Stadia, and GeForce NOW, but also Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox."\c\cApple has argued that the 30% cut it takes "reflects the immense value of the App Store" and beyond the visible features it offers developers, that cut covers "Apple’s technology, tools, software for app development and testing, marketing efforts, platinum-level customer service, and distribution of developers’ apps and digital content." Apple has further argued that it requires iOS apps to use its storefront to "ensure that iOS apps meet Apple's high standards for privacy, security, content, and quality" and avoid exposing iOS users to risks from alternative storefronts. \c\cLegal review of the cases identify the key issue is whether Apple's control of the iOS App Store is a monopoly or not. Epic Games has argued that Apple maintains a monopoly for iOS-enabled devices, and thus its behavior in restricting alternative payment systems and storefronts are anticompetitive. Apple contends that the marketplace that Epic participates in is multiple platforms, not just the iOS, and in that perspective, Apple does not have a monopoly. \c\cIn an interview with CNN, Sweeney stated that Epic planned out a course of action over several months prior to August 2020, codenamed "Project Liberty", aimed to force Apple and Google's hands, either to alter their store policies or to initiate legal action. \c\cOn August 13, 2020, Epic Games updated Fortnite across all platforms, including the iOS and Android versions, to reduce the price of "V-Bucks" (the in-game currency) by 20% if they purchased directly from Epic. For iOS and Android users, if they purchased through the Apple or Google storefront, they were not given this discount, as Epic said they could not extend the discount due to the 30% revenue cut taken by Apple and Google. Within hours, both Apple and Google had removed Fortnite from their storefronts stating the means of bypassing their payment systems violated their terms of service. \c\cEpic immediately filed separate lawsuits against Apple and Google for antitrust and anticompetitive behavior in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Epic retained the legal counsel of Christine A. Varney, formerly lead of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice under the Obama administration, for both cases. As part of the suit against Apple, Epic also released a video called "Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite", parodying Apple's "1984" advertisement using Fortnite assets, which Epic points out in their lawsuit had been used by Apple then to challenge the weight of IBM at the time. In its suit against Apple, Epic accused Apple of antitrust behavior with its practices around the App Store and its payment system, charging that these were in violation of the federal Sherman Act and the California Cartwright Act. In its suit towards Google, Epic challenged Google's past mantra of "Don\'t be evil" and claimed that its practices around the Google Play store and its payment system violate the Sherman Act and California's Cartwright Act. Epic stated that Google's restrictions on the Android system interfered with deals for pre-loading Fortnite on phones from OnePlus and LG. They state in the claim "Notwithstanding its promises to make Android devices open to competition, Google has erected contractual and technological barriers that foreclose competing ways of distributing apps to Android users, ensuring that the Google Play Store accounts for nearly all the downloads of apps from app stores on Android devices."\c\cEpic did not seek monetary damages in either case, but instead was "seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands, if not more, of third-party app developers." In comments on social media the next day, Sweeney said that they undertook the actions as "we\'re fighting for the freedom of people who bought smartphones to install apps from sources of their choosing, the freedom for creators of apps to distribute them as they choose, and the freedom of both groups to do business directly. The primary opposing argument is: \'Smartphone markers can do whatever they want.\' This as an awful notion.[sic] We all have rights, and we need to fight to defend our rights against whoever would deny them."\c\cGoogle, in response to the lawsuit, stated to The Verge that "For game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users. While Fortnite remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available on Play because it violates our policies. However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring Fortnite back to Google Play."\c\cBy August 17, 2020, Apple had informed Epic that it would terminate its access to developers accounts and tools for the App Store and iOS and macOS by August 28, 2020. This led Epic to file a motion for a preliminary injunction to block this as well as prevent Apple from delisting Fortnite from the App Store, asserting that lack of access to the development tools for iOS and macOS would affect Unreal Engine development and subsequently impact all developers that used the engine. Apple stated in response to the request for preliminary injunction that Epic had approached them in June to ask for a special deal for Epic to operate Fortnite on the App Store to allow users to pay Epic directly, and when Apple had failed to grant them this, Epic had contacted them prior to updating the version on August 13, 2020, to state they were willingly going to violate the App Store terms. Apple further requested the court deny Epic the preliminary junction, calling the "emergency" situation one that Epic had created itself. Sweeney stated in response that as his emails in Apple's complaint said, he was looking for Apple to extend to this type of exemption to all iOS developers and not just for Epic Games. Epic filed a response to Apple's complaint with support of Microsoft, specifically asking the court to block Apple from taking away its iOS development tool access as this would impact all developers that have used the Unreal Engine. Microsoft wrote in their support, "Denying Epic access to Apple's SDK and other development tools will prevent Epic from supporting Unreal Engine on iOS and macOS and will place Unreal Engine and those game creators that have built, are building, and may build games on it at a substantial disadvantage."\c\cOn August 24, 2020, after a court hearing Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers granted Epic's request to prevent Apple from taking away its developer licenses for iOS and macOS, but did not grant the preliminary injunction to overturn Apple's decision to remove Fortnite from the iOS store. Rogers wrote that the removal of the developers licenses had "potential significant damage to both the Unreal Engine platform itself, and to the gaming industry generally" and Apple "has chosen to act severely" in threatening that step. On terms of Fortnite, Rogers agreed with Apple that "Epic Games has not yet demonstrated irreparable harm. The current predicament appears of its own making." Subsequently, Apple terminated Epic's iOS developer account on August 28, 2020, thereby preventing the company from uploading further material to the App Store but otherwise still being able to develop for the platform. \c\cPrior to the first hearing on September 28, 2020, Epic filed paperwork ahead of the hearing in which they intend to seek a preliminary injunction to require Apple to rehost Fortnite. \c\cApple filed a countersuit against Epic on September 8, 2020. Apple asserted in their suit that Epic breached their contract and was seeking to block the use of Epic's payment system from any app, including Fortnite, on the iOS storefront, and sought monetary damages to recover funds that Epic had made while their version of Fortnite was active on August 13, 2020. Apple called Epic's suit an attempt "to be part of a marketing campaign designed to reinvigorate interest in Fortnite". Judge Rogers dismissed Apple's monetary claims of theft in November 2020, stating that the claims cannot be considered "independently wrongful" of the breach of contract claims, leaving these breach claims otherwise in place. \c\cAt the first court hearing on the matter on September 28, 2020, Judge Rogers appeared likely to deny Epic's demand to require Apple to rehost Fortnite on the App Store unless they conform to the App Store policy, siding with Apple that Epic had created the situation leading to its removal itself, but otherwise ready to maintain the restraining order related to the Unreal Engine and Epic's developer accounts. Judge Rodgers did speak to looking towards a jury trial for the case, likely to be heard in July 2021, stating during the hearing "I think it's important enough to understand what real people think. Do these security issues concern people or not? Are the concerns of the developers incredibly important? I think many people would feel it is. I do think that this is something for which jury insights would be important."\c\cIn post-hearing filings, both Epic and Apple have argued that the case should proceed via judge hearings and not through jury trials. Judge Rodgers agreed, scheduling a bench trial to commence in May 2021. Subsequent to this scheduling, Judge Rogers denied to grant Epic Games a temporary injunction to require Apple to allow Fortnite in its current state (with Epic's storefront), but made permanent the injunction preventing Apple from terminating Epic's developer accounts such that it can continue to maintain the Unreal Engine for iOS and macOS systems. In her decision, Rogers stated that a key aspect of her review of the case will be Epic's contention that the App Store is unique and their arguments as to why Apple's antitrust behavior is limited to the App Store and not to the other closed systems such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Store or the Nintendo eShop. Rogers said that "a final decision should be better informed regarding the impact of the walled garden model given the potential for significant and serious ramifications for Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft and their video game platforms."\c\cFacebook stated in December 2020 that it will fully support Epic Games in the lawsuit during its discovery phase. Facebook itself had been in prior conflict with Apple over its App Store policies and had amassed its own collection of information they plan to share with Epic. \c\cAs part of its case, Apple had attempted to subpoena records from Valve related to several hundred games and their sales on Steam, given that Steam is a direct competitor to Epic Games's storefront in the personal computer space. Valve declined to comply with these requests, arguing that Apple's requests are overly broad and unrelated to their complaint with Epic. The judge ruled in Apple's favor, stating that Valve was not the only target of Apple's subpoenas seeking similar storefront data, and thus the request was not unreasonable. \c\cThe trial commenced on May 3, 2021. Due to the nature of the case, Judge Gonzalez Rogers required that all parties be physically present at the court, with additional steps made to account for safety due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The trial ran for three weeks, with testimony ending on May 21, 2021 and closing arguments given on May 24, 2021. The law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore represented Epic Games while Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher represented Apple. \c\cAmong aspects covered by the trial included:\c\cEpic Games and Apple discussed whether other apps such as Minecraft and Roblox should be defined as "games" or "metaverses". Though they agreed that Minecraft is a game, they disagreed over how to define Roblox. Epic argued that Roblox, like Fortnite, is a metaverse, while Apple argued that Roblox is a singular game and that games within it are "experiences", comparable to individual worlds within Minecraft. As a result, in May 2021, Roblox immediately altered its branding to remove the word "game" from its website, replacing it with "experience" in an effort to comply with Apple's app store policies. \c\cApple defended its curation of content on the iOS app store, a restriction that had previously prevented cloud gaming services like GeForce Now or Google Stadia from offering a direct app on the iOS store, as each game would require approval by Apple under Apple's rules but would allow for these services to be offered through a progressive web application run through Safari or Chrome. Apple pointed to the recent addition of itch.io, an indie game storefront, to the Epic Game Store, stating that as itch.io lacked any type of moderation of content, this had allowed the Epic Game Store to effectively include a large amount of mature and adult content that was otherwise disallowed by Epic's own store guidelines, while Apple's policies require moderation of app-by-app content to prevent such a situation. Epic pointed out that it only distributed the itch.io client and was not responsible for any of the games that the client itself distributed or sold. \c\cApple's anti-steering policies, which prevent any app from directing or informing its users to a different storefront outside of Apple's iOS one to make purchases, were brought into question as related to potential antitrust charges. Anti-steering policies had been deemed acceptable in practice in the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court case Ohio v. American Express Co. as long as no harm was shown to either side of the two-sided market in considering the absence of anti-steering policies. Epic attempted to argue that with Apple banning developers from directing users to alternative payment systems and storefronts, they were taking a larger share of app revenues, and thus that these anti-steering provisions should be eliminated from Apple's policies. \c\cDuring the trial, a number of documents that were part of evidence collected by Epic and Apple were made public during proceedings, some containing confidential information related to third parties. Some of these documents were meant to be sealed but were instead misplaced into online public court records, and revealed some of the past inner workings of the video game industry, in addition to details on Epic's financials related to the Epic Game Store. This included Epic previously approaching Sony Interactive Entertainment in early 2018 to try to convince them to allow for cross-platform play on the PlayStation consoles; Epic approaching Microsoft to try to get them to allow free-to-play games to be played on the Xbox consoles without the need for an Xbox Live Gold paid subscription; and an unannounced game streaming service planned by Walmart. Judge Rogers took steps after the second day to try to make sure that appropriately sealed documents were kept out of the online public records. \c\cJudge Rogers issued her first ruling on September 10, 2021. Rogers found in favor of Apple on nine of ten counts brought up against them in the case, including Epic's charges related to Apple's 30% revenue cut and Apple's prohibition against third-party marketplaces on the iOS environment. Rogers did rule against Apple on the final charge related to anti-steering provisions, and issued a permanent injunction that, in 90 days from the ruling, prevented Apple from preventing developers from linking app users to other storefronts from within apps to complete purchases. In her decision, Rogers identified that the market of concern was neither games nor Apple's App Store but "digital mobile gaming transactions". Under this market, Judge Rogers concluded that Apple was not a monopoly, and while Apple "enjoys considerable market share of over 55% and extraordinary high profit margins", that type of success was not an illegal monopoly. In this light, Judge Rodgers ruled that Epic had failed to show that Apple violated federal or state anti-trust laws, but ruled that Apple did violate California's competition laws through the anti-competitive behavior of disallowing any mention of other payment systems within apps. \c\cJudge Rogers also ruled against Epic, requiring them to pay Apple $3.6 million in revenue that was withheld to Apple related to their attempts to bypass the App Store, and further stated that Epic did violate its contractual terms as a developer with Apple in how they deployed the update to Fortnite in August 2020 that instigated events such that Apple may block Epic from providing apps to the App Store. \c\cSweeney stated that the decision "isn\'t a win for developers or for consumers", that Epic would not be bringing Fortnite back to iOS until "when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment, passing along the savings to consumers", and that they would continue to litigate on this matter. A representative for Apple stated that "Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law."\c\cCompanies like Facebook, Spotify, and the Match Group supported Epic Games in their lawsuit and spoke of their own past issues with Apple's App Store policies related to their services. Digital Content Next, a non-profit trade group representing media outlets like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, also backed Epic's suit, asserting among other issues that Apple has given out uniquely favorable deals to some providers like Amazon but not to others. \c\cAfter the initial ban, some users attempted to auction iPhones with Fortnite still installed with prices as high as tens of thousands of dollars. By the time the game was actually removed from the App Store, it did not surprise many users as most people were anticipating it from the beginning and it seemed that many players purely jumped "on board for the memes", according to Polygon. In September 2020, Epic Games, together with thirteen other companies launched the Coalition for App Fairness, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores. \c\cOn October 8, 2020, Microsoft announced a commitment to ten fairness principles in the operation of its Microsoft Store on Windows 10, which included promises of transparency over its guidelines, not blocking competing app stores from being used on Windows, and not removing apps from the store based on their business model, how they handle payments, or how their services are delivered. \c\cIn December 2020, Apple announced that they would be lowering the revenue cut Apple takes for app developers making $1M or less from 30% to 15% if app developers fill out an application for the lowered revenue cut. \c\cThe events and initial actions on Epic's lawsuit against Google were brought on the same day as Epic's suit against Apple, but Google stressed the legal situation around their case is far different. Google asserted that the Android operating system does not have the same single storefront restriction as Apple's iOS, and thus allows different Android phone manufacturers to bundle different storefronts and apps as they desire. Google said they are negotiating with Epic Games far differently from Apple in their case. \c\cFollowing a lawsuit filed by 36 states and the District of Columbia over antitrust violations related to the Play Store in early July 2021, Epic amended its claim in the Google suit later that month to reflect information supporting the states\' case. Epic specifically focused on Google's actions when Epic had started working with Samsung to offer Fortnite through their own storefront, with evidence from the states that corroborated anti-competitive behavior. \c\cIn December 2020, Epic Games filed separate complaints against Apple and Google in the United Kingdom's Competition Appeal Tribunal related to the companies\' anticompetitive behavior in both the UK and European Union, with similar charges as Epic asserted in their U.S. cases. They have also launched legal action in Australia, and the European Union. On February 22, 2021, the Competition Appeal Tribunal rejected Epic's lawsuit against Apple in the UK however allowed their lawsuit against Google to proceed. Epic Games later released a statement stating that they would reconsider pursuing their lawsuit against Apple in the UK following the resolution of the US lawsuit while also stated that they were "pleased" with the tribunal's decision regarding their case against Google. \c\cEpic also filed similar charges against Apple in Australia. On April 9, 2021, Judge Nye Perram ordered a 3 month stay on Epic's lawsuit against Apple in Australia while stating that the stay would become permanent in the event Epic does not file in the U.S. but under the Australian Consumer Law within that time frame. Epic appealed Judge Perram's ruling, which was granted in a ruling in July 2021, allowing its case in Australia to go forward. \c\cIn the United States, forty states filed suit against Google in July 2021 arguing its app store practices, including its 30% revenue cut, were anti-competitive, similar to the factors that Epic sought in its case. Later, in August 2021, Senators Richard Blumenthal, Marsha Blackburn, and Amy Klobuchar introduced the "Open App Markets Act" bill, which would prevent app stores from forcing developers from exclusively using the app store's payment system. \c\cIn August 2021, as part of a settlement to a similar class-action lawsuit filed by app developers, Apple announced that it would allow developers to collect information within apps such as email addresses from users so that the developers can subsequently tell customers about ways to pay outside of the App Store. \c\cSouth Korea passed a law in August 2021 amending their Telecommunications Business Act that required app stores like Apple's and Google's to allow app developers to use alternative payment systems other than the storefront, in addition to giving the government more involvement in mediations over app store issues in conflicts between the operators and developers and users. This was the first such law passed at a national level. Epic asked Apple to allow Fortnite onto the Korean version of the store due to this policy in September 2021, but Apple rejected this as the law had yet to come into effect.
Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation to airlift from Afghanistan certain at-risk Afghan civilians, particularly interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants. U.S. personnel also helped NATO and regional allies in their respective evacuation efforts from Hamid Karzai International Airport in the country's capital of Kabul. The operation was concurrent with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans. \c\cSIV applicants were airlifted to the United States, where they were temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their SIV requirements. \c\cThe operation's name was unveiled on 14 July 2021 by the Biden administration. On 22 July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs (ALLIES) Act to increase the visa cap for Afghan interpreters and to expedite the Afghan SIV process.[clarification needed]\c\cOn 30 July, the first group of 221 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing, with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants still to be moved from Afghanistan. \c\cOn 12 August, following continued Taliban victories across Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced that it would deploy 3,000 U.S. troops to Hamid Karzai International Airport to help evacuate embassy personnel, U.S. nationals and SIV applicants. On 13 August, a vanguard of two Marine infantry battalions 1st Battalion 8th Marines and one Army combined-arms battalion TF 1-194 AR MN Army National Guard, arrived in Kabul, with an infantry brigade from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division on standby in Kuwait. Another 1,000 Air Force and Army personnel were to deploy in Qatar to process SIV applicants. Meanwhile, U.S. embassy staff in Kabul were destroying sensitive materials and items featuring embassy logos or U.S. flags, standard procedure during a drawdown. Helicopters shuttled people between the embassy compound and Kabul International Airport. \c\cOn 15 August, following the fall of Kabul—in which Afghan security forces fled the capital and thousands of Afghan civilians fled to the airport in hopes of boarding flights, resulting in chaotic scenes of Afghans attempting to force themselves aboard military planes—the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. U.S. military took control over the security and air traffic control of the airport later in the day. At this point, Operation Allies Refuge became concurrent with a new effort to airlift all SIV applicants, embassy personnel, American nationals, and eligible Afghans seeking to flee the country.[citation needed]\c\cOn 16 August, a C-17 cargo plane, which usually includes less than Army 150 paratroopers, safely evacuated roughly 640 people to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The US Air Force later stated they undercounted the passengers due to not counting children sitting in their parents\' laps on the buses and actually airlifted 823 Afghan civilians, setting a new record for the C-17. The Pentagon confirmed the head of U.S. Central Command, General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., met Taliban leaders based in Qatar's capital Doha. The Taliban officials agreed to terms set by McKenzie for refugees to flee using Kabul Airport. U.S. Army Maj. General William Taylor said that nine C-17s arrived overnight, bringing equipment and 1,000 more troops. Separately, seven C-17s airlifted 700-800 passengers out of the airport, 165 of which were American citizens while the rest were SIV applicants and third country nationals. \c\cOn 17 August, about 1,100 people were evacuated on 13 flights. The White House said more than 3,200 U.S. citizens, permanent residents and refugees were evacuated from the country, and nearly 2,000 Afghan interpreters were flown to the U.S. for SIV processing. On August 18, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said U.S. military flights evacuated about 2,000 people, and said it has processed more than 4,840 people for evacuation. The State Department said the U.S. military has evacuated nearly 5,000 people from the country. On August 19, more than 2,000 people were evacuated on 12 flights. The Pentagon said it has evacuated about 7,000 people from the country. \c\cOn 20 August, about 5,700 people were evacuated on 16 flights. The Pentagon said it has evacuated about 12,700 people from the country. On 21 August, United States Army Major General William D. Taylor announced that 17,000 people have been evacuated in the past few weeks, including 2,500 Americans. The Taliban has at times blocked evacuation efforts made by the United Kingdom\c\cOn 22 August, President Joe Biden said that American troops may remain in Afghanistan past the August 31 deadline. He also announced that 28,000 people have been evacuated since 15 August, and that 33,000 people have been evacuated since July. \c\cAlso on 22 August, the Department of Defense ordered the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation. The current activation is for 18 planes: four from United Airlines; three each from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines and Omni Air; and two from Hawaiian Airlines. Commercial airline pilots and crews would help transport thousands of Afghans who are arriving at U.S. bases in Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. From the bases in the Middle East, the airliners would augment military flights carrying Afghans to Germany, Italy, Spain and other stops in Europe, and then ultimately to the United States. \c\cOn 23 August, United States Army Major General William D. Taylor announced that Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, was ready to receive Afghan evacuees in addition to Fort McCoy, Wisconsin; Fort Bliss, Texas; and Fort Lee, Virginia. Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby said the goal was to be able to receive about 25,000 evacuees in coming weeks. \c\cOn 25 August, Blackwater founder Erik Prince says that he is offering to charge $6,500 for anyone who wanted to evacuate from Kabul. That same day, the total amount of evacuations topped 82,300. \c\cAlthough the Taliban's conquest of the country led to the disintegration of the Afghan Armed Forces, an armed remnant of mostly 500 to 600 Afghan Commandos were at the airport helping U.S. troops provide perimeter security. The Pentagon said these Afghan troops would be evacuated if they desired. \c\cOn 27 August, the Department of Defense announced that three more U.S. military bases will be used to house up to 50,000 Afghan nationals who are applying for SIVs or are deemed "at risk" from the Taliban: Fort Pickett, Holloman Air Force Base and Marine Corps Base Quantico. \c\cOn 5 September, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said that around 100 Americans remain in Afghanistan. Klain said that the Biden administration will look for ways to rescue them. \c\cOn 10 September, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced in a statement that 21 Americans and 11 legal citizens have evacuated from the country. \c\cAs of 26 August, at least 195 people had been killed at or near the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes. The majority were killed by a suicide bombing. \c\cSix people were killed after trying to escape as stowaways: two people were seen falling to their deaths from the sky after clinging to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane, while three people clinging to the side of an Air Force jet were killed after being run over. Remains of another dead Afghan were found in the landing gear of the American C-17, after the pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in a nearby country because they were unable to retract the landing gear. Eleven more civilians died during stampedes at the airport, seven of whom died in a single incident on August 21. At times, the Taliban has fired crowd control shots at the Kabul airport, with some people reported shot and injured from gunfire. Three more people died during gun incidents, including two armed men who fired into a crowd and were killed by U.S. troops, while the other was an Afghan guard killed during a gunfight between Afghan forces and unknown gunmen. \c\cAt least 182 people were killed and more than 200 others were wounded during a suicide bombing attack at the airport on August 26, when evacuations of locals and foreigners were under way. The attack was carried out by Islamic State militants. At least 169 Afghan civilians and 13 US service members were among the killed. The dead Americans were identified as eleven marines, one soldier, and one Navy corpsman. Several more foreign troops and Taliban members were among the injured. Three of the dead Afghan civilians were also British citizens. \c\cOn 2 September, a nine-month old baby died after arriving at the Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, making her the first death of a evacuee on American soil.
This article largely discusses presence of openly lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender and queer bishops in churches governed under episcopal polities. The existence of LGBTQ bishops in the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist and other traditions is a matter of historical record, though never, until recently, were LGBTQ clergy and Bishops ordained by any of the main Christian denominations.  Homosexual activity was engaged in secretly. When it was made public, official response ranged from suspension of sacramental duties to laicization. \c\cThe higher prominence given today to the presence of LGBTQ clergy, including bishops, in the life of the church reflects broader issues, both socially and ecclesiologically (see List of Christian denominational positions on homosexuality), concerning issues of social tolerance and the relationship between social change and doctrinal development. The issue has attracted greater attention in recent years following the development of the gay rights movement, and the increasing discussion within some Christian churches over the inclusion of gay clergy in senior positions. \c\cIt was customary in the past for individuals – whether clergy or not – to remain secretive (in the closet) about their sexual orientation and activity. This was mainly because there was generally low tolerance for homosexuality across society, and those caught faced severe criminal sanctions (often including death). Nor is it straightforward to identify individuals before the 19th century as homosexual or "gay" in the modern sense of the world. \c\cNevertheless, as far back as the sixth century (CE) the Greek chronicler John Malalas wrote about Isaiah, Bishop of Rhodes and Alexander, Bishop of Diospolis in Thracia who had been punished by the Prefect of Thrace (Victor) for "homosexual practices". Isaiah was tortured severely and exiled, while Alexander had his genitals amputated and was subsequently paraded around the city on a litter. As a result the Emperor Justinian decreed that all caught for pederasty should have their genitals amputated. Many homosexual men were arrested in the wake of this, and died from their injuries. An atmosphere of fear followed. \c\cIn the eleventh century, Ralph, Archbishop of Tours in France had his lover Jean installed as Bishop of Orléans in France. Neither Pope Urban II, nor his successor Paschal II took action to depose either man from the episcopacy. \c\cBaldric of Dol (c. 1050 – 1130), abbot of Bourgueil and subsequently Bishop of Dol-en-Bretagne in France, wrote passionate letters to a man simply called "Walter": "If you wish to take up lodging with me, I will divide my heart and breast with you. I will share with you anything of mine that can be divided; If you command it, I will share my very soul."\c\cSeveral of the poems of Marbodius of Rennes (died 1123), Bishop of Rennes in France, speak of handsome boys and homosexual desires although stop short of consummating physical relationships (An Argument Against Copulation Between People of Only One Sex). Poems, such as the one where he sent an urgent demand that his beloved return if he wished the speaker to remain faithful to him, have been interpreted to indicate that more than poetic invention was involved. \c\cAfter the reformation in the Roman Catholic Church, public scandal touched upon the fondness of Cardinal Scipione Borghese (Archbishop of Bologna) for Cardinal Stefano Pignatelli (his likely lover). \c\cIn the 16th century in Italy, Pope Julius III (Bishop of Rome) was rumoured to have a romantic relationship with a teenage boy named Innocenzo. In the 18th century notable examples of emotional and perhaps romantic relationships among bishops include Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart and Giovanni Lercari (the Archbishop of Genoa). \c\cIn the Anglican Communion, John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury in England (1583–1604), formed a close relationship with Andrew Perne while at university in Cambridge. Perne went on to live with Whitgift in his old age. Puritan satirists would later mock Whitgift as "Perne's boy" who was willing to carry his cloak-bag – thus suggesting that the two had enjoyed a homosexual relationship. William Laud (died 1645), also Archbishop of Canterbury, managed homosexual leanings discreetly, but confided his erotic dreams about the Duke of Buckingham and others to a private diary. In the 19th century Cardinal John Henry Newman remained close to Ambrose St. John and was attacked by contemporaries for his "lack of masculinity". The two were buried in the same grave. \c\cJohn Atherton (1598–1640) served from 1634 as Bishop of Waterford and Lismore in the Church of Ireland. In 1640 Atherton was accused of buggery with a man, John Childe, his steward and tithe proctor. They were tried under a law that Atherton himself had helped to institute. They were both condemned to death, and Atherton was executed in Stephen's Green, Dublin. Reportedly, he confessed to the crime immediately before his execution, although he had proclaimed his innocence before that. \c\cIt is in contemporary Anglicanism that the issue of homosexuality and its relationship to people in the episcopate has been confronted openly. Indeed, the first large mainstream church to ever consecrate an openly gay bishop who was not celibate has been the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, a member of the Anglican Communion, who consecrated Gene Robinson diocesan bishop of the Diocese of New Hampshire in 2003. \c\cRobinson was elected bishop coadjutor in 2003 and succeeded as diocesan bishop in March 2004. Before becoming bishop, he served as Canon to the Ordinary to the VIII Bishop of New Hampshire. His sexual orientation was privately acknowledged in the 1970s, when he studied in seminary, was ordained, married, and started a family. He went public with his sexual identity and divorced in 1986. He entered a formal relationship with his second partner, Mark Andrew, in 1988. When delegates to the Episcopal convention were voting on the ratification of his election, it became an issue of controversy. His election was ratified 62 to 45. After his election, many theologically conservative Episcopalians in the United States abandoned the Episcopal Church, formed the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) and aligned themselves with bishops outside the Episcopal Church in the United States, a process called the Anglican realignment. \c\cThere have been documented cases of other openly gay Anglican bishops, however.  The first bishop to come out as gay was the US Episcopal bishop Otis Charles, who did so soon after his retirement in 1993. He subsequently divorced from his wife. He had been a bishop in Utah from 1971 to 1993, and after coming out became vocal in his support for LGBT rights while remaining a member of the Episcopal House of Bishops. In 1999 he was arrested and escorted away in handcuffs after a protest at the Episcopal church national convention against the church's historical treatment of gay people. He went on to legally marry his partner, Felipe Sanchez-Paris in 2008. \c\cMary Glasspool, who is openly gay and lives with her partner of 20 years, was elected as a suffragan bishop in the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles in December 2009 and was consecrated on 15 May 2010. Her election has attracted worldwide attention, including an expression of concern from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. In response to expressions of concern that her election would be viewed as a threat to the cohesion of the Anglican Communion, Glasspool said, "I\'ve committed my life as a life of service to the people of Jesus Christ, and what hurts is the sense that anybody might have that my name or my servanthood could be perceived as divisive." In 2015, Glasspool accepted the invitation to serve the Episcopal Diocese of New York, where she has been serving as an assistant bishop since 2016. \c\cBishop Thomas Shaw of Massachusetts, a celibate monk who previously served as superior of the Society of St. John the Evangelist, discussed his experiences as a gay monk, priest, and bishop in the 2012 documentary Love Free or Die, about Robinson's election. A longtime supporter of the full inclusion of gays and lesbians in the church, he had avoided broaching the subject of his own sexuality because as a monk "he did not want to send the message that, as some conservatives argue, gay people should be celibate." Bp Shaw died of cancer in 2014, one month after his successor was consecrated. \c\cBishop Thomas James Brown was consecrated the 10th bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Maine on 22 June 2019. He is married to Thomas Mousin, who is also an ordained priest in the church. \c\cBishop Bonnie A. Perry was elected to be the 11th Episcopal Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Michigan and ordained on 8 February 2020 at the Ford Community & Performing Arts Center in Dearborn, Mich. Perry will become the first woman bishop as well as the first lesbian bishop in the diocese since it was formed in 1836.  She is married to her partner, Susan Harlow, who is an ordained United Church of Christ pastor. \c\cBishop Deon K. Johnson was elected on 23 November 2019. His ordination will take place on Saturday, 25 April, at St. Stanislaus Polish Catholic Church in St. Louis. He is married to Jhovanny Osorio-Vázquez Johnson. \c\cIn 1993 Peter Ball resigned from his position as Bishop of Gloucester after admitting to an act of gross indecency with a 19-year-old man. \c\cIn 1994 the gay rights campaign group OutRage!, led by Peter Tatchell, began to concentrate on religious homophobia. It was revealed in the press that the new Bishop of Durham, Michael Turnbull, had a conviction for a gay sex offence and OutRage! disrupted his ordination ceremony. There were other bishops known or suspected to be gay in private and OutRage! held a demonstration outside Church House in London naming ten bishops and urging them to "Tell the truth!" Although the ten bishops were not named in the British press, their names were published in an Australian gay newspaper, the Melbourne Star Observer, and has since been published on the internet. They included Timothy Bavin (Bishop of Portsmouth), Brother Michael (Fisher) (assistant bishop, Ely), John Klyberg (Bishop suffragan of Fulham), Michael Marshall (assistant bishop, London), Brian Masters (area Bishop of Edmonton), John Neill (assistant bishop, Bath & Wells), Jack Nicholls (Bishop suffragan of Lancaster), Mervyn Stockwood (assistant bishop, Bath & Wells) and Michael Turnbull (Bishop of Durham). However, OutRage produced no evidence for any of its claims. \c\cAt the same time, Tatchell began a dialogue with the Bishop of London, David Hope, who had not been named as the group thought that he could be persuaded to come out voluntarily. Press stories speculating about the personal sexuality of bishops led Hope to fear the worst and he called a press conference in February 1995 at which he denounced OutRage! for putting him under pressure. While admitting that his sexuality was "a grey area", he had "sought to lead a celibate life" and was "perfectly happy and content". \c\cMervyn Stockwood, who was gay, was bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Southwark, but also celibate. He even gently rebuked a parish priest for initiating the blessing of same-sex unions in the late 1970s.[citation needed]\c\cAppointed as the suffragan Bishop of Edmonton (London) in 1999, Peter Wheatley is gay and has been living with his partner saying that he is "a celibate Christian living by Christian teachings".  This does not appear to have generated any significant controversy.  Bishop Wheatley is opposed to the ordination of women to the episcopate. \c\cIn 2003, Jeffrey John, at the time Canon Chancellor and Theologian of Southwark Cathedral, was chosen to be the Bishop of Reading (a suffragan of the Bishop of Oxford).  John has been in a relationship with another male priest for many years, though he also says that their relationship is celibate. As a result of the ensuing controversy, however, John withdrew his acceptance of the appointment. He was subsequently appointed Dean of St Albans. John again emerged in the debate over gay bishops in July 2010 following widespread media reports that he was the Crown Nomination Commission's preferred candidate for appointment by the Queen as Bishop of Southwark though subsequent reports suggested that this was not the case or that his name had been rejected following leaking of the proposal. \c\cIn 2013, it was announced that the Church of England's House of Bishops had approved plans to allow gay men to become appointed as bishops if they were celibate, including those such as Jeffrey John who are in civil partnerships. \c\cIn 2016, Bishop Nicholas Chamberlain, the bishop of Grantham in the diocese of Lincoln, announced he was gay and in a same-sex partnership becoming the first bishop to do so in the Church of England. \c\cBishop Merwyn Castle was consecrated Bishop of False Bay (a suffragan of the diocese of Cape Town) in 1994, but because most Anglicans outside South Africa were unaware of his homosexuality, and because he was celibate, no comparable controversy took place. The Anglican Church of Southern Africa has no official position on homosexuality. \c\cIn 1995, Bishop Derek Rawcliffe, retired Bishop of Glasgow and Galloway in the Scottish Episcopal Church, disclosed his homosexuality. Like Terry Brown (see below), Rawcliffe had also served as a bishop in Melanesia. \c\cBishop Terry Brown, of Malaita in the Solomon Islands, attended the 1998 Lambeth Conference (which declared same-sex relationships "incompatible with Scripture") as an openly gay man (he also attended the 2008 Lambeth Conference). \c\cBarry Hollowell, who resigned as Bishop of Calgary in the Anglican Church of Canada in 2005, came out publicly in 2008 after the death of his wife, who had been aware of his sexual orientation at the time of his election to the episcopate. In 2016, the Diocese of Toronto elected as a suffragan bishop, an openly gay and partnered priest, Kevin Robertson. He was consecrated on 7 January 2017 as Bishop of York-Scarborough.[citation needed]\c\cBishop Thomas Gumbleton, a retired Catholic bishop in the Diocese of Detroit, has consistently been a supporter of New Ways Ministry and has also called for homosexual priests and bishops to "come out" and be truthful to themselves and others.[citation needed] Gumbleton has acted as a keynote speaker at Call to Action conferences. In 1995 he wore a mitre at a church service on which were symbols of the cross, a rainbow and a pink triangle in solidarity with the gay community. Later, he came into the public eye before the Vatican's Instruction with regard to the ordination of homosexual men was released, arguing against Andrew R. Baker's article on the issue in America. \c\cFrancis Spellman, Cardinal Archbishop of New York, was long rumored to have been gay, according to a book by John Cooney, who said that many whom he interviewed took his homosexuality for granted. In addition, a book published in 1998 claims that during the Second World War, Spellman was carrying on a relationship with a chorus boy in the Broadway revue One Touch of Venus. Spellman defended Senator Joseph McCarthy's 1953 investigations of subversives and homosexuals in the federal government.[citation needed]\c\cArchbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, retired on 24 May 2002 following the revelation that he had used $450,000 in archdiocesan funds to settle a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment. In a statement one week later, he admitted the falsity of his previous assertion that income he had earned outside of his priestly occupation (and turned over to the Church) exceeded the $450,000. In 2009 he confirmed that he was gay, but did not reveal any details of his relationships. \c\cThe auxiliary Roman Catholic Bishop of Cape Town, South Africa,  Reginald Cawcutt,  resigned in July 2002 following allegations that he outed himself as gay on a sometimes-sexually charged website set up for gay priests. Bishop Reginald Cawcutt blamed the scandal on the conservative US organization Roman Catholic Faithful which infiltrated the now closed website, called St. Sebastian's Angels, and traced posting addresses. \c\cIn 2003, Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër was removed from office by Pope John Paul II for alleged sexual misconduct with younger men who were students in his care. Officially, the Pope accepted the resignation letter which Groër had written on the occasion of his 75th birthday. This made Groër, who had adamantly refused to ever comment in public on the allegations, one of the highest-ranking Catholic clerics to become caught up in the sexual abuse scandals. \c\cIn 2005, Juan Carlos Maccarone, the Bishop of Santiago del Estero in Argentina was forced to resign after images were released of him engaged in sexual activity with another man. Suggestion was made that the former state governor Carlos Juarez had been involved in the release after criticism of the governor's human rights record. \c\cFrancisco Domingo Barbosa Da Silveira, the Bishop of Minas in Uruguay, was forced to resign in July 2009, following a gay sex scandal in which he had faced extortion. \c\cIn February 2013, Cardinal Keith O\'Brien, leader of the Catholic Church in Scotland, was forced to resign as archbishop three months ahead of planned retirement because of allegations of inappropriate acts with four priests during the 1980s, but also more recently. O\'Brien had been a vocal critic of the UK Government's plans to introduce same-sex marriage. \c\cIn October 2016, a group in favour of same-sex marriage in Mexico called the Pride National Front (FON) alleged that a number of Catholic leaders were homosexual. The list included Hipólito Reyes Larios, Archbishop of Xalapa in Veracruz. \c\cIn 2008 the gay German priest Horst Gorski was nominated for election as a bishop in the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church, Germany. He lost against Gerhard Ulrich.  In 2015, however, Gorski became the first homosexual to serve as head of office for the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany (VELKD) and Vice-President of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). \c\cIn May 2009 the Diocese of Stockholm in the Church of Sweden elected Eva Brunne as its bishop. She won the vote by 413 votes to 365 and officially succeeded Bishop Caroline Krook in November 2009. Brunne is married to her partner, Gunilla Linden, who is a priest and with whom she has a son. Brunne is believed to be the world's first openly lesbian bishop. \c\cFollowing her appointment, Brunne said: "I am happy and very proud to be part of a church that encourages people to make their own decisions." She added: "Diversity is a big wealth."\c\cIn May 2013, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) elected its first openly gay bishop, Bishop Guy Erwin, to office as the bishop of the Southwest California Synod. \c\cIn 2015 the Church of Sweden elected Mikael Mogren as bishop of Västerås, and thus got their first openly gay male bishop. He came out publicly as gay in one of his books published in 2013, without much public attention to the fact neither then nor at the time of his election. In one of the interviews following the election that mentioned his orientation, Mogren explained that he is "not a single-issue party". \c\cAlso in 2015, bishop Kevin Kanouse, a bishop in the ELCA, came out as gay. \c\cOn May 8, 2021, Sierra Pacific Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) elected the Reverend Doctor Megan Rohrer the first openly transgender bishop, the first in any major Christian denomination. They were installed September 11, 2021. \c\cIn 2016, the Western Jurisdiction of the United Methodist Church elected its first openly gay and partnered bishop. Before being elected, Bishop Karen Oliveto had served as senior pastor of Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco. Earlier in 2016, the New York Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church had ordained the denomination's first openly LGBTQ clergy. At the United Methodist Church's General Conference, the delegates voted in favour of a motion to defer the issue of human sexuality to the Council of Bishops to reexamine the Book of Discipline. On 7 May 2018 the Council of Bishops in the United Methodist Church proposed allowing individual pastors and regional church bodies to decide whether to ordain LGBT clergy and perform same-sex weddings, though this proposal can only be approved by the General Conference.
The Panjshir conflict is an ongoing armed conflict between the formerly dominant Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the National Resistance Front and other groups, and the newly dominant Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is controlled by the Taliban. On 17 August 2021, Amrullah Saleh assumed the Afghan presidency and declared the resistance. On 26 August, a brief ceasefire was declared. On 1 September, talks broke down and fighting resumed as the Taliban attacked resistance positions. \c\cAs of 3 September 2021[update], in addition to the opposition in the Panjshir, there are also districts in the centre of Afghanistan that are still in resistance against the Taliban, supported by ethnic and religious minorities. \c\cOn 6 September, the Taliban took control of most of the Panjshir province, with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains to continue fighting within the province. \c\cHistorically, the Panjshir Valley was known for its natural defences. Surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, Panjshir never fell to the Soviets during the invasion of the 1980s nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the early 1990s. In the war of 1996–2001, Panjshir was a center of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. In these conflicts, Panjshir was under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Massoud who was killed by a suicide bomber in 2001. Soon after, the United States invasion of Afghanistan resulted in the overthrow of the previously dominant, Taliban-led Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the eventual establishment of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Massoud and his family remained highly respected in Panjshir in the next two decades. \c\cThe traditional anti-Taliban sentiment of the Panjshiris has an ethnic dimension: A majority of the population of the Panjshir Valley are ethnic Tajik people, while the majority of the Taliban are Pashtuns. However, these ethnic differences became less pronounced in course of the Taliban insurgency, as the Taliban began to recruit Tajiks into their ranks. \c\cIn 2021, the Taliban overran most of Afghanistan in a lightning offensive; Panjshir Province was the only area which was able to resist until the offensive's conclusion. However, the valley's ability to withstand future Taliban assaults was hampered by it being cut off from outside support. In the 1980s and 1990s, Panjshir's forces had been able to keep supply lines to Tajikistan open. These were not accessible in the 2021 conflict, as the Taliban had successfully taken most of northern Afghanistan. Regardless, the former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan initially continued to exercise de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which was described by the The Week as "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands" as of August 2021. Former loyalists to the old republic fled to Panjshir, hoping to transform it into an anti-Taliban stronghold. \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Saleh—citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan—declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi along with the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Dushanbe. On 23 August 2021, Massoud made contact with unnamed American lawmakers. \c\cPrior to the fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, including commandos, ex-Mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and other anti-Taliban activists. Most of them regrouped at Baghlan Province's Andarab District before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan. According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid August 2021. Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms. By 22 August 2021, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a "handful of armoured humvees" in the valley. \c\cThere are differences between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan which was supportive of the Taliban. As a result, Massoud was more willing to negotiate with the Taliban. By 22 August, the resistance also confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban on their own, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. According to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to five helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. \c\cOn 23 August, it was reported that BM-21 Grads were acquired as a part of its arsenal. \c\cAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the US Military Academy made prior to the fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars. Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial materiel of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. The Taliban remain a movement consisting of many different sub-groups whose aims, strategies, beliefs, and loyalties vary. \c\cAround 17 August 2021, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud, along with local civilians who had responded to his mobilization calls. At the time, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—"under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. On 18 August, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anaba in Panjshir. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training. \c\cOn 17 August, a negotiated end to the political impasse had been attempted, with Saleh calling for a "peace deal" with the Taliban. On 18 August, the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government was raised by a top Afghan diplomat as a means of ending the stalemate. \c\cOn 18 August, local sources from Parwan Province reported that Saleh's forces had taken Charikar from Taliban fighters stationed in the area. In addition, there are reports of gunfights taking place near Salang Pass. On the following day, videos were released which showcased local fighters with flags of the old, anti-Taliban Northern Alliance parading through the streets of Charikar. \c\cOn 20 August, anti-Taliban fighters reportedly recaptured Andarab, Puli Hisar and Dih Salah districts in Baghlan Province with the Taliban claiming 15 of its soldiers had been killed, while other sources reported that up to 60 Taliban fighters were killed or injured, and two dozen captured. The three districts had reportedly experienced a revolt, led by a local police chief, after Taliban had conducted unpopular house-to-house searches. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi announced the operational success of the districts being recaptured via Twitter. \c\cAudiovisual reports of the events circulated on social media and were reported by Pajhwok Afghan News. Later on the 20th, it was reported that the forces, led by Abdul Hamid Dadgar, had recaptured Andarab, though the Taliban had not yet commented. \c\cOn 21 August, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to "discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans". \c\cA source within the Panjshir resistance consequently confirmed their involvement in the operations in Baghlan Province, and stated that they planned on seizing a northern highway which could allow them to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Taliban social media accounts called the counteroffensive a "betrayal" of the amnesty the Taliban had offered. It was reported on 22 August 2021 that Taliban fighters had been sent to the Keshnabad area of Andarab in order to kidnap the children of anti-Taliban forces. \c\cOn 22 August, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possibly mediate. Meanwhile, resistance spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary informed the Agence France-Presse that Ahmad Massoud's group would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implemented a system of "decentralisation" and "equal rights" across the country. On 23 August, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that while Taliban fighters are being sent to Panjshir, the Taliban are willing to seek peaceful means to end the conflict. \c\cAlso, the Islamic Emirate gave the opposition forces a four-hour ultimatum to surrender. In a statement to Al Arabiya, Massoud rejected the ultimatum. In response, the IEA announced "hundreds" of its forces had been dispatched to the Panjshir Valley. It was reported on 23 August that talks between Taliban representatives and Panjshir leaders did not work. Ali Maisam Nazary, spokesman for the resistance, said that the Taliban made demands for Massoud to accept no elections with a centralized government, which Massoud rejected as he wanted a future government to be decentralized, with respect for civil and semi-autonomy rights. \c\cAn unidentified Taliban spokesperson proclaimed in a statement that "hundreds of Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate are heading towards the state of Panjshir to control it, after local state officials refused to hand it over peacefully". It was reported that on 23 August, Taliban commander Qari Fashihuddin was tasked to lead offensive operations in Panjshir. The Taliban reported that several of their fighters were killed and others wounded in ambushes in Jabal Siraj. \c\cOn 23 August, the Taliban claimed to have recaptured all 3 districts in Baghlan that fell to the resistance forces a week ago: Dih Salah District, Pul-e-Hisar and Andarab. A Taliban district chief stationed in Andarab was reported to be killed in the fighting. On 24 August, Panjshir resistance fighters reportedly retook control of Banu and Dih Salah districts, while Puli Hisar remained under Taliban control. Saleh publicly warned via Twitter that Taliban fighters in Andarab were blocking humanitarian assistance for civilians trying to escape from the fighting and called it a "humanitarian disaster". On the following day, Massoud's forces claimed to have ambushed a Taliban convoy in Andarab, destroying a critical bridge and inflicting heavy losses on the Islamists. \c\cOn 24 August, Major Wazir Akbar, an ex-Afghan commando who joined the Panjshir-based resistance fighters, reported an attempted Taliban incursion at Anjuman Pass through Badakhshan province, which was repelled with heavy Taliban casualties. \c\cOn 26 August 2021, a ceasefire was declared with the Taliban and the resistance entering into talks. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that he was "80 percent confident of a solution without war in the Panjshir Valley". On 29 August, Panjshir representatives stated that there were no Taliban fighters trying to enter Panjshir, refuting information from Anaamullah Samangani, who is a member of the Taliban's Cultural Commission. On 1 September, it was reported that ceasefire talks failed. \c\cOn 26 August, according to a video published by Global Defense Corp, heavy fighting broke out between anti-Taliban resistance group in Panjshir Valley and Taliban. More than 200 Taliban fighters were driven out the Panjshir Valley and some were captured by anti-Taliban resistance group. The National Resistance Front (NRF) has also captured Pol-e-Hesar, Deh Salah and Banu districts. \c\cOn 28 August, Panjshir fighters engaged Taliban fighters in Sanjan, Kapisa and in Khost Wa Fereng, Baghlan in response to allegations of ceasefire violations conducted by Taliban fighters in the area. \c\cOn 29 August, internet and telecommunication services throughout Panjshir province were shut down on orders from the Taliban. \c\cOn 30 August, Panjshir fighters ambushed Taliban fighters attempting to break into Panjshir from Andarab. \c\cOn 31 August 2021, Taliban fighters commenced an offensive against the National Resistance Front in the provinces of Baghlan, Panjshir, and Parwan. Anti-Taliban sources claimed that the offensive involved al-Qaeda troops, a statement backed by videos in which pro-Taliban fighters were heard speaking non-native or locally uncommon languages such as Arabic. Sources reported that the offensive started when Taliban fighters were spotted entering Gulbahar and blocked the main road with a container. Taliban forces retook Dih Saleh District in Baghlan, allowing them to directly attack Panjshir. An initial Taliban assault through Khawak Pass connecting the Baghlan and central Panjshir Provinces failed. NRFA spokesperson Fahim Dashty said that the attack was likely done to test the area's defenses. Taliban troops also began to attack southern Panjshir from Gulbahar, resulting in heavy fighting. Despite being numerically superior to the defenders, the Taliban failed to break through. \c\cOn 1 September, a day after clashes at the entry points of the valley were reported, Mullah Amir Khan Motaqi, the head of the Taliban's commission for guidance & encouragement stated over a twitter audio message to the people of Panjshir that attempts at reaching a negotiated settlement were "unfortunately all in vain." He lay the blame with the leadership of the resistance in Panjshir, saying there are still some people in the valley who "don\'t want the problems to be solved peacefully." He went on to say that Taliban has selected a native of the province as their desired governor. Despite the Taliban shutdown of Panjshir's internet, Fahim Dashti, the spokesperson for the Panjshir Resistance managed to conduct an interview with BBC Persian, in which he stated that the negotiations failed because of a fundamental difference of goals between the two sides. According to him, Panjshir resistance had the intention of extracting commitments and guarantees protecting freedoms and human and political rights of ethnic and religious minorities as well as women, but Taliban's goal in the negotiation was not to negotiate such guarantees, but to negotiate the extent of participation of the Panjshir opposition in a Taliban-led government that would satisfy the resistance. \c\cOn 2 September, Panjshir sources claimed that 13 Taliban fighters were killed in an ambush in Chikrinow district. Even though the offensive had stalled by this point, a Taliban spokesman said the valley was surrounded by all four directions and that a Panjshir resistance \'victory was impossible\' as well as claiming Taliban territorial gains. Meanwhile, the Taliban claimed to have pushed into the Shotul district of Panjshir, but provided no firm proof for this claim. Analysts[who?] judged that the Taliban had probably advanced for a short time before being pushed back again. A minor Taliban attack on Anjuman Pass in northern Panjshir was reportedly easily repelled by Afghan commandos. In addition, local anti-Taliban forces from Andarab claimed to have retaken the crucial Khawak Pass. \c\cMeanwhile, revolts had erupted in Wardak Province and Daikundi Province which are home to many Hazaras, an ethnic group which had been previously discriminated against by the Taliban. The Taliban had begun reaching out to the Hazara community in the months leading up to their takeover, promising to respect their rights and traditions. Accordingly, the situation in Wardak and Daikundi is complex, as local militia leaders had aided the Taliban takeover despite the disapproval of much of the population. In Daikundi's Khadir District, a revolt erupted as the pro-Taliban Hazara commander Muhammad Ali Sedaqat was ordered to disarm locals, with some fearing that the disarmament was not properly recorded and would expose locals to harassment by the Taliban. Fighting consequently broke out between the Taliban, pro-republic Hazaras, and pro-Taliban Hazaras. Local militias began to ambush Taliban troops. \c\cOn 3 September, the Taliban claimed to have captured Panjshir valley, however these claims were described as lies and propaganda by the local resistance leaders such as Saleh as well as international spectators. A NRF spokesperson stated that the situation was "difficult", but also that a Taliban push into the valley had resulted in the encirclement of a few hundred Taliban fighters. By the following day, heavy fighting was confirmed to be still continuing in the valley, with Paryan District reportedly being contested. An Italian medical aid organisation operating in the area confirmed that the Taliban had advanced up to Anaba; the Taliban claimed to have seized the districts of Khenj and Unabah. The NRF countered by claiming that they had managed to encircle even more Taliban troops, now numbering thousands, at Khawak Pass and Dashte Rewak. On 5 September, both sides achieved some successes: The NRF was able to force hundreds of encircled Taliban fighters to surrender in the valley, with the NRF claiming to have captured up to 1,500. In turn, local journalists confirmed that the Taliban had taken both Rukha and Paryan Districts, while NRF spokesman Fahim Dashty was killed in combat. The Taliban also claimed to have advanced into Panjshir's capital Bazarak. A The Times reporter who accompanied the Taliban testified that much of the valley appeared to be under Islamist control at this point, although groups of NRF fighters continued to strike at the Taliban behind the frontlines. Massoud reacted to the Taliban advance by declaring on Facebook that he was endorsing offers by local religious leaders to negotiate a peaceful solution of the conflict. Pakistani journalist and regional expert Ahmed Rashid argued that the Taliban had clearly expressed that they would not "tolerate what [Massoud is] asking for, which is a semi-autonomous region in the Panjshir Valley". The Taliban leadership indeed rejected Massoud's negotiation offer, stating that it would only accept the NRF's surrender. \c\cOn 6 September, after heavy fighting resulting in high losses on both sides, the Taliban captured the governor's office in Bazarak, and claimed control of the whole Panjshir Valley. The remaining NRF troops had reportedly retreated into the mountains, with the Taliban stating that many had fled the region. An NRF official then claimed Massoud was at a safe location, while Saleh escaped to Tajikistan. Ali Nazary, head of foreign affairs for the resistance group, said that Ahmed Massoud was still present inside Afghanistan. The NRF contested the Taliban's conquest of Panjshir, arguing that resistance fighters were still present in strategic positions in the valley, continuing their fight. \c\cBy 7 September, many civilians from Panjshir Valley had fled into the mountains to escape the Taliban, while Massoud made defiant statements and called for a large-scale, nation-wide uprising. The Panjshir locals were also threatened by starvation, as local supply remained cut-off. The remaining NRF troops were reportedly still resisting the Taliban in some areas. The NRF also claimed that the Taliban had begun to massacre local civilians. \c\cAs of 9 September, OSINT evidence analyzed by Bellingcat researchers shows that the Taliban continue to advance, and control territory at least 60 kilometres (37 mi) into the valley. The Taliban has placed the valley under siege, not allowing journalists or goods to enter, so the extent of their control is difficult to surmise. Panjshir residents who were able to reach Kabul warned that supplies in the province are being exhausted due to the blockade. NRF leader Ali Nazary claimed that the Taliban had not conquered all of Panjshir, but only the main road, which allowed them to capture nearby Bazarak as well. He stated that the resistance forces had made a tactical withdrawal from the main road, while retaining 60–65% of the sub-valleys and strategic positions under their control. Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, meanwhile stated that Massoud and Saleh were still in Afghanistan but incommunicado for security reasons and had not fled to Tajikistan, contrary to earlier reports. \c\cBy 10 September, the Taliban had captured the residence where Saleh had earlier been hiding and aired his latest video claiming he was still in Panjshir, with photos of a Taliban fighter posing at the same spot where Saleh had recorded the video, being posted on social media. A three-day ceasefire was reported to be in effect, although not confirmed by any side. National Congress Party leader Abdul Latif Pedram meanwhile told TOLO News that NRF forces were present in all mountains of Panjshir. NRF commander Saleh Rigistani vowed that their forces will continue fighting, and added that the province was facing a shortage of food and medicinal supplies. Taliban Cultural Commission member Anaamullah Samangani however claimed that the NRF had no "public presence" in Panjshir and were hiding in caves and valleys, with talks for their surrender ongoing. Residents meanwhile complained that roads in Panjshir were blocked, while electricity and telecommunications were shut. \c\cA tribal elder meanwhile stated on 10 September that the Taliban was blocking food supplies and carrying out extrajudicial executions of civilians, adding that eight civilians were reportedly killed by them on 7 September. Ahmad Wali Massoud also accused the Taliban of killing civilians and stated that the NRF still controlled "major areas" in Panjshir. Saleh's son Shuresh stated on 11 September that his father's brother Rohullah Azizi, who had been fighting for the resistance, had been executed alongside his driver on 9 September by the Taliban, after being stopped at a checkpoint in Khanez village of Panjshir. \c\cAlso on 11 September, Tasnim News Agency reporters were allowed into Panjshir. They met with a group of Red Unit Taliban fighters who claimed that all of Panjshir was captured and resistance forces may have taken shelter in nearby mountainous areas. They also claimed that the situation was calm despite the expiration of the reported ceasefire. Many civilians were seen fleeing the area fearing of renewed clashes. Reporters also interviewed a NRF supporter who blamed the Taliban for not establishing an inclusive government. He also claimed that the Pakistan Air Force had helped the Taliban. \c\cAn investigative report published by BBC on 13 September found that the Taliban had executed at least 20 civilians in Panjshir since they entered the valley. \c\cAs of 23 August 2021, there was no public support for the resistance from the international community. At the start of the conflict, the US and other potential allies were focused on the concurrent Kabul airlift, which required the Taliban's cooperation. Massoud's op-ed in The Washington Post requesting Western support may be evidence of a lack of enthusiasm (for the resistance) in the US government. \c\cOn 21 August, former Indian Chief of the Army Staff Shankar Roychowdhury said that the Government of India must reach out to Panjshir-based resistance forces alongside Taliban factions that may be friendly to India. \c\cOn 25 August 2021, Bilal Y. Saab, an ex-Pentagon senior advisor, and Mick Mulroy, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, Marine veteran and ex-CIA Special Activities Center operator, argued in a Time editorial that Washington DC should provide support in Afghanistan by allowing the CIA to station its officers with counterterrorism responsibilities to secretly assist anti-Taliban resistance groups. \c\cOn 27 August, Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan have volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it can be deemed illegal. \c\cIn an interview made on 2 September, Erika Simpson, president of the Canadian Peace Research Association, said that it was potentially risky for a country to publicly support the resistance from inside Afghanistan and suggested that it was better to support anti-Taliban resistance groups based overseas. \c\cOn 6 September, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh strongly condemned the Taliban assault on the Panjshir Valley. The spokesman also condemned all foreign interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs, indirectly suggesting Pakistani involvement in Afghanistan. On 10 September, a road named Panjshir Alley in Tehran was officially named and approved by the Tehran City Council. \c\cPakistan's Interior minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad on 1 September said in an interview with Hum News that "All top Taliban leaders were born and brought up in Pakistan. This has been our 'service\' that we trained them and many more might be studying."\c\cAccording to an India Today report, the former Samangan MP Zia Arianjad said on 6 September that defending resistance forces had been bombed by drones of the Pakistan Air Force using smart bombs and claimed that Pakistan's special forces assisted the Taliban in attacking the resistance. The Week cited defence analyst Babak Taghvaee and Panjshir governor Kamaluddin Nezami stating that drones had attacked the NRF, with Taghvaee attributing responsibility to the Pakistani Air Force. These claims of Pakistan support were denied by both the Taliban and Pakistan. \c\cNRF officials said that journalist and NRF spokesperson Fahim Dashti was killed on 6 September in Anaba district in a clash including an attack by Pakistan Air Force drones. A statement released by the Tajik Embassy in Germany on 8 September suggested that the Taliban received some help from unnamed countries to bomb Panjshir. \c\cJournalists Carlotta Gall and Adam Nossiter wrote in The New York Times that the international community would be in a bind if they showed some form of support for the resistance because of the airlift operations. Abdul Matin Beyk suggested that other anti-Taliban forces are waiting to see if the Panjshir-based fighters will either resist to the end or keep considering negotiations from Taliban representatives. He suggests that their successes can inspire others to do the same. \c\cAnalysts Bill Roggio and Andrew Tobin speculated that the eventual success of the Taliban offensive against the Panjshir Valley might have been related to the previous attempts of the NRF to expand into neighboring districts. Accordingly, the NRF would have been overextended and had not prepared its defenses well enough.
Since January 2001, multiple drone strikes have been conducted by the United States government in Afghanistan. These strikes began during the administration of the United States President George W. Bush. During the presidency of Donald Trump, it was estimated that drone strikes had multiplied at a pace of four to five times compared with previous presidency of Barack Obama. In 2016, Obama ordered the CIA to report civilian drone strike deaths, an order which was revoked by Trump. \c\cBy 2021, there had been a total of at least 13,074 airstrikes conducted by the US government, killing at least 4,138 people, including 310 civilians and 73 children. Besides the US government, the Afghan Air Force (AAF) also carried out air strikes in Afghanistan. Since 1 June 2016, the AAF has conducted at least 41 strike capable operations. \c\c1 January 2015: One unknown killed in a US drone strike Spera District Khost Province. \c\c3 January 2015: Twenty-five were killed in two separate drone strikes, one at Gayan District Paktika province killing eighteen and the other at Spera District Khost Province killing seven. \c\c7 January 2015: Three reported killed in the eastern part of Logar Province. \c\c8 January 2015: Six reported killed and three injured in a US air strike at Chikanawr area, Lal Pura District, Nangarhar Province. \c\c11 January 2015: Eight killed and three injured at Chikanawr area, Lal Pura District, Nangarhar Province. \c\c16 January 2015: Three killed at Nazyan District, Nangarhar Province. \c\c17 January 2015: One unknown killed or injured at Lal Pura District, Nangarhar Province. \c\c19 January 2015: One unknown killed or injured at Khogyani District, Nangarhar Province. \c\c29 January 2015: Four killed at Nazyan District, Nangarhar Province. \c\c2 January 2016: Five former Pakistani Taliban (TTP) fighters who pledged alliance to ISIL, including the former TTP commander in Bajaur tribal agency in Pakistan, Abu Bakr, were killed by a US drone strike, further injuring two militants in the Shaltan Darra area, located in the Shegal district, located in the Kunar province. \c\c5 January 2016: A US Special Forces soldier, Army Staff Sgt.

A further 30 ISIL militants were injured, including 14 civilians. \c\c1 January 2018: Twenty-six people, including foreigners and prominent ISIL commanders, were killed by a possible US strike in the village of Saradara and Alkhani in the Darzab district. Some victims included famous militant commander Qari Zia aka Shuja, and two other prominent militants, Yaqub and Shaikh, a judge. There were also possible civilian casualties. \c\c1 January 2018: A possible US strike killed seven Taliban fighters in the Bati Kot district. A second strike killed two members of ISIL's Afghan branch in Achin District. \c\c5 January 2018: A possible US strike killed 10 ISIL militants in a training camp in Nangarhar's Haska Mena district while they were in training. Two compounds belonging to ISIL were also destroyed, leaving five militants dead.

Two were killed, who were described by Pentagon spokesman John Kirby as "high-profile ISIS targets" and "planners and facilitators"; the third occupant of the vehicle was injured. The airstrike was carried out a day after an attack at Kabul Airport, which had resulted in the death of more than 180 people. \c\c29 August: A U.S. airstrike targeted a vehicle in Kabul a few kilometres from the airport, which U.S. officials falsely stated was carrying ISIS-K bombers but was actually driven by aid worker, Zemari Ahmadi who worked for U.S. based Nutrition and Education International. Ahmadi had loaded bottles of water into his trunk for his family and for his neighbors, which a New York Times investigation suggested had been mistakenly identified by the U.S. military as explosives, prompting the fatal airstrike. Water deliveries had stopped in his neighborhood following the collapse of the government. US officials initially claimed the vehicle had visited an alleged ISIS safe house and that secondary explosions had occurred after the airstrike, but no evidence of a secondary explosion was found at the site, and the location that the drone had tracked Ahmadi to, where he and three others had loaded bottles of water into his trunk, was the office of Nutrition and Education International, and not an ISIS-K safe house as the U.S. had alleged. Ten family members were killed in the airstrike at their home, including seven children and Ahmadi. Some of those killed had previously worked for international NGOs and held visas allowing them entry to the United States. The Pentagon later acknowledged that Ahmadi and vehicle he was driving posed no threat and that there was no connection between Ahmadi and ISIS-K. \c\cThe United States government has faced great criticism owing to the number of civilian casualties and many killed being unintended targets. Amnesty International USA has also questioned the legality of drone attacks.
The Justice for J6 rally was a pro-Donald Trump demonstration that occurred on September 18, 2021, in support of hundreds of people who were arrested and charged following the United States Capitol attack (which took place on January 6). The event was organized by Matt Braynard. \c\cIn August, a rally titled "Justice for J6", organized by Look Ahead America (a nonprofit led by former Trump campaign staffer Matt Braynard), was scheduled to be held on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol starting at 12:00 p.m. ET on September 18. The rally is intended as a show of support for people charged for participating in the attack. Lawmakers and law enforcement officials expressed their concerns over possible unrest at the rally. \c\cIn response to the rally's announcement, the Metropolitan Police Department was activated for September 18. There were also discussions about restoring the fencing surrounding the Capitol, though they were initially met with bipartisan disapproval. It was unclear how many people planned to attend the event. \c\cA counter-rally was subsequently scheduled on the same day, heightening concerns over participants of both events clashing. The Department of Homeland Security shared an intelligence briefing memo to state and local law enforcement agencies, which warned of potential violence at the rally and on the day before. The memo did not identify a specific or credible plot associated with the event, but it also warned that individuals and small groups can "mobilize to violence with little-to-no warning, particularly in response to confrontational encounters with perceived opponents or calls for escalation by key influencers."\c\cThe protective fencing was restored around the Capitol by September 13, and multiple congressional offices were slated to close on September 17. \c\cBraynard downplayed the estimated size of the rally and criticized the security measures established in response to the event, saying they were designed to discourage and deter participants. In response to the planned rally, Former U.S. President Donald Trump called it a "setup" for Republican voters, saying, "If people don\'t show up they\'ll say, \'Oh, it's a lack of spirit.\' And if people do show up they\'ll be harassed." Republicans have distanced themselves from the demonstration. On social media, far-right groups like the Proud Boys were urging members not to attend the event. \c\cAmong the small crowd of around 400 to 450 people, at least four people were arrested. One man arrested at the event was found to be in possession of a knife, while another was found to be in possession of a gun.
Cannabis in Italy is legal for medical and industrial uses, although it is strictly regulated, while it is decriminalized for recreational uses. In particular, the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use is a misdemeanor and it is subjected to fines, as well as the suspension of personal documents (e.g. passports and driver's licenses). Nevertheless, the unauthorized sale of cannabis-related products is illegal and punishable with imprisonment, as is the unlicensed cultivation of cannabis, although recent court cases have effectively established the legality of cultivating cannabis in small amounts and for exclusively personal use. The licensed cultivation of cannabis for medical and industrial purposes requires the use of certified seeds, however there is no need for authorization in order to plant certified seeds with minimal levels of psychoactive compounds (a.k.a. cannabis light). \c\cA 1914 USDA report described the Italian hemp as the highest-priced hemp fiber in both the American and European markets, noting that it was obtained from plants similar to those cultivated in Kentucky at the time. The cause of the higher price was attributed to water retting and to increased care and labor in the preparation of the fiber. The report identified four main varieties of hemp being cultivated in Italy:\c\cthe Bologna, (a.k.a. great hemp or chanvre de Piedmont in France), was cultivated in the provinces of Bologna, Ferrara, Rovigo, and Modena, with plants averaging nearly 12 feet (i.e. 3.66 m) in height in the local rich alluvial soil, while ranging between 8 and 11 feet (i.e. 2.44 and 3.35 m) in height when grown in test sites in Washington, D.C. and Lexington, KY;\c\cthe Canapa piccola, (a.k.a. small hemp), was cultivated in the Arno valley in Tuscany, with plants ranging between 4 and 7 feet (i.e. 1.22 and 2.13 m) in height locally, while ranging between 4 and 6 feet (i.e. 1.22 and 1.83 m) in height in the test sites;\c\cthe Neapolitan, large seeded variety, was cultivated in the vicinity of Naples and even on the sides of Mount Vesuvius, with plants ranging between 7 and 10 feet (i.e. 2.13 and 3.05 m) in height in the test sites;\c\cthe Neapolitan, small seeded variety, was cultivated in the same area of the large seeded variety, with plants rarely exceeding 4 feet (i.e. 1.22 m) in height in the test sites. \c\cIn the 1940s, Italy was believed to be the second-biggest producer of industrial cannabis in the world, after the Soviet Union, although statistics from China, another major producer, are not available. According to the national farmers association Coldiretti, almost 100 thousand hectares (i.e. 1000 km2) of farmland in Italy were dedicated to the production of cannabis at the time. The decline of hemp production in Italy came with the economic boom of the 1950s and 1960s, during which time synthetic fibers were introduced into the market and the international campaign against narcotics intensified. In particular, Italy endorsed all the three major drug control treaties, namely the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988, and soon after the passage of the anti-drug Cossiga Law 685/75 of 1975, hemp fields in Italy all but disappeared. \c\cIn recent years, hemp production for medical and industrial purposes has seen a resurgence in Italy thanks to new technologies and innovative applications involving cannabis plants. In particular, hundreds of new businesses started growing cannabis in several Regions after looser requirements came into force in 2016 regarding the cultivation of cannabis plants with levels of THC below 0.2% (a.k.a. cannabis light), with the estimated cultivation area increasing from 400 hectares in 2013 to almost 4000 hectares (i.e. 40 km2) in 2018. \c\cIn 1993, the Radical Party led by Marco Pannella successfully put forward a referendum that repealed criminal penalties for the personal use of soft drugs. However, the controversial Fini-Giovanardi Law 49/06 removed the distinction between hard and soft drugs in 2006, and until it was struck down by the Constitutional Court in 2014 the possession of marijuana and hashish was punishable as harshly as the possession of heroin or cocaine. In particular, the law tripled sentences for selling, cultivating, and possessing cannabis from 2–6 years to 6–20 years, leading to prison overcrowding, with 40% of inmates being jailed for drug-related crimes, although cannabis consumption was not criminalized. \c\cAt present, the possession of cannabis for personal use is decriminalized and subjected to fines and the confiscation of personal documents like passports and driver's licenses, while its unlicensed cultivation and sale are still illegal and punishable with imprisonment, although there have been cases in which followers of the Rastafari religion have been acquitted of possession charges on religious grounds. Nevertheless, according to a 2015 poll by Ipsos, 83% of Italians deem laws prohibiting soft drugs as ineffective, 73% are in favour of legal cannabis, and 58% think that legalization would benefit public finances. In terms of consumption, 25% of people aged 15 to 19 years old have admitted using cannabis for recreational purposes at least once in 2014. Moreover, according to a 2018 report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Italy ranks third in the European Union in terms of cannabis use. \c\cThe popularity of recreational cannabis led in 2016 to renewed legalization efforts in Parliament, where legislation was proposed with the support of several politicians, mainly from the centre-left Democratic Party, the left-wing Left Ecology Freedom party, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, the anti-prohibition Radical Party, and even a few from the conservative Forza Italia party, as well as members of the Anti-Mafia Directorate. Proponents of the legislation point to the failure of prohibitionism in reducing cannabis consumption and argue that legalizing cannabis would regulate the circulation of cannabis-related products, reduce consumption among adolescents, allow the police and courts to focus their resources on other issues, and deprive criminal organizations of a significant source of revenue by redirecting it toward the State in the form of taxes, similarly to what happened in Colorado after it legalized cannabis in 2012. In particular, the value of the illegal cannabis market in Italy is estimated between 7.2 billion and more than 30 billion euros, while the potential tax revenue from legal cannabis is estimated between 5.5 and 8.5 billion euros. Moreover, the potential GDP boost resulting from a legal cannabis market in Italy is estimated between 1.30% and 2.34%. \c\cNevertheless, legalization efforts were opposed by several conservative and catholic-leaning politicians, mainly from the Northern League party and the New Centre-Right party, who argued that the consumption of cannabis constitutes a health risk and that legalization will not reduce drug addiction. The PD-led coalition government at the time, of which the New Centre-Right was a partner, was mainly focused on ensuring the passage of constititutional reforms, therefore cannabis legalization was not considered a priority. After the defeat of the constitutional referendum and the subsequent resignation of then Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on 12 December 2016, legalization efforts stalled in Parliament. \c\cIn 2016, the "cannabis light" Law 242/16 removed the need for authorization to plant certified cannabis seeds with levels of THC below 0.2%, while the detection of THC levels between 0.2% and 0.6% during field inspections is still considered acceptable, when it can be attributed to natural causes. The law also requires farmers to keep the certification receipts for up to one year, however the use of cannabis leaves and inflorescences for edible products is still prohibited. The potential revenue from the sale of cannabis light in Italy is estimated to be more than 40 million euros, and by 2018 hundreds of new businesses started growing cannabis in several Regions. \c\cEven though these looser requirements were originally intended to benefit farmers growing industrial hemp, with the production being limited to the 64 varieties of industrial hemp certified by the European Union, a lack of clarity regarding the use of cannabis inflorescences effectively created a booming unregulated market for recreational light cannabis. Since the law does not explicitly prohibit the sale of hemp flowers, customers can legally buy them, and then they can simply crumble them, roll them, and smoke them. The aforementioned 0.2% limit for the allowed THC content is considerably lower than the 15-25% range typically found in marijuana, thus preventing cannabis light users from actually getting stoned, however proponents of cannabis legalization are confident that the spread of cannabis light can contribute to the normalization of cannabis overall. \c\cNevertheless, in September 2018, then Interior Minister and Northern League party leader Matteo Salvini issued a memo to law enforcement agencies outlining a zero-tolerance policy towards cannabis retailers. In particular, the directive stated that cannabis products that contain THC levels above 0.2%, or that are made from plants not included in the official list of industrial hemp varieties, must be considered as narcotics and thus confiscated. Moreover, the Superior Council of Health, which provides technical-scientific counsel to the Ministry of Health, recommended in April 2018 to stop the free sale of cannabis light, as a public health precaution. The Council argued that the industrial applications of cannabis, as envisaged in the Law 242/16, do not include cannabis inflorescences; and they also cited a lack of scientific studies on the effects of even small levels of THC on possibly vulnerable subjects such as older people, breastfeeding mothers, and patients suffering from certain pathologies, which prevents them form ruling out possible health risks. Adding to the uncertainty in the cannabis light market, the Supreme Court of Cassation ruled in May 2019 that the sale of derivatives of cannabis sativa which do not fall within the scope of the Law 242/16, most notably oils, resins, buds, and leaves, is illegal under Italian Law unless such products are effectively devoid of narcotic effects. The Court also reaffirmed that only certain agricultural varieties of cannabis are permitted under the Law 242/16, which was meant to benefit farmers growing industrial hemp. \c\cIn 2019, a team of economists from the University of Magna Graecia, Université Catholique de Louvain, and the Erasmus School of Economics published a study on the effect of light cannabis liberalization in Italy on the organized crime. Albeit light cannabis does not generate hype as illegal marijuana, the study showed that confiscations of illegal marijuana declined with the opening of light cannabis shops. The authors also found a reduction in the number of confiscations of hashish and plants of marijuana along with a reduction of arrests for drug-related offenses. Forgone revenues for criminal organizations were estimated to be at least 90–170 million euros per year. \c\cIn December 2019, the Supreme Court of Cassation ruled that cultivating domestically small amounts of cannabis for the exclusive use of the grower is legal under Italian Law, after being asked to clarify previous conflicting interpretations of the law. The Court did not specify what constitutes a legally allowed small amount of cannabis, however the ruling came from a case in which the defendant possessed two plants, and was initially sentenced by a lower court to one year in prison and a 3000 € (i.e. about 3500 US$) fine. \c\cThe Court argued that public health is not threatened by a single cannabis user cultivating a few plants in a domestic setting and, in order to justify the assessment of a personal use of the plants, it pointed out the small size of the cultivation. In particular, the Court argued that, given the rudimental techniques used, the small number of plants present, the modest achievable amount of the final product, and the lack of evidence connecting it to a larger narcotic market, the cultivation appears to be destined exclusively for the personal use of the defendant, and should therefore be considered excluded from the application of the penal code. The ruling came just days after a proposed amendment to the 2020 budget calling for legalisation and regulation of domestic cannabis use, although already approved by the Lower House, was ruled inadmissible by the President of the Senate on technical grounds. \c\cIn April 2021, a patient suffering from acute rheumatoid arthritis was acquitted of drug pushing after a court ruled that he was allowed to exceed the legal limits of cannabis cultivation, after running out of an adequate supply of medical cannabis due to the coronavirus pandemic, on the grounds that it was for his personal health use. As of July 2021, another patient suffering from fibromyalgia, for which a daily dose of one gram of medical cannabis is usually prescribed, is currently on trial for the same charge of drug trafficking, after two cannabis plants were found in his house, together with rudimental tools for cultivating, preserving, and weighing cannabis, as well as a stock of the final product sufficient for just above a month of therapy, with a THC content ranging between 0.32% and 2.38%. The defendant lives in Calabria which, similarly to Molise and Aosta Valley, has not yet approved for medical cannabis to be covered by its Regional Health Agency, thus leading to higher costs and a distribution limited to a few pharmacies. Moreover, critics have argued that such charges would lead patients to buy cannabis directly from illegal pushers instead of growing it themselves, since they would risk just a fine, confiscation of documents, and a mandatory rehabilitation program for the charge of possession, as opposed to 6 years in prison for drug pushing. In fact, a third of all the illigal marijuana produced in Italy is reportedly cultivated in Calabria, due to its favorable climate, with the \'Ndrangheta being the leading criminal organization for drug trafficking in both Italy and Europe. \c\cIn September 2021, a preliminary text was approved by the Justice Committee in the Lower House that would decriminalize the small-scale cultivation of up to four female cannabis plants at home for exclusively personal use. The stated aim of the proposed legislation is to make sure that patients have access to medical cannabis, as well as to combat criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking. The law would also lower the penalties for minor cannabis-related infractions from 2–6 years in prison to 1 year at most, thus distinguishing it from hard drugs like heroin, while it would increase penalties related to drug trafficking to 6–10 years. \c\cAt the same time, a ballot initiative was launched that aims at the decriminalization of the cultivation of marijuana, as well as the repeal of penalties for cannabis possession, by amending the relevant laws through a referendum. In particular, the objective of the campaign is to amend several articles of the Presidential Decree DPR 309/90 of 1990, regarding the discipline of narcotics and psychotropic substances, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of the related stages of substance dependence, which is reportedly responsible for 35% of the current prison population in Italy. The initiative is supported by several pro-legalization organizations, including ARCI and the Luca Coscioni Association, as well as several political parties, including Italian Radicals, +Europa, Possible, Power to the People, Communist Refoundation, and Italian Left. In its first week of operation, the campaign collected 400 thousand signatures in less than four days and reached the required 500 thousand signatures well before the deadline set at the end of September, which will allow the referendum to take place as early as spring 2022. The speed at which the signatures were collected was made possible by a law approved in July 2021 that allows for signatures to be collected online, while previously only in-person signing was allowed, and the campaigner intend to keep collecting signatures up until the deadline, in order to make sure that the referendum proposal is not rejected due to some of them being ruled invalid. In particular, the collected signatures must be verified by the Supreme Court of Cassation, while the Constitutional Court must verify that the ballot question is in line with the Constitution, after which the President will set a date for the referendum. \c\cCannabis inflorescences are classified as narcotics and their pharmaceutical use is strictly regulated in accordance with the aforementioned UN Conventions of 1961 and 1971, EU regulations, as well as national legislation, including the aforementioned DPR 309/90 of 1990. The cultivation of cannabis plants for pharmaceutical use, as well as the production and distribution of cannabis-based medicine, are allowed only for authorized entities, while the DPR 309/90 forbids both the direct and indirect advertisement of a list of derived substances. Nevertheless, farmers can cultivate cannabis for exclusively non-pharmaceutical purposes, such as the production of hemp fibers or other industrial applications, using certified seeds under the direction of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food, and Forestry Policies. \c\cIn November 2015, Italy instituted the Central Office for Narcotics, in accordance with the 1961 UN Convention and subsequent amendments, which instruct countries allowing the cultivation of cannabis for medical purposes to create a state agency for its management. The functions of the Central Office for Narcotics include:\c\cimplementing national and EU regulations regarding narcotics and psychoactive drugs;\c\cupdating the official list of narcotics and psychoactive substances;\c\cauthorizing the cultivation of cannabis for the production of medicine and other substances;\c\capproving areas dedicated to the cultivation of cannabis;\c\capproving the exportation, importation, distribution within the national territory, and storage of cannabis plants and derived materials, with the exception of stocks kept in facilities authorized for the production of medicine;\c\cdetermining the production quotas based on Regional requests, and relaying that information to the International Narcotics Control Board. \c\cThe Central Directorate for Anti-Drug Services (CDA) is a joint organization involving the State Police, the Carabinieri, and the Financial Guard, as well as civil administration personnel from the Ministry of Interior, in the fight against drug trafficking. The three law enforcement agencies are equally represented in the Directorate, with the general director being selected every three years from the three agencies on a rotationary basis. The Directorate was originally instituted as the Anti-Drug Directorate through the Law 685/75 of 1975, and underwent several changes over the years, becoming the Central Anti-Drug Services through the Law 121/81 of 1981, until the Law 16/91 of 1991 defined its current structure and functions. The Directorate is made of three main branches, each containing two Divisions. \c\cThe General and International Affairs (GIA) branch manages multilateral, training, and legislative initiatives, as well as technical support to the Judiciary Police. International initiatives are coordinated with the United Nations, the European Union, as well as other agencies including the G7 Rome-Lyon Group, the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre, Ameripol, the Paris Pact Initiative, and the International Drug Enforcement Conference. The GIA branch manages training and educational activities at both a national and international level through courses, conferences, and workshops; and it also gives technical-juridical advice regarding bills and regulations on narcotics and drug trafficking. \c\cThe Studies, Research, and Information (SRI) branch conducts research and intelligence activities, in particular monitoring national and international drug trafficking. The analysis includes local consumption statistics, trafficking routes, production and market areas, concealment methods, demographics of the people involved, and evolution of new narcotics. At the international level, the SRI branch collaborates with the International Narcotics Control Board. It also gathers and processes information from both national and foreign sources regarding drug-related confiscations, arrests, and deaths, subsequently relaying these data to the National Statistics System (SISTAN), as well as using them for internal reports. Finally, the SRI branch offers support upon request in terms of providing bibliographical references for academic and research purposes. \c\cThe Anti-Drug Operations (ADO) branch coordinates police activities against drug trafficking through intelligence, strategic, operational, and technical-logistical support both at a national and international level. The ADO branch also approves and coordinates undercover operations, manages naval boarding requests against suspicious vessels in international waters, and monitors internet activities related to drug trafficking. \c\cThe main narcotic substances obtained from the female inflorescences and resin of cannabis plants are marijuana, hashish, and hashish oil. According to the CDA, the major marijuana producers worldwide are Albania, supplying Italy and parts of Europe; Mexico and the United States, mainly supplying North America; and Paraguay, which represents the main distribution center for all of South America; while Morocco  represents the main producer of hashish. Moreover, the three main routes for the illegal trade of cannabis-derived substances are from Mexico towards the United States and Canada; from North Africa, through Spain, towards the European markets; and from Albania, through the Adriatic Sea, towards Italy and other European markets. Furthermore, the Italian black market for marijuana is also supplied by the Netherlands, as well as local producers. \c\cIn January 2013, Italy legalized the medical use of cannabis with a doctor's prescription. However, at the time, the cost of cannabis-based medicine wasn\'t covered by the State and the drug had to be imported from abroad, primarily from the Netherlands and through intermediary agencies, making it too expensive for the average patient to buy legally at pharmacies, with prices reaching up to 50 € (i.e. about 59 US$) per gram, as well as waiting times reaching up to a month. \c\cFor this reason, then Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti announced in September 2014 that the army would begin growing cannabis plants in a secure room at the Chemical-Pharmaceutical Military Facility in Florence, which is already tasked with the production of orphan drugs both as an application of the constitutional right to health care and as a matter of national security. The military facility manages all stages of the production of medical cannabis, including growing and harvesting the plants, drying and grinding the leaves, sanitizing the final product with gamma rays, and then shipping it to pharmacies and hospitals. \c\cThe state-approved cannabis is prescribed for several conditions, in particular for chronic pain relief to patients with cancer and multiple sclerosis, and the army production increased from 20 kg between 2014 and 2016 to more than 100 kg of cannabis in 2017, resulting in a 30% decrease in the cost of the final product. Moreover, in order to keep up with the demand from doctors and patients, which was estimated between 400 and 450 kg a year in 2017, the army is expanding its cultivation to other areas of the military facility, where new greenhouses have already been set up in order to reach an estimated production of 300 kg per year. \c\cIn February 2021, Bio Hemp Farming became the first italian company to be granted authorization by the Ministry of Health to grow medical cannabis and to extract its active principles for pharmaceutical purposes. The potential revenue from medicinal cannabis is estimated to be more than 1.4 billion euros, with the internal market creating at least 10000 jobs and reducing the dependence on imports. \c\cThe prescription of cannabis for medical use is allowed when the patient is unresponsive to conventional or standard therapies, and the list of medical uses includes:\c\crelieving chronic pain, as well as pain associated with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries;\c\ctreating nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and HIV treatments;\c\cstimulating appetite for patients suffering from cachexia, anorexia, cancer, and AIDS;\c\cinducing hypotension within glaucomas;\c\creducing involuntary movements for patients affected by Tourette syndrome. \c\cThe state-run production and distribution of medical cannabis is the result of a collaboration between the Ministries of Health and Defence, as well as other entities including the Ministry of Agricultural, Food, and Forestry Policies; the Regions; the Italian Medicines Agency; the Superior Institute of Health; the Defence Industries Agency; and qualified experts. The aim is to ensure the availability of the raw material; guarantee the safe preparation and use of cannabis-based medicine; prevent the use of unauthorized, illegal, or counterfeit products; and make therapies affordable by reducing the cost of cannabis. \c\cThe military facility currently produces two types of cannabis-based ingredients, which are then distributed to pharmacies in a minced form to be used in their formulations. Cannabis FM2, which is similar to the Bediol strain, has been available to the Regions since December 2016, and its THC content (i.e. between 5% and 8%) is lower than the levels commonly found in similar drugs sold in the black market, or even in those legally imported from the Netherlands, while its CBD content (i.e. between 7.5% and 12%) is comparatively higher due to its more useful anti-inflammatory properties. Since July 2018, Cannabis FM1, which is similar to the Bedrocan variety, has also been available to the Regions, and it shows a considerably higher THC content (i.e. between 13% and 20%), as well as a considerably lower CBD content (i.e. less than 1%). The higher THC content makes Cannabis FM1 more suitable to mitigate the symptoms of conditions like multiple sclerosis. \c\cThe final price of the product being sold to pharmacies by the military facility, based on the estimated production costs, is equal to 6.88 € (i.e. 7.39 US$) per gram, not including the VAT. Furthermore, in June 2017, the Ministry of Health established a maximum price for medical cannabis between 8.50 € and 9.00 € per gram, in order to standardize the expenses sustained by patients. However, this price cap has resulted in a short supply of the product due to limited profit margins for pharmacies, while regional legislative differences also add to the overall complexity of the cannabis market. For example, the Regions have the ability to increase local prices in order to make it profitable for pharmacies to sell medical cannabis, and they can also decide for which health conditions the drug can or cannot be prescribed. \c\cThe Ministry of Health also publishes consumption statistics for medical cannabis both at a national and a regional level, based on regional distribution requests and the authorized sale of the product, and the military facility determines its production quotas by taking into account the consumption data from the previous two years, as well as the yearly increases. The annual legal consumption of medical cannabis has grown from 40 kg in 2013 to nearly 10 times that in 2017, and the demand is expected to further quadruple as the value of cannabis is more widely understood by doctors. The high demand caused pharmacies throughout Italy to run out of medical cannabis by September 2017, prompting many patients with prescriptions to turn to the black market, while in January 2018 the importation of cannabis was extended to Canada. As of March 2021, it is estimated that more than 2 million patients in Italy could benefit from medical cannabis, while the total needs are estimated to be at least 2000 kg per year. However, only a few tens of thousands of patients have access to cannabis-based drugs, while the coronavirus pandemic has affected both the importation and the distribution of the medicine. \c\cThe origins of the Chemical-Pharmaceutical Military Facility in Florence date back to 1853 in the Kingdom of Sardinia, when the General Chemical-Pharmaceutical Laboratory was established in Turin by royal decree, as part of the Military Pharmacy Warehouse, in order to provide the military with the medicine and medical supplies needed, as well as combating deseases like malaria, which was widespread in Italy at the time. After the Great War, plans were made to modernize the Laboratory, and move it to a more central location within the Italian peninsula, in order to improve the distribution of supplies. The current facility, covering about 55000 m2, was thus constructed in Florence, becoming operational in October 1931, and producing several types of medicine, medical supplies, cosmetics, and food products, with a workforce peaking at 2000 people in the 1940s. \c\cRenamed the Chemical-Pharmaceutical Military Facility in 1976, beside the production of medical cannabis with hydroponic cultures, the institute also produces five different orphan drugs, as well as mantaining the national stockpile of antidotes in case of mass poisoning, terrorist attacks, and nuclear disasters, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health which manages a net of warehouses located in each Region. In particular, the facility was involved in relief efforts during several natural and man-made disasters, including the Florence flood of 1966, the Friuli earthquake of 1976, the Irpinia earthquake of 1980, as well as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986, for which the institute produced 500 thousand pills of potassium iodide in less than 24 hours, in order to combat the thyroid damage caused by Iodine-131. The facility has also been involved in the production of medicine and medical supplies for international assistance, such as during the Romanian revolution of December 1989. \c\cThe military facility is a non-profit institute, operating on a balanced budget since 2008 and reinvesting any surplus into research and production, and collaborating with several Italian universities in several fields of research and education. In order to avoid unfair competition with the private sector, the facility mainly focuses on the research and production of unprofitable drugs used to cure rare diseases, which are defined as affecting just one every 2000 people, although possible revenue may still be obtained from exporting such drugs, with potential customers numbering at least 400 million people worldwide. With regards to the production of medical cannabis, the facility is looking for a public–private partnership in order to increase the overall production, possibly reaching 4000 kg a year, thus covering the national demand while also providing export opportunities. \c\cIn 2016, Italy removed the need for authorization to grow certified hemp with levels of THC below 0.2%, in order to stimulate the production of industrial hemp and to offer an alternative to the cultivation of wheat for farmers damaged by low prices, desiccated lands, and competition from large corporations importing grain from abroad. In particular, the potential profit from the cultivation of hemp in Italy is estimated to be more than 2500 € (i.e. about 2900 US$) per hectare, which is more than 10 times the estimated yield for wheat, and with the increasing number of farmers turning to hemp production, the overall production of durum wheat in Italy decreased by more than 4% in 2017. An important cultivar for Italy is Fibranova, which was developed in the 1950s as \'Bredemann Eletta\' x \'Carmagnola\', while \'Bredemann Eletta\' was developed at the Max Planck Institut. Other cultivars include Carmagnola Selezionata, the landrace Carmagnola, Eletta Campana (a Carmagnola cross), and Superfibra. \c\cThe cultivation of industrial hemp with minimal levels of psychoactive compounds has several commercial applications, including food, fabrics, clothing, biofuel, construction materials, and animal feed. In Italy, certified hemp plants can be used for both industrial and ornamental purposes, however food products can only be derived from the hemp seeds, since they have no THC content, while the consumption of hemp flowers and leaves is still prohibited. On the other hand, the hemp seeds reportedly contain all essential amino acids in optimal proportions and in an easily digestible form, and edible products include biscuits, bread, flour, anti-inflammatory oil, ricotta, tofu, and beer. The elevated protein content also makes cannabis-based food a suitable meat replacement for vegetarians, while its intense flavour has even been used for gelato, chocolate bars, and pastries. Other hemp-derived products include oils used in cosmetics, thermally insulating ecobricks, pellet fuel, as well as natural resins and fabrics that can be used for clothing due to their thermal properties, and for furnitures due to their resistance. \c\cAnother significant application of industrial cannabis is soil decontamination through phytoremediation, a process in which contaminants are absorbed by the fast-growing roots of hemp plants, which store the toxins or even transform them into a harmless substance. Examples of applications include the removal of toxic chemical dioxins from farm lands and grazing fields around the Ilva steel plant near Taranto, as well as the removal of radioactive strontium and cesium from areas affected by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
At 07:26 BST on 19 September 2021, police officers were called to a residential property on Chandos Crescent in Killamarsh, Derbyshire, an outer suburb of Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Three children and one adult were found dead inside the property, with the incident being treated as a suspected mass murder. A criminal inquiry is currently ongoing, and on 22 September, 31-year-old Damien Bendall of Killamarsh was charged with four counts of murder in connection with the incident. \c\cKillamarsh is a former coal mining town situated in far northern Derbyshire. It is located close to the border with South Yorkshire, across which lies the city of Sheffield, of which Killamarsh has become an outer commuter suburb as Sheffield has expanded to the south and east. \c\cPolice officers from the Derbyshire Constabulary attended to reports of a disturbance at a residential property on Chandos Crescent, close to Killamarsh town centre, at 07:26 local time on 19 September 2021. Arriving at the property, officers located the remains of three children and one adult inside. The victims were later named as siblings Lacey Bennett (aged 11) and John Paul Bennett (aged 13), their mother Terri Harris (aged 35), and Lacey's friend Connie Gent (aged 11); the two siblings and the mother lived together at the property, while Gent was staying at the property for a sleepover."}
The 2022 Philippine presidential and vice presidential elections is scheduled to be held on Monday, May 9, 2022, as part of that year's general election. This will be the 17th direct presidential election and 16th vice presidential election in the Philippines since 1935, and the seventh sextennial presidential and vice presidential election since 1986. \c\cIncumbent president Rodrigo Duterte is ineligible for re-election, pursuant to the 1987 Philippine Constitution. The position of president and vice president are elected separately, thus the two winning candidates could come from different political parties. \c\cAccording to the Constitution of the Philippines of 1987, the election is held every six years after 1992, on the second Monday of May. The incumbent president is term-limited. The incumbent vice president may run for two consecutive terms. The first-past-the-post voting system is used to determine the winner: the candidate with the highest number of votes, whether or not one has a majority, wins the presidency. The vice presidential election is a separate election, is held on the same rules, and voters may split their ticket. If two or more candidates wins the most votes for any position, Congress shall vote from among them which shall be president or vice president, as the case may be. Both winners will serve six-year terms commencing at noon on June 30, 2022, and ending on the same day six years later. \c\cIn the 2016 presidential and vice presidential elections, Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte of Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (transl. Philippine Democratic Party-People Power; PDP–Laban) won the presidency against four other candidates, while House representative from Camarines Sur Leni Robredo of the Liberal Party won against Senator Bongbong Marcos and four others in the vice presidential election that is the closest margin since 1965. Marcos put the result under protest in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal. \c\cIn July 2016, Vice President Robredo was appointed to head the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council, but later resigned in December 2016 after she was told to stop attending all cabinet meetings, amid her criticism of the administration's bloody war on drugs. Duterte's allies afterwards attempted to impeach her, but the president called on them to end the effort. \c\cIn the 17th Congress, the representative from Davao del Norte, Pantaleon Alvarez, was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives in July 2016. Faced with reports of destabilization, Duterte in October 2017 said that he will declare revolutionary government, where it is understood that all positions in government are declared vacant, in order to prevent chaos. The president listed the Communist Party of the Philippines, the elites, and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency as the organizations that had a hand in efforts to destabilize the government. \c\cMidway the legislative term, former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who was the representative from Pampanga, ousted Alvarez from the speakership. The president's allies said that the ouster was due to a squabble between Alvarez and Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, the president's daughter, who the latter branded the former as from the opposition when she launched the Hugpong ng Pagbabago (transl. Faction of Change; HNP), a regional political party in the Davao Region where both Davao del Norte and Davao City are a part of. \c\cIn the 2019 midterm Senate election, the opposition fielded the Otso Diretso (transl. Straight Eight) coalition, while the administration fielded their slate under the Hugpong ng Pagbabago banner. Hugpong won 9 of the 12 seats contested, while Otso Diretso won no seats. Cynthia Villar, wife of defeated 2010 presidential candidate Manuel Villar, topped the election, while 2013's Senate election topnotcher and 2016 defeated presidential candidate Grace Poe finished second. While Sara Duterte's Hugpong won in the Davao Region, they notably failed to unseat Alvarez, and PDP–Laban defeated Hugpong's candidate for governor of Davao del Norte, and won the province's both seats in the House of Representatives. \c\cIn the House of Representatives, the pro-Duterte parties won, but there was a squabble on who should be Speaker. President Duterte negotiated a term-sharing agreement with Alan Peter Cayetano and Lord Allan Velasco, with the former serving the first 15 months of the term, while Velasco will serve out the final 18 months. Meanwhile, Tito Sotto was comfortably re-elected as Senate President. \c\cOn Marcos's electoral protest against Robredo, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal released in October 2019 the report on Marcos's pilot provinces of Camarines Sur, Iloilo and Negros Oriental, and showed that Robredo increased her lead by 15,742 votes. The tribunal voted to defer on deciding on the protest, and instead proceeded with Marcos's plea to nullify the votes from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) provinces of Basilan, Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao. Those who dissented the decision said that the protest should have been dismissed, as Marcos failed to recover votes from his 3 pilot provinces, citing the rules of the tribunal; they were overruled when the others said that Marcos's plea on the ARMM provinces should also be resolved. \c\cA couple of weeks later, the president challenged Robredo to co-chair the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD), the office that oversees the war on drugs, along with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency chief, which she accepted. A week later, Duterte said that he will fire Robredo if she shares state secrets about the drug war. Several days later, Duterte said he cannot trust Robredo, after she asked the government for a list of high value targets in the drug war. Robredo replied that "He should tell me straight if he wants me out." Senator Francis Pangilinan of the Liberal Party said that Duterte could have fired Robredo instead of belittling her. A day later, Duterte fired Robredo as co-chair of the ICAD, with Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo shared that she spoke with foreigners, was asking for the scope of her powers and was among those daring the President to fire her, along with Senator Francis Pangilinan. \c\cAfter remarks by actress Sharon Cuneta in July 2020 saying she hopes Robredo will succeed Duterte in 2022 so that "decency" will be restored in the country, Robredo said that she has no plans yet of running in 2022. \c\cRobredo had a televised speech in August claiming that the government had no plans on how to resolve the COVID-19 pandemic. She then shared 10 recommendations on how to resolve it. Duterte himself, in a separate speech days later, asked Robredo not to "add fuel to the fire", and that even if he dies, the problems of the country won\'t be solved. This comes as suggestions of a "revolutionary government" replacing the current constitutional government were put forward by the Mayor Rodrigo Roa Duterte – National Executive Coordinating Committee (MRRD-NECC). Archie Gamboa, the chief of the Philippine National Police, said that he received an invitation from the group, but did not act on it. Duterte, in the same speech where he answered Robredo's suggestions, said that he does not know the people pushing for revolutionary government, and that he has nothing to do with it. After being disowned by Duterte, the MRRD-NECC offered Robredo a part in the plot; Robredo rejected the offer. Duterte then said that he wants the concept to be discussed in public. \c\cA leadership crisis erupted in the House of Representatives when Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano refused to give way to Lord Allan Velasco when the supposed term-sharing agreement was to take effect. Cayetano instigated a vote of no confidence against himself on early October 2020, which he easily won. A few days later, a picture surfaced of Velasco and Davao City mayor Sara Duterte, with Velasco's allies saying that she supports him. Later that week, pro-Velasco congressmen met at the Celebrity Sports Plaza, some kilometers away from the Batasang Pambansa Complex; this is where they elected Velasco as Speaker. The next day, Velasco was elected Speaker, this time in the Batasang Pambansa, while Cayetano resigned from the speakership while the election was taking place via Facebook Live. \c\cIn November 2020, Typhoon Ulysses ravaged the country. At the height of the onslaught, #NasaanAngPangulo (transl. where is the president?) hashtag trended on Twitter. On one of his weekly broadcasts, Duterte accused Robredo of starting the hashtag, and that she merely made phone calls to the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and did not order them herself, but him, two to three days before. Robredo denied starting the hashtag, nor did she ask "Where is the president?", accusing Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo for "peddling fake news". Panelo and National Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana later apologized to Robredo over the claim that she used government assets to conduct relief operations, and with Lorenzana stating that only relief goods from Robredo's office were transported. \c\cPulse Asia released its survey for the top two positions. Davao City mayor Sara Duterte leads in the presidential race with 26%, with Bongbong Marcos, Senator Grace Poe, Manila mayor Isko Moreno and Senator Manny Pacquiao in second place. Robredo followed those four, with 8%. For the vice presidential election, mayors Moreno and Duterte and Senate President Tito Sotto were statistically tied for first. By the new year, President Duterte said that the presidency "is not for women", and that his daughter is not running. Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo on his TV show Counterpoint then later said that Mayor Duterte has the qualities of being president, adding that there is a need of "continuity of the Duterte leadership." Mayor Duterte herself rejected running. Mayor Duterte said that she will be open in running for president in 2034. By January 2021, calendars began appearing in Quezon City urging Mayor Duterte to run. \c\cThe Presidential Electoral Tribunal dismissed Marcos's election protest against Robredo in February 2021. The decision was unanimous, with seven justices fully concurring, while eight others concurred. Robredo herself said that while she is open to running for president, she prefers local politics, where she feels she\'d be "happier." Meanwhile, "Run, Sara, run" billboards have sprouted all over the country. Duterte replied that "For now there is no chance that I will change my mind," and "I am pleading to them to please allow me to run for President in 2034."\c\cIn March 2021, former Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio launched "1Sambayan" (read as "isambayan", which means "one nation"), a coalition that will put up one lone candidate against Duterte's handpicked successor. Carpio is aiming not to split the vote, pointing out that Duterte won over Mar Roxas and Grace Poe in 2016 as those who were against him were not united. Lawyer Howard Calleja, in argument against accusations that the coalition is acting "holier-than-thou", stated that "What is clear is this administration is bad. In fact, it is super bad. We are not saying we are good. What we are saying is that there is nothing perfect, but we are giving the Filipinos a better alternative than what we have today."\c\c1Sambayan is considering one among Robredo, Moreno, Poe, and Senator Nancy Binay as candidates. Moreno said that "I don’t want to entertain any politics for now." Pacquiao, who was left out in 1Sambayan's list, said that it is "not the best time to talk about these political line-ups." Mayor Duterte, for her part, said "They sound authoritarian to me." Carpio said that both Pacquiao and Mayor Duterte won\'t be considered due to their ties to President Duterte. Former senator Antonio Trillanes IV said that there was never an offer from 1Sambayan for him to run, but if Robredo won\'t seek the presidency in 2022, he\'ll entertain entering the presidential race; as for the vice presidency, he said that 1Sambayan put upon their presidential candidate the choice on who would be the running mate, so he can\'t comment on that for now. \c\cPacquiao, PDP–Laban interim president, released a statement against President Duterte's handling of the South China Sea dispute on May 2021. Later that month, Alfonso Cusi, secretary of Energy and party vice chairman, authorized a meeting that released a resolution urging President Duterte to run for vice president. By June, Duterte replied that Pacquiao should "study first" before commenting on the president's foreign policy. On July 17, in a party general assembly, Cusi was elected party president, thereby removing Pacquiao from his office as party interim president, and Pacquiao ally Koko Pimentel was ousted as party executive vice chairman. \c\cTito Sotto and Panfilo Lacson, who were also not initially chosen by 1Sambayan, were being eyed as a tandem. Sotto said both of them are yet to be convinced on this, and when asked if he\'d run for higher office in 2022, he said that he hadn\'t made a decision yet. Lacson later declined the offer from 1Sambayan in a letter to Justice Carpio, in which he cited his principal sponsorship of the Anti-Terrorism Law as "inconsistent and incongruent" to the goals of the coalition. \c\cOn June 12, 2021, 1Sambayan announced six initial nominees who will go through the coalition's selection process for a presidential and vice-presidential tandem. The nominees (who members of the coalition may vote for as their candidate for either post) include: senator Poe, vice president Robredo, former senator Trillanes, human rights lawyer and former senatorial candidate Chel Diokno, incumbent house deputy speaker Vilma Santos-Recto, and CIBAC representative and house deputy speaker Eddie Villanueva. Justice Carpio later explained that, while initially interested, Mayor Moreno, along with Senator Binay, personally declined their received offers to run under 1Sambayan. Soon after, Senator Poe and Representative Santos also withdrew their names from contention, noting that they instead wanted to focus their separate energies on the ongoing pandemic. At the same time, Vice President Robredo, former Senator Trillanes, and Representative Villanueva expressed their support for unity in 2022 under 1Sambayan. \c\cLacson and Sotto announced their candidacies on July, with their campaign to be launched in August. Lacson was later sworn in as a member of the Partido para sa Demokratikong Reporma (transl. Party for Democratic Reforms; Reporma), the party of former secretary of Defense Renato de Villa who lost the 1998 presidential election. \c\cOn his final State of the Nation Address, President Duterte said that "Today is my last State of the Nation Address, and this is by no means my swan song." A week later, the PDP–Laban faction led by Cusi announced that their national executive committee is endorsing Senator Bong Go, a long-time aide of the president and now senator, for president, and President Duterte for vice president. \c\cMeanwhile, Manila mayor Isko Moreno was reportedly to take his oath as member of Aksyon Demokratiko (transl. Democratic Action), the party founded by Senator Raul Roco. This was after he resigned from the National Unity Party. However, this did not happen as an unexpectedly large number of people turned up on vaccination sites, particularly in Manila, on that morning, causing some vaccination sites to cancel the scheduled inoculation. Moreno was subsequently elected party president a week later. \c\cLater that month, Go declined the offer to run for president. Meanwhile, the PDP–Laban faction led by Manny Pacquiao ousted President Duterte as party chairman, replacing him with Koko Pimentel, while Lutgardo Barbo, former governor of Eastern Samar, was named party vice chairman, ousting Cusi, who held that position before the party split. \c\cOn September 8, Lacson and Sotto formally launched their tandem via social media, in a taped production in an undisclosed studio. Later that day, the Cusi faction of PDP–Laban held its national convention in Pampanga to nominate Senator Go and President Duterte for president and vice president, respectively. \c\cOn September 19, Senator Manny Pacquiao has accepted the nomination of his PDP-Laban-faction led by Koko Pimentel for President. A day later, the Cusi faction of the PDP-Laban party would declare the nomination of Pacquiao as "Illegal" as they believe that their faction has the right to nominate the party's presidential nominee as the sole legal PDP-Laban party. \c\cThe Commission on Elections is expected to publish a tentative list of candidates by late October 2021. By start of the election period itself on early January 2022, the commission would have finalized a list of candidates that would appear on the ballot. \c\cVarious personalities have  declared that they will run in the election. \c\cSenator Panfilo Lacson\c\cMayor of Manila Isko Moreno\c\cSenator Manny Pacquiao\c\cPanfilo Lacson (Reporma), incumbent senator\c\cIn July 2021, Senate President Tito Sotto confirmed that Lacson will run for president in a tandem with him. On September 8, the duo announced their candidacies for the upcoming election. \c\cIsko Moreno (Aksyon), incumbent mayor of Manila\c\cMoreno announced his candidacy on September 22; his running mate will be Dr. Willie Ong. \c\cManny Pacquiao (PDP–Laban), incumbent senator. \c\cBoxing promoter Bob Arum said in June 2020 that Pacquiao told him that he\'d run for president instead of defending his Senate seat in 2022. A few days later, Pacquiao denied talking to Arum about politics. A year after that, sports official and former Bacolod mayor and representative Monico Puentebella said that Pacquiao is running for president, and that he was authorized by the latter to talk about politics.

Addressing the nation Monday, June 28, Duterte later admitted that running for vice president was "not a bad idea" but this would depend if there would be "space" for him in the polls. On July 17, 2021, Duterte announced his plans to run as vice president to be immune from possible cases against him." On August 24, 2021, Duterte accepted the endorsement by PDP-Laban to run for vice president citing his agreement to "make the sacrifice and heed the clamor of the people." A couple of weeks later, the PDP-Laban faction led by Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi formally nominated Duterte for vice president. \c\cWillie Ong (Lakas–CMD), public health advocate and former Department of Health consultant\c\cOng will be the running-mate of Moreno; their ticket was officially announced on September 22, 2021. \c\cTito Sotto (NPC), incumbent president of the Senate of the Philippines\c\cOn July 2021, Sotto announced that he will be Lacson's eventual running mate in the presidential race; this was followed by an official campaign announcement on September 8, 2021. \c\cWin Gatchalian\c\cBongbong Marcos\c\cAntonio Trillanes\c\cWin Gatchalian (NPC), incumbent senator\c\cAntonio Trillanes (Magdalo), former senator\c\cOn May 12, 2021, Trillanes formally declared his intention to run for president, changing his status from being an alternate candidate to Vice President Leni Robredo "to being a principal candidate for President to vie for 1Sambayan coalition’s nomination." However, he is open to give way to Robredo if she decides to run for president. He previously said in February 2020 that the highest position he\'d run for was senator and that he\'d support Robredo for president instead. \c\cBongbong Marcos (Nacionalista), former senator\c\cBy January 2020, Marcos confirmed that he is running "for a national position" in 2022, although he did not specify which position. By September 2020, Marcos's sister Imee said that her brother was still noncommittal to which position he\'d run for. A year later, Marcos himself confirmed that "The presidency is not taken off the table." On September 21, the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP; transl. Federal Party of the Philippines) nominated Marcos to run for president.

By February, Robredo's supporters launched an online petition encouraging her to run for president. On June 12, 2021, 1Sambayan coalition released a partial list of nominees for president and vice president in the 2022 Philippine election which was the result of a months of consultations between parties and personalities who had agreed on the common goal of challenging whoever President Rodrigo Duterte would be endorsing as his successor.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Victoria is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in the Australian state of Victoria was identified on 19 January 2020, when a man returning from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cOn 10 March, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews warned Victorians to expect "extreme measures" in the wake of the federal government updating the travel advice for Italy. These could include cancelling major sporting events, requiring entire economic sectors to work from home, and calling recently retired health professionals to return to work. \c\cA state of emergency was declared on 16 March, which was extended on 12 April, with existing directions remaining in place including staying at home, restrictions on particular activities, detention, restrictions on airports and cruise ships, aged care, hospitals and isolation for people diagnosed with COVID-19.[citation needed] It was extended further on 11 May,[citation needed] and again on 19 July to 16 August. \c\cOn 22 March, the school holiday was brought forward from 27 to 24 March. \c\cOn 14 April, Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced that Victoria would have the widest coronavirus testing in Australia, with anyone having COVID-19 symptoms able to get tested. The statement was issued that those who presented with fever or chills, in the absence of any other alternative diagnosis that explained the issue, or acute respiratory infection characterised by coughing, sore throat or shortness of breath should be tested for coronavirus. \c\cOn 20 June, the Victorian Government re-tightened restrictions on household gatherings following a spike in community transmitted cases over the previous week, reported to be mainly caused by family-to-family transmission in large household gatherings. From 22 June, households could once again only have five visitors; and most easing of restrictions that were to take place were postponed. \c\cOn 30 June, the Victorian Government re-enforced local lockdowns across 10 different Melbourne postcodes. Residents there would need to comply with the four acceptable reasons to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes. \c\cOn 2 July, the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced the "Judicial Inquiry into Hotel Quarantine Program". This followed some cases of coronavirus in Victoria being linked by DNA sequencing to a breach in hotel quarantine infection control. The Inquiry was to "... examine the operation of Victoria's hotel quarantine program for returning travellers." It was headed by retired judge Jennifer Coate, and was scheduled to deliver its report to the Governor by 25 September. The inquiry was delayed by lockdown restrictions. Andrews noted that "it is abundantly clear that what has gone on here is completely unacceptable and we need to know exactly what has happened." An interim report was published on 6 November, and the inquiry's final report was published on 21 December. The Government response to the interim report was published in November. \c\cOn 4 July, the Victorian Government announced two more postcodes affected by the lockdown until 29 July 2020. Nine public housing towers housing 3,000 residents were also added, with the additional condition that residents could not leave the tower under any circumstances for five days, with the possibility of an extension to 14 days. The Victorian ombudsman later found the lockdown of the public housing towers breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 6 July, the Victorian and NSW state Governments announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July. \c\cOn 7 July, after recording 191 new cases, Premier Andrews announced that metropolitan Melbourne and the Shire of Mitchell would re-enter lockdown from 12 am on 9 July, for 6 weeks. \c\cOn 19 July, following a "concerning increase in coronavirus cases", Premier Andrews announced that "face coverings" were to be made mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne, and Mitchell Shire. This was not enforced until after 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday 22 July to allow the populace time to acquire a face covering. In addition, the state of emergency was extended until 16 August 2020. \c\cFrom 22 July, as the chance of coronavirus infection remained high in aged care and health care settings, visits were restricted to carers only, and with a limit of one hour per day. \c\cFrom 23 July, "face coverings" in metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire became mandatory whenever residents leave their homes. A fine of A$200 was imposed to those not complying, though medical and other exemptions were allowed, such as not being required for children under 12 years of age. \c\cOn 2 August, a state of disaster was declared and metropolitan Melbourne was moved to Stage 4 restrictions. A curfew across Melbourne from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. was imposed, a 5 km (3.1 mi) radius restriction as added, and other restrictions that had previously been applied only to selected postcodes were applied to the whole of metropolitan Melbourne. A permit system was introduced for any residents that still needed to travel to work outside of their 5 km radius. \c\cOn 6 September (Father's Day), the "Roadmap for Reopening" was announced; a series of four steps towards "COVID Normal" which would begin on 13 September. In the "First Step", which applied to metropolitan Victoria, several restrictions were eased including a reduction of the curfew, some loosening of rules around outdoor exercise and social interactions, the introduction of a "bubble" that allowed single people living alone to nominate one person to be allowed to visit them during the first two steps, and increased limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. At the same time, it was announced that regional Victoria would move to the "Second Step", which included a staged return of students to onsite learning as well as the reopening of outdoor public pools and further increases to limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. \c\cOn 18 October, regional Victoria was moved to "Step Three", which included the reopening of most businesses to the public, increased seating for hospitality, the allowance of visitors for all residents and the resumption of some indoor sports. At the same time, the 5 km limit in metropolitan Victoria was increased to 25 km (16 mi) and the two-hour time limit was removed, however the border between metropolitan and regional Victoria (often referred to as the "ring of steel") was strengthened with extra checkpoints added. \c\cOn 26 October, metropolitan restrictions were eased, with residents allowed to leave home for any reason, all retail businesses allowed to reopen, hospitality venues allowed to seat patrons, further relaxations on outdoor gatherings, and allowance of visitors to all residents, with some caveats. The 25 km restriction and "Ring of steel" remained in place, however. \c\c With a length of 112 days, Victoria's second lockdown was the longest continuous lockdown world-wide, as of October 2020. \c\cOn 31 October, Premier Andrews took his first day off after 120 consecutive days of coronavirus press conferences. \c\cOn 8 November, metropolitan restrictions were brought into line with regional restrictions with travel now being allowed to and from anywhere in the state. Indoor recreation, community and entertainment venues were also reopened. Restrictions on accommodation were also loosened in an effort to encourage intrastate tourism. It was also announced that, subject to public health advice, Victoria would move to the "Last Step" on 22 November. \c\cOn 27 November, Victoria recorded its 28th consecutive day of 0 new cases and 0 deaths, and had 0 active cases, epidemiologically eliminating the virus. \c\cOn 30 November, the Victorian government announced that a new dedicated agency, "COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria" (CQV), had been created. The interim Commissioner of CQV is the Commissioner of Corrections, Emma Cassar. CQV is part of the government's response to the COVID-19 Hotel Quarantine Enquirys\' interim report. It will oversee all parts of the Victorian quarantine program: mandatory quarantine for people entering Australia, Health Hotels for positive and suspected cases, or close contacts, and Frontline Worker Accommodation. The CQV Commissioner will be supported by three Deputy State Controllers. Deputy Chief Health Officer Professor Ben Cowie will lead the CQVs\' health management. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Ross Guenther will provide expertise in enforcement. As of 15 January 2021[update] the third Controller was still to be appointed. On 5 May 2021, the CQV general manager of infection control, Matius Bush, was stood down by the Minister for Government Services Danny Pearson pending a conduct review. Bush breached infection controls twice by: refusing a COVID test at a quarantine hotel when requested by Defence personnel; and failing to sanitise or change his mask when returning to a quarantine hotel from a coffee shop. Reports about the breaches were leaked and published in The Australian newspaper. \c\cOn 17 December, the Victorian ombudsman tabled a report in the Victorian Parliament in which she found the 4 July lockdown of public housing towers In Melbourne breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 30 December, Victoria's 61-day streak of zero community cases came to an end as three community cases were identified, linked to the New South Wales outbreak. As a precautionary measure for New Year's Eve the Victorian Government reduced household gatherings from 30 people to 15 and mandated masks within an indoor setting. The border to New South Wales closed at 11:59 pm on 31 December, with returning Victorian residents from "green zones" that returned before the deadline made to isolate until they received a negative test result. Those that returned afterwards would have to get tested and isolate for 14 days, aligning the restrictions with visitors from the Northern Beaches and Greater Sydney that had been enforced 11 days prior. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, a quarantine hotel worker at the Grand Hyatt Melbourne, a "resident support officer" involved in the Australian Open tennis quarantine program, was found to have COVID-19. From 11:59 pm Victoria immediately reintroduced some rules, tightened some, and put off imminent easing of some restrictions. The plan to, from 8 February (Monday), allow up to 75 per cent of office workers back into their workplaces was put on hold. Masks are mandatory inside, and only 15 persons are allowed at private events. The man visited at least 14 businesses from 29 January to 1 February, but was able to give contact tracers a detailed list of places and times. Anyone who was at those places at those times, must be tested, and isolate for 14 days. Testing site hours were extended from 4 February, opening at 8 am. More drive-through lanes were added, and additional testing sites opened. By 5 February, genomic sequencing confirmed that the Hyatt worker was infected with the more contagious "UK strain" of COVID-19. \c\cOn 12 February, it was announced that a five-day lockdown under Stage 4 restrictions would take effect beginning at 11:59 pm. AEDT, due to a cluster of 13 cases tied to a Holiday Inn quarantine hotel near Melbourne Airport, which have been assumed to be the UK variant. It was alleged by health officials to have been spread on a hotel floor due to a patient's use of an aerosol-generating nebuliser, which is normally banned under hotel quarantine. By 14 February the cluster had grown to 16, and by 16 February, the number of confirmed infections had increased to 19. By 19 February,  the Melbourne Holiday Inn outbreak had increased to 22, one person was admitted to intensive care, and about 3,515 contacts were quarantined. \c\cResidents may not leave their homes except for essential shopping, exercise, caregiving, essential work, or participating in a professional sporting event. Residents may only shop or exercise within five kilometres of their homes. Face masks are mandatory at all times out-of-home, all public gatherings are banned, and all schools are closed. As they account for the majority of UK variant cases, international arrivals into Victoria were also suspended. All Australian states and territories have placed travel restrictions upon Victoria. Premier Andrews stated that these infections were "moving at a velocity that has not been seen anywhere in our country over the course of these last 12 months." Special dispensation was given to the 2021 Australian Open, which became crowdless effective 11:30 pm. AEDT on 12 February in the midst of the night's final match (play was temporarily suspended at that time to remove all spectators from the court). \c\cThe lockdown was lifted as anticipated at 11:59 pm on 17 February. Despite this, Victoria will not allow any incoming international flights "indefinitely". \c\cRemaining restrictions included:\c\cMasks mandatory inside,\c\cMasks outdoors when unable to keep social distance,\c\c5 person limit on home visits,\c\c20 person limit for outdoor gatherings. \c\cAs of 9 May 2021 Victoria had no cases of community transmission for 72 days. \c\cOn 24 May in northern Melbourne, 4 cases of COVID-19 in the community were reported; this broke Victoria's streak of 86 days with no community transmission. Another 5 community cases, for a total of 9, were reported on 25 May. 4 of them were family contacts of a man, who may be the source of the outbreak, who tested positive on 2 May. As a result, restrictions in Greater Melbourne were again tightened from 6pm on Tuesday, 25 May, to at least Friday, 4 June. Restrictions included:\c\cmandatory wearing of masks indoors (children under 12 exempted)\c\cprivate gatherings, limited to 5 people\c\cpublic gatherings, limited 30 people\c\climits on visitors to hospitals and aged care reinstated\c\cMelbourne residents were allowed to travel out of the city, but had to observe restrictions as if they were still in Melbourne\c\cno changes to the number of people allowed in workplaces, shops, bars, or beauty services. \c\cRelaxation of "density caps" in hospitality venues had been planned, was put on hold. Cultural and sports event were allowed, but the AFL "paused" ticket sales for Victorian-based games. \c\cBy 27 May the Melbourne outbreak had risen to 26 cases. There were over 150 exposure sites and 11,000 contacts had been linked through contact tracing to the outbreak. As a result of the growing outbreak Victoria entered its fourth lockdown, statewide, as of 11:59pm on 27 May. The restrictions were initially planned to last for at least 7 days until 11:59pm on 3 June. By 1 June the number of cases in the Victorian outbreak had reached 60 and on 2 June the lockdown was extended for another 7 days. By June 7 there were 81 active COVID cases in the outbreak. The lockdown ended, with some restrictions remaining, just before midnight on 10 June. \c\cDuring the lockdown leaving home was initially only allowed for 5 reasons:\c\cFood and supply shopping (only within 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) of home)\c\cAuthorised work\c\cCare and caregiving, health\c\cExercising, for up to two hours:\c\cwith no more than one other person\c\cwithin 5 km of home\c\cTo get a COVID-19 vaccination. \c\cOtherwise:\c\cSchools closed (some exemptions)\c\cHigher education, online only\c\cChildcare centres and kindergartens, stay open\c\cHairdressers, beauty salons and similar, closed\c\cEntertainment venues, closed\c\cOnly take-away food allowed from cafes and restaurants\c\cNo public or private gatherings\c\cNo hospital or nursing home visits (some exemptions)\c\cFunerals limited to 10 people, plus those running the event\c\cWeddings not allowed (some exemptions)\c\cMasks mandatory outside the home, unless exempted. \c\cThere were anti-lockdown protests in Melbourne on 28 May. \c\cDue to the outbreak, all Australian states imposed a range of restrictions on travellers from Victoria, either banning entry, only allowing state residents back in, requiring home isolation for 7 days under Victorias\' rules, 14 days hotel quarantine, or other measures. New Zealand paused the travel bubble with Victoria from 7:59pm on 25 May. As a result of the pausing of the travel bubble, the Melbourne Rebels\' scheduled Super Rugby Trans-Tasman match against the Highlanders was forced to be relocated from Queenstown, New Zealand to Sydney. On 3 June the stay-at-home order from NSW Health, for anyone in NSW who had been in Victoria since May 27, was extended by a week. \c\cThe fourth lockdown meant that a number of other interstate professional sporting matches that were due that week had to either be played in empty stadiums, or relocated to alternative venues. The A-League match between Western United and Melbourne Victory on 28 May, the AFL match between the Western Bulldogs and Melbourne on 28 May and the AFL matches scheduled on 29 May (Collingwood against Geelong at the MCG and St Kilda against North Melbourne at Marvel Stadium) were played in empty stadiums, while the AFL match between Richmond and Adelaide scheduled for Sunday 30 May and the NRL match between the Melbourne Storm and the Gold Coast Titans scheduled for 5 June were both relocated interstate, to Sydney and the Sunshine Coast respectively. \c\cAfter the number of cases in the Victorian outbreak had reached 60 by 1 June, on 2 June the lockdown was extended for another 7 days. Some restrictions were eased:\c\cthe 5 km travel limit was extended to 10 km (6.2 miles),\c\cschool attendance allowed for years 11 and 12,\c\cauthorised work now includes some outdoors work. \c\cUse of the Service Victoria QR code check-in is required across Victoria for places like supermarkets and shops. \c\cThe Victorian outbreak rose to 63 cases by 3 June, all in Greater Melbourne. As a result, from 11:59 pm that day some lockdown restrictions in regional Victoria were eased:\c\cmovement in regional areas was unrestricted (to Melbourne is still restricted)\c\cstudents could return to school\c\cThere were 81 active COVID cases in the outbreak by June 7. There were also 3 separate clusters with unknown sources in Victoria by then: 32 cases in Whittlesea; 9 at the Arcare aged care centre in Maidstone; and 14 at a cluster in West Melbourne. The West Melbourne cluster was found to be of the fast spreading Delta COVID variant, raising the possibility the fourth Victorian lockdown could be extended again. \c\cThe lockdown ended on 10 June at 11:59 pm, with some restrictions remaining. \c\cno visitors in the home\c\cmust wear a mask both indoors and outdoors\c\ctravel limited to 25 km (16 mi) radius of home. \c\cDue to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, from 11:59pm on 24 June, border entry was barred to non-Victorian residents who had been in Greater Sydney and Wollongong in the previous 14 days as those areas were considered to be red zones. Returning Victorians had to get a red zone permit and quarantine at home for 14 days. \c\cFrom 11:59pm on July 11, Victoria closed its border to all New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory residents to try to prevent the delta variant entering the state. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr tweeted that it was "incredibly disappointing and frustrating" after more than a year with no local COVID-19 cases that the border was being closed to Canberrans. \'Border bubble\' arrangements for border towns remained in place. \c\cOn 14 July, after 11 COVID cases were detected in the state, Victoria reintroduced the requirement to wear face masks in workplaces, in schools, and when social distancing was not possible, outdoors. Most cases are linked to removalists from NSW who picked up from the Ariele apartments in Maribyrnong on 8 July without face masks. On return to NSW the removalists tested positive. Because of them the apartment block, with 130 residents, was put into a 14 day lockdown on 13 July, which was \'reset\' by the new cases. \c\cOn 15 July, it the Premier announced that Victoria would enter a snap lockdown for 5 days from 11:59pm on 15 July (Thursday) until 11:59pm on 20 July (Tuesday). This will be the third Victorian lockdown in 2021, and the fifth since the start of the pandemic in Australia. There are 18 cases in the current outbreak in Victoria, 4 recorded on this day, all of which link back to "incursions" from NSW. There are 1,500 primary close contacts and 75 exposure sites in Victoria. \c\cOn 20 July the Premier announced that Victoria's snap lockdown would be extended, with current settings to continue for the next seven days until Tuesday, 27 July at 11.59pm - the Delta variant is confounding Victoria’s public health experts and is moving faster than anything they\'ve seen before. \c\cOn 22 July, the death of a 48-year-old woman from Victoria the previous week was linked by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to "probable" thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS),  after vaccination with AstraZeneca. \c\cOn 24 July there was an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne. There were 6 arrests, 4 people charged, and 74 infringement notices issued. There were also protests in Brisbane, and in Sydney where several people were arrested, infringement notices issued and over 50 people charged. Assistant police commissioner Luke Cornelius responds: "It beggars belief that the protest today could, if mass spreading occurs, result in an extension of the very thing they are protesting for: an end to the current lockdown and a reopening of business, which is something we are all working so hard to achieve."\c\cOn 27 July at 11:59pm the 5th lockdown was lifted with strict restrictions still remaining. It is unknown when the restrictions will ease further. \c\cno visitors in the home\c\cmust wear a mask both indoors and outdoors\c\cstudents can return to school\c\cpublic gatherings are limited to 10 people\c\cpubs, restaurants, bars, gyms and retail can reopen with density limits\c\ccommunity sport is back but spectators not allowed\c\cOn 5 August 2021, in response to the detection of six new community cases, the Victorian Government announced their sixth lockdown, commencing that evening at 8 pm for seven days. At about 7pm that day there was an anti-lockdown protest of up to 400 people in Flinders Street, Melbourne. \c\cRegional Victoria was released from its sixth lockdown early on 10 August.[citation needed]\c\cOn 11 August the lockdown was extended for 7 days. This followed the state having 20 new cases, 5 with an unknown source. \c\cOn 16 August the lockdown was extended for another 14 days, with the overnight curfew reinstated and a target end date of 2 September. \c\cOn 19 August, Melbourne marked 200 days of lockdowns since the beginning of the pandemic. \c\cOn 21 August at 1pm, regional Victoria was also placed into its seventh lockdown and other restrictions tightened, such as the 5 km limit for essential shopping, and exercise activities. Hospitality was again takeaway only, most retail stores closed and schooling online only. Sporting venues, skate parks, playgrounds, and outdoor exercise equipment all closed. Construction statewide returned to a 25 per cent capacity limit. The 9pm-5am curfew in metropolitan Melbourne was not enacted in regional Victoria. This action followed 61 new state cases of COVID-19 on 19 August, one in Shepparton. By the afternoon of 20 August rapid PCR testing brought the cluster in Shepparton at least 21 cases. 48 of the new locally acquired cases from 19 August were linked to known outbreaks, 22 were in isolation during their infectious period. 11 separate "mystery cases" were in suburbs including Airport West, Frankston, Keysborough, Docklands and Yarraville. After there were 27 cases in 2 days at a childcare centre in Broadmeadows, among others, childcare centres were restricted to essential workers. \c\cThe same day there was another anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne city, which became violent. Up to 4,000 people marched and over 200 were arrested, 3 for assaulting police. Police responded with pepper spray when protesters threw objects at them. 7 police officers were injured, 6 of those hospitalised. 236 fines were issued. Those arrested can each be fined AU$5,452. Smaller protests were also held in Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Perth, and in Sydney where over 45 people were arrested. \c\cOn 29 August, following a year high 92 new cases detected in the community in a single day, the Victorian Government announced that the statewide lockdown was to be extended. \c\cOn 31 August the deaths of 2 women with COVID-19 were reported in Victoria. The women both died at their homes, one was aged in her 40s from Darebin, the other was in her 60s from Hume. They were the first COVID deaths reported in Victoria since 30 November 2020, 9 months. The same day there were 76 new locally acquired cases, 45 linked to existing outbreaks and 36 in isolation while they were infectious. \c\cOn 1 September, following new cases reaching triple digits (120 cases) in a single day for the first time since 2 September 2020, the lockdown was extended again with a target end date of 23 September. An additional target was getting 70% of the eligible population of Victoria receiving their first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines by that date. \c\cOn 3 September, another overnight death from COVID-19 death was reported, a man in his 60s, bringing state deaths to 823. There were also 208 new cases of COVID-19. There were 1,176 active cases coming from 48,572 test results on 2 September. That day around 6,000 tests were done in Shepparton, mostly day 13 tests of people in isolation. 33,511 doses of vaccine were administered too at state-run sites that day. \c\cOn 9 September there was another Victorian COVID-19 death. A Coburg man in his 70s died in hospital, he was not vaccinated, bringing state deaths to 824. There were 344 new locally acquired cases, of which 149 have been linked to known outbreaks. 127 (up 16) were hospitalised, 33 in ICU with 21 requiring a ventilator. 319,027 vaccinations were administered at state-run sites, and 42,998 test results were received. By this day, 64 per cent of Victorians had received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. \c\cAlso on 9 September at 11:59 pm, lockdown restrictions in regional Victoria, except Greater Shepparton, were eased. Greater Shepparton's restrictions were eased on 15 September, with Ballarat re-entering lockdown on the same day. \c\cOn 14 September, the deaths of 2 more people were reported.

There were 4,083 active cases, 173 were hospitalised, 44 in intensive care and 23 on ventilators. \c\cAlso on 15 September, at 11:59pm Ballarat went back into lockdown, it's eighth, for at least 7 days. This followed the town having 4 recent COVID cases as well as "widespread" wastewater detection. The Ballarat International Foto Biennale photographic exhibition, already delayed from 28 August by the regional lockdown, had been rescheduled to open on the 15th. \c\cOn  19 September, at 11:59pm Greater Geelong, Surf Coast Shire and Mitchell Shire went back into lockdown, their eighth, for at least 7 days. This followed both Greater Geelong and Mitchell reporting cases and Surf Coast showing positive waste water detections with no confirmed source.[citation needed]\c\cOn 20 September, there was a violent protest by hundreds of people against mandatory vaccination for construction workers outside the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) headquarters. In order to be allowed to work, tradespeople were required to have had at least one dose of vaccine by  23 September (Thursday). The union building was damaged and riot police employed pepper spray and rubber bullets. As a consequence, combined with an increase in transmission of COVID-19 in the industry, from 11.59pm that night all building and construction industry worksites in Ballarat, Geelong, Metropolitan Melbourne, Mitchell Shire and the Surf Coast were shut down for two weeks. \c\cOn 21 September in Melbourne, there was a large protest march against a wide range of pandemic response related issues, including the previous days\' construction industry shut down. The "Victorian Workers Rally For Freedom" started near to the CFMEU headquarters at 10pm, went through the CBD, past state Parliament, Flinders Street railway station, then onto and blocking the West Gate Freeway. At least one  media reporter was assaulted and objects thrown at police. Riot police again used tear gas and rubber bullets. The construction shutdown could cost the industry nearly AU$500 million per day. There were 62 arrests related to the protest. \c\cOn 22 September in Melbourne city there was another protest with up to 1,000 people converging on the Shrine of Remembrance. After a stand-off for a few hours with police surrounding them, protesters dispersed at about 5pm. Two police officers were injured by thrown bottles and more than 200 people were arrested. An estimated 300 fines were issued for not complying with stay-at-home directives. \c\cBy 22 September, Victoria had another 3 deaths in 24 hours bringing the state COVID-19 death toll to 836, and 628 new cases, exceeding the previous record of 625 daily new cases set in 2020. The lockdown of Ballarat ended at midnight this day. \c\cBy 23 September there were another 4 deaths, taking the outbreak total to 20, and total state deaths to 240 since March 2020. With 766 new daily cases, another record high was set. Active cases were at 6,666. \c\cThe dead were:\c\c3 men: 1 in his 70s and 1 his 80s both from Hume, and 1 in his 80s from Moreland\c\c1 woman in her 90s from Hume\c\c257 were hospitalised with COVID-19. Of these 257 there were:\c\c60 in intensive care, 41 on ventilation\c\c81% were not vaccinated, 15% partially vaccinated, only 3% fully vaccinated\c\cState vaccinations were at:\c\c45% double dose\c\c75 per cent single dose\c\cVictoria was rationing the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, with Premier Andrews blaming the Commonwealth government for supply issues. \c\cAlso notably by 23 September, at 235 days, Melbourne set a record for the worlds\' longest lockdown. As of this date, the city is expected to be locked down until "late October". \c\cThe 2020 Australian Grand Prix (scheduled for 15 March) was cancelled. \c\cThe 2021 Australian Grand Prix was postponed, then later cancelled on 6 July 2021. \c\cThe 2020 Melbourne International Flower & Garden Show (scheduled for 25–29 March 2020) was cancelled. \c\cThe 2020 Melbourne International Comedy Festival (scheduled for 25 March – 19 April 2020) was cancelled due to banned public gatherings of more than 500 people. \c\cThe 2020 Melbourne International Jazz Festival (scheduled for 29 May – 12 June) was cancelled; however, it was replaced by a virtual online event by These Digital Times. \c\cThe 2020 annual Melbourne Food and Wine Festival (due to start in March 2020) was postponed to Spring. \c\cThe inaugural Rising Festival was postponed in 2020, in 2021 a snap lockdown started at midnight on 27 May, the second day of the festival, and was then extended a week. The remainder of the Festivals\' already reduced programme was cancelled. The Victorian Government funded Rising to replace the Melbourne International Arts Festival and White Night. \c\cThe 2020 annual Royal Melbourne Show (due to start in mid-September) was cancelled. \c\cThe 2021 annual Royal Melbourne Show (due to start in mid-September) was cancelled. \c\cThe 2020 annual Royal Geelong Show (scheduled for October) was cancelled. \c\cMelbourne's New Year's Eve fireworks at the end of 2020 were cancelled. \c\cThe 2021 Rainbow Serpent Festival, normally held on the Australia Day long weekend in Lexton, had its physical events cancelled.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23 January 2020. Early cases were primarily imported until local transmission began to develop in February and March. By late-March and April, COVID-19 clusters were detected at multiple sleeping quarters, for which soon contributed to an overwhelming proportion of new cases in the country. \c\cOn 22 January 2020, a multi-ministerial committee was formed with Minister of Finance Lawrence Wong and Minister of Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong as the co-chairs and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies Heng Swee Keat as advisors. On 23 April 2021, Lee announced the appointment of Ong Ye Kung as the Minister for Health, another committee co-chair alongside incumbents Lawrence Wong and Gan Kim Yong from 15 May 2021. Singapore also contributed US$500,000 to support the World Health Organization's (WHO) efforts against COVID-19. \c\cIn response to the first wave of COVID-19, Singapore enacted the "COVID-19 Control Order", announcing on 3 April 2020 a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the "circuit breaker lockdown". Initially planned to be applied from 7 April to 4 May, the circuit breaker lockdown was extended to 1 June on 21 April following continued untraced transmission within the community. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 19 May announced the three-phased approach to resume activities safely with the gradual re-opening of economic activities in each phase. Phase 1 lasted for 17 days from 2 June and ended on 18 June, with Phase 2 lasting for 6 months and 8 days from 19 June to 27 December. Singapore was in Phase 3 from 28 December 2020 until 7 May 2021; following the rise of the Delta variant, it temporarily reverted to Phase 2 on 8 May, which was raised to "Phase 2 Heightened Alert" from 16 May to 13 June, "Phase 3 Heightened Alert" from 14 June to 21 July and "Phase 2 Heightened Alert" from 22 July 2021 to 9 August 2021. This was followed by "Preparatory Stage of Transition" from 10 August 2021. A mass vaccination programme is currently under way following the approval and acquisition of the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. \c\cAs of 23 September 2021, 10,379 active cases remain out of a total of 82,860 confirmed cases, with 72,411 recoveries and 70 deaths. Singapore currently has a case fatality rate of 0.08%, one of the lowest in the world. It introduced what was considered one of the largest and best-organised epidemic control programs in the world, along with fellow neighbouring countries such as South Korea and Vietnam. Various measures have been taken to mass test the population for the virus, such as isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps such as TraceTogether (both app and token) and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with. Such measures have helped avoid further lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020. \c\cOn 31 December 2019, health authorities in China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), after mounting evidence that the novel coronavirus had spread to 18 countries and completion of investigation in Wuhan. \c\cThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, cases were traced to clusters that several cases had visited during a particular time period in the whole of Singapore. Imported cases also became a source of infection in March. From April to September 2020, most new cases were at foreign worker dormitories and construction sites, while imported cases formed the bulk of new cases from early October 2020. As of 23 September 2021, there are a total of 56,476 dormitory residents, 21,122 cases in the community, and 5,262 imported cases. 23 September 2021 saw 1,504 daily cases—the highest since 22 September 2021, while 12 May 2020 saw 20,799 active cases during the heightened lockdown. There are currently 23 warded in the intensive care unit, as of 23 September 2021. It was only on 14 August 2020 that there were no reported community cases for the first time since June, while 1 October 2020 was the first time since April that the daily number of imported cases exceeded that of dormitory cases. 13 October 2020 was the first time in over six months that no dormitory cases were reported, with 15 June 2021 being the first time in over eleven months that no imported cases were reported. \c\cInternationally, the case fatality ratio (CFR) for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS in 2003. The transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus powering the COVID-19 pandemic has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. However, Singapore's death rate has been one of the world's lowest, both in terms of CFR and per capita. This may be attributed to the fact that the bulk of the cases are restricted to the migrant workers living in dormitories away from the general population. These migrant workers tend to be younger, with an average age of 30 years and 2 months old when surveyed in 2015, and the healthcare system was never overwhelmed. The authorities also tested the entire dormitory population for COVID-19 infection, leading to many otherwise asymptomatic infections being picked up. Research by the European Commission suggests that the CFR for SARS-CoV-2 virus picks up in cases 50 years of age and above. The elderly in the general population in Singapore have been advised to stay at home as much as possible, while resident-facing staff in old folks homes are being housed on site or separately in hotels. \c\cOther factors contributing to Singapore's exceptionally low CFR include the country's use of extensive contact tracing and testing to identify cases, mandatory mask-wearing, and hospitalisation of all high-risk patients. Singapore has comparatively strict criteria for classifying COVID-19 deaths, counting patients who were infected with COVID but died of other causes as non-COVID deaths. \c\cPrevalence studies on the population have shown that 4 in 1600 in the community, or about 0.25%, have previously been infected with COVID-19, while at least 47% of migrant workers living in dormitories have tested positive by PCR or serological tests. \c\cNational authorities began reporting suspected cases on 4 January, however the first confirmed case was reported on 23 January, a tourist from Wuhan. Until 30 January, there were a total of 13 confirmed cases, all of whom were visitors to Singapore from China. The first case involving a Singaporean was confirmed on 31 January after returning from Wuhan. Contact tracing procedures were put in place to identify close contacts of the confirmed cases who were placed under 14-day quarantines to ring-fence the potential spread of the virus. \c\cThese imported cases eventually lead to clusters of local transmissions being formed. The first local cluster was reported on 4 February at Yong Thai Hangs. It was identified as the locus of the infection where four women without recent history of travel to China contracted the virus. The shop was affected when a tour group from Guangxi, China visited it along with other locations such as the Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive, where another case occurred, while touring Singapore. The tour group had returned to China and the Chinese authorities had confirmed that two of the group was infected. Authorities raised DORSCON level to Orange with the impending COVID-19 cases of infection, with Prime Minister Lee expressing his worry about some cases with no known chain of transmission of the infection directly from Wuhan or indirectly via cases traced in Singapore. He suggested that it might become "futile to try to trace every contact". More clusters emerged at various locations, where there were large scale gatherings such as a business conference, Chinese New Year dinner gatherings and church-related activities. Two clusters were linked when several cases in each cluster was found to have infected each other through serological tests, the first such successful test in the world. \c\cIn March, as the number of cases began to rise exponentially around the world, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) began to encourage Singaporeans to return home. Various institutes of higher learning recalled their students currently on overseas internship or exchange, and the MFA began liaising with airlines to facilitate flights to key cities when necessary during this period, to cater to demand for return flights to Singapore. This led to an increase in number of imported cases, in which over 70% of cases from 16 to 19 March were Singaporeans and long-term pass holders returning from overseas. \c\cPlans for the lockdown began in February but waited until late of March. Various mask-off activities were prohibited such as dining in and all exercise activities and many people were working from home starting from early April; and from 5 May, gatherings and social visits were only allowed up to two per day, until 1 June. The bulk of cases began to shift from imported cases to migrant workers living in dormitories, resulting in the authorities imposing a mandatory quarantine of 20,000 migrant workers in two dormitories gazetted as isolation areas, namely the S11 Dormitory and Westlite Toh Guan. Following which, the number of cases in migrant worker dormitories began to soar as more clusters were detected in other migrant worker dormitories, reaching a single-daily high of 1,426 cases recorded amongst migrant workers on 20 April. On 21 April, MOM announced that all foreign workers in dormitories were to stop work until 4 May to curb the rising spread of the coronavirus among the groups that were hit the hardest. The number of daily cases amongst migrant workers living in dormitories gradually decreased but continued to remain in the hundreds until early August, with aggressive testing by the authorities. April also marked a shift in policy. The government stopped automatically admitting the infected in hospitals and instead created community care facilities for those who were at low risk, which allowed hospitals to focus only on those in higher risk categories. At the peak on 12 May, there were 19,667 patients in community care facilities. This allowed hospitals to reduce bed take up related to COVID-19 from more than a thousand to several hundred in a few weeks. 18 September saw the first time since the crisis spread to work dormitories that the daily dorm case number fell into single digits. \c\cFrom May onwards, the vast majority of cases were reported in dormitories, with community cases never rising above 24 cases, which was reported on 11 July. Nevertheless, while numbers in the dorms remained elevated in May, 20 April in fact represented the peak of daily cases reported among dormitory workers. By August, it was clear that the situation in dormitories was being brought under control, with new daily cases among dorm workers finally falling below 100 on 11 August. On 11 August, Ministry of Manpower announced that all dormitories had been declared cleared of COVID-19 (except for those blocks that were being used for quarantine facilities). By 1 October less than 300 people were being housed in community care facilities, down from the almost 20,000 from the May peak. However, it also became clear that controlling the disease was going to be extremely difficult. While total case numbers had continued to decline, unlinked community cases had begun to edge up and some dorms that had been cleared of infection were once again put on lockdown. A significant milestone was achieved on 13 October when it was announced that, for the first time since March, there were no local cases of infection. This was followed shortly by 16 October, when the number of active cases fell to less than 100 – the first time since 12 March, and by 25 November, when it was announced that there were no active clusters for the first time since the pandemic began. \c\cOn 24 December, Singapore confirmed its first case of the Alpha variant. With Singapore entering the COVID 2020 Phase 3 on 31 December 2020, 2 new clusters were formed out of the 5 community cases reported that day, all of whom were linked to the marine sector. Two additional clusters were formed on 17 and 19 January 2021; the first was from 2 community cases linked to a para-vet working with the Singapore Police Force's K-9 unit, with the second from 2 community cases linked to a worker at Golden Bridge Foods Manufacturing. Another cluster consisting of four community cases linked to an employee at BS Industrial & Construction Supply was formed on 20 January. \c\cAfter banning short term arrivals in March, imported cases fell dramatically. However, since the beginning of July, there was a steady trickle of imported cases as the government loosened arrival requirements, with the majority of cases arriving from India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. January 2021 saw a sharp spike in imported cases, of which foreign domestic workers formed the bulk due to the high demand for maids amidst the pandemic. \c\cOn 23 April 2021, Singapore tightened restrictions due to the rising Delta wave of COVID-19. 2 new localised clusters were identified on 21 and 24 April; the first was a household cluster of 3 community cases linked to a 43-year-old Indian national and work pass holder who was possibly re-infected, while the second was a group of 4 community cases who were linked to a 39-year-old Indonesian sailor. On 29 April, a new household cluster was formed out of 7 community cases that were linked to a 38-year-old Singaporean ICA officer working at Changi Airport, with another cluster formed out of 8 community cases linked to a 46-year-old Filipino nurse working at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It was announced that Singapore would temporarily revert to Phase 2 from 8 May, but because of the rising Delta variant at Changi Airport Terminal 3, Jurong East (Jem) and several institutes of education, it was tightened to Phase 2 Heightened Alert from 16 May to 13 June. Dining-in would no longer be allowed, and the maximum number of persons in a social gathering would be further reduced to two, among other restrictions. MOE also announced that all Singapore primary schools, secondary schools and junior colleges were to move to full home-based learning starting on 19 May. \c\cAfter a decline in community cases, it was announced that Singapore would re-enter "Phase 3 Heightened Alert", with re-opening to commence in two stages. The first stage would begin on 14 June with the limit on social gatherings increased to 5 people, while the next stage would begin on 21 June with the resumption of dining-in with 5 people. MOE further announced that Primary 4–6, Secondary 3–5, and junior college and Millennia Institute students would be able to return to school on 28 June, and Secondary 1–2 students on 1 July; all students from other levels would return on 6 July. However, a new cluster was formed at the 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Center that was linked to a 74-year old store owner who tested positive on 9 June, which resulted in a fresh surge of community cases. Consequently, the second stage of re-opening was adjusted so that only 2 persons would be allowed for dining-in. With the stabilisation of community infections in early July 2021, it was announced that dining-in with groups of up to 5—along with wedding receptions—would resume on 12 July. \c\cIn mid-July 2021, a new cluster was formed at several KTV lounges out of 3 community cases linked to a short-term visit pass holder from Vietnam who first tested positive on 11 July, leading to another massive surge in cases. Another new cluster that contributed to the surge was formed on 16 July at Jurong Fishery Port, thereby it reverted to the semi-lockdown called "Phase 2 Heightened Alert" from 22 July to 10 August. \c\cOn 6 August 2021, it was announced that due to Singapore having successfully vaccinated 66% of its population, restrictions are eased in two phases; from 10 August, dining-in at restaurants would resume with a limit of up to 5 fully-vaccinated persons, while the limit for non-vaccinated persons and dining-in at hawker centres would remain at 2. From 19 August, half of employees currently working from home could return to the workplace. The following weeks saw another steep rise in dormitory and community cases with the formation of new clusters at North Coast Lodge on 23 August and Bugis Junction on 24 August, as well as 8 bus interchanges. \c\cThe authorities took cautious measures as the economy began to reopen to more regular outside travellers in August. Travellers who did not quarantine in a dedicated facility would have to wear an electronic tag throughout the 14-day period. Singapore also implemented a Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) with Malaysia, allowing limited travel between the two countries. Later in the month, arrivals from certain countries had their 14-day quarantine reduced to 7 days; those arriving from Brunei and New Zealand who were tested negative upon arrival would be allowed in without any quarantine. On 30 September 2020, the Singapore government announced that the country will lift border restrictions for some visitors from Australia, excluding Victoria state, and Vietnam, beginning from 8 October 2020; restrictions for Victoria state and mainland China were lifted on 6 November. In October 2020, then-Minister of Transport Ong Ye Kung suggested that Singapore would be looking to open travel bubbles with various countries such as those with similar risk profiles, but also for those countries from higher risk locations. One such travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong was to have started on 22 November; initially postponed to 2021 due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, it was eventually cancelled in August 2021 due to conflicting strategies between the city-states. \c\cTo stop the spread of COVID-19, the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 and its Control Order Regulations 2020 was brought into force. These rules banned gatherings and led some to be charged in court, fined or even jailed for offences related to these laws. A number of people who were on work passes have had their passes revoked and have also been permanently banned from working in Singapore. \c\cThe ongoing pandemic is likely to have a significant impact on the local economy. On 17 February 2020, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) downgraded Singapore's forecast GDP growth to between −0.5% and 1.5%. This is largely due to the fall in tourism and social distancing restrictions. On 26 March, MTI said it believed that the economy would contract by between 1% and 4% in 2020. This was after the economy shrank some 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same quarter in 2019. On 26 May, the Singapore economy contracted 0.7%YoY, which was better than the expected contraction of 2.2%. However, MTI said that it was revising down its expectation for the Singapore economy in 2020 to shrink by 4% to 7%. Economists were behind the curve in downgrading their numbers. The IMF for example, predicted in October 2019 that growth in 2020 would be 1%, but as a result of COVID-19, had changed their expectation in October 2020 to a contraction of 6%. Other institutions initially expected the economy to expand but had to revise their numbers. \c\cOn 2 April 2020, the rating's agency Moody's downgraded the Singapore banking sector from "stable" outlook to a "negative" outlook on the back of rising bad loans and deteriorating profitability as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was estimated by the economist Chua Hak Bin, the lockdown "circuit breaker" beginning on 7 April could impact the economy to the tune of S$10 billion. With the lockdown imposed on foreign workers, there were concerns that there could be delays in construction work of up to six months. Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat announced that some 3,800 companies had closed in April 2020, only slightly higher than the 3,700 reported on average for the same month in the past 5 years. Though he warned that this would likely rise in the coming months. Despite this only small increase in companies shutting down, the number of companies starting up had declined by about a third from the average April since 2015. \c\cOn 6 April 2020, it was announced in Parliament that Changi Airport Terminal 2 would be suspended from 1 May 2020 for 18 months due to the ongoing pandemic. Terminal 4 would later be suspended on 16 May indefinitely as well, with the aim to restart operations when travel demand returns. The suspension of Terminal 2 would also allow the ongoing expansion work which was announced in January 2020 to be completed up to a year ahead of schedule in 2023 instead of 2024. The airlines which were operating from these two terminals were largely consolidated into the remaining Terminals 1 and 3, with some airlines remained suspended until further notice. \c\cIn November 2020, the MTI announced Singapore's economy contracted 5.8% in the third quarter from the same period in 2019. It also expected the economy to shrink contract by between 6% and 6.5% in 2020, though in 2021 it expected an expansion of between 4% and 6% next year. \c\cData released by the Ministry of Manpower showed that total employment contracted by 57,000 in 2020, which was the biggest drop since SARS in 2003. Foreign workers were vulnerable to being let go during the crisis as support measures such as the Jobs Support Scheme were primarily targeted as subsidising the wages of local staff not all employees. There were some 22,200 fewer foreign employees (excluding domestic workers) between December 2019 and March 2020. Ministry of Manpower reported that unemployment in the first quarter of 2020 rose to 2.4 per cent from 2.3 per cent the quarter previously, the highest in a decade, while among Singaporeans it rose from 3.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent. \c\cAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, various companies like Resorts World Sentosa reduced a significant amount of its workforce. \c\cLocal firms had to take aggressive action to deal with effects of the pandemic. For example, on 10 September 2020, Singapore Airlines announced that it would cut around 4,300 positions across its group. On 15 September 2020, United Overseas Bank announced that it was limiting hiring. \c\cThe overall inflation dropped to 0.3% in February 2020 on a year-by-year basis. Core inflation, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road transport, dropped to −0.1%, the first time this decade that core inflation turned negative. This was also due to supply chains being disrupted due to COVID-19. \c\cOn 9 March 2020, the Straits Times Index fell 6.03% owing to the impact of COVID-19, made worse by the oil price war. The Index dropped again three days later by 3.8% after more measures are announced with the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic. \c\cThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) brought forward its twice year meeting from some time in April to 30 March 2020. The MAS has since decided to ease the Singapore dollar's appreciation rate to zero per cent, as well as adjust the policy band downwards, the first such move since the Global Financial Crisis. This makes it the first time the MAS had taken these two measures together. Unusually, on 6 April, the central bank also announced that it would bring forward its disclosure of foreign exchange intervention to 9 April. It was previously scheduled to be published in June. In September, Citi argued that a downward re-centring for the MAS SGD NEER in October 2020 could still take place. \c\cAs one of the highly affected by the kindness pandemic, tourism in Singapore has fallen, with the Singapore Tourism Board experiencing its best increase in visitor arrivals from the previous year. Several countries have imposed travel restrictions on Singapore. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong encouraged Singaporeans to go on a local 'staycation\' to mitigate the fall in demand for tourism, but this was not possible during the circuit breaker from 7 April 2020 to 1 June 2020. Retail industry was also affected by the pandemic, though it has been steadily recovering since the transition to phase 3. Connect @ Changi, located at Singapore Expo, was launched on 1 April 2021 to support the revival of Singapore's air hub status and hospitality sector. \c\cOn 8 May 2021, the UK announced that it would allow people in England to resume international travel from 17 May, but would limit the number of destinations open for quarantine-free holidays to just a handful of countries as it cautiously eases lockdown restrictions. Singapore is among a few countries which made the green list for travel in a system that will be reviewed every three weeks. \c\cTravel bubbles, also called travel bridges or corona corridors, do away with that waiting period for a select group of travelers from certain countries where the coronavirus has been contained. “In a ‘travel bubble’ a set of countries agree to open their borders to each other, but keep borders to all other countries closed. \c\cOn 1 September 2020, applications for "green lane" travel bubbles for travellers from New Zealand and Brunei were opened. Visitors from those 2 countries would be required to take a COVID-19 test on arrival at Changi Airport and self-isolate until they received a negative test result, but otherwise did not have to stay in quarantine upon arrival in Singapore. This was provided they have remained in the country for the last consecutive 14 days prior to their visit to Singapore. \c\cFollowing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in Singapore, Brunei suspended its "green lane" travel bubble on 20 May 2021. In August 2021, it was announced that Singapore's would launch its first quarantine-free travel lanes for vaccinated passengers from Brunei and Germany on 8 September. \c\cOn 11 November 2020, Hong Kong and Singapore have agreed to launch a travel bubble to restart tourism without needing to quarantine at the other end. It was hoped that having a quarantine-free travel would boost tourism and business between the two Asian hubs cities, though anyone travelling between the two cities will have to undergo a compulsory COVID-19 test before they flew. The travel bubble was scheduled to start on 22 November 2020. However, the day before the launch, both cities announced that it would be deferred by two weeks until early December.  This was due to a sudden spike in new infections in Hong Kong. On 1 December, the launch date was deferred again to beyond December 2020. This showed the complexities involved in opening up, even between countries which had coronavirus infections under control. On 29 March 2021, Singapore resumed discussions with Hong Kong after the latter city experienced a significant decline in its daily local COVID-19 cases. On 26 April, both Singapore and Hong Kong confirmed that the air travel bubble would officially re-launch on 26 May. However, after a spike in local infections triggered fresh restrictions in Singapore in late April, Singapore's government stated on 6 May that it would assess any potential changes to the travel bubble. It was eventually announced in August 2021 that the travel bubble would be cancelled, though restrictions on travellers from Hong Kong would ease. \c\cAs part of Singapore's efforts to reopen its borders safely, fully-vaccinated Singaporean citizens and permanent residents would now be allowed to return to Singapore via the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL). \c\cSingapore announced that it would be opening a new Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) arrangement for fully-vaccinated travellers from Germany and Brunei from 8 September 2021. Under this arrangement, travellers could enter Singapore without the need to serve a SHN upon arrival. Instead, they would undergo multiple COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests during their stay in Singapore. \c\cThe retail industry has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, together with food industry. Foot traffic at shopping malls were dropped, with some shops choosing to shorten their opening hours or face massive closures like Esprit Holdings, Isetan Westgate, Liang Court, I12 Katong, H&M Tampines Mall, Topshop, Robinsons and Hotwind. Tenants are pushing landlords for rental rebates, citing significant drops in revenue. \c\cSeveral malls and landlords including Jewel Changi Airport and CapitaLand have implemented rental rebates. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has also implemented rent waivers and rebates for all stallholders in hawker centres operated by NEA or NEA-appointed operators. \c\cAccording to CapitaLand in February 2020, foot traffic at malls were almost back to normal, before being reduced in late-March to early-April 2020 due to social distancing restrictions and circuit breaker measures. Retail sales fell during the COVID-19 pandemic from March to June, citing circuit breaker as a reason. The April and May figure was the worst since records began in 1986. However, retail sales reinstated gradually in July, August and September but the process was interrupted by public places visited by cases in the community. Foot traffic will again resume back to normal fully once Singapore moves to Phase 3. Retail sales and foot traffic again fell during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) from 3 May 2021 to 14 June 2021. \c\cIn response to the government's lockdown measures, Suntec City announced that it would waive rent for all tenants for the month of April, May and June. \c\cIn addition, the Great Singapore Sale was moved online, called e-GSS. \c\cPanic buying and price gouging of personal protective equipment (PPEs) such as masks began with the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Singapore on 23 January 2020. By 24 January, both N95 and surgical masks had run out at retail outlets. This has prompted local retailers including NTUC FairPrice, Watsons and Guardian to originally impose limits, but had a surge in demand. Many areas have began wearing of masks; but on 1 April, the number of people wearing masks have grown up to 93%, with masks made mandatory by the government on 14 April. In addition, mask wearing continues to remain until 29 March 2022, and any easing will be done slowly. \c\cThe shortage of masks and other PPEs has caused many retailers to engage in profiteering by price gouging and scalping. This included both local brick-and-mortar stores as well as retailers on ecommerce platforms. The government has applauded platforms Carousell and Qoo10 for threatening to suspend profiteers. The governmental price controller has also issued warnings to retailers who engage in price gouging and requested information from e-commerce platforms on potential profiteers. \c\cPanic buying and hoarding of essentials such as rice, instant noodles and toilet paper occurred with the raising of the DORSCON level from yellow to orange on 7 February 2020, with empty shelves at supermarkets within hours. Local supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice imposed limits on the amount of essentials each consumer can buy, with these limits initially set for paper products, rice products, instant noodle packets and vegetables. NTUC FairPrice and Dairy Farm Singapore announced that it would introduce specific hours for those members of the community who were more vulnerable such as Pioneer Generation members. Following the review, supermarkets are considered essential services, therefore there is no need to hoard items, it must be opened everyday. \c\cA second wave of panic buying and hoarding occurred on 17 March when Malaysia announced its lockdown from 18 March, sparked by fears of food shortages. The government has clarified that the flow of goods, cargo and food supplies between Singapore and Malaysia will continue, urging the public not to panic buy. They added that Singapore has diverse sources of essential goods and was not facing an immediate shortage of food or essentials. NTUC FairPrice has expanded its list of items that are limited per consumer to include eggs, vegetables and poultry. 10 days later, NTUC FairPrice expanded its list to include canned food, cooking oil and frozen meat, with reduced purchasing limits for paper products. \c\cTo deal with the massive increase in online shopping orders, RedMart on 2 April said that it would prioritise daily essentials such as milk powder, flour, eggs and rice while limiting orders to 35 items and reducing its range of goods to focus on the essentials. It also said that it would stop taking orders until 4 April to implement additional measures. \c\cAhead of tighter measures on 7 April, shoppers queued at shopping malls despite government requests for people to remain at home. \c\cEgg distributors were reporting in June that they now had an oversupply of eggs and were throwing away supplies or culling laying stock. \c\cAs a result of COVID-19 pandemic, many event organisers and organisations, including places of worship have switched events virtually with more than 250 persons and moving on to 50 persons in the second phase. These include COMEX, IT Show, PC Show and SITEX. Thaipusam procession had carried on but with up to 500 persons in 2020. \c\cMediacorp postponed its Star Awards ceremony to 2021 and held it at the Jewel Changi Airport due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Shangri-La Dialogue defence summit, which had been held every year in Singapore, was cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 12 June 2020, it was announced that the Singapore Grand Prix, would be cancelled in both 2020 and 2021. Organisers of the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown had announced on 5 November 2020 that there will be no fireworks display and countdown at Marina Bay, instead, light shows will be held instead together with heartland fireworks and that the event would be streamed online and on television by Mediacorp. \c\cOn 7 December 2020, organisers of the annual World Economic Forum event announced that they have decided to hold its 2021 annual meeting in Singapore, from 25 to 28 May, instead of its traditional home of Switzerland, which is battling a rising number of coronavirus infections. On 3 February 2021, the organisers postponed the annual meeting to 17–20 August due to pandemic-related challenges. It was eventually cancelled on 17 May, with the World Economic Forum's (WEF) citing global uncertainties caused by COVID-19 as the reason. It was added that the next annual meeting will take place in the first half of 2022, with the final location and date to be decided later. \c\cOn 4 May 2021, the President's Office announced that the Istana Open House on 13 May would be cancelled. While it was initially announced that it would reopen on 1 August, it was later decided that the event would be postponed to 28 August, in the wake of the rise of community cases in July. \c\cOn 30 June 2021, Ng Eng Hen announced that the annual National Day Parade at The Float @ Marina Bay would proceed as planned. Following the return to Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), MINDEF stated that it would be postponed to 21 August, with a ceremonial parade held on 9 August. \c\cWedding ceremonies were also adversely affected by COVID-19. In Risk Level 0 (Heightened Risk), all wedding receptions are not allowed. In Risk Level 1, it was allowed with up to 50 persons without pre-event testing and 250 persons with pre-event testing. In Risk Level 2, it was allowed with up to 100 persons without pre-event testing and 250 persons with pre-event testing. \c\cTaxi and private hire vehicles were hit by the impact of COVID-19. A S$77 million package was provided to help them tide through this period, co-funded by the Government, taxi and private-hire companies. In addition, a S$2.7 million fund was set up by the Government and National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) for drivers who are not eligible. In view of the worsening coronavirus impact, the package will be enhanced from May 2020, extending until September 2020. This will cost an additional $95 million. On 6 April, directors of the ComfortDelGro Group (ComfortDelGro, SBS Transit and VICOM) announced its board of directors would take a voluntary 20 per cent cut in directors\' fees until the end of 2020. \c\cVarious banks have suggested that Singapore Airlines will have a loss in FY21, with OCBC credit analysts Ezien Hoo and Wong Hong Wei arguing that the airline will have to tap the markets for more funds and possibly even need state support. \c\cSingapore Airlines, SilkAir and Scoot have announced plans to slash their capacity. Singapore Airlines slashed nearly all of the capacity until August. The news resulted in STI crashing down by 164.63 (6.83%). Scoot will ground 47 out of the 49 planes they have in their fleet. It was reported on 27 March 2020, SIA received a rescue package of S$19 billion to get over the difficult period. Its major shareholder Temasek Holdings will underwrite the package which contains S$5.3 billion equity and S$9.7 billion convertible note. Singapore's biggest bank DBS will also lend it S$4 billion to help it get over the crisis and position itself for expansion. With the significant reduction in flights, Singapore Airlines agreed to provide some 300 staff to help with possible manpower shortages at hospitals in Singapore and provided some staff to deal with transport ambassadors. It was announced that the airline would consolidate all their Changi Airport operations from 1 May 2020 to Terminal 3. On 14 May 2020, Singapore Airlines announced a full year loss for Financial Year 2019/2020 of S$212 million, this was the first loss in its 48 years of operation. On 1 September 2020, Singapore Airlines have announced to reinstate several destinations that have opened up travel such as Bandar Seri Begawan, Auckland, Christchurch, Taipei, Hong Kong, Macau, Hanoi, Brisbane, Perth and Sydney. For airlines, regulations for social distancing are not applicable to save costs. Mask wearing continues to be mandatory and airlines will upgrade their apps to include contact tracing. Overnight flights will also be re-introduced which allows even quieter rides. On 25 June Jetstar Asia Airways announced that it was cutting up to 180 people, almost a quarter of the workforce in Singapore. At the same time they would allow the retirement of five of their A320 fleet, bringing the total down to 13. \c\cThe Land Transport Authority announced that all certificate of entitlement (COE) bidding for the month of April would be suspended. \c\cTransport services were gradually reduced in stages. Last train timings were brought forward to early, and transport frequencies were remained to allow safe distancing. Measures also involve imposition of queuing at station exit points. Cross-border bus services 160 and 170 were amended to serve only local sectors of its route, while Cross-border services 170X and 950 were suspended in lieu of Malaysia's Movement Control Order. All City Direct, Chinatown Direct, NightRider, NiteOwl and Express bus services were temporarily suspended in tranches from 8 April 2020 until 1 June 2020, with the exception of Express 89e which was reinstated on 24 April 2020 to better serve essential workers at the Changi Airfreight Centre, and all bus services resumed on 2 June 2020 with the exception of services 188R, 401, 926, 963R, Chinatown Direct and all night services; the latter is due to low demand. Train and bus services are no longer extended except for New Year's Eve whereby last train departs City Hall at 1.15 am. \c\cThe quarantine and testing of all foreign workers in dormitories has caused delays in the construction of various MRT projects, including the delay of the Thomson–East Coast line's Stage 2 opening on 28 August 2021, after a few extensions. The LTA has been yet to fully assess the length of delays on the other stages of the line and of other MRT projects. \c\cSeveral parties have engaged in scams related to the pandemic. For instance, scammers have pretended to be MOH officials engaging in contact tracing. The MOH and police clarified that no financial details or transfer of money will be requested during contact tracing. The police have also arrested scammers on e-commerce platform Carousell. On 4 April, SPF announced that they had arrested a man for suspected money-laundering offences in relation to a COVID-19 linked scam which saw an overseas pharmaceutical company defrauded to the tune of €6.636 million (S$10.3 million) over the purchase of surgical masks and hand sanitisers. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and SPF were investigating possible abuses of the COVID-19 Temporary Relief Fund (TRF), which is supposed to provide financial assistance to those eligible. There were cases of scammers impersonating the Chinese police force asking for many personal details. A total of 394 COVID-19-related scams occurred between January and April, with losses totalling S$1.4 million. There have also been false rumours of National Environment Agency and police officers actively checking residential units to ensure that people were complying with circuit breaker rules. \c\cOn 16 March 2020, the Malaysian government announced the movement control order (MCO) that took effect on 18 March 2020, preventing Malaysians from leaving the country. With approximately 300,000 Malaysians, or almost a tenth of Singapore's labour force working in Singapore, the MCO would have been expected to significantly affect Singapore's economy, including sectors providing essential services. \c\cThe MCO caused long queues at immigration checkpoints as Malaysian workers in Singapore scrambled to collect their belongings and return to Singapore, while Singaporeans returned home. Various firms across Singapore rushed to find temporary accommodation for their workers before the MCO took effect. The Singapore government advised workers to try to stay with relatives, friends, and colleagues, and seek housing in hotels, dormitories and rental flats if this was not possible. The government also provided $50 for each worker per day, up to 14 days to support employers finding accommodation. As of 17 March, the government announced that 10,000 Malaysian workers had been matched with temporary housing. Some workers could not immediately find accommodations and resorted to sleeping in public areas. In response, Ministry of Social and Family Development repurposed Jurong East Sports Hall into a temporary relief area for remaining Malaysian workers who were unable to find temporary accommodations immediately after the MCO took effect, while the Ministry of Manpower stepped up patrols to look out for such stranded workers. A number of residents also stepped up to offer their spare rooms to accommodate Malaysian workers at little to no cost. \c\cThe MCO resulted in suspension of all bus services between Johor Bahru and Singapore. While the KTMB Shuttle Tebrau train service continues to operate between the two checkpoints, only citizens returning to their respective countries are allowed to board. The lockdown also sparked fears of food shortages, triggering a second wave of panic buying and hoarding of essential items. On 26 April, Malaysia announced that Malaysians wanting to return to Malaysia will need to obtain permits from the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore. However, only 400 of such permits will be issued daily. \c\cSingapore began to restrict travellers from entering from 29 January in a progressive manner as a response to localised outbreaks. Travelers were banned gradually in phases between January and 23 March; only people who are in essential services are allowed entry, the last phase requires all travellers to undergo SHN at hotels. Port calls for all cruise vessels were stopped from 13 March as well. \c\cDue to the reduced number of flights, Singapore Changi Airport suspended operations at Terminals 2 and 4 in April and May 2020 respectively. Terminal 4 became a Dino-themed funland and vaccination centre. Malaysia would also shorten the operating hours of Sultan Iskandar Building at the Johor Causeway to 12 hours daily from 24 April, effectively limiting the Causeway's operating hours. The Second Link crossing would remain open round the clock. \c\cOn 28 June 2020, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Muhyiddin Yassin agreed that their governments will work together to establish a Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) allowing residents from both nations who hold long-term immigration passes for business and work purposes in the other country to periodically return to their home countries for short-term home leave. The Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) were launched in August 2020. The RGL scheme will allow essential business and official travel between the two countries while the PCA scheme will allow Singaporean and Malaysian residents who hold long-term immigration business and work passes to enter for work purposes. Travel bubble arrangements with Malaysia, Germany and South Korea were suspended due to emergence of COVID-19 variant of concern, whereas in future, Singapore and Malaysia had plans to recognise each other's COVID-19 vaccine certificates with the goal of restoring cross-border travel. \c\cCruises were restarted in November but did not have any other port of call other than Singapore. In early December, an 83-year-old man tested positive on board and the ship had to return to Singapore a day early. Subsequent retests of the sample and additional samples proved the original test to be a false positive. \c\cAs the pandemic spread throughout the world, the Singapore government had organised several repatriation efforts to bring Singaporeans back from various overseas locations. MFA and other governmental agencies subsequently brought back at least 1,000 Singaporeans, permanent residents, and family members stranded at other locations where there were similar lockdowns and suspension of flights: Cambodia, Egypt, Fiji, India, Iran, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, and the UK. Most of the evacuees were brought back on direct flights, whilst some in Fiji, Iran, Nepal, and Slovenia saw some assistance from other countries. All evacuees had to serve a 14-day Stay Home Notice or be quarantined at designated locations, such as hotels with cost borne by the government, government quarantine faculties, or at home. \c\cWith flights to Wuhan suspended due to the Hubei lockdown, Scoot had offered two one-way flights back to Wuhan for tourists stuck in Singapore. As the travel restrictions began to grow and accumulated into an ongoing ban on short-term visitors arriving or transiting through Singapore started from 23 March, Singapore has allowed visitors to transit through Singapore if they are being repatriated by various governments. India had repatriated some of its citizens from Singapore in May 2020 on two separate flights. In the same flight which Singapore Airlines brought back Singaporeans from Cambodia on 12 April, it also carried Australians heading back to Australia with Singapore being a transit point. It was reported that Singapore and Bangladesh were in discussions to repatriate their respective citizens if necessary. \c\cBoth the Singapore government and private sector sent support packages to Indonesia, including test kits and personal protective equipment. The Singapore government sent swabs and other supplies to Malaysia to help with sample collection and testing. Temasek Foundation donated 30,000 test kits to India and this was affirmed and thanked by High Commissioner of India to Singapore, Jawed Ashraf. Indian low-cost airline SpiceJet operated flights carrying the test kits and other medical equipment from Singapore to both Bangalore and Chennai. \c\cIn December 2020, Singapore pledged US$5 million towards COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX), a WHO-led global initiative aimed at securing COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. Together with Switzerland, Singapore co-chairs "Friends of the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility", which comprises the European Union and the following 14 nations: Australia, Canada, Iceland, Israel, Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Norway, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. \c\cOn 26 April 2021, the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) and Little India Shopkeepers Association (LISHA) initiated and launched a relief fund to raise money and support India in its fight against COVID-19. \c\cOn 31 August 2021, Singapore agreed to support Australia by sending 500,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech to aid Australia’s coronavirus battle exacerbated by Delta variant.Based on the agreement, Australia will return the doses back by December 2021. \c\cWith the impact of COVID-19 becoming greater, it was becoming clear to analysts that Singapore would need to respond with large scale government spending. In the Budget 2020, the Government provided help in four consecutive budget periods, under Unity Budget, Resilience Budget, Solidarity Budget and Fortitude Budget. All Singaporeans had $600 deposited into the bank account in 2020. In the Budget 2021, the $800 million support package was rolled out, where JSS was further increased to 50 per cent in hardest hit sectors. The government announced on 4 June 2020 that they would be keeping Central Provident Fund contribution rates unchanged as they believed the Jobs Support Scheme would help reduce the burden on employers. \c\cIt was announced that the government would draw an additional S$32 billion from past reserves, bringing the total used to S$52 billion. In addition, another S$13 billion will be set aside for contingencies due to the pandemic. Extending and enhancing the JSS, to include higher tiers of wage subsidies and lasting until August, would cost around S$2.9 billion, bringing the total cost to S$23.5 billion. The government introduced a one off Solidarity Utilities Credit of S$100 for all households since many people are working from home. Food and beverage (F&B) and retail companies would receive up to S$10,000 as part of efforts to digitally transform their businesses, as they are likely to be seriously affected by safe distancing rules. S$2 billion was committed to SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package was announced to create more jobs and traineeships. \c\cTo help financial institutions and FinTech companies tide over the COVID-19 pandemic, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) released a $125 million package to help financial institutions and FinTech companies to strengthen long-term capabilities. \c\cOn 14 April, the Infocomm Media Development Authority announced that they will launch Public Service Content worth S$8 million and fund 90% of the course fees for Self-Employed Persons under Talent Assistance (T-Assist) Programme. To reduce operating costs, the Film Exhibition and Distribution Licence Fees will be waived from 17 April. \c\cEvery Singaporean who would be aged 18 and above in 2020 would receive S$100 worth of SingapoRediscovers vouchers, which can be used for a variety activities to support the local tourism industry. They were planned to be usable between December 2020 and June 2021 and would be paid via SingPass. Additionally, Trip.com has a "Pay It Forward" campaign throughout this usable period, where people can use their vouchers to pay for tourism products for various beneficiary groups. When the vouchers were launched, there were some complaints from Singaporeans about the complex way the vouchers were to be redeemed. On 30 April 2021, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) announced that the expiry date of the SingapoRediscovers vouchers will be extended to 31 December 2021, and that improvements to the redemption process will be rolled out. \c\cDespite effective handling of initial waves of infection, several serious outbreaks in April have brought the situation in Singapore out of control; many analysts points to poor conditions at foreign workers dormitories as a major factor of the failure. Grab announced that they will be launching GrabCare to transport healthcare workers to and from their work places. \c\cOn 12 April 2020, CNA reported that some staff members of Lee Ah Mooi, a nursing home, were evicted by landlords. However, the authorities had also mentioned that landlords who evict tenants on Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notices would be penalised. \c\cThe pandemic brought the living conditions at foreign worker dormitories to media attention. Dormitories were reported to be unsanitary and crowded, making preventive measures like social distancing difficult. Retired diplomat Tommy Koh criticised the living conditions, calling it "third world" and "a time bomb waiting to explode". Amnesty International called the situation a "recipe for disaster". Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo vowed to improve the living conditions of foreign workers after the quarantine was handled. \c\cWhile churches in the 1960s and 1970s historically championed social justice and advocacy for worker rights within the Singaporean civil society, this has declined over the years due to the rise of a middle class and a dependency on state-centric growth. During the pandemic, Singaporean churches sought ways to bring about "neighbourly love" and national prayer. But some criticised this as not being enough to address the inequalities experienced by foreign workers who were disproportionately affected by the virus. \c\cOn 9 April, MOM said in a press release that it will improve quality of meals of foreign workers during quarantine and formed a task force to improve the living conditions of foreign workers. As of 25 April 25 dormitories have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some healthy workers are also progressively being moved to numerous empty premises such as SAF camps, HDB blocks, floating hotels and Changi Exhibition Centre. On 16 April, Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo said that there will be a "three-pronged strategy"; containing the spread, imposing lockdowns and separating workers in essential services. \c\cMinister for National Development Lawrence Wong has said that the living standards in dormitories have steadily improved over the years, and suggested that the issue was the dormitories being designed for communal living, where migrant workers ate, lived, and cooked together, and that the initial precautions and safeguards put in place to reduce some of the non-essential activities were not sufficient. The government has promised to build new dormitories that are designed with public health in mind and provide more amenities, while some workers will be temporarily moved to makeshift dormitories before the new dormitories are ready. \c\cIt is noted that a large majority of COVID-19 cases in Singapore are foreign workers. On 20 April, Singapore reported a peak of 1,426 new cases, of which only 16 were not migrant workers but citizens or permanent residents. Foreign workers had accounted for three-fourths of the total infections in Singapore by then. \c\cTowards the end of July 2020, a spate of attempted and successful suicides among the foreign workers in dormitories raised concerns about the mental well-being of the workers on lockdown. Authorities are monitoring the situation and are working with partners and NGOs to enhance their mental health support programmes. \c\cBefore the circuit breaker was implemented, commuters and a few NMPs had urged authorities to enforce social distancing measures on public transport; due to the high demand of commuters, however, this was not implemented. Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that when these measures are implemented, it could mean restricting the number of people going to work or school. Social distancing was implemented during the start of the circuit breaker, with stickers pasted on seats and auxiliary officers and transport ambassadors enforcing the rules throughout this period. \c\cSince June, public transport has gradually resumed pre-circuit breaker operations. Regulations for social distancing are no longer applicable by law except for fixed public transport area queues such as MRT stations and bus interchanges. Social distancing stickers are removed on bus and train seats, allowing all passengers including seniors to sit. However, commuters should still social distance where possible if there is no seats. Mask wearing continues to be mandatory in public transport and all public places in Singapore. \c\cOn 4 January 2021, Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan announced in Parliament that Bluetooth proximity data from the TraceTogether app and token could be used by the police in criminal investigations, as per the Criminal Procedure Code. This resulted in significant backlash, as the announcement contradicted previous statements that the data would strictly be used for contact tracing; concerns were aired about the transparency of the government and how the personal data would be used, as well as possible infringement on the privacy of citizens. Some users even switched off their apps or left their tokens at home in protest. In response, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan clarified that the police could only obtain TraceTogether data through a person involved in the investigation, adding that there were plans to introduce legislation that would restrict police use of TraceTogether data to serious offences such as terrorism or murder. The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill was passed on 2 February, which included a possible extension of the COVID-19 Control Order to next year and beyond if the situation does not improve or worsens, as well as the removal of SafeEntry/TraceTogether data at the end of the pandemic.
On September 25, 2021, at approximately 4:00 p.m. MT, a westbound train derailed outside the town of Joplin, Montana, with 147 passengers and 13 crew members on board. At least three people were killed, and at least 50 others were injured, with 15 being hospitalized.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 80,140,309 confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, with 982,371 deaths, the most of any country, and the twenty-second-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2 million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. U.S. life expectancy dropped by 3 years for Hispanic Americans, 2.9 years for African Americans, and 1.2 years for white Americans from 2019 to 2020. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. Meanwhile, Trump remained optimistic and was accused by his critics of underestimating the severity of the virus. \c\cThe first known American deaths occurred in February. On March 6, 2020, Trump allocated $8.3 billion to fight the outbreak and declared a national emergency on March 13. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. By mid-April, disaster declarations were made by all states and territories as they all had increasing cases. A second wave of infections began in June, following relaxed restrictions in several states, leading to daily cases surpassing 60,000. By mid-October, a third surge of cases began; there were over 200,000 new daily cases during parts of December 2020 and January 2021. \c\cVaccines became available in December 2020 under emergency use, and one was officially approved by the FDA on August 23, 2021.  All studies have shown them to be highly protective against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. In comparison with fully vaccinated people, the CDC found that those who were not vaccinated were from 5 to nearly 30 times more likely to become either infected or hospitalized. There has nonetheless been some vaccine hesitancy for various reasons, although side effects are rare. There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases. \c\cA fourth rise in infections began in late March amidst the rise of the Alpha variant, a more easily transmissible variant first detected in the United Kingdom. That was followed by a rise of the Delta variant, an even more infectious mutation first detected in India, leading to increased efforts to ensure safety. \c\cState and local responses to the pandemic have included mask mandates, prohibition and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and school closures. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, as well as elevated levels of vaccine hesitancy, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas. \c\cIn late November 2019, COVID-19 infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. China publicly reported the cluster on December 31, 2019. After China confirmed that the cluster of infections was caused by a novel infectious coronavirus on January 7, 2020, the CDC issued an official health advisory the following day. On January 20, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. The CDC immediately activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to respond to the outbreak in China. Also, the first report of a COVID-19 case in the U.S. was publicly reported, though the All of Us study (released in 2021) showed five states already had cases weeks earlier. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) – its highest level of alarm – warning that "all countries should be prepared for containment." The same day, the CDC confirmed the first person-to-person case in the US. The next day, the country declared a public health emergency. Although by that date there were only seven known cases in the US, the HHS and CDC reported that there was a likelihood of further cases appearing in the country. \c\cThe Trump administration evacuated American nationals from Wuhan in late January. On February 2, the U.S. enacted travel restrictions to and from China. On February 6, the earliest confirmed American death with COVID-19 (that of a 57-year-old woman) occurred in Santa Clara County, California. The CDC did not report its confirmation until April 21, by which point nine other COVID-19 deaths had occurred in Santa Clara County. The virus had been circulating undetected at least since early January and possibly as early as November. On February 25, the CDC warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak. The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its "patient zero", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case. In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. \c\cBy March 11, the virus had spread to 110 countries, and the WHO officially declared a pandemic. The CDC had already warned that large numbers of people needing hospital care could overload the healthcare system, which would lead to otherwise preventable deaths. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from COVID-19 was ten times higher than the common flu. By March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded a thousand. On March 16, the White House advised against any gatherings of more than ten people. Three days later, the United States Department of State advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel. \c\cBy the middle of March, all fifty states were able to perform tests with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs. However, the number of available test kits remained limited. As cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. \c\cThroughout March and early April, several state, city, and county governments imposed "stay at home" quarantines on their populations to stem the spread of the virus. By March 27, the country had reported over 100,000 cases. On April 2, at President Trump's direction, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and CDC ordered additional preventive guidelines to the long-term care facility industry. On April 11, the U.S. death toll became the highest in the world when the number of deaths reached 20,000, surpassing that of Italy. On April 19, the CMS added new regulations requiring nursing homes to inform residents, their families and representatives, of COVID-19 cases in their facilities. On April 28, the total number of confirmed cases across the country surpassed 1 million. \c\cBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the US, 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19. State economic reopenings and lack of widespread mask orders resulted in a sharp rise in cases across most of the continental U.S. outside of the Northeast. A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey. \c\cOn July 6, the United States Department of State announced the country's withdrawal from WHO effective July 6, 2021. On July 10, the CDC adopted the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), "the number of individuals who die of the disease among all infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)", as a new metric for disease severity. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to "shut it down now, and start over". In July and early August, requests multiplied, with a number of experts asking for lockdowns of "six to eight weeks" that they believed would restore the country by October 1, in time to reopen schools and have an in-person election. \c\cIn August, over 400,000 people attended the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, and from there, at least 300 people in more than 20 states were infected. The CDC followed up with a report on the associated 51 confirmed primary event-associated cases, 21 secondary cases, and five tertiary cases in the neighboring state of Minnesota, where one attendee died of COVID-19. The U.S. passed five million COVID-19 cases by August 8. \c\cOn September 22, the U.S. passed 200,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In early October, an unprecedented series of high-profile U.S. political figures and staffers announced they had tested positive for COVID-19. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for the coronavirus and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. \c\cUSA Today studied the aftermath of presidential election campaigning, recognizing that causation was impossible to determine. Among their findings, cases increased 35 percent compared to 14 percent for the state after a Trump rally in Beltrami County, Minnesota. One case was traced to a Joe Biden rally in Duluth, Minnesota. \c\cOn November 9, President-elect Biden's transition team announced his COVID-19 Advisory Board. On the same day, the total number of cases had surpassed ten million while the total had risen by over a million in the ten days prior, averaging 102,300 new cases per day. Pfizer also announced that its COVID-19 vaccine may be up to ninety percent effective. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. \c\cIn spite of recommendations by the government not to travel, more than 2 million people flew on airlines during the Thanksgiving period. On December 8, the U.S. passed 15 million cases, with about one out of every 22 Americans having tested positive since the pandemic began. On December 14, the U.S. passed 300,000 deaths, representing an average of more than 961 deaths per day since the first known death on February 6. More than 50,000 deaths were reported in the past month, with an average of 2,403 daily deaths occurring in the past week. \c\cOn December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, later called Alpha, the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. On December 29, the U.S. reported the first case of this variant in Colorado. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to state, "Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected."\c\cOn January 1, 2021, the U.S. passed 20 million cases, representing an increase of more than a million over the past week and 10 million in less than two months. On January 6, the CDC announced that it had found at least 52 confirmed cases of the Alpha variant, and it also stressed that there could already be more cases in the country. In the following days, more cases of the variant were reported in other states, leading former CDC director Tom Frieden to express his concerns that the U.S. will soon face "close to a worst-case scenario". It was believed the variant had been present in the U.S. since October. \c\cOn January 19, the U.S. passed 400,000 deaths, just five weeks after the country passed 300,000 deaths. On January 22, the U.S. passed 25 million cases, with one of every 13 Americans testing positive for COVID-19. By March 5, more than 2,750 cases of COVID-19 variants were detected in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico. On February 22, the U.S. passed 500,000 deaths, just five weeks after the country passed 400,000 deaths. In the first prime time address of his presidency on March 11, Biden announced his plan to push states to make vaccines available to all adults by May 1, with the aim of making small gatherings possible by July 4. On March 24, the U.S. passed 30 million cases, just as a number of states began to expand the eligibility age for COVID-19 vaccines. Experts began warning against public relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation measures as vaccines continue to be administered, with one, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, warning of a new rise in cases. \c\cBy April 7, the Alpha variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the US On April 12, the U.S. reported its first cases of a new "double mutant" SARS-CoV-2 variant from India, later called Delta, in California. By April 25, the country's seven-day average of new infections was reported to be decreasing, but concerns were raised about drops in vaccine demand in certain parts of the US, which were attributed to vaccine hesitancy. On April 29, the CDC estimated that roughly 35% of the U.S. population had been infected with the virus as of March 2021, about four times higher than the official reported numbers. \c\cOn May 4, Biden announced a new goal of having 70 percent of all adults in the U.S. receive at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot by July 4, along with steps to vaccinate teenagers and more inaccessible populations. The country ultimately did not reach that goal, with only 67 percent of the overall adult population having done so by July 4. On May 6, a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that the true COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. was more than 900,000 people. On May 9, Dr. Fauci confirmed that the U.S. death toll was likely undercounted. \c\cOn May 13, the CDC changed its guidance and said that fully vaccinated individuals do not need to wear masks in most situations. Some states ended their mask mandates shortly after, while others maintained the mandate. The CDC was criticized for the confusion resulting from the announcement, as it did not remove existing state and local mandates. The guidance also did not remove the federal mask mandate on public transportation. On June 15, the U.S. passed 600,000 deaths, though the number of daily deaths had decreased due to vaccination efforts. \c\cBy late June, COVID-19 cases rose again, especially in Arkansas, Nevada, Missouri, and Wyoming. The rising numbers were believed to be attributable to the Delta variant. By July 7, the Delta variant had surpassed the Alpha variant to become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the US, according to CDC data. By late August the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of all cases and was found to double the risk of hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated. \c\cOn August 1, the U.S. passed 35 million cases. By early and mid-August, hospitals in some states with low vaccination rates began to exceed capacity. One-quarter of the U.S. population resides in eight states—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Texas—but, by mid-August, these states together had a half of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the nation. By the end of the month, the ICUs of five of those—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Texas—were over 90% full. \c\cOn September 8, the U.S. passed 40 million cases. By September 15, one in every 500 Americans had died from COVID-19. By September 20, COVID-19 had killed over 675,000 Americans, the estimated number of American deaths from the Spanish flu in 1918. As a result, COVID-19 became the deadliest respiratory pandemic in recent American history. The Associated Press called the new numbers a "colossal tragedy" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines. On October 1, the U.S. passed 700,000 deaths. \c\cOn January 28, 2020, the CDC updated its China travel recommendations to level 3, its highest alert. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. In late January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On February 7, the State Department said it had facilitated the transportation of nearly eighteen tons of medical supplies to China, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100 million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. \c\cContact tracing is a tool to control transmission rates during the reopening process. Some states like Texas and Arizona opted to proceed with reopening without adequate contact tracing programs in place. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. Privacy concerns have prevented measures such as those imposed in South Korea where authorities used cellphone tracking and credit card details to locate and test thousands of nightclub patrons when new cases began emerging. Funding for contact tracing is thought to be insufficient, and even better-funded states have faced challenges getting in touch with contacts. Congress has allocated $631 million for state and local health surveillance programs, but the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that $3.6 billion will be needed. The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which "may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials". As of July 1, only four states are using contact tracing apps as part of their state-level strategies to control transmission. The apps document digital encounters between smartphones, so the users will automatically be notified if someone they had contact with has tested positive. Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email, and phone communications. \c\cIn the United States, remdesivir is indicated for use in adults and adolescents (aged twelve years and older with body weight at least 40 kilograms (88 lb)) for the treatment of COVID‐19 requiring hospitalization. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. Among those were chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have been successfully used to treat malaria for over fifty years. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. On March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which allowed certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. On June 15, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19, saying the available evidence showed "no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery". However, Trump continued to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 through late July. \c\cFrom early 2020, more than 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the US) began vaccine research. In preparation for large-scale production, Congress set aside more than $3.5 billion for this purpose as part of the CARES Act. On November 20, 2020, the Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization for its vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was granted on December 11. On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020. Starting on December 14, 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered. \c\cPolling showed a significant partisan divide regarding the outbreak. In February 2020, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was "a real threat": 70% and 72%, respectively. By mid-March 2020, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as "a real threat", while only 40% of Republicans agreed. In mid-March, various polls found Democrats were more likely than Republicans to believe "the worst was yet to come" (79–40%), to believe their lives would change in a major way due to the outbreak (56–26%), and to take certain precautions against the virus (83–53%). The CDC was the most trusted source of information about the outbreak (85%), followed by the WHO (77%), state and local government officials (70–71%), the news media (47%), and Trump (46%). A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. In September 2020, Pew Research Center found that the global image of the United States had suffered in many foreign nations. In some nations, the United States\' favorability rating had reached a record low since Pew began collecting this data nearly twenty years ago. Across thirteen different nations, a median of fifteen percent of respondents rated the U.S. response to the pandemic positively. \c\cThe pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, led a recession in the United States following the economic cycle peak in February 2020. The economy contracted 4.8 percent from January through March 2020, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April. The total healthcare costs of treating the epidemic could be anywhere from $34 billion to $251 billion according to analysis presented by The New York Times. A study by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson indicated that most economic impact due to consumer behavior changes was prior to mandated lockdowns. During the second quarter of 2020, the U.S. economy suffered its largest drop on record, with GDP falling at an annualized rate of 32.9 percent. As of June 2020, the U.S. economy was over ten percent smaller than it was in December 2019. \c\cIn September, Bain & Company reported on the tumultuous changes in consumer behavior before and during the pandemic. Potentially permanently, they found acceleration towards e-commerce, online primary healthcare, livestreamed gym workouts, and moviegoing via subscription television. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. OpenTable estimated in May that 25 percent of American restaurants would close their doors permanently. \c\cThe economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has raised fears of a mass eviction crisis, with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating 30–40 million are at risk for eviction by the end of 2020. According to a report by Yelp, about sixty percent of U.S. businesses that have closed since the start of the pandemic will stay shut permanently. \c\cThe pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the disease itself and efforts to contain it, including political, cultural, and social implications. \c\cFrom the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. During the first year, an ad-hoc organization called Stop AAPI Hate received 3,795 reports of racism against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. \c\cDisproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations. Of four studies published in September 2020, three found clear disparities due to race and the fourth found slightly better survival rates for Hispanics and Blacks. As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. In June 2021, the CDC confirmed these numbers, reporting that American Indian or Alaska Native, Non-Hispanic persons had the highest rates of both hospitalizations and deaths, while Hispanic and Latino persons suffered the highest rates of COVID compared to White persons. However the CDC noted that only 61% of case reports included race and ethnicity data, which could result in inaccurate estimates of the relative risk among groups.  Additionally, a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2020 revealed that the effect of stress and weathering on minority groups decreases their stamina against COVID. \c\cFrom 2019 to 2020 in the United States, the life expectancy of a Hispanic American decreased 3 years, for an African American 2.9 years, and for a White American 1.2 years. The COVID Tracking Project published data revealing that people of color were contracting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites. An NPR analysis of April–September 2020 data from the COVID Tracking Project found that Black people's share of COVID-19 deaths across the United States was 1.5 times greater (in some states 2.5 times greater) than their share of the U.S. population. Similarly, Hispanics and Latinos were disproportionately infected in 45 states and had a disproportionate share of the deaths in 19 states. Native American and Alaskan Native cases and deaths were disproportionally high in at least 21 states and, in some, as much as five times more than average. White non-Hispanics died at a lower rate than their share of the population in 36 states and D.C. \c\cBy April 2020, closed schools affected more than 55 million students. \c\cThe pandemic prompted calls from voting rights groups and some Democratic Party leaders to expand mail-in voting, while Republican leaders generally opposed the change. Some states were unable to agree on changes, resulting in lawsuits. Responding to Democratic proposals for nationwide mail-in voting as part of a coronavirus relief law, President Trump said "you\'d never have a Republican elected in this country again" despite evidence the change would not favor any particular group. Trump called mail-in voting "corrupt" and said voters should be required to show up in person, even though, as reporters pointed out, he had himself voted by mail in the last Florida primary. Though mail-in vote fraud is slightly higher than in-person voter fraud, both instances are rare, and mail-in voting can be made more secure by disallowing third parties to collect ballots and providing free drop-off locations or prepaid postage. \c\cHigh COVID-19 fatalities at the state and county level correlated with a drop in expressed support for the election of Republicans, including the reelection of Trump, according to a study published in Science Advances that compared opinions in January–February 2020 with opinions in June 2020. \c\cBy late August 2021, more than 800 colleges and universities, over 200 health care companies and dozens of states, local governments and school districts, had some type of vaccination requirements. President Biden has appealed to public organizations and private companies to require employees to be vaccinated, which companies are now legally allowed to do. \c\cUntil August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Nonetheless, nearly 2,000 private hospitals and health systems had previously issued vaccine mandates. Many companies outside health care did the same, such as United Airlines, Tyson Foods, and Walmart among them. Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors. With the new Delta variant spreading infections more quickly due to its higher transmissibility, companies including Facebook, Google, and Salesforce, have already issued employee vaccine mandates. \c\cAccording to a USA Today poll from August 2021, 68% supported a business's right to refuse service to unvaccinated customers, and 62% supported employer's right to mandate vaccinations to its employees. In the same poll, 72% also felt that mandating masks was "a matter of health and safety" and should not be considered an infringement on personal liberty. \c\cThe United States has experienced pandemics and epidemics throughout its history, including the 1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemics. In the most recent pandemic prior to COVID-19, the 2009 swine flu pandemic took the lives of more than 12,000 Americans and hospitalized another 270,000 over the course of approximately a year. \c\cAccording to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the "most prepared" nation in 2020.
General elections were held in Qatar for the first time on 2 October 2021, following an announcement by the Emir of Qatar on 22 August 2021. The elections for the Consultative Assembly were originally scheduled to be held in the second half of 2013, but were postponed in June 2013 until at least 2016. In 2016 they were postponed again. Finally in November 2020 Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani pledged to hold the election in October 2021. \c\cVoter turnout stood at 44%. \c\cThe elections were originally scheduled to be held in the last six months of 2013, but were postponed prior to the retiring Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani transferring power to his son Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The Consultative Assembly's term was extended until 2016 and then until 2019. \c\cIn October 2019 Al Thani issued an order for a committee to be formed to organise the elections, chaired by Prime Minister Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdul Aziz Al Thani. \c\cMen and women aged over 18 are eligible to vote for 30 of the 45 seats in the Consultative Assembly according to the constitution, with the remainder appointed by the Emir. \c\cOn 29 July 2021 Al Thani approved the electoral law, which mandated the thirty members being elected from single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting. The law requires candidates to be at least thirty years old and 'of Qatari origin' (according to the 2005 nationality law). This limited voting to those descended from people who held citizenship in 1930, barring people who had been naturalised and members of the Al Murrah tribe from contesting the election and leading to protests. 
On 3 October 2021 a private jet crashed into a building in Milan, Italy. All eight occupants of the aircraft were killed. 
The Pandora Papers are 11.9 million leaked documents that were announced by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) on October 2, 2021 to be published beginning on October 3, 2021. The organisations described the document leak as their most expansive exposé of financial secrecy yet. In the Pandora Papers, the ICIJ worked on 11.9 million documents, making this the largest offshore data leak in history, surpassing the Panama Papers, which were a leak of 11.5 million confidential documents. \c\cOver 100 billionaires, 30 current and former leaders, and 300 public officials were named in the first leaks on October 3, 2021. \c\cThough not illegal, Tony Blair was shown in the papers to have saved £312,000 in Stamp Duty on the purchase of a £6.45million property in London by purchasing Romanstone International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company.
The Pandora Papers are 11.9 million leaked documents (comprising 2.9 terabytes of data) that were published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) beginning on 3 October 2021. The news organisations of the ICIJ described the document leak as their most expansive exposé of financial secrecy yet, containing documents, images, emails and spreadsheets from 14 financial service companies, in nations including Panama, Switzerland and the UAE, surpassing their previous release of the Panama Papers in 2016, which had 11.5 million confidential documents. At the time of the release of the papers, the ICIJ said it is not identifying its source for the documents. \c\cUp to an estimated US$32 trillion (excluding non-monetary valuables such as real estate, art, and jewelry) may be hidden from being taxed, according to news reports. \c\cIn total, 35 current and former national leaders appear in the leak, alongside 400 officials from nearly 100 countries. Among those names are former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Montenegrin President Milo Đukanović, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim, Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba and Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso. More than 100 billionaires, 29,000 offshore accounts, 30 current and former leaders, and 336 politicians were named in the first leaks on 3 October 2021. \c\cKing Abdullah II of Jordan is one of the main figures named in the papers, with documents showing he had invested over US$100 million in property across the UK and the US; they included houses in Cliffside Drive, Malibu, Washington, D.C., London and Ascot in the UK. A UK company controlled by Cherie Blair was shown to have acquired a £6.45 million property in London by purchasing Romanstone International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company; had the property been acquired directly, £312,000 would have been payable in stamp duty. Tony Blair's name appears in a statement of joint income for the associated mortgage. The papers also reveal how an office block owned by the Aliyev family was sold to the Crown Estate, the sovereign's public estate, for £66 million in 2018, netting the Aliyevs a £31 million profit. Another office block worth £33 million was sold to the family in 2009, and was gifted to Heyder Aliyev, son of Azerbaijan's President Aliyev. Elsewhere, a close associate[who?] of Vladimir Putin was revealed to have secret assets in Monaco, and Andrej Babiš, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, who had campaigned on promising to crack down on corruption and tax evasion, did not declare the use of an offshore investment company in the purchase of eight properties, including two villas, in Mougins on the French Riviera for £12 million. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was also mentioned, despite being quoted in 2018 as stating, "Every public servant's assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask – what is legitimate?" Kenyatta and six members of his family have been linked to 13 offshore companies. \c\cOther global names mentioned include Shakira, who was incorporating new offshore entities while going on trial for tax evasion; model Claudia Schiffer; Indian cricket player Sachin Tendulkar; Alexandre Cazes, the founder of the dark web site AlphaBay, used to deal in illegal drugs; Pakistan's finance minister, Shaukat Fayaz Ahmed Tarin, and several of family members of Pakistan's top generals; and the CEO of Channel One Russia, Konstantin Ernst. Miguel Bosé, Pep Guardiola and Julio Iglesias are also named. \c\cThe leaked files come from 14 offshore service providers that help clients establish companies in secrecy jurisdictions. \c\cAn ICIJ report focused on the Panamanian law firm of Alemán, Cordero, Galindo & Lee, or Alcogal, saying it was the "law firm of the Latin American elite" that created at least 14,000 shell companies and trusts in tax havens. Alcogal was mentioned more than any other offshore provider in the leaked documents. \c\cThe ICIJ worked with journalists in 117 countries including news organizations such as The Washington Post, L\'Espresso, Le Monde, El País, Süddeutsche Zeitung, PBS program Frontline, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, The Guardian, and the BBC’s Panorama. \c\cIn Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan said that all citizens mentioned in the Pandora Papers would be investigated and appropriate action taken in case of wrongdoing.
There have been many cases of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests, nuns and members of religious orders. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the cases have involved many allegations, investigations, trials, convictions, acknowledgement and apologies by Church authorities, and revelations about decades of instances of abuse and attempts by Church officials to cover them up. The abused include mostly boys but also girls, some as young as three years old, with the majority between the ages of 11 and 14. Criminal cases for the most part do not cover sexual harassment of adults. The accusations of abuse and cover-ups began to receive public attention during the late 1980s. Many of these cases allege decades of abuse, frequently made by adults or older youths years after the abuse occurred. Cases have also been brought against members of the Catholic hierarchy who covered up sex abuse allegations and moved abusive priests to other parishes, where abuse continued. \c\cBy the 1990s, the cases began to receive significant media and public attention in countries including in Canada, United States, Chile, Australia and Ireland, and much of Europe. In 2002, an investigation by The Boston Globe led to widespread media coverage of the issue in the United States. Widespread abuse has been exposed in Europe, Australia, Chile, and the United States, reflecting worldwide patterns of long-term abuse as well as the Church hierarchy's pattern of regularly covering up reports of abuse. \c\cFrom 2001 to 2010, the Holy See examined sex abuse cases involving about 3,000 priests, some of which dated back fifty years. Diocesan officials and academics knowledgeable about the Roman Catholic Church say that sexual abuse by clergy is generally not discussed, and thus is difficult to measure. Members of the Church's hierarchy have argued that media coverage was excessive and disproportionate, and that such abuse also takes place in other religions and institutions, a stance that dismayed critics who saw it as a device to avoid resolving the abuse problem within the Church. \c\cIn a 2001 apology, John Paul II called sexual abuse within the Church "a profound contradiction of the teaching and witness of Jesus Christ". Benedict XVI apologised, met with victims, and spoke of his "shame" at the evil of abuse, calling for perpetrators to be brought to justice, and denouncing mishandling by church authorities. In 2018, referring to a particular case in Chile, Pope Francis accused victims of fabricating allegations, but by April, was apologizing for his "tragic error" and by August, was expressing "shame and sorrow" for the tragic history. He convened a four-day summit meeting with the participation of the presidents of all the episcopal conferences of the world, which was held in Vatican City from 21 to 24 February 2019, to discuss preventing sexual abuse by Catholic Church clergy. In December 2019, Pope Francis made sweeping changes that allow for greater transparency. In June 2021, a team of U.N. special rapporteurs for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) have criticized the Vatican, referring to persistent allegations that the Catholic Church had obstructed and failed to cooperate with domestic judicial proceedings in order to prevent accountability for abusers and compensation for victims. \c\cSexual abuse in the Catholic Church has been reported as far back as the 11th century, when Peter Damian wrote the treatise Liber Gomorrhianus against such abuses and others. \c\cIn the late 15th century, Katharina von Zimmern and her sister were removed from their abbey to live in their family's house for a while partly because the young girls were molested by priests. In 1531, Martin Luther claimed that Pope Leo X had vetoed a measure that cardinals should restrict the number of boys they kept for their pleasure, "otherwise it would have been spread throughout the world how openly and shamelessly the Pope and the cardinals in Rome practice sodomy."\c\cThe sexual abuse of children below the age of consent by priests has received significant media and public attention in the United States, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Belgium, France, Germany, and Australia. Cases have also been reported in other nations throughout the world. Many of the cases span several decades and are brought forward years after the abuse occurred. \c\cAlthough nationwide inquiries have been conducted only in the United States and Ireland, as well as an Australian inquiry into institutional responses, cases of clerical sexual abuse of minors have been reported and prosecuted in New Zealand, Canada and other countries.  In 1995, Austrian Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër resigned from his post as Archbishop of Vienna over allegations of sexual abuse, although he remained a Cardinal. Since 1995, more than 100 priests from various parts of Australia were convicted of sexual abuse. \c\cIn Ireland, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse issued a report that covered six decades (from the 1950s). It noted "endemic" sexual abuse in Catholic boys\' institutions, saying that church leaders were aware of abuses and that government inspectors failed to "stop beatings, rapes and humiliation." The report noted the "centrality of poverty and social vulnerability in the lives of the victims of abuse."\c\cIn Australia, according to Broken Rites, a support and advocacy group for church-related sex abuse victims, as of 2011[update] there have been over one hundred cases in which Catholic priests have been charged for child sex offenses. A 2012 police report claimed that 40 suicide deaths were directly related to abuse by Catholic clergy in the state of Victoria. In January 2013, an Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was called to investigate institutional sexual abuse of minors related, but not exclusive, to matters concerning clergy of the Catholic Church. \c\cOf the Catholic sexual abuse cases in Latin America, the most widely known is the sexual scandal of Father Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic congregation. The revelations took place after the Legion spent more than a decade denying allegations and criticizing the victims who claimed abuse. \c\cIn Tanzania, Father Kit Cunningham and three other priests were exposed as pedophiles after Cunningham's death. The abuse took place in the 1960s but was only publicly revealed in 2011, largely through a BBC documentary. \c\cChurch officials and academics knowledgeable about the Third World Roman Catholic Church[who?] say that sexual abuse by clergy is generally not discussed, and thus is difficult to measure. This may be due in part to the more hierarchical structure of the Church in Third World countries, the "psychological health" of clergy in those regions, and because Third World media, legal systems and public culture are not as apt to thoroughly discuss sexual abuse. In the Philippines, where as of 2002[update] at least 85% of the population is Catholic, the revelations of sexual abuse by priests, including child sexual abuse, followed the United States\' widespread reporting in 2002. \c\cAcademic Mathew N. Schmalz notes India as an example: "you would have gossip and rumors, but it never reaches the level of formal charges or controversies." Traditionally, the Roman Catholic Church has held tight control over many aspects of church life around the globe, but it left sex abuse cases to be handled locally. In 2001, the church first required that sex abuse cases be reported to Rome. In July 2010, the Vatican doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim in which clergymen can be tried in a church court. It also streamlined the processes for removing abusive priests. \c\cAccording to a 2004 research study by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 4,392 Catholic priests and deacons in active ministry between 1950 and 2002 have been plausibly (neither withdrawn nor disproven) accused of under-age sexual abuse by 10,667 individuals. Estimating the number of priests and deacons active in the same period at 110,000, the report concluded that approximately 4% have faced these allegations. The report noted that "It is impossible to determine from our surveys what percent of all actual cases of abuse that occurred between 1950 and 2002 have been reported to the Church and are therefore in our dataset." The Augustin Cardinal Bea, S.J. specializes in abuse counseling and is considered an expert on clerical abuse; he states "approximately 4% of priests during the past half century (and mostly in the 1960s and 1970s) have had a sexual experience with a minor." According to Newsweek magazine, this figure is similar to the rate of frequency in the rest of the adult population. \c\cIn 2014, the Permanent Representative of the Holy See to the UN, Silvano Maria Tomasi, appeared before the Committee against Torture and reported that during the previous ten years, 3420 cases of abuse against minors had been investigated and 884 priests had been removed from their positions and reduced to lay status. Allegations of and convictions for sexual abuse by clergy have occurred in many countries. There are no accurate figures available on the number of sexual abuse cases in different regions. But, in 2002 The Boston Globe reported, "clearly the issue has been most prominent in the United States." The US is the country with the highest number of reported Catholic sex abuse cases. \c\cAfter the United States, the country with the next highest number of reported cases is Ireland. A significant number of cases have also been reported in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and countries in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. \c\cIn response to the attention, members of the church hierarchy[who?] have argued that media coverage has been unfair, excessive, and disproportionate.[failed verification] According to a Pew Research Center study, in 2002 the media coverage was focused on the US, where a series in The Boston Globe initiated widespread coverage in the region. However, by 2010 the focus had shifted to Europe. \c\cIn September 2011, a submission was lodged with the International Criminal Court alleging that the Pope, Cardinal Angelo Sodano (Dean of the College of Cardinals), Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone (Cardinal Secretary of State), and Cardinal William Levada (then-current Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) had committed a crime against humanity by failing to prevent or punish perpetrators of rape and sexual violence in a "systematic and widespread" concealment which included failure to co-operate with relevant law enforcement agencies. In a statement to the Associated Press, the Vatican described this as a "ludicrous publicity stunt and a misuse of international judicial processes." Lawyers and law professors emphasized that the case is likely to fall outside the court's jurisdiction. \c\cOn 13 May 2017, Pope Francis acknowledged that the Vatican had a 2,000 case backlog of sex abuse cases. \c\cPhilip Jenkins, professor at the Department of Religion and History at Penn State University, questioned the theses of increased sexual abuse among priests, saying the percentage of priests accused of molesting minors is 1.8%, much of which is not about pedophilia alone. \c\cIn the late 1940s, the American priest Gerald Fitzgerald founded the Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete, a religious order that treats Roman Catholic priests who struggle with personal difficulties such as substance abuse and sexual misconduct. In a series of letters and reports to high-ranking Catholic leaders starting in the 1950s, Fitzgerald warned of substantial problems with abusive priests. He wrote, for example, "[sexual abuse] offenders were unlikely to change and should not be returned to ministry." He discussed the problem with Pope Paul VI (1963 – 1978) and "in correspondence with several bishops". \c\cIn 2001, the Vatican first required that sex abuse cases be reported to the Vatican hierarchy; before that, it left management of the cases to local dioceses. After the 2002 revelation by The Boston Globe that cases of abuse were widespread in the Church in Massachusetts and elsewhere, The Dallas Morning News did a year-long investigation. It reported in 2004 that even after these revelations and public outcry, the institutional church had moved allegedly abusive priests out of the countries where they had been accused but assigned them again to "settings that bring them into contact with children, despite church claims to the contrary". Among the investigation's findings was that nearly half of 200 cases "involved clergy who tried to elude law enforcement."\c\cThe cases received significant media and public attention in the United States, Ireland (where abuse was reported as widespread), and Canada, and throughout the world. In response to the attention, members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive and disproportionate.[failed verification]  According to a Pew Research Center study, media coverage was generated mostly in the United States, beginning in 2002, with a series in The Boston Globe that published hundreds of news reports. By contrast, in 2010 much of the reporting focused on child abuse in Europe. \c\cDifferent scandals of sexual abuse involving members of the Catholic clergy have been made public in Costa Rica, as more than ten priests have been formally accused. However, one of the most recent and most dramatic events due to its media exposure occurred in 2019 when judicial accusations against the priests Mauricio Víquez and Manuel Guevara led to the search and seizure of the Episcopal Conference by the Judicial Investigation Department on 7 March 2019. Víquez, who was the Episcopal Conference's spokesman and professor at the University of Costa Rica, was dismissed from the clerical state by the Holy See and the process for removal of his university tenure was started. He is currently a fugitive overseas reason for which an international arrest warrant was issued against him. In the case of Guevara, parish priest of Santo Domingo de Heredia, was arrested by the authorities. \c\cAnother priest wanted for sexual abuse, Jorge Arturo Morales Salazar, was arrested by the authorities while trying to escape through the Panama border and held on preventive custody. Other notable cases are Father Enrique Delgado, popular figure due to his TV show La Hora Santa (The Holy Hour) who was sentenced to prison for rape and sexual abuse against three minors, Father Enrique Vazquez who escaped the country apparently with financial help from San Carlos\' bishop Angel Sancasimiro, and Father Minor Calvo, another TV personality with his TV show An encounter with Christ and as director of the Catholic radio station Radio maria who was found in a car with a teenager in the La Sabana Park at midnight (although Calvo was convicted for corruption and embezzlement he was not convicted for sexual abuse). \c\cJózef Wesołowski, a Polish citizen who had been a nuncio (papal ambassador), was laicized in 2014 because of accusations of sexual abuse of minors during the five years he served as Vatican ambassador in Santo Domingo. The Holy See refused to waive his diplomatic immunity in order to allow him to be judged in Santo Domingo, but charged him before the Vatican criminal tribunal.  However, in July 2015 the trial was postponed due to Wesolowski's ill health; he died on 27 August 2015 before a trial could be held. \c\cIn November 2015, in El Salvador's sole non-military Catholic diocese, the Archdiocese of San Salvador, Fr. Jesus Delgado, biographer and personal secretary to Archbishop Oscar Romero was dismissed by the Archdiocese after investigations revealed that he had molested a girl, now 42 years of age, when she was between the ages of 9 and 17. Due to the statute of limitations, Delgado could not face criminal charges. In December 2016, a canonical court convicted Delgado and two other El Salvador priests, Francisco Galvez and Antonio Molina, of committing acts of sex abuse between the years 1980 and 2000 and laicized them from the priesthood. \c\cIn November 2019, the Archdiocese acknowledged sex abuse committed by Fr. Leopoldo Sosa Tolentino in 1994 and issued a public apology to his victim. Tolentino was suspended from ministry and began the canonical trial process. Another El Salvador priest José Adonay Chicas Campos was laicized in 2019 after pleading guilty to sex abuse in a criminal trial at the Vatican and sentenced to 16 years in prison. \c\cIn 2018 Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Bishop Juan Jose Pineda, a close aide of Cardinal Maradiaga, following revelations of sexual abuse and financial scandal. \c\cIn the late 1980s, allegations were made of physical and sexual abuse committed by members of the Christian Brothers, who operated the Mount Cashel Orphanage in St. John's, Newfoundland. The government, police, and church had colluded in an attempt to cover up the allegations, but in December 1989 they were reported in the St. John's Sunday Express. Eventually more than 300 former pupils came forward with allegations of physical and sexual abuse at the orphanage. The religious order that ran the orphanage filed for bankruptcy in the face of numerous civil lawsuits seeking damages. Since the Mount Cashel scandal, a number of priests across Canada have been accused of sexual abuse. \c\cIn August 2005, Father Charles Henry Sylvestre of Belle River, Ontario pleaded guilty to 47 counts of sexual abuse of females, aged between nine and fourteen years old, between 1952 and 1989. Sylvestre was given a sentence in October 2006 of three years, and died 22 January 2007 after three months in prison. \c\cIn 2011, Basilian priest Father William Hodgson Marshall, who died in 2014 at the age of 92, pled guilty to 16 counts of indecent assault of minors and one count of sexual assault for incidents that occurred between 1952 and 1986 when he taught at Assumption and Holy Names high schools in Windsor, plus other Catholic high schools in Toronto and Sudbury. He was sentenced to two years in prison, and served 16 months of his sentence before being released on probation in 2012. However, Marshall, who was given the nickname "Happy Hands" in the 1950s due to his tendency to touch students, later pled guilty to more sex abuse charges stemming from his time in Saskatchewan. On 30 April 2020, the Canadian Supreme Court rejected an appeal from the Basilian Fathers of Toronto to not give Marshall victim Rod MacLeod a required payment of just over $2.5 million, including $500,000 in punitive damages, stemming from a sexual-assault case in the 1960s. The payment was first ordered by a jury in April 2018. \c\cOn 25 August 2020, British Columbia justice David Crossin ordered the office of the Bishop of Kamloops and retired priest Erlindo Molon, who was by then 88 years old, to pay $844,140 in damages to Rosemary Anderson, who claimed Molon raped her 70 to 100 times in 1976 and 1977, beginning when she was 26 years old. Anderson claimed Molon offered her counselling to help her deal with her father's death. During the lawsuit, former Kamloops bishop, and future Vancouver Archbishop, Adam Exner now 90, conceded on the stand that Molon “was molesting people,” including Anderson. Exner also stated that Molon was not stripped of his priesthood status until after Anderson told him that Molon raped her and suggested that she marry him. \c\cBy 1912, thousands of First Nations children attended residential schools, many of which were run by the Catholic Church. In 1990, Manitoba leader Phil Fontaine revealed that he had been sexually and physically abused in a Catholic residential school. He claimed that sexual abuse was common in residential schools in general. "In my grade three class, if there were 20 boys, every single one of them would have experienced what I experienced. They would have experienced some aspect of sexual abuse."\c\cCanadian author and artist, Michael D. O\'Brien, has also spoken out about his painful experiences of residential school abuse, revealing that "the sexual exploitation of the young has been epidemic in Catholic residential schools and orphanages."\c\cOf the Catholic sexual abuse cases in Latin America, the most widely known is the sexual scandal of Father Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic congregation. The revelations took place after the Legion spent more than a decade denying allegations and criticizing the victims who claimed abuse. \c\cLuis Esteban Zavala Rodríguez, a priest in Irapuato, was condemned to 65 years and three months in prison and fined MXN $61,000 in January 2021 for raping a 12-year-old girl as she took catechism classes at a church in the city. \c\cThe United States has been the focus of many scandals and subsequent reforms. BishopAccountability.org, a "online archive established by lay Catholics", have reported over 3,000 civil lawsuits against the church, some of these cases have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements with many claimants, totaling more than $3 billion since 1950. \c\cWhile the church in the United States claims to have addressed the issue, some disagree. Mark Honigsbaum of The Guardian wrote in 2006 that, "despite the National Review Board's own estimates that there have been some 5,000 abusive priests in the US, to date 150 have been successfully prosecuted."  Some critics of the church, such as Patrick Wall, attribute this to a lack of cooperation from the church. In California, for example, the archdiocese[clarification needed] has sought to block the disclosure of confidential counseling records on two priests, arguing that such action would violate their First Amendment right on religious protection. Paul Lakeland claims Church leaders who enabled abuse were too frequently careless about their own accountability and the accountability of perpetrators. \c\cIn 2004, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange settled nearly 90 cases for $100 million. In July 2007, its parent archdiocese, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles reached a settlement of 45 lawsuits for $60 million.  By July 2007, a $660 million agreement was made with more than 500 alleged victims. \c\cIn September 2007 the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego reached a $198.1 million "agreement with 144 childhood sexual abuse victims". \c\cIn July 2008 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver agreed "to pay $5.5 million to settle 18 claims of childhood sexual abuse."\c\cIn 1998 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas paid $30.9 million to twelve victims of one priest ($49.1 million in present-day terms). From 2003 to 2009 nine other major settlements, involving over 375 cases with 1551 claimants/victims, resulted in payments of over US$1.1 billion. The Associated Press estimated the settlements of sex abuse cases from 1950 to 2007 totaled more than $2 billion. Addressing "a flood of abuse claims" five dioceses (Tucson, Arizona; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Davenport, Iowa, and San Diego) got bankruptcy protection. Eight Catholic dioceses have declared bankruptcy due to sex abuse cases from 2004 to 2011. \c\cAlthough bishops had been sending sexually abusive priests to facilities such as those operated by the Servants of the Paraclete since the 1950s, there was scant public discussion of the problem until the mid-1960s. Even then, most of the discussion was held amongst the Catholic hierarchy with little or no coverage in the media. A public discussion of sexual abuse of minors by priests took place at a meeting sponsored by the National Association for Pastoral Renewal held on the campus of the University of Notre Dame in 1967, to which all U.S. Catholic bishops were invited.[citation needed]\c\cVarious local and regional discussions of the problem were held by Catholic bishops in later years. However, it was not until the 1980s that discussion of sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clerics began to be covered as a phenomenon in the news media of the United States. According to the Catholic News Service, public awareness of the sexual abuse of children in the United States and Canada emerged in the late 1970s and the 1980s as an outgrowth of the growing awareness of physical abuse of children in society.[citation needed]\c\cIn September 1983, the National Catholic Reporter  published an article on the topic. The subject gained wider national notoriety in October 1985 when Louisiana priest Gilbert Gauthe pleaded guilty to 11 counts of molestation of boys. After the coverage of Gauthe's crimes subsided, the issue faded to the fringes of public attention until the mid-1990s, when the issue was again brought to national attention after a number of books on the topic were published. \c\cIn 2002, The Boston Globe's Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of sexual abuse cases involving Catholic priests drew the attention, first of the United States and ultimately the world, to the problem. Other victims began to come forward with their own allegations of abuse, resulting in more lawsuits and criminal cases. Since then, the problem of clerical abuse of minors has received significantly more attention from the Church hierarchy, law enforcement agencies, government and the news media. One study shows that the Boston Globe coverage of the cases "had a negative and long-lasting effect" on Catholic school enrollment, and explained "about two-thirds of the decline in Catholic schooling."\c\cIn 2003 Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee authorized payments of as much as US$20,000 to sexually abusive priests to convince them to leave the priesthood. \c\cIn July 2003 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville paid $25.7 million to "settle child sexual-abuse allegations made in 240 lawsuits naming 34 priests and other church workers." In 2003 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston also settled a large case for $85 million with 552 alleged victims. In 2004, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange settled nearly 90 cases for $100 million. \c\cThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas paid $30.9 million in 1998 to twelve victims of one priest ($49.1 million in present-day terms). \c\cIn April 2007 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon agreed to a $75 million settlement with 177 claimants and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle agreed to a $48 million settlement with more than 160 victims. In July 2007 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles reached a $660 million agreement with more than 500 alleged victims, in December 2006, the archdiocese had a settlement of 45 lawsuits for $60 million. \c\cAs recently as 2011 Fr Curtis Wehmeyer was allowed to work as a priest in Minnesota despite many people having reported concern about his sexual compulsion and suspicious behavior with boys. Wehmeyer was employed as a priest without proper background checks. Wehmeyer was later convicted of sexually abusing two boys. After Wehmeyer's arrest there were complaints the responsible clergy were more concerned with how to spin the story in a favorable light than in helping victims. \c\cIn July 2018, Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C. resigned from the College of Cardinals (the first Cardinal to do so since 1927) following allegations of abuse and attempted homosexual rape at a seaside villa. In August, a "systematic coverup" of sex abuse by more than 300 priests in Pennsylvania parishes was revealed. Reviewers of the situation indicated that many more victims and perpetrators were likely undiscovered. In March 2018, Archbishop Anthony Apuron of Guam was removed from office by the Vatican. Apuron had been accused of sexually molesting altar boys in the late 1970s. Moreover, in the latest case, priest Louis Brouillard was charged for having raped altar boys during "sleepovers" as a teenager. Over fifteen priests, two archbishops, and a bishop have been recognized in sex abuse cases, from the 1950s until the 1990s. \c\cAddressing "a flood of abuse claims" five dioceses (Tucson, Arizona; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon.; Davenport, Iowa, and San Diego) got bankruptcy protection. Eight Catholic diocese have declared bankruptcy due to sex abuse cases from 2004 to 2011. \c\cIn the United States the 2004 John Jay Report, commissioned from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and funded by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), was based on volunteer surveys completed by the Roman Catholic dioceses in the United States. The 2004 John Jay Report was based on a study of 10,667 allegations against 4,392 priests accused of engaging in sexual abuse of a minor between 1950 and 2002. \c\cOn 29 December 2019, it was revealed that numerous bishops across the United States withheld hundreds of names from their accused clergy list. \c\cOn 6 March 2020, a joint investigation conducted by Propublica and the Houston Chronicle was published which revealed that the Catholic Church transferred more than 50 credibly accused U.S. Catholic clergy to other countries after sex abuse accusations surfaced against them. \c\cThe Holy See Secretariat of State's report, published in November 2020, stated that Pope John Paul II was made aware of allegations against McCarrick but did not believe them, and that Benedict XVI, after receiving further complaints, also made little effort to stop McCarrick. The report absolved Pope Francis, but placed blame on both Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI for Theodore McCarrick's rise in power they both were aware of sex abuse allegation against him. \c\cOn 17 August 2019, Argentina Bishop Sergio Buenanueva of San Francisco, Cordoba, acknowledged the history of sex abuse in the Catholic Church in Argentina. Buenanueva, who was labeled as a "Prelate" for the Argentine Catholic Church, also stated that the church's sex abuse crisis in Argentina, which is Pope Francis\' native country, was "just beginning". \c\cA three-judge court cleared former priest Carlos Eduardo José, 62, of sexual abuse charges from 1999 to 2008 in Caseros, Buenos Aires because the statute of limitations had expired by March 9, 2021. The accusations date from 2009 but the church took no action until 2019. Three other complaints against the same priest by other students were earlier dismissed by other courts on statute of limitations grounds. \c\cEarly in 2018, Pope Francis met with Bishop Juan Barros from Chile concerning the charges of sexual abuse by Fr. Fernando Karadima, and accusations of cover-up by Barros. Many laypersons and victims of sexual abuse came forward to condemn Barros for covering up the sex crimes. When Pope Francis visited the bishop, he was asked by local reporters about the sexual abuse scandal surrounding Barros.  Pope Francis quickly condemned the charges a "slander", stating, "The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, I will speak. There is not one piece of evidence against him. It is calumny. Is that clear?"\c\cFollowing the pope's defense of Barros, Boston Cardinal Sean Patrick O\'Malley, a key Vatican advisor on clergy abuse, acknowledged that Francis\' comments about Barros were "a source of great pain" for victims.  Francis then appointed Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to investigate the allegations of abuse in the Chilean church. Upon receiving Scicluna's report, Francis wrote on 12 April that he had "made serious mistakes in the assessment and perception of the situation, especially because of a lack of truthful and balanced information". He also declared that the Chilean church hierarchy was collectively responsible for "grave defects" in handling sexual abuse cases and the resulting loss of credibility suffered by the church. Following Francis\' remarks, 33 Chilean bishops offered their resignation. Pope Francis later apologized to the victims of the sex abuse scandal. In late April 2018, three victims were invited to the Vatican. \c\cOn 11 June 2018, Francis accepted the resignations of Bishop Juan Barros Madrid of Osorno, and on 28 June those of Bishops Horacio Valenzuela of Talca and Alejandro Goić Karmelić of Rancagua. In September he accepted those of those of Carlos Eduardo Pellegrín Barrera of Chillán and Cristián Contreras Molina of San Felipe. \c\cKaradima was laicized on 28 September 2018. \c\cOn 13 October 2018, Pope Francis laicized two former archbishops: Francisco José Cox Huneeus of La Serena and Marco Antonio Órdenes Fernández of Iquique. \c\cIn March 2019, Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati Andrello resigned as required upon turning 75 amid allegations of sexual abuse. \c\cOn 21 August 2019, Chile's nuncio announced that the Vatican had launched an investigation into claims that Bernardino Piñera, an influential Chilean priest who is also a paternal uncle of Chilean President Sebastian Piñera, sexually abused at least one child 50 years prior. \c\cIn 2002, Mathew N. Schmalz noted that Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in India are generally not spoken about openly, stating "you would have gossip and rumors, but it never reaches the level of formal charges or controversies."\c\cIn 2014, Raju Kokkan, the vicar of the Saint Paul's Church in Thaikkattussery, Thrissur, Kerala, was arrested on charges of raping a nine-year-old girl. According to Kerala Police, Kokkan had raped the child on several different occasions, including at least thrice in his office during the month of April. Kokkan promised to gift the child expensive vestments for her Holy Communion ceremony before sexually assaulting her. The abuse was revealed after the victim informed her parents that she had been raped by Kokkan on 25 April 2014. The priest subsequently fled to Nagercoil in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, and was arrested by police on 5 May. Following the arrest, the Thrissur Archdiocese stated that the vicar had been removed from his position within the Church. Between February and April 2014, three other Catholic priests were arrested in the state of Kerala on charges of raping minors. \c\cIn 2016, the Catholic Church reappointed a convicted and jailed priest in the Ootacamund Diocese in Tamil Nadu, with little regard for victims rights and children's safety. \c\cIn 2017, Father Robin Vadakkumchery of St Sebastian church in Kannur was arrested in Kochi on the charge of repeatedly raping a 15-year-old girl who later gave birth to a child. The baby is reported to have been taken to an orphanage without the mother's consent. He has been sentenced to 20 years in prison by a special court constituted under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 in Thalassery. \c\cIn 2018, after much public outcry, Bishop Franco Mulakkal was arrested on 21 September by the Kerala Police. The Vatican had just \'temporarily\' relieved him from his pastoral responsibilities. The nun who complained against Bishop Franco had mentioned to the police that he had repeatedly had unnatural sex with her on multiple occasions between 2014 and 2016. \c\cIn 2012, Singapore-born psychotherapist and author Jane Leigh, a single mother of two who now lives in Melbourne, alleged in her autobiography My Nine Lives Last that she was sexually abused by Roman Catholic priests when she was a teenager. Starting from when she was 12 years old, she was abused for two and half years during the secluded one-on-one outings by a 34-year-old priest whom she initially met at neighbourhood mass held at her home when she was 12, he allegedly did so while picking or dropping her off when her parents were at work. After she reported the matter to her mother, she was berated for tempting the priest and sent to another Catholic priest for counselling. Consequently, church stated that they will conduct the investigations. \c\cIn November 2010, an independent group in Austria that operates a hotline to help people exit the Catholic Church released a report documenting physical, sexual, and emotional abuse perpetrated by Austrian priests, nuns, and religious officials. The report is based on hotline calls from 91 women (28%) and 234 men (72%), who named 422 perpetrators of both sexes, 63% of whom were ordained priests. \c\cIn June 2010, Belgian police raided the Belgian Catholic Church headquarters in Brussels, seizing a computer and records of a Church commission investigating allegations of child abuse. This was part of an investigation into hundreds of claims that had been raised about alleged child sexual abuse committed by Belgian clergy. The claims emerged after Roger Vangheluwe, who had been the Bishop of Bruges, resigned in 2009 after admitting that he was guilty of sexual molestation. The Vatican protested against the raids. In September 2010, an appeals court ruled that the raids were illegal. \c\cThere are three main known cases of sexual abuse in Croatian Catholic Churches: in Archdiocese of Zagreb, Archdiocese of Rijeka and Archdiocese of Zadar. \c\cIn Archdiocese of Zagreb guilty convicted priest was Ivan Čuček (2000), in Archdiocese of Rijeka Drago Ljubičić (2011), and in Archdiocese of Zadar Nediljko Ivanov (2012). \c\cCardinal Philippe Barbarin, the Archbishop of Lyon, was convicted on 7 March 2019 of failing to report sex abuse allegedly committed by a priest and was given a six-month suspended prison sentence. On 5 July 2019, it was announced that Pope Francis laicized Bernard Preynat, the priest who Barbarin was accused of protecting. Barbarin also afterwards served a six-month suspended prison sentence. Despite the conviction being overturned, the scandal still resulted in Pope Francis accepting Barbarin's resignation as Archbishop of Lyon on 6 March 2020. \c\cOn 14 January 2020, Preynat, who was previously convicted on another sex abuse charge in 2016, confessed during his criminal trial that he had a habit of "caressing" Boy Scouts he oversaw when he served as scout chaplain in the Lyon suburb of Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon and that he did so in a way which brought him "sexual pleasure". On 15 January, Preynat, who is accused of molesting 80 Boy Scouts between 1971 and 1991, stated that the Vatican let him complete his seminary education for becoming a priest after he had undergone therapy at the Vinatier Psychiatric Hospital between 1967 and 1968, and that he had warned that Vatican about his sexual impulses. After Preynat's 2016 conviction for acts of abuse committed between 1986 and 1991, which also resulted in only an 18-month suspended prison sentence, Barbarin was reported to have appointed Preynat to a higher position in the Archdiocese of Lyon. \c\cOn 9 November 2019, the Conference of French Bishops approved a resolution agreeing that every French Catholic Bishop would pay compensation for abuse which took place in the French Catholic Church. On 16 March 2020, Preynat received a five-year prison sentence after being convicted of sexually assaulting boy scouts. On 11 November 2020, Jean-Marc Sauve, the head of the independent commission set up by the Catholic Church in France to investigate claims of sex abuse, acknowledged the his commission's sex abuse hotline, which closed on 31 October 2020, received 6,500 calls reporting sex \c\cabuse in a period of 17 months. On 16 December 2020, former French nuncio Luigi Ventura received a suspended eight-month prison sentence for sexually harassment, which includes probation and a required payment of €13,000 to the victims, as well as €9,000 in legal fees. \c\cOn 3 October 2021, a commission released a report stating that since the 1950s, there have been about 3,000 pedophiles among the ranks of Catholic clergy in France. The report found the estimation among more than 115,000 priests and religious officials. \c\cIn September 2018 a report by the German Catholic Church found that 3,677 children in Germany, mostly 13 or younger, had been sexually abused by Catholic clergy between 1946 and 2014. In August 2020, at 1,412 people in Germany accused members of Catholic religious orders of sexually abusing them as children, teenagers, and as wards. At least 654 monks, nuns and other members of religious orders were accused of abuse. Around 80% of the victims were male and 20% female. The orders were among the last Catholic church organizations in Germany to address sex abuse. Despite the facts that women make up the largest membership of German religious orders, male religious order members had the largest share of sex abuse accusations. \c\cIn May 2021, Cardinal Reinhard Marx offered his resignation, citing collective failure in dealing with sexual abuse as his main reason. Subsequently, Pope Francis denied his offer, while emphasizing the importance of Marx's repentance in his subsequent tenure. \c\cIn the Republic of Ireland, starting in the 1990s, there were a series of criminal cases and government enquiries related to allegations that priests had abused hundreds of minors over previous decades. State-ordered investigations documented "tens of thousands of children from the 1940s to the 1990s" who suffered abuse, including sexual abuse at the hands of priests, nuns, and church staff in three dioceses. \c\cIn many cases senior clergy had moved priests accused of abuse to other parishes. By 2010, a number of in-depth judicial reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions. The abuse was occasionally made known to staff at the Department of Education, the police, and other government bodies. They have said that prosecuting clergy was extremely difficult given the "Catholic ethos" of the Irish Republic.[citation needed] In addition, in 2004 the Christian Brothers had sued for a civil settlement that barred prosecution of any of its members or the naming of any Christian Brother in the government investigatory report. Christian Brothers had a higher number of allegations made against their order than were made against others. Neither were any victims named in the report. \c\cIn 1994, Micheal Ledwith resigned as President of St Patrick's College, Maynooth when allegations of sexual abuse by him were made public. The June 2005 McCullough Report found that a number of bishops had rejected concerns about Ledwith's inappropriate behavior towards seminarians "so completely and so abruptly without any adequate investigation", although his report conceded that "to investigate in any very full or substantial manner, a generic complaint regarding a person's apparent propensities would have been difficult". \c\cFr Brendan Smyth was reported to have sexually abused and indecently assaulted 20 children in parishes in Belfast, Dublin and the United States, during the period between 1945 and 1989. Controversy over the handling of his extradition to Northern Ireland led to the 1994 collapse of the Fianna Fáil/Labour coalition government. \c\cIn December 2010, Archdiocese of Dublin "singing priest" Tony Walsh was sentenced to 123 years in prison for 14 child abuse convictions involving sex-related offences dating from the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s. However, the sentences were to be served concurrently, netting to a maximum of 16 years. By the time he plead guilty in December 2018 to indecently assaulting a teenage boy with a crucifix on a date in 1983, Walsh had already been in prison for 13 years. \c\cSix reports by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church have up until 2011 established that six Irish priests were convicted between 1975 and 2011. \c\cIn August 2018, a list was published which revealed that over 1,300 Catholic clergy in Ireland had been accused of sexual abuse, and that by this time, 82 of them got convicted. In May 2020, it was revealed that prior to the 2004 merger with the Scout Association of Ireland (SAI) which formed Scouting Ireland, Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland (CBSI) covered up sex abuse committed by people who served in the organization. In a period spanning decades, both the CBSI and SAI shielded 275 known or suspected predators who abused children after becoming aware of the reported acts of abuse. Scouting Ireland backed the findings of the report and issued an apology. \c\cIn October 2018, Italian victim rights group Rete l\'Abuso released a statement saying that since 2000 the Italian justice system had handled about 300 cases of abusive priests and nuns, with 150 to 170 convictions. \c\cAfter revelations by Norwegian newspaper Adresseavisen, the Catholic Church in Norway and the Vatican acknowledged in 2010 that Georg Müller had resigned in July 2009 from the position of Bishop of Trondheim which he held from 1997 because of the discovery of his abuse of an altar boy two decades earlier. The Vatican cited Canon law 401 §2, but as is customary gave no details. The Norwegian Catholic Church was made aware of the incident at the time but did not alert the authorities. Norwegian law did not allow a criminal prosecution of Müller so long after the event. \c\cDuring 2013 the public in this deeply Catholic country became concerned about reports of child sex abuse scandals within the Church, some of which reached the courts, and the poor response by the church. The Church resisted demands to pay compensation to victims. \c\cIn October 2013 the Catholic Church in Poland explicitly refused to publish data on sexual abuse, but said that, "if the data were to be published, the scale would be seen to be very low". Bishop Antoni Dydycz said that priests should not be pressed to report sexual abuse to state authorities, invoking the ecclesiastical "seal of confession", which bans them from revealing what is said in the rite of confession. \c\cOn 27 September 2018, Bishop Romuald Kamiński of the Warsaw-Praga Diocese issued an apology to those who had been sexually abused by priests in his Diocese and that church leaders in Poland had completed work on a document to address the abuse of minors and suggest ways to prevent it. According to Archbishop Wojciech Polak, the head of Poland's Catholic Church, the document will also include data on the scale of priestly sex abuse in Poland. By early 2019, however, the document still had not been made public. On 8 October 2018, a victims group mapped out 255 cases of alleged sex abuse in Poland. \c\cStatistics were released on 14 April 2019, commissioned by the Episcopal Conference of Poland and with data from over 10,000 local parishes. It was found that from 1990 to mid-2018, abuse reports about 382 priests were made to the Church, with 625 children, mostly under 16, sexually abused by members of the Catholic clergy. There were opinions that the figures underestimated the extent of the problem, and failed to answer questions church officials had avoided for years. Marek Lisinski, the co-founder of Don\'t Be Afraid, which represents victims of clerical abuse, said "Tell us how [the priests] hurt those children and how many times they were transferred to different parishes before you paid notice". The data were released a few weeks after Pope Francis had called for "an all-out battle against the abuse of minors". After pressure from the Pope, in the preceding years Poland's Church had publicly apologised for abuses, and accepted the need to report those accused of such crimes. In earlier times clergy to whom sexual abuse of minors was reported were not required by their superiors to notify the police, but to investigate themselves, and if necessary inform the Vatican. \c\cOn 11 May 2019, Polak issued an apology on behalf of the entire Catholic Church in Poland. The same day, Tell No One, a documentary detailing accounts of sex abuse by Catholic Church clergy in Poland, went viral, reaching 8.1 million viewers on YouTube by 13 May. Among many, the film featured a priest known as Father Jan A., whose case is being reviewed by the Diocese of Kielce, who confessed to molesting many young girls. The film also alleges that Rev. Dariusz Olejniczak, a priest who was sentenced for molesting 7-year-old girls, was allowed to continue working with young people despite his conviction On 14 May 2019, Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has long had an alliance with the nation's Catholic Bishops, agreed to increase penalties for child sex abuse by raising the maximum prison sentence from 12 years to 30 years and raising the age of consent from 15 to 16. Prosecutor and PiS lawmaker Stanislaw Piotrowicz, who heads the Polish Parliament's Justice Commission, has also been criticized for playing down the actions of a priest who was convicted for inappropriately touching and kissing young girls. \c\cOn 25 June 2020 Pope Francis appointed Grzegorz Rys, Archbishop of Łódź, Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Kalisz, relieving its Bishop, Edward Janiak, age 67, of his responsibilities while under investigation for protecting priests who committed acts of sex abuse. On 17 October Pope Francis accepted Janiak's resignation. \c\cIn February 2019, three protestors toppled a statue of Rev. Henryk Jankowski following revelations that he sexually abused Barbara Borowiecka when she was a girl. Jankowski, who also had a criminal investigation involving the sexual abuse of a boy dropped against him in 2004, had been defrocked in 2005. However, he died in 2010 without ever being convicted of sex abuse. It has also been acknowledged that Lech Walesa's personal chaplain Rev. Franciszek Cybula had been accused of committing acts of sex abuse while serving in the as well. On 13 August 2020, Pope Francis removed Gdansk Archbishop Slawoj Leszek Glodz, who was among those who covered up abuse committed by Jankowski and Cybula. Glodz had also presided over Cybula's funeral Despite the fact that Glodz turned 75, the required age for Catholic Bishops to offer their resignation, the move was described as "cleaning house", as it is highly unusual for the pope to accept such a resignation on a prelate's actual birthday. \c\cOn 6 November 2020, The Holy See's nuncio to Poland announced that following an investigation by the Holy See regarding sex abuse allegations, Cardinal Henryk Gulbinowicz was now "barred from any kind of celebration or public meeting and from using his episcopal insignia, and is deprived of the right to a cathedral funeral and burial." Gulbinowicz was also ordered to pay an "appropriate sum" to his alleged victims. \c\cGulbinowicz is the former archbishop of Wrocław, whose support of the trade union Solidarity played a critical role in the collapse of communism in Poland. On 16 November 2020, 10 days after the Vatican, Gulbinowicz, but, as a result of the Vatican displinary action, could not have a funeral in Wroclaw's Cathedral of St. John the Baptist or to be buried in the cathedral. \c\cIn 2013, Cardinal Keith O\'Brien, the Archbishop of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh, resigned following publication of allegations he had engaged in inappropriate and predatory sexual conduct with priests and seminarians under his jurisdiction and abused his power. \c\cIn 2020, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse released a report which stated that the Catholic Church of England and Wales "swept under the carpet" allegations of past child sex abuse by numerous Catholic clergy in England and Wales. According to the report "there was no acknowledgement of any personal responsibility" by Vincent Nichols, since 2014 a cardinal and the senior Catholic cleric in England and Wales. The report said that Nichols cared more about the impact of abuse on the Church's reputation than on the victims, and lacked compassion towards them. \c\cIn Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry started in January 2014. It was the largest inquiry in UK legal history into sexual and physical abuse in certain institutions (including non-Catholic ones) that were in charge of children from 1922 to 1995. The De La Salle Brothers and the Sisters of Nazareth admitted early in the inquiry to physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions in Northern Ireland that they controlled, and issued an apology to victims. A 2017 report also stated that the local police, who had also poorly investigated claims of sex abuse at the non-Catholic Kincora Boys\' Home, had played a role in assisting the local Catholic officials in covering up reported sexual abuse activity at four Catholic-run homes for boys in the Belfast area and that these four homes had contained the highest level of reported sex abuse of all the 22 homes which were investigated. \c\cCatholic church in Australia had been criticised for mishandling of childhood sexual abuse cases which are severe in nature and widespread in extent. Catholic priests were charged by 2011 in over 100 cases of childhood sexual abuse in Australia. The Catholic Church had secretly paid equivalent of $276.1 million by 2017 in compensation to thousands of childhood sexual abuse victims of priests and religious brothers. Inquiries established that historically Australian Catholic church officials often, where cardinal George Pell knew about sex abuse in Catholic church as early as 1973, ignored or punished the child victim, did not investigate allegations, documents were destroyed or not kept, failed to prevent future abuse by clergy who had come to their attention by transferring clergy and religious members to new parishes or dioceses which did not know of their past and not stripping them of their religious status. John Paul II and Benedict XVI made apologies for abuse in Australia. \c\cRoyal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (2015–17) found that 7% of all Catholic priests in Australia were "alleged perpetrators of child sex abuse", average age of victims was 11.5 for boys and 10.5 for girls. Royal Commission found that 46% (92 out of 201) of Catholic Churches had child sexual abuse cases. Royal Commission had 4,756 child sexual abuse cases from 4,444 victims against 1,880 accused, in 62% cases the accused were Catholic priests and religious brothers and the rest were members of church. Abuse victim Amber Louise criticized Church's Towards Healing protocol, started in 1996 to "establish a compassionate and just system for dealing with complaints of abuse", who told the Royal Commission that the program delayed reporting her complaint. In June 2019, 18 months after being ordered to do so by the Royal Commission, the Australian Catholic Church published its National Catholic Safeguarding Standards closely mirroring Royal Commission's recommendations and government's National Principles for Child Safe Organizations. \c\cIn 2019, Fr Vincent Gerald Ryan, who had previously served 14 years in jail for sexually abusing 34 boys from 1973 to 1991, was jailed for at least 14 months for sex abuse he committed against two altar boys. \c\cIn September 2020, the Australian state of Queensland passed legislation which makes it so religious institutions, such as the Catholic church, and their members are no longer able to use the sanctity of confession as a defence against failing to report material information about the sexual abuse of children. Under the new Queensland law, clergy who refuse to report confessions of sex abuse will face a maximum sentence of three years in prison. In October 2020, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that the church had failed to intervene against Thomas Butler, a Marist Brother known as Brother Patrick, when students reported that he sexually abused them within the three-year period he taught at Queensland capital Brisbane's Marist College Ashgrove. Butler had received sex abuse complaints in between 1991 and 1993. Provincial of the Marist Brothers in Australia, Brother Peter Carroll, delivered an apology at the royal commission's public hearing. \c\cIn an address before the Irish parliament on 11 May 1999, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern announced a comprehensive program to respond to the scandal of abuse in the nation's Catholic-run childcare institutions. Ahern's speech included the first official apology to those who had been abused physically and sexually while they had been in the care of these institutions. The Taoiseach asked the abuse victims for forgiveness, saying: "On behalf of the State and of all citizens of the State, the Government wishes to make a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, to detect their pain, to come to their rescue."\c\cIn response to the furor aroused by the media reports of abuse in Irish government institutions run by religious orders, the Irish government commissioned a study which took nine years to complete. On 20 May 2009, the commission released its 2600-page report, which drew on testimony from thousands of former residents and officials from more than 250 institutions. The commission found that there were thousands of allegations of physical abuse of children of both sexes over a period of six decades. Over the same period, around 370 former child residents alleged they had suffered various forms of sexual abuse from religious figures and others. The report revealed that government inspectors had failed in their responsibility to detect and stop the abuse. The report characterized sexual molestation as "endemic" in some church-run industrial schools and orphanages for boys. \c\cIn the wake of the broadcast of a BBC Television documentary, Suing the Pope, which highlighted the case of Seán Fortune, one of the most notorious clerical sexual offenders, the Irish government initiated an official inquiry into the allegations of clerical sexual abuse in the Irish Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns. The inquiry resulted in the publication of the Ferns Report in 2005. \c\cIn response to the Ferns Report, Ireland's Prime Minister Brian Cowen stated that he was "ashamed by the extent, length, and cruelty" of child abuse, apologized to victims for the government's failure to intervene in endemic sexual abuse and severe beatings in schools for much of the 20th century. Cowen also promised to reform the Ireland's social services for children in line with the recommendations of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse report. Irish President Mary McAleese and Cowen made further motions to start criminal investigation against members of Roman Catholic religious orders in Ireland. \c\cIn November 2009, Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse reported its findings in which it concluded that:\c\cIn 2009, The Murphy Report is the result of a three-year public inquiry conducted by the Irish government into the Sexual abuse scandal in Dublin archdiocese, released a few months after the report of the Ryan report. The Murphy report stated that, "The Commission has no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up by the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Church authorities". It found that, "The structures and rules of the Catholic Church facilitated that cover-up." Moreover, the report asserted that, "State authorities facilitated that cover-up by not fulfilling their responsibilities to ensure that the law was applied equally to all and allowing the Church institutions to be beyond the reach of the normal law enforcement processes."  The report criticized four archbishops – John Charles McQuaid who died in 1973, Dermot Ryan who died in 1984, Kevin McNamara who died in 1987, and retired Cardinal Desmond Connell – for not giving allegations and information on abusers to legal authorities. \c\cThe United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, in early 2014, issued a report asserting that the pope and the Roman Catholic Church have not done enough and protect their reputation rather than protect children. A joint statement of the panel said,\c\cCommittee chair, Kirsten Sandberg enumerated some major findings, that abusive priests were sent to new parishes or other countries without police being informed, that the Vatican never insisted on bishops reporting abuse to police, and that known abusers still have access to children. Barbara Blaine of SNAP said,\c\cThe UN report prompted discussions of specific areas of controversy, including secrecy among bishops and Vatican statements denying responsibility which in canon law they have. \c\cBritish author and Catholic social activist Paul Vallely wrote that he felt the UN report had been hurt by the Commission having gone well beyond the issue of child abuse to issues such as contraception. However, he also felt the report did bring important pressure on the Vatican on important issues like reporting cases to police. \c\cThe Associated Press estimated the settlements of US Church sex abuse cases from 1950 to 2007 totaled more than US$2 billion. The figure was more than $3 billion in 2012 according to BishopAccountability. \c\cIn July 2003 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville paid $25.7 million to "settle child sexual-abuse allegations made in 240 lawsuits naming 34 priests and other church workers."\c\cAccording to The Boston Globe, the Archdiocese of Boston secretly settled child sexual abuse claims against at least 70 priests from 1992 to 2002. In 2003 the Archdiocese of Boston also settled a large case for $85 million with 552 alleged victims. \c\cIn April 2007 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon agreed to a $75 million settlement with 177 claimants and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle agreed to a $48 million settlement with more than 160 victims. \c\cIn July 2008 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver agreed "to pay $5.5 million to settle 18 claims of childhood sexual abuse."\c\cAddressing "a flood of abuse claims" five dioceses (Tucson, Arizona; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Davenport, Iowa, and San Diego) got bankruptcy protection. Eight Catholic diocese have declared bankruptcy due to sex abuse cases from 2004 to 2011. \c\cThe cost to the Church increased rapidly. Taking into account sums awarded to victims by juries, out-of-court settlements and legal fees, estimates went from $0.5 billion by the late 1990s to more than $2.6 billion in 2009. Roman Catholics spent $615 million on sex abuse cases in 2007. \c\cThe number and size of these settlements made it necessary for the dioceses to reduce their ordinary operating expenses by closing churches and schools in order to raise the funds to make these payments. Several dioceses chose to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a way to litigate settlements while protecting some church assets to ensure it continues to operate. In some cases, the dioceses filed bankruptcy just before civil suits against them were about to go to trial. This had the effect of mandating that pending and future lawsuits be settled in bankruptcy court. The sexual abuse scandal costs each of the 195 dioceses "an average of $300,000 annually."\c\cSeveral dioceses adopted the practice of first transferring the majority of their assets to their parishes and foundations before declaring bankruptcy, in the hope of decreasing considerably the amount to be awarded to victims. In some cases, the Vatican had to approve the transfer of large amounts to foundations in order to shield them from seizure; in other cases it guided and supervised such transactions. \c\cSome of the accused priests were forced to resign. Some priests whose crimes fell within statutes of limitation are in jail. Some have been laicized. Others – because they are elderly, because of the nature of their offenses, or because they have had some success fighting the charges – cannot be laicized under canon law. Some priests live in retreat houses that are carefully monitored and sometimes locked. \c\cBernard Francis Law, Cardinal and Archbishop of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, resigned after Church documents were revealed which suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in his archdiocese. On 13 December 2002, Pope John Paul II accepted Law's resignation as Archbishop and reassigned him to an administrative position in the Roman Curia, naming him archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and he later presided at one of the Pope's funeral masses. Law's successor in Boston, Archbishop (later Cardinal) Seán P. O\'Malley, found it necessary to sell substantial real estate properties and close a number of churches in order to pay the $120 million in claims against the archdiocese.[citation needed]\c\cTwo bishops of Palm Beach, Florida, resigned due to child abuse allegations. Resigned bishop Joseph Keith Symons was replaced by Anthony O\'Connell, who later also resigned in 2002.[citation needed]\c\cHofstra University researcher Charol Shakeshaft, the author of a report on sexual offenses in schools, said sexual violence is much more prevalent in schools than in the Church. According to the report, up to 422,000 students from California will be victims of sexual violence in the future. \c\cA report which Christian Ministry Resources (CMR) released in 2002 stated that contrary to popular opinion, there are more allegations of child sexual abuse in Protestant congregations than there are in Catholic ones, and that sexual violence is most often committed by volunteers rather than by priests. It also criticized the way the media reported sexual crimes in Australia. The Royal Commission in Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse revealed that between January 1950 and February 2015, 4,445 people alleged incidents of child sexual abuse in 4,765 claims. The media reportedly reported that as many as 7% of priests were accused of being a child sexual abuser, but ignored the same report on the Protestant Churches and Jehovah's Witnesses; Gerard Henderson stated:\c\cOne of the authors of an investigation by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution drew parallels between the handling of sexual assaults in the Church and how medical authorities handled similar abuse and assaults by doctors and psychologists. In both systems, the abusers are in positions of trust, admiration, and authority; the abuse is treated as an illness; the perpetrator is allowed to return to practice following an apology or rehabilitation program; and the incidents are hidden from the public for the good of the organization. \c\cThere have been many debates over the causes of sex abuse cases. \c\cOpinion seems divided on whether there is any definite link or connection between the Roman Catholic institution of celibacy and incidences of child abuse by Catholic clergy. \c\cA 2005 article in the conservative Irish weekly the Western People proposed that clerical celibacy contributed to the abuse problem by suggesting that the institution of celibacy has created a "morally superior" status that is easily misapplied by abusive priests: "The Irish Church's prospect of a recovery is zero for as long as bishops continue blindly to toe the Vatican line of Pope Benedict XVI that a male celibate priesthood is morally superior to other sections of society." Christoph Schönborn and Hans Küng have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church. \c\cErnie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said, "We don\'t see the Catholic Church as a hotbed of this or a place that has a bigger problem than anyone else. I can tell you without hesitation that we have seen cases in many religious settings, from traveling evangelists to mainstream ministers to rabbis and others." Philip Jenkins, a long-time Catholic turned Episcopalian, asserts that his "research of cases over the past 20 years indicates no evidence whatever that Catholic or other celibate clergy are any more likely to be involved in misconduct or abuse than clergy of any other denomination—or indeed, than non-clergy. However determined news media may be to see this affair as a crisis of celibacy, the charge is just unsupported."\c\cChurch authorities are often accused of covering up cases of sex abuse. In many cases, as discussed in the sections on different countries, clergy discovered by Church authorities to be criminally offending are not reported to civil authorities such as the police. They are often merely moved from one diocese to another, usually without any warning to the authorities or the congregations at the destination. While offending clergy could be subject to action such as laicization, this is rare; the intention of the Church until recent times has been to avoid publicity and scandal at all costs. \c\cIn some cases offenders may confess their wrongdoing to a priest under the Sacrament of Penance. Church canon law unconditionally prohibits a priest hearing such a confession from making any disclosure about the existence or content of the confession to anybody, including Church and civil authorities—the "Seal of the Confessional". This obligation is taken very seriously throughout the Catholic Church; for example all serving archbishops in Australia told the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that they would not report to police a colleague who admitted in the confessional to child rape. This is not always in contradiction with civil law; the law in many, but not all, countries confers confessional privilege, a rule of evidence that forbids judicial inquiry into certain communications between clergy and members of their congregation. \c\cAccording to the John Jay Report, 80.9% of the abuse victims in the United States were male, and a study by Dr. Thomas Plante found the number may be as high as 90%. A number of books, such as The Rite of Sodomy: Homosexuality and the Roman Catholic Church, have argued that homosexual priests view sex with minors as a "rite of passage" for altar boys and other pre-adult males. William Donohue of the Catholic League said that the Church's child sexual abuse problem was really a "homosexual crisis", which some have dismissed as unwarranted by stating a lack of correlation between a man identifying as homosexual and any particular likelihood he will abuse children. In the United States, says Donald B. Cozzens, 23 percent to 58 percent of priests and seminarians are homosexual, with a higher percentage among the younger men. Research on pedophilia in general shows a majority of abusers identify themselves as heterosexual, and the Causes and Context Study of the John Jay Institute found no statistical support for linking homosexual identity and sexual abuse of minors. Additionally The New York Times reported "the abuse decreased as more gay priests began serving the church."\c\cSome bishops and psychiatrists have asserted that the prevailing psychology of the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling. Thomas Plante, a psychologist specializing in abuse counseling and considered an expert on clerical abuse, states "the vast majority of the research on sexual abuse of minors didn\'t emerge until the early 1980s. So, it appeared reasonable at the time to treat these men and then return them to their priestly duties. In hindsight, this was a tragic mistake."\c\cRobert S. Bennett, the Roman Catholic Washington attorney who headed the National Review Board's research committee, identified "too much faith in psychiatrists" as one of the key problems concerning Catholic sex abuse cases. About 40% of the abusive priests had received counseling before being reassigned. \c\cIn 2019, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI published a letter (in German and then translated into English) in which he provided a unified perspective on several issues that, together, he believes contributed to the sexual abuse scandal. One of the chief reasons put forth by the Pope was the push by several prominent theologians for relativistic perspectives on morality where "there could no longer be anything that constituted an absolute good, any more than anything fundamentally evil; (there could be) only relative value judgments."\c\cIn Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention, Cimbolic & Cartor (2006) noted that because of the large share of post-pubescent male minors among cleric victims there is need to further study the differential variables related to ephebophilia (sexual interest in mid-to-late adolescents, generally ages 15 to 19) versus pedophilia (sexual interest in prepubescent children, generally those 13 years of age or younger) offenders. Cartor, Cimbolic & Tallon (2008) found that 6 percent of the cleric offenders in the John Jay Report are pedophiles, 32 percent ephebophiles, 15 percent attracted to 11- and 12-year-olds only (both male and female), 20 percent indiscriminate, and 27 percent mildly indiscriminate. \c\cThey also found distinct differences between the pedophile and ephebophile groups. They reported that there may be "another group of offenders who are more indiscriminate in victim choice and represent a more heterogeneous, but still a distinct offender category" and suggested further research to determine "specific variables that are unique to this group and can differentiate these offenders from pedophile and ephebophile offenders" so as to improve the identification and treatment of both offenders and victims. \c\cAll victims in the John Jay report were minors. Using a non-standard definition of "pre-pubescent", the Causes and Context Study of the John Jay College estimated that only a small percentage of offender priests were true pedophiles. The study classified victims as pre-pubescent if they were age 10 or younger, whereas the age bracket specified in the current guidelines issued by the American Psychiatric Association is "generally age 13 or younger". A recent book estimates that if the latter definition were used instead of the former, the percentage of victims classified as prepubescent would have been 54% rather than the 18% figure cited by the Causes and Context report, and that a higher percentage of priests would therefore have been classified as pedophiles. \c\cIn July 2014, Pope Francis was quoted as having said in an interview that about 8,000 Catholic clergy (2% of the total), including bishops and cardinals, were pedophiles. The Vatican indicated the interview had not been recorded nor notes taken during it and that quotes may have been misattributed in a deliberate attempt to manipulate readers. They stated that Pope Francis had not indicated that any cardinal abusers remained in their position. \c\cIt has been argued that a shortage of priests caused the Roman Catholic hierarchy to act in such a way to preserve the number of clergy and ensure that sufficient numbers were available to man their congregations despite serious allegations that some of these priests were unfit for duty. \c\cIn The Courage To Be Catholic: Crisis, Reform, and the Future of the Church, author George Weigel claims that it was the infidelity to orthodox Roman Catholic teaching, the "culture of dissent" of priests, women religious, bishops, theologians, catechists, Church bureaucrats, and activists who "believed that what the Church proposed as true was actually false" was mainly responsible for the sexual abuse of parishioners\' children by their priests. Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick, a retired Archbishop of Washington who was himself later laicized due to sexual misconduct, blamed the declining morals of the late 20th century as a cause of the high number of child molestations by priests. \c\cThe hypothesis that a purported decline in general moral standards was associated with an increase in abuse by clergy was promoted by a study by John Jay College funded by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The study claimed that the liberal 1960s caused the increase in abuse, and the conservative Reagan years led to its decline. The study was branded the \'Woodstock Defence\' by critics who said that the study's own figures showed a surge in abuse reported from the 1950s, and the passage of time meant that reports of abuse from earlier decades were unlikely. \c\cThe 2004 John Jay Report, a report commissioned by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, stated "the problem was largely the result of poor seminary training and insufficient emotional support for men ordained in the 1940s and 1950s." A report by the National Review Board issued simultaneously with the John Jay Report pointed to two major deficiencies on the part of seminaries: failure to screen candidates adequately, followed by failure to "form" these candidates appropriately for the challenges of celibacy. These themes are taken up by a recent memoir by Vincent J. Miles that combines a first-hand account of his life in a minor seminary during the 1960s with a review of the scientific literature about sexually abusive behavior. Miles identifies specific aspects of seminary life that could have predisposed future priests to engage in such behavior. \c\cItalian academic Lucetta Scaraffia [it] wrote in L\'Osservatore Romano that a greater presence of women in the Vatican could have prevented clerical sexual abuse from taking place. \c\cThis view has been challenged and severely criticized by several scholars for denying the cases of nuns implicated in sexual abuse and pedophilia. In 1986, a history scholar from Stanford University recovered archival information about investigations from 1619 to 1623 involving nuns in Vellano, Italy, secretly exploiting illiterate nuns for several years. In 1998, a religious research national survey on revealed a very high number of nuns reporting childhood victimizations of sexual abuse by other nuns. It was further noted that the majority of nun-abuse victims are of the same sex. In 2002, Markham examined the sexual histories of nuns to find several cases of nuns sexually abusing children. \c\cThe responses of the Catholic Church to the sex abuse cases can be viewed on three levels: the diocesan level, the episcopal conference level, and the Vatican. Responses to the scandal proceeded at levels in parallel, with the higher levels becoming progressively more involved as the gravity of the problem became more apparent. For the most part, responding to allegations of sexual abuse in a diocese was left to the jurisdiction of the local bishop or archbishop. According to Thomas Plante, a psychologist specializing in abuse counseling and considered an expert on clerical abuse, "unlike most large organizations that maintain a variety of middle management positions, the organizational structure of the Catholic Church is a fairly flat structure. Therefore, prior to the Church clergy abuse crisis in 2002, each bishop decided for himself how to manage these cases and the allegations of child sexual abuse by priests. Some have handled these matters very poorly (as evidenced in Boston) while others have handled these issues very well."\c\cAfter the number of allegations exploded following The Boston Globe's series of articles, the breadth and depth of the scandals became apparent in dioceses across the United States. The U.S. bishops felt compelled to formulate a coordinated response at the episcopal conference level. Although the Vatican did not respond immediately to the series of articles published by The Boston Globe in 2002, it has been reported that Vatican officials were, in fact, monitoring the situation in the U.S. closely. \c\cJohn L. Allen Jr., senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, characterized the reaction of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) as calling for "swift, sure and final punishment for priests who are guilty of this kind of misconduct." In contrast to this, Allen characterized the Vatican's primary concern as wanting to make sure "that everyone's rights are respected, including the rights of accused clergy" and wanting to affirm that it is not acceptable to "remedy the injustice of sexual abuse with the injustice of railroading priests who may or may not be guilty."\c\cOn 26 March 2019, Pope Francis made public an apostolic letter titled Communis Vita (Community Life). The letter, which was issued on 19 March 2019, amends Canon Law and requires superiors to a local religious to dismiss any member of their  "religious house" if they have been absent for 12 months and out of contact. Canon Law already required superiors to track them down and encourage them to return to their local order after they have been absent for six months. The policy officially came into effect on 10 April 2019. Parish transfers of abusive priests have existed in numerous Catholic sex abuse cases. \c\cIn 2009, eighteen religious orders agreed to pay €1.2 billion compensation to childhood victims of sexual abuse, a 10 times increase from the €128 million compensation agreed in 2002, on the condition that the identities of abusers must be kept secret, and victims will forgo the right to sue church and government. Money was raised mainly by selling church property to government. \c\cCatholic Church Commission on Child Sexual Abuse (Ireland), also known as the Hussey Commission, was established by church in 2001 to investigate how complaints about clerical abuse of minors have been handled over the last three decades. In 2010 Vatican announced an investigation into Irish Catholic Establishment's handling of the sex abuse and subsequent scandal. \c\cAfter the media in Philippines began reporting on sexual abuses by local catholic priests, the year 2002 Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines apologized for sexual misconduct committed by its priests over the last two decades and committed to drafting guidelines on how to deal with allegations of such offenses. President of this conference, Archbishop Orlando Quevedo, stated that over the previous two decades neerly 200 of country's 7,000 catholic priests may have committed "sexual misconduct including child abuse, homosexuality and affairs". \c\cIn August 2011, after women's activist group "Gabriela" assisted a 17-year-old girl in filing sexual abuse allegations against a Catholic priest in Butuan province then bishop of Butuan, Juan de Dios Pueblos, took the accused priest under his custody without handing him over to civil and church authorities. This behaviour was also heavily criticized by retired Archbishop Oscar V. Cruz, who blamed Pueblos for showing his priests the "wrong way". \c\cAccording to the John Jay Report, one in four child sex abuse allegations were made within 10 years of the incident. Half were made between 10 and 30 years after the incident and the remaining 25% were reported more than 30 years after the incident. The Report points at: failure by the RCC hierarchy in the United States to grasp the seriousness of the problem, overemphasis on the need to avoid a scandal, use of unqualified treatment centers for clergy removed for rehabilitation, a sort of misguided willingness by bishops to forgive sexual misconduct as a moral failing and not treat it a crime, allowance of recidivism upon reassignment of the priest, and insufficient accountability of the hierarchy for inaction. \c\cSince 2002, a major focus of the lawsuits and media attention has been criticism of the approach taken by bishops when dealing with allegations of sexual abuse by priests. As a general rule, the allegations were not reported to legal authority for investigation and prosecution. Instead, many dioceses directed the offending priests to seek psychiatric treatment and for assessment of the risk of re-offending. In 2004, according to the John Jay report, nearly 40% of accused priests participated in psychiatric treatment programs. The remaining priests did not undergo abuse counseling because allegations of sexual abuse were only made after their death. The more allegations made against a priest, the more likely he was to participate in treatment. \c\cSome bishops repeatedly moved offending priests from parish to parish after abuse counseling, where they still had personal contact with children. According to the USCCB, Catholic bishops in the 1950s and 1960s viewed sexual abuse by priests as "a spiritual problem, one requiring a spiritual solution, i.e. prayer". \c\cHowever, starting in the 1960s, the bishops came to adopt an emerging view based on the advice of medical personnel who recommended psychiatric and psychological treatment for those who sexually abused minors. This view asserted that with treatment, priests who had molested children could safely be placed back into ministry, although perhaps with certain restrictions such as not being in contact with children. This approach viewed pedophilia as an addiction, such as alcoholism which can be treated and restrained. \c\cSome of the North American treatment facilities most frequently used for this purpose included the Saint Luke Institute in Maryland; centers operated by the Servants of the Paraclete in Jemez Springs, New Mexico, and St. Louis, Missouri; John Vianney Center in Downingtown, Pennsylvania.; the Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut; and the Southdown Institute near Toronto, Ontario, in Canada. This approach continued into the mid-1980s, a period which the USCCB characterizes as the "tipping point in the understanding of the problem within the church and in society". According to researcher Paul Isley, however, research on priest offenders is virtually nonexistent and the claims of unprecedented treatment success with clergy offenders have not been supported by published data. \c\cThe USCCB perceived a lack of adequate procedures for the prevention of sexual abuse of minors, the reporting of allegations of such abuse and the handling of those reports. In response to deficiencies in canonical and secular law, both ecclesiastical and civil authorities have implemented procedures and laws to prevent sexual abuse of minors by clergy and to report and punish it if and when it occurs. In June 2002, the USCCB adopted a zero tolerance policy to future sex abuse that required responding to allegations of sexual abuse. It promulgated a Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People that pledged the Catholic Church in the U.S. to providing a "safe environment" for all children in Church-sponsored activities. \c\cThe Charter instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees. The Charter requires dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty. A Dallas Morning News article reported nearly two-thirds of the bishops attending the conference had covered for sexually abusive priests. According to Catholic News Service by 2008, the U.S. church had trained "5.8 million children to recognize and report abuse," run criminal checks on volunteers and employees and trained them to create a safe environment for children. \c\cA 2006 study by Jesuit Georgetown University Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) found lay Catholics were unaware of the specific steps that the church has decided to take, but 78% strongly approved reporting allegations of sexual abuse to civil authorities and 76% strongly approved of removing people credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor. \c\c[when?]\c\cIn 2005, Kathleen McChesney of the USCCB said "In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States. ...  What is over is the denial that this problem exists, and what is over is the reluctance of the Church to deal openly with the public about the nature and extent of the problem."\c\cIn early 2009, the sexual impropriety including molesting boys by Marcial Maciel Degollado, the founder of the Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic congregation of pontifical right made up of priests and seminarians studying for the priesthood, was disclosed publicly. In March, the Vatican ordered an apostolic visitation of the sexual abuse scandal in the Legion of Christ. In June 2009 Vatican authorities named five bishops from five different countries, each one in charge of investigating the Legionaries in a particular part of the world. \c\cThe 2001 Lord Nolan recommendations, accepted in full by the bishops, became model guidelines for other bishops\' conferences around the world, and a model for other institutions in Britain. One guideline was that in each parish there should be a "safeguarding officer", a lay person who would vet through the Criminal Records Bureau, a government agency, anyone in the parish who had access to young people or vulnerable adults, and would be a contact for anyone with any concerns. \c\cIn June 2002, the USCCB established the "Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People", a comprehensive set of procedures for addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy. The charter includes guidelines for reconciliation, healing, accountability, reporting, and prevention of future acts of abuse. \c\cThe USCCB's National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Young People now requires dioceses faced with an allegation of child sexual abuse (where the victim is currently a minor) to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation, and (in the case of an admission of guilt or finding of guilt by an appropriate investigation) remove the accused from duty. \c\cThe Board also approached John Jay College of Criminal Justice to conduct a descriptive study of the nature and scope of the problem of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church as well as the costs to the church of the scandal. Data collection commenced in March 2003, and ended in February 2004. The findings of this study are discussed elsewhere on this page. \c\cJohn L. Allen Jr., Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, commented that many American Catholics saw the Vatican's initial silence on The Boston Globe stories as showing a lack of concern or awareness about the issue. However, Allen said that he did not know anyone in the Roman Curia who was not at least horrified "by the revelations that came out of the Globe and elsewhere" or who would defend "Cardinal Law's handling of the cases in Boston" or "the rather shocking lack of oversight that revealed itself" though "they might have different analyses of what should have happened to him". Allen described the Vatican's perspective as being somewhat skeptical of the media handling of the scandal. In addition, he asserted that the Vatican viewed American cultural attitudes toward sexuality as being somewhat hysterical as well as exhibiting a lack of understanding of the Catholic Church. \c\cAccording to Allen, cultural differences between the Vatican and American Catholics complicated the process of formulating a comprehensive response to the sexual abuse scandal: "there is a lot about the American culture and the American Church that puzzles people in the Vatican, and there is much about the Vatican that puzzles Americans and English speakers generally."\c\cOn 9 May 2019, Pope Francis issued the Motu Proprio Vos estis lux mundi requiring both clerics and religious brothers and sisters, including Bishops, throughout the world to report sex abuse cases and sex abuse cover-ups by their superiors. Under the new Motu Proprio, all Catholic dioceses throughout the world are required to establish stable mechanisms or systems through which people may submit reports of abuse or its cover-up by June 2020. All metropolitan Archdioceses are also required to send reports to the Holy See on the progress of the investigation, whether in their Archdiocese or suffragan dioceses, every 30 days and to complete the investigation within 90 days unless granted an extension. The law is effective for a three-year experimental period with a vacatio legis of 1 June 2019.  According to Canon law professor Kurt Martens:\c\cOn 17 December 2019 Pope Francis issued a canon law instruction "On the confidentiality of legal proceedings" lifting the "pontifical secret" in the cases relating to: violence or abuse of authority in forcing sexual acts, sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable persons, crimes of paedophilia involving children under 18 years of age or with incapacitated subjects and the concealment of those conducts from ecclesiastical or civil inquiries. Under the new provisions, are excluded from the pontifical secret all the stages of the canonical trials, from the denunciation, to the phase of the preliminary investigations, to the phase of the proper debate, and up to the final decision, as well as any witness statements and documents produced in trial. It concerns both the procedures that take place at the local level, and those that take place in Rome, at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. \c\cThe instruction provides however that the information obtain in a canonical trial be treated in such a way as to ensure its security, integrity and confidentiality with a view to protecting the good name, image and privacy of all persons involved. According to Archbishop Juan Ignacio Arrieta, Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts: "the fact that knowledge of these criminal actions is no longer bound by the "pontifical secret" does not mean that it provides the freedom to make it public by those in possession of it, which in addition to being immoral, would undermine the right to a good reputation". Moreover, the Instruction does not in any way counter the absolute duty of the Priest to observe the sacramental seal nor the duty of observe the confidentiality of information acquired outside of confession within the whole forum called "extra-sacramental". \c\cThe professional secrecy of those involved in a canonical trial should not constitute an obstacle to "the fulfilment of the obligations laid down in all places by the laws of the State, including any reporting obligations [of possible news of a crime], and the execution of the enforcement requests of the civil courts" which, naturally, could oblige the delivery of documentary material to the civil courts. In this regard, Prof. Giuseppe Dalla Torre, former president of the Vatican City State Tribunal, observed that:\c\cAccording to Archbishop Charles Scicluna, adjunct secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the abolition of pontifical secrecy means that:\c\cProf. Dalla Torre underlined that this instruction is a canonical instrument which does not affect the application of the civil laws, as it regards the conduction of the trials and the cooperation with ecclesiastica authorities:\c\cCardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, Secretary of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, sent a letter which became known as the Crimen sollicitationis. In this letter, addressed to "all Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and other Local Ordinaries, including those of Eastern Rite", the Holy Office laid down procedures to be followed in dealing with cases of clerics (priests or bishops) of the Catholic Church accused of having used the sacrament of Penance to make sexual advances to penitents; its rules were more specific than the generic ones in the Code of Canon Law. \c\cIn addition, it instructed that the same procedures be used when dealing with denunciations of homosexual, pedophile or zoophile behaviour by clerics. It repeated the rule that any Catholic who failed for over a month to denounce a priest who had made such advances in connection with confession was automatically excommunicated and could be absolved only after actually denouncing the priest to the Ordinary of the place or to the Holy Congregation of the Holy Office, or at least promising seriously to do so. \c\cThe Vatican promulgated a revised Code of Canon Law which included a canon (1395, §2) which explicitly named sex with a minor by clerics as a canonical crime "to be punished with just penalties, not excluding dismissal from the clerical state if the case so warrants." According to De delictis gravioribus, the letter sent in May 2001 by then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) – Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and according to Father Thomas Patrick Doyle, who has served as an expert witness on Pontifical Canon Law, Crimen Sollicitationis was in force until May 2001. \c\cIn April, Pope John Paul II issued a letter stating that "a sin against the Sixth Commandment of the Decalogue by a cleric with a minor under 18 years of age is to be considered a grave sin, or \'delictum gravius.\'" In the letter, Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela (Safeguarding the Sanctity of the Sacraments), "§1 Reservation to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) is also extended to a delict against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue committed by a cleric with a minor below the age of eighteen years. §2 One who has perpetrated the delict mentioned in §1 is to be punished according to the gravity of the offense, not excluding dismissal or deposition." In other words, the CDF was given a broader mandate to address the sex abuse cases only from 2001 – prior to that date, the 1917 Code of Canon Law permitted sexual abuse cases by the clergy to be handled by the Congregation, for the Congregation to open cases itself, or for the Ordinary to handle judgement. All priestly sex crimes cases were placed under the CDF which, in the majority of cases, then recommended immediate action. \c\cThe "Guide to Understanding Basic CDF Procedures concerning Sexual Abuse Allegations" explain briefly the procedures which have been derived from the 1983 Code of Canon Law and put in place since 30 April (the same day). Among the points made:\c\cEvery allegation of sexual abuse of a minor by a priest is investigated by the local diocese and, if there is even a "semblance of truth" the case is referred to the Vatican CDF. "The local bishop always retains power to protect children by restricting the activities of any priest in his diocese."\c\cCivil law concerning reporting of crimes to the appropriate authorities should always be followed. \c\cThe CDF may authorise the local bishop to try the case. If a priest (who has the right of appeal to the CDF) is found guilty, a number of canonical penalties are possible, including dismissal from the clerical state. "The question of damages can also be treated directly during these procedures."\c\cSome cases can be referred directly to the Pope, who can issue a decree of dismissal from the priesthood ex officio. \c\cOther disciplinary measures short of dismissal are available where the priest has undertaken to live a life of prayer and penance, but he can be dismissed if he breaks the conditions imposed. \c\cThe CDF continues to update the 2001 law (Motu Proprio Sacramentorum Sanctitatis tutela) in the light of special faculties granted to the CDF by Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI. \c\cIn May, in line with the 1983 Code of Canon Law and the 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, a letter from the CDF was sent to the Catholic bishops. \c\cThe Vatican instituted reforms to prevent future United States abuse by requiring background checks for all church employees who have contact with children. Since then, in the US, over 2 million volunteers and employees; 52,000 clerics; 6,205 candidates for ordination have had their backgrounds evaluated. \c\cIn June, the USCCB established the "Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People", a comprehensive set of procedures for addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy. (More details in the Episcopal Responses section above.).[citation needed]\c\cPope John Paul II stated that "there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young". \c\cIn April, the Pontifical Academy for Life organized a three-day conference, entitled "Abuse of Children and Young People by Catholic Priests and Religious", where eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts were invited to speak to near all Vatican dicasteries\' representatives. The panel of experts overwhelmingly opposed implementation of policies of "zero-tolerance" such as was proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. One expert called such policies a "case of overkill" since they do not permit flexibility to allow for differences among individual cases. \c\cIn June, Louisville, Kentucky lawyer William McMurry filed suit against the Vatican on behalf of three men alleging abuse as far back as 1928, accusing church leaders of organizing a cover-up of cases of sexual abuse of children. \c\cIn August, Pope Benedict was personally accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to cover up the molestation of three boys in Texas by Juan Carlos Patino-Arango in Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. He sought and obtained immunity from prosecution as head of state of the Holy See. The Department of State "recognize[d] and allow[ed] the immunity of Pope Benedict XVI from this suit." See International position of the Pope for information on head-of-state immunity of a pope. \c\cIn November, the Vatican published Criteria for the Discernment of Vocation for Persons with Homosexual Tendencies, issuing new rules which forbid ordination of men with "deep-seated homosexual tendencies". While the preparation for this document had started ten years before its publication, this instruction is seen as an official answer by the Catholic Church to what was seen as a "pedophile priest" crisis. The US National Review Board cited the preponderance of adolescent males among the victims of clerical sexual abuse of minors in its report. The document was criticized by the National Association of Catholic Diocesan Lesbian and Gay Ministries for what some see as its implying that homosexuality is tied to the sexual abuse of children. \c\cArchbishop Csaba Ternyak, secretary of the Congregation for Clergy, put the following question to the experts: "[T]o what degree one can talk about the rehabilitation of the offender, what are the most effective methods of treatment, and on what grounds we can say that a person who has never offended is at risk to sexually molest someone?"\c\cTernyak spoke about the way that the crisis had damaged the priest-bishop relationship. He noted that there was a "sense of gloom" felt by the overwhelming majority of priests who had not been accused of any abuse but nonetheless who perceived that their bishops had turned against them and therefore had "become disillusioned about the effectiveness of the laws of the Church to defend their dignity and their inalienable rights". Ternyak also noted that "there have been more than a few suicides among accused priests."\c\cIn April, during a visit to the United States, Pope Benedict admitted that he was "deeply ashamed" of the clergy sex abuse scandal that has devastated the American church. Benedict pledged that pedophiles would not be priests in the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Benedict also apologized for child abuse scandal in Australia. \c\cIn November, the United States Court of Appeals in Cincinnati denied the Vatican's claim of sovereign immunity, and allowed a lawsuit against the Catholic Church government by three men who claim they were sexually abused as children by priests in the Louisville, Kentucky, US archdiocese to proceed. The Vatican did not appeal the ruling. \c\cTwo researchers reported that abuse cases had "steeply declined" after 1985 and that responses to abuse had changed substantially over 50 years, with suspension becoming more common than reinstatement. \c\cIn a statement, read by Archbishop Silvano Maria Tomasi at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on 22 September 2009, the Holy See stated that the majority of Catholic clergy who had committed acts of sexual abuse against under-18-year-olds should not be viewed as pedophiles, but as homosexuals who are attracted to sex with adolescent males. The statement said that rather than pedophilia, "it would be more correct to speak of ephebophilia; being a homosexual attraction to adolescent males ... Of all priests involved in the abuses, 80 to 90% belong to this sexual orientation minority which is sexually engaged with adolescent boys between the ages of 11 and 17."\c\cHowever, Margaret Smith and Karen Terry, two researchers who worked on the John Jay Report, cautioned against equating the high incidence of abuse by priests against boys with homosexuality, calling it an oversimplification and "an unwarranted conclusion" to assert that the majority of priests who abused male victims are gay. Though "the majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature ... participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay man."  She further stated that "the idea of sexual identity [should] be separated from the problem of sexual abuse... [A]t this point, we do not find a connection between homosexual identity and the increased likelihood of subsequent abuse from the data that we have right now." Tomasi's move angered many gay rights organisations, who claimed it was an attempt by the Vatican to redefine the Church's past problems with pedophilia as problems with homosexuality. \c\cEmpirical research shows that sexual orientation does not affect the likelihood that people will abuse children. Many child molesters cannot be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children. \c\cIn April 2010, in response to extensive negative publicity and criticism of the Pope, the Vatican entered what the Associated Press called "full damage control mode". Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's secretary of state, during a visit to Chile, linked the scandal to homosexuality. In response to widespread criticism of that statement, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said Bertone's statement went outside the remit of church authorities, while maintaining that "the statement was aimed at \'clarifying\' Cardinal Bertone's remarks and should not be seen as the Holy See \'distancing\' itself from them." He also noted that 10 per cent of the cases concerned paedophilia in the "strict sense", and the other 90 per cent concerned sex between priests and adolescents. Giovanni Maria Vian, editor of L\'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, said the continuing criticism of Pope Benedict XVI and the Vatican in handling the clerical sex abuse crisis is part of a media campaign to sell newspapers. The Pope issued a statement that the "Church must do penance for abuse cases". \c\cMsgr. Charles J. Scicluna explained in an interview with the Italian newspaper Avvenire:  "Between 1975 and 1985 I do not believe that any cases of pedophilia committed by priests were brought to the attention of our Congregation. Moreover, following the promulgation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, there was a period of uncertainty as to which of the "delicta graviora" were reserved to the competency of this dicastery. Only with the 2001 "Motu Proprio" did the crime of pedophilia again become our exclusive remit... In the years (2001–2010) the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) had "considered accusations concerning around three thousand cases of diocesan and religious priests, which refer to crimes committed over the last fifty years."\c\cPope Benedict issued an apology to those who had suffered from child abuse in Ireland in March 2010. The letter stated that the Pope was "truly sorry" for what they had suffered, and that "nothing can undo the wrong you have endured. Your trust has been betrayed and your dignity violated." Nevertheless, the letter was not enough to satisfy many critics, who felt that the letter failed to address their concerns, and mistakenly presented the abuse as an issue within the Church in Ireland, rather than acknowledging that it was a systemic problem. \c\cIn July 2010 the Vatican issued a document to clarify their position. They doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim that clergymen can be tried in a church court and to streamline the processes for removing abusive priests. However, the new rules were less strict than those already in place in the United States and lacked the clarity that pedophilia is a civil offense of the existing rules there. \c\cIn May, the Vatican published new guidelines, drawn up by Cardinal William Levada, the head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, on dealing with the clergy sexual abuse cases. The guidelines tell the bishops and heads of Catholic religious orders worldwide to develop "clear and coordinated" procedures for dealing with the sexual abuse allegation by May 2012. The guidelines instruct the bishops to cooperate with the police and respect the relevant local laws in investigating and reporting allegations of sexual abuse by the clergy to the civic authorities, but do not make such reporting mandatory. The guidelines also reinforce bishops\' exclusive authority in dealing with abuse cases. Victims advocacy groups criticized the new guidelines as insufficient, arguing that the recommendations do not have the status of church law and do not provide any specific enforcement mechanisms. \c\cThe Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors (Italian: Pontificia Commissione per la Tutela dei Minori) was instituted by Pope Francis on 22 March 2014 for the safeguarding of minors. It is headed by Boston's cardinal archbishop, Sean P. O\'Malley, O.F.M. Cap.. \c\cIn November 2014, Pope Francis laicized and excommunicated abusive priest Father Jose Mercau of Argentina. \c\cAt the beginning of 2018, Francis denied overwhelming reports of widespread sexual abuse by priests in Chile. In the face of the resulting outcry, he introduced an investigation that led to every bishop in Chile submitting his resignation; only a few of these were accepted, however. \c\cAt mid-year, amidst a series of abuse scandals in many countries, including the revelation that over a 50-year period, more than 300 priests were plausibly accused of abuse in the state of Pennsylvania alone, Pope Francis spoke of his "shame", without however offering concrete steps to remove abusive priests or sanction those who took part in cover-ups. \c\cFrom 21 to 24 February 2019, a four-day Catholic Church summit meeting was held in Vatican City, called the Meeting on the Protection of Minors in the Church (Italian: Incontro su "La Protezione dei Minori nella Chiesa") with the participation of the presidents of all the episcopal conferences of the world to discuss preventing sexual abuse by Catholic Church clergy. \c\cOn 26 March 2019, one month after the summit was held, Pope Francis adopted:\c\cVatican Law No. CCXCVII On the protection of minors and vulnerable persons;\c\cthe Motu Proprio On the protection of minors and vulnerable persons;\c\cthe Guidelines of the Vicariate of Vatican City on the protection of minors and vulnerable persons. \c\cAccording to Andrea Tornielli, these:\c\cLaw No. CCXCVII requiries Vatican City officials, including those in the Roman Curia, and diplomatic personnel of the Holy See, such as the Apostolic Nuncios, to report sex abuse. Failure to do so can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros (about $5,600) or, in the case of a Vatican gendarme, up to six months in prison. In addition, all crimes related to child abuse, including mistreatment, are persecutable "ex officio", even when the purported victim does not file an official report. The law also extends the statute of limitations to 20-year prescription that, in the case of and offence against a minor, begin to count from on his or her eighteenth birthday. In addition, the Governorate of the Vatican City State is required to set up, within the Vatican Department of Health and Welfare, service to support and assist the victims of abuse, providing them with medical and psychological assistance and informing them of their rights and of how to enforce them. \c\cThe motu proprio extends the application of the Vatican law to the Roman Curia and its personnel. It requires that, when recruiting staff, the candidate's suitability to interact with minors must be ascertained. \c\cThe Guidelines for the Vicariate of Vatican City are addressed to the canons, parish priests and coadjutors of the two parishes located within the Vatican, as well as to the priests, deacons and educators of the Saint Pius X Pre-Seminary, to all the religious men and women who reside in the Vatican, and to all those who work within the ecclesiastical community of the Vicariate of Vatican City. The guidelines require that, in the course of pastoral activities, those persons must always be visible to others when they are in the presence of minors, and that it is strictly forbidden to establish a preferential relationship with a single minor, to address a minor in an offensive way or to engage in inappropriate or sexually allusive conduct, to ask a minor to keep a secret, to photograph or to film a minor without the written consent of his parents. The Vicar of Vatican City has also the obligation to report to the Promoter of Justice any news of abuse that is not manifestly unfounded, and to remove the alleged perpetrator of the abuse from pastoral activities as a precautionary measure. \c\cIn 2010, the BBC reported that the major causes of the scandal were the cover-ups and other alleged shortcomings in the way in which the church hierarchy has dealt with the abuses. Particularly, the actions of Catholic bishops in responding to allegations of clerical abuse were harshly criticized. \c\cIn September 2010, Pope Benedict XVI lamented that the Roman Catholic Church had not been vigilant enough or quick enough in responding to the problem of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy. Pope Benedict laicized 400 priests for abuses in two years of his papacy. A representative of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), a group representing abuse victims, criticized the pope's remarks as "disingenuous" because, in her opinion, the church had in fact been "prompt and vigilant" in concealing the scandal. After Benedict's resignation in 2013, he was criticized by SNAP for allegedly protecting the church's reputation "over the safety of children". Representatives from the Center for Constitutional Rights (at the time engaged in an International Criminal Court case against Pope Benedict in which they were acting for SNAP), alleged that Pope Benedict had been directly involved in covering up some of the crimes. \c\cMary Dispenza further states that crimes against children took place in the past, they take place now and they will continue to take place in the future unless Pope Francis and the bishops act decisively to ensure that child safety has higher priority than protecting priests and the image of the Catholic Church. \c\cA Vatican spokesman stated, "When individual institutions of national churches are implicated, that does not regard the competence of the Holy See...The competence of the Holy See is at the level of the Holy See."\c\cCiting canons 331 and 333 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, James Carroll of The Boston Globe asserted that "On the question of how far papal authority extends, the canon law of the Catholic Church could not be clearer" and alleged that the Holy See's denial of competency contravenes canon law. Canon 331 states that "The vicar of Christ... possesses full, immediate, and universal ordinary power in the Church, which he is always able to exercise freely", and canon 333 states that "...By virtue of his office, the Roman pontiff not only possesses power over the universal church, but also obtains the primacy of ordinary power over all particular churches and groups of them."\c\cSilvano Tomasi, the Holy See's permanent observer to the U.N. stated that the Vatican was not responsible for abusive priests because "priests are citizens of their own states, and they fall under the jurisdiction of their own country" but the United Nations report differed claiming that since priests are "bound by obedience to the pope" under canon law, then the Holy See is accountable. The report also urged the Vatican to insist that priests and bishops involve the police in all abuse reports and end a "code of silence" leading to whistleblowers being "ostracized, demoted and fired". \c\cTo place the cases under the competence of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has been criticized by some as making the process more secretive and lengthening the time required to address the allegations. For example, in his biography of John Paul II, David Yallop asserts that the backlog of referrals to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for action against sexually abusive priests is so large that it takes 18 months to merely get a reply. \c\cVatican officials have expressed concern that the church's insistence on confidentiality in its treatment of priestly sexual abuse cases was seen as a ban on reporting serious accusations to the civil authorities. Early in 2010 Cardinal Claudio Hummes, the head of the Congregation for Clergy, finally said that instances of sexual abuse by priests were "criminal facts" as well as serious sins and required co-operation with the civil justice system. Italian academic Lucetta Scaraffia [it] described the conspiracy involved in hiding the offense as omerta, the Mafia code of silence, and said that "We can hypothesise that a greater female presence, not at a subordinate level, would have been able to rip the veil of masculine secrecy that in the past often covered the denunciation of these misdeeds with silence". \c\cSome parties have interpreted the Crimen sollicitationis – a 1962 document ("Instruction") of the Holy Office (which is now called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) codifying procedures to be followed in cases of priests or bishops of the Catholic Church accused of having used the sacrament of Penance to make sexual advances to penitents – as a directive from the Vatican to keep all allegations of sexual abuse secret, leading to widespread media coverage of its contents. Daniel Shea, the US lawyer who found the document, said that the document "proves there was an international conspiracy to hush up sex abuse issues". The Vatican responded that the document was not only widely misinterpreted, but moreover had been superseded by more recent guidelines in the 1960s and 1970s, and especially the 1983 Code of Canon Law. \c\cThe Catholic hierarchy has been criticized for not acting more quickly and decisively to remove, laicize and report priests accused of sexual misconduct. Cardinal Roger Mahony of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, said: "We have said repeatedly that ... our understanding of this problem and the way it's dealt with today evolved, and that in those years ago, decades ago, people didn\'t realize how serious this was, and so, rather than pulling people out of ministry directly and fully, they were moved."\c\cOne early opponent of the treatment of sexually abusive priests was Father Gerald Fitzgerald, the founder of The Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete. Although Fitzgerald started the Servants of the Paraclete to assist priests who were struggling with alcohol and substance abuse problems, he soon began receiving priests who had sexually abused minors. Initially, Fitzgerald attempted to treat such priests using the same spiritual methods that he used with his other "guests". However, as he grew convinced of the futility of treating sexually abusive priests, Fitzgerald came to oppose vehemently the return of sexual abusers to duties as parish priests. He wrote regularly to bishops in the United States and to Vatican officials, including the pope, of his opinion that many sexual abusers in the priesthood could not be cured and should be laicized immediately. \c\cEventually, Fitzgerald lost control of the Servants of the Paraclete. The center began to employ medical and psychological professionals who added psychiatry and medical treatment to the spiritual regimen of treatment favored by Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald continued to oppose these modifications to his treatment regimen until his death in 1969. \c\cBishop Manuel D. Moreno of Tucson, Arizona, United States repeatedly attempted to have two local abusive priests laicized and disciplined, pleading unsuccessfully in a letter of April 1997 with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to have one laicized; he was first suspended in 1990 and convicted by the church in 1997 of five crimes, including sexual solicitation in the confessional. The two were finally laicized in 2004. Bishop Moreno had been strongly criticized for failing to take action until details of his efforts became public. \c\cIn a The New York Times article, Bishop Blase J. Cupich, chairman of the United States Bishops Committee for the Protection of Children and Young People, is quoted explaining why Father Fitzgerald's advice "went largely unheeded for 50 years": First, "cases of sexually abusive priests were considered to be rare." Second, Father Fitzgerald's, "views, by and large, were considered bizarre with regard to not treating people medically, but only spiritually, and also segregating a whole population with sexual problems on a deserted island." And finally, "There was mounting evidence in the world of psychology that indicated that when medical treatment is given, these people can, in fact, go back to ministry." This was a view which Cupich characterized as one that "the bishops came to regret". \c\cIn 2010 several secular and liberal Catholics were calling for Pope Benedict XVI's resignation, citing the actions of then Cardinal Ratzinger's blocking of efforts to remove a priest convicted of child abuse. The pope did eventually resign in 2013, although he said that he did so because of his declining health. \c\cIn 2012, William Lynn of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia was found guilty of one count of endangering the welfare of a child and sentenced to three to six years in prison. Lynn became the first United States church official to be convicted of child endangerment because of his part in covering up child sex abuse allegations by clergy. \c\cAs reported by the Boston Globe, some bishops had facilitated compensation payments to victims on condition that the allegations remained secret. For example,\c\cIn November 2009, the Irish Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse reported its findings in which it concluded that:\c\cIn April 2010, Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins wanted to prosecute the Pope for crimes against humanity due to what they see as his role in intentionally covering up abuse by priests. In a CNN interview a few days later, however, Dawkins declined to discuss the international crime law court's definition of crimes against humanity, saying it is a difficult legal question.[citation needed]\c\cIn April 2010, a lawsuit was filed in the Milwaukee Federal Court by an anonymous "John Doe 16" against the Vatican and Pope Benedict XVI. The plaintiff accused Ratzinger and others of having covered up abuse cases to avoid scandal to the detriment of the concerned children. \c\cIn February 2011, two German lawyers initiated charges against Pope Benedict XVI at the International Criminal Court. As one of the reasons for the charges they referred also to the "strong suspicion" that Joseph Ratzinger, as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, covered up the sexual abuse of children and youths and protected the perpetrators. \c\cInternal division became public, with Christoph Cardinal Schönborn accusing Cardinal Angelo Sodano of blocking Ratzinger's investigation of a high-profile case in the mid 1990s. \c\cIn the trial of the French bishop Pierre Pican, who received a suspended jail sentence for failing to denounce an abusive priest, the retired Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos wrote a letter to support Pican in his decision. Exposed to heavy critiques, Hoyos claimed to have had the approval of Pope John Paul II. \c\cIn 2011 Hoyos was heavily criticized again. This time the Congregation for the Clergy was blamed of having opposed in 1997 to the newly adapted rules of the Irish bishops, demanding the denouncement of every abusive priest to the police. The Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin described the cooperation with the Congregation for the Clergy as "disastrous". \c\cAn article in The Washington Post published 27 December 2019, accuses former American Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick of paying bribes totaling US$600,000 to Pope John Paul II ($50,000) and Pope Benedict XVI ($291,000) and 100 Vatican employees to cover-up sexual misconduct accusations against him. \c\cThe media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases is a major aspect of the academic literature. \c\cIn 2002, the discovery that the sex abuse by Catholic priests was widespread in the U.S. received significant media coverage. For the first 100 days The New York Times had 225 pieces, including news and commentary, and the story appeared on its front page on 26 occasions. \c\cWalter V. Robinson, an American journalist and journalism professor, led The Boston Globe's coverage of the Roman Catholic sex abuse cases, for which the newspaper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Robinson was also a Pulitzer Prize finalist in Investigative Reporting in 2007. \c\cIn Ireland television journalism similarly played a key role in helping public awareness of widespread sexual abuse of children by priests. \c\cBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) produced the documentary Sex Crimes and the Vatican by a victim which included the claim that all allegations of sex abuse are to be sent to the Vatican rather than the civil authorities, and that "a secret church decree called \'Crimen sollicitationis\' ... imposes the strictest oath of secrecy on the child victim, the priest dealing with the allegation, and any witnesses. Breaking that oath means instant banishment from the Catholic Church – excommunication." Documentary also quoted the 2005 Ferns Report. \c\cSome critics have stated that the oversaturation of Church sex abuse stories has led to the perception that the Catholic Church is more rife with pedophilia than in reality.  A The Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll found that 64 percent of those queried thought Catholic priests "frequently" abused children; however, there is no data that indicates that priests commit abuse more often than the general population of males. \c\cAnglican writer Philip Jenkins supported many of these arguments stating that media coverage of the abuse story had become "... a gross efflorescence of anti-catholic rhetoric."\c\cCommentator Tom Hoopes wrote that during the first half of 2002, the 61 largest newspapers in California ran nearly 2,000 stories about sexual abuse in Catholic institutions, mostly concerning past allegations. During the same period, those newspapers ran four stories about the federal government's discovery of the much larger – and ongoing – abuse scandal in public schools. \c\cMany popular culture representations have been made of the sex abuse of children cases. \c\cA number of memoirs and non-fiction books have been written about these issues, including Andrew Madden's Altar Boy: A Story of Life After Abuse, Carolyn Lehman's Strong at the Heart: How it Feels to Heal from Sexual Abuse, Larry Kelly's The Pigeon House which deals with abuse in the Pigeon House TB Sanatorium at Ringsend;, and Kathy O\'Beirne's bestseller Kathy's Story, which details physical and sexual abuse suffered in a Magdalene laundry in Ireland. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Ed West has asserted that Kathy Beirne's story is "largely invented", based on Hermann Kelly's Kathy's Real Story, a book by the journalist on the Irish Daily Mail; Kelly is also former editor of The Irish Catholic. \c\cThe Magdalene laundries were the subject of a drama film called The Magdalene Sisters (2002), which generated controversy as it was early in the revelations about abuses at Catholic homes. In 2006, a documentary called Deliver Us From Evil directed by Amy Berg and produced by Berg and Frank Donner was made about sexual abuse; it primarily focused on one priest and his crimes. It showed how far some clergy went in order to cover up the many reports of sexual abuse.  In Ireland, the documentary series, Suffer the Children (UTV, 1994), was released. \c\cMany other feature films have been made about the continuing revelations of sex abuse within the Church, including:\c\cJudgment (1990)\c\cThe Boys of St. Vincent (1992)\c\cPrimal Fear (1996)\c\cSuing the Pope (2002), BBC documentary by Colm O\'Gorman\c\cSong for a Raggy Boy (2003)\c\cBad Education (2004), film by Pedro Almodóvar. \c\cTwist of Faith (2004), an HBO film\c\cHoly Water-Gate (2004), documentary\c\cOur Fathers (2005), a Showtime movie based on the book by David France\c\cHand of God (2006), documentary filmed for Frontline\c\cSex Crimes and the Vatican (2006), documentary filmed for the BBC Panorama Documentary Series that purports to show how the Vatican has used Crimen sollicitationis to silence allegations of sexual abuse by priests. \c\cDoubt (2008), based on the eponymous play\c\cWhat the Pope Knew, 2010 Panorama (BBC) episode\c\cMea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God, 2012 HBO film\c\cCalvary, 2014 Irish drama\c\cPerfect Obedience, 2014 Mexican film\c\cRay Donovan Showtime TV Series (2013)\c\cThe Prey - Silence in the Name of God (2013), Italian documentary by Luca Bellino and Silvia Luzi. \c\cSpotlight (2015), drama based on The Boston Globe's investigation and publishing about clergy abuse. Spotlight won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with the Best Original Screenplay. \c\cThe Keepers (2017), American documentary web series that was released on Netflix\c\cBy the Grace of God (2019), French-Belgian drama\c\cTell No One (2019), Polish documentary film by Tomasz Sekielski\c\cRevelation (2020), Australian documentary series by Nial Fulton and Sarah Ferguson\c\cA daily updated list of films and documentaries is available at the "Literature List Clergy Sexual Abuse" composed by journalist and author Roel Verschueren [nl]. \c\cIn 2005, Limp Bizkit released the album The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1), which focuses on dark lyrical subject matter, including Catholic sex abuse cases, terrorism and fame. Comedian Tim Minchin has the songs "The Pope Song", and "Come Home (Cardinal Pell)".
On October 4, 2021, Facebook and their subsidiaries including Instagram and WhatsApp were made globally unavailable. The outage is ongoing and the cause is not yet known. Security experts identified the problem as possibly being DNS-related and was most particularly related to BGP. The outage also reportedly broke internal systems used by Facebook employees.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on 25 January 2020 with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne, Australia. It has since spread elsewhere in the region, although many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. Three Oceania sovereign states (Nauru, Tonga, and Tuvalu) and one dependency (Cook Islands) have yet to report a case. Australia and New Zealand were praised for their handling of the pandemic in comparison to other Western nations, with New Zealand and each state in Australia wiping out all community transmission of the virus several times even after re-introduction in the community. \c\cHowever, by August 2021, Australia's populous states of New South Wales and Victoria had conceded defeat in their eradication efforts.[citation needed] In early October 2021, New Zealand also abandoned its elimination strategy. \c\cNote: The statistical information in this table may vary from official reports and WHO data, and is known to inconsistently include historical and suspected cases which may have returned a positive diagnostic test result. In some cases, these positive test results were reported by the media and/or by the relevant health authorities as confirmed cases, but this is not necessarily indicative of active SARS-CoV-2 infection due to most COVID-19 tests analysing past presence of the virus through the detection of relevant antibodies or through the detection of one or more viral fragments which are slowly shed during or after a person's recovery. These viral fragments are not indicative of whether that person has a current presence of the virus and are not indicative of infectivity. \c\cOn 25 January 2020, the first case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported, that of a Chinese citizen who arrived from Guangzhou on 19 January. The patient received treatment in Melbourne. On the same day, three other patients tested positive in Sydney after returning from Wuhan. \c\cOn 1 March 2020, a 78-year-old man from Western Australia, who had been a passenger on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, became the first person to die from coronavirus in Australia. He died in a hospital in Perth. \c\cAustralian borders were closed to all non-residents from 20 March 2020; all returning travellers are required to undergo two weeks' quarantine in hotels. From March onwards, many states and territories also closed their internal borders, with similar quarantine requirements for exempt travellers. A breach of quarantine in Melbourne hotels led to the state of Victoria experiencing a second wave and returning to strict lockdown measures from July through to October 2020.[citation needed]\c\cAs of 22 September 2021[update], Australia has reported 88,710 cases and 1,178 deaths. There are around 19,500 active cases in Australia. No deaths from COVID-19 were recorded in Australia from 28 December 2020 until 13 April 2021, when an overseas returned traveller died at The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane. There were then none until 11 July, when NSW Health reported a COVID-19 death from the current NSW Delta outbreak. As of 22 September 2021[update] at least 206 people in NSW had died of COVID-19 since the beginning of this latest outbreak. In late August 2021, Victoria also reported its first deaths since the end of the outbreak in June 2020 that saw the longest lockdown period in Australia at the time. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021, the external territory Norfolk Island has not had any confirmed cases. In March 2020, as a precautionary measure, the Norfolk Island Regional Council imposed a 32-day travel ban and declared a state of emergency. Administrator Eric Hutchinson stated that the measures were necessary due to the remote island's extremely limited health capacity. Lockdown measures began to be lifted from 6 May 2020. \c\cFollowing outbreaks in the Australian Eastern States and Territories in mid-2021, Norfolk islands implemented further restrictions. Covid support packages are available for Norfolk Island businesses and residents. \c\cNorfolk Island has begun administering COVID-19 vaccinations and is expected to complete it's initial vaccination rollout by October 2021. As of 2 August, over 60% of residents have received their first jab. Due to the accelerated rollout of the Comirnaty (Pfizer) COVID-19 vaccine and low levels of vaccine hesitancy in Norfolk Island, the region's COVID-19 vaccination clinic is currently slated to be closed on 31 September. \c\cOn 19 March 2020, the local government of Easter Island ordered a lockdown of the island and requested LATAM Airlines to evacuate all tourists on the island. However, on 24 March, the first case of coronavirus was reported on the island. By the start of April, 5 confirmed cases had been reported. All cases have recovered after some weeks and no new cases have been reported since. \c\cThe first case of the disease in Fiji was reported on 19 March 2020, leading to the lockdowns of Fiji's two largest cities, Lautoka and Suva for over twenty days. \c\cOn 31 July 2020, Fiji recorded its first death from COVID-19, a 66-year-old man who was repatriated from India. \c\cAfter over 365 days of no new cases in the community, Fiji recorded a new community case on 19 April 2021 leading to the immediate lockdown of Nadi and a second lockdown for Lautoka. This lockdown lasted almost fifty days and ended on 5 June 2021 despite COVID-19 cases still growing in the community. A similar lockdown was also introduced in the Central Division which contained Suva, Lami and Nausori in a single large containment area. The lockdown for the Lami-Nausori containment remains in place as of date. \c\cBy 20 August 2021, Fiji had confirmed 43,096 cases of COVID-19 with 21,825 recoveries and 432 deaths (plus 247 other unrelated COVID-19 positive patients deaths). \c\cAs of 24 August 2021, Fiji had reported 44,188 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 444 deaths to WHO; and as of 13 August 2021, a total of 690,888 vaccine doses having been administered. \c\cOn 11 March 2020, the first case in French Polynesia was confirmed. The first patient was Maina Sage, a member of the French National Assembly. There were 39 confirmed cases on 4 April. A ban on sales of alcohol was extended until the crisis is over. \c\cBy 11 November 2020, 11,316 cases and more than 4,842 recoveries had been reported in French Polynesia. \c\cAs of 12 August 2021[update], a total of 137,967 vaccine doses have been administered. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021[update], there have been 40,178 confirmed cases and 328 deaths. \c\cAs of 18 July 2020, there were 22 cases in New Caledonia. President Thierry Santa went into self-isolation on 4 April after a member of his staff tested positive. On 7 March 2021, the first nine locally transmitted cases were reported. \c\cOn 16 October 2020, the collectivity reported its first case. On 23 October, a second test on the first case returned a negative result, making the collectivity again COVID-free. \c\cA local community outbreak began on 6 March 2021, and the number of cases has since risen to 302 by 20 March. The first death was reported on 22 March. \c\cOn 1 February 2020, the government of Kiribati put all visas from China on hold and required new arrivals to fill in a health form and travellers from countries with the coronavirus to go through a self-quarantine period. Despite not having any cases, on 28 March President Taneti Maamau declared a state of emergency. \c\cOn 10 September 2020, the government announced it will keep the borders closed until the end of the year to keep the country free of the virus. \c\cOn 18 May 2021, a local seafarer on a ship quarantined in the port of Betio tested positive for the virus. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021, there have been 0 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 0 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 29 July 2021, a total of 13,970 vaccine doses have been administered. \c\cOn 24 January 2020, the Marshall Islands issued a travel advisory that requires any visitors to the country to have spent at least 14 days in a country free of the virus. On 1 March, the ban was extended to China, Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. \c\cAs of 18 March, all incoming international travel had been temporarily suspended, as well as some intra-island flight services. \c\cThe first two positive cases of COVID-19 were confirmed at the US Army Garrison on Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA) on 29 October. They were both placed in managed quarantine. \c\cOn 29 December, the Marshall Islands became the first independent nation in the Pacific to begin its COVID-19 vaccinations. \c\cThe Federated States of Micronesia reported its first suspected case in managed isolation on 8 January 2021. The suspected case was later deemed to be non-infectious and a detection of historical viral fragments after the individual returned negative antibody and antigen tests later in the month. As of 24 August 2021, the Federated States of Micronesia official COVID-19 case count reported to the WHO is zero; and as of 8 August 2021, a total of 56,736 vaccine doses have been administered. \c\cNew Zealand reported its first case on 28 February 2020 from a citizen who had arrived from Iran on 26 February. The second case was a citizen who had recently traveled to northern Italy. The first local transmission of the virus happened on 4 March in Auckland. On 29 March, New Zealand reported its first fatality, a woman in her 70s from the West Coast region. \c\cThe New Zealand Government introduced a four-level alert system on 21 March to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. On 25 March, the country moved into Alert Level 4, placing the country in a nationwide lockdown and closing its borders. While mass gatherings were banned and schools and most businesses were closed, essential services such as supermarkets, petrol stations, and health services remained open. Due to successful efforts to eliminate the pandemic within New Zealand's borders, the alert level system was progressively lowered to Level 3 on 27 April and Level 2 on 13 May, with lockdown restrictions and social distancing measures being eased at each stage. On 9 June, New Zealand entered into Alert level 1, where remaining restrictions on economic activities and daily life were eliminated but the country's borders remained closed to most international travellers. \c\cOn 4 May, the country marked the first day without the reports of any new case of COVID-19, a month after the country announced lockdown. By 31 May, there was only one active case with a total of 1,504 (1,154 confirmed and 350 probable) cases, 1,481 recoveries, and 22 deaths. By 8 June, that last active case had recovered. Following 24 consecutive days of no new cases, two new cases resulting from overseas travel were reported on 16 June. \c\cOn 11 August 2020, four cases were reported in Auckland, making the first reported community transmissions after 102 days. In response to the Auckland August 2020 community outbreak, lockdown restrictions were reinstated nationwide. Due to the reduction in community transmissions, lockdown restrictions in Auckland and the rest of New Zealand were progressively eliminated on 30 August, 23 September, and 7 October 2020. \c\cWhile most cases in New Zealand throughout 2021 have occurred at the border, community outbreaks have occurred periodically predominantly in the Auckland Region in February and August 2021, leading to the reinstatement of national lockdown restrictions on both occasions. \c\cNew Zealand's national vaccination programme began on 20 February 2021. As of August 2021, 3.33 vaccinations have been administered; with 2.17 million receiving their first dose and 1.16 million additionally receiving their second dose. \c\cIn early October 2021, Prime Minister Jacind Ardern confirmed that New Zealand's elimination elimination strategy would be phased out in favour of a new model that takes into account the country's vaccination rates. \c\cAs of 25 August 2021, the Cook Islands has not detected any active confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2. \c\cOn 5 June 2021, the first positive PCR test result in the Cook Islands was obtained which was reported in the media. However, it was determined to be a non-infectious historical known case of a person who had earlier completed quarantine in New Zealand and therefore not counted as an active confirmed case, however already been counted in New Zealand and recovered. \c\cBy 2 August 2021, the Cook Islands reported to the WHO a total of 21,761 vaccine doses have been administered. On 24 August 2021, the Te Marae Ora Ministry of Health reported it had completed its COVID-19 national vaccination programme, with 96.7 per cent of the eligible population, people aged 16-years or older, fully vaccinated. All doses were the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty. The Government is planning a further operation to vaccinate 12-15 year olds. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021[update], there have been no confirmed cases in Niue and as of 1 August 2021, a total of 2,352 vaccine doses have been administered. As a precautionary measure, the government has banned visitors from highly affected countries, and later all arrivals except for Niue residents and essential services people only. From 24 March 2021, travellers from Niue can resume quarantine free travel into New Zealand. Niue commenced their vaccination campaign the week beginning 31 May 2021. \c\cOn 9 July 2021, Niue completed it's initial vaccination rollout, which included everyone aged 16 years or older. 97% of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated using the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine. Since March 2021, Niue has a one-way travel bubble which allows Niueans to travel to New Zealand without quarantine. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021, there have been no cases in Tokelau. As a precautionary measure, boats arriving from affected countries have been banned from landing. On 19 March, all incoming travel was suspended, except for Tokelauans. \c\cOn 19 July 2021, the Royal New Zealand Navy warship HMNZS Wellington delivered 120 vials of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to Tokelau's Nukunonu atoll, which is sufficient to vaccinate 720 people . Tokelau's population was 1,499 according to the 2016 Census. As of 2 August, Tokelau had reported to the WHO that 998 vaccine doses had been administered. \c\cPalau began implementing border controls early on. The President of Palau Thomas Remengesau Jr. issued an executive order suspending all charter flights from China, Macau, and Hong Kong from 1–29 February 2020. By March, the country's borders were closed. \c\cThe order also quarantined all non-citizens who recently entered the country for fourteen days. \c\cPalauans began receiving COVID-19 vaccines in 2021. As a signatory of the Compact of Free Association with the United States, Palau has received vaccines from Operation Warp Speed. \c\cOn 31 May 2021, the first case was confirmed. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021, there have been 2 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 0 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 8 August 2021, a total of 26,796 vaccine doses have been administered. \c\cOn 20 March 2020, the first case in Papua New Guinea was confirmed. \c\cSwabs were taken and sent to the Medical Research Institute in Goroka for testing. Three announcements followed. First the Health Minister Jelta Wong declared a probable case, and Prime Minister James Marape followed up by declaring the result as negative. Further tests were conducted and the prime minister confirmed the positive result for COVID-19. Police Minister Bryan Kramer then stated on Facebook that the inconsistent results were due to faulty test equipment, and that requests had been made for further testing to be conducted in Melbourne. As of 19 November 2020, Papua New Guinea had 602 cases, 585 recoveries and 7 deaths. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021, there have been 17,947 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Papua New Guinea with 192 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 12 August 2021, a total of 102,074 vaccine doses have been administered. \c\cThe Autonomous Region of Bougainville's confirmed its first case of the COVID-19 pandemic on Friday, 7 August 2020, in Arawa, Bougainville. \c\cThere were two potential COVID-19 cases in Samoa that after returning a positive PCR test result in November 2020. However it is likely both cases were simply detection of viral fragments from non-contagious historical cases as neither case had symptoms and their close contacts tested negative. A third positive PCR test was returned on 12 February 2021. Of the three positive test results, Samoa has only official declared one confirmed case of COVID-19 to the WHO. \c\cThe first case of COVID-19 in the Solomon Islands was confirmed on 3 October 2020 as a student who had been repatriated from the Philippines on the 28 September 2020. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021, there have been 20 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 0 deaths, reported to WHO. The last confirmed case was reported on 5 April 2021 and all cases have recovered. As of 6 August 2021, a total of 56,621 vaccine doses have been administered. \c\cWhile the epicenter of COVID-19 in the USA lies in the contiguous 48 states, cases and outbreaks have been reported in the country's Oceanic jurisdictions. The state of Hawaii has by far the most coronavirus cases in the region, followed up by the territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. \c\cOn 9 November 2020, American Samoa reported its first three positive test results. As all three suspected cases were aboard a container ship, did not enter the country and were not confirmed to be active cases, they were not reported to the WHO. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021 in reporting to the WHO, there have been no confirmed COVID-19 cases and no deaths; and as of 8 August, 52,769 vaccines doses have been administered. \c\cBy 28 August 2020, the US territory of Guam has had 1,287 confirmed cases of the virus, 488 recoveries, and ten deaths. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021, there have been 9,138 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Guam with 145 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 8 August 2021, a total of 202,807 vaccine doses have been administered. \c\cThe first case was reported on 6 March 2020, and the first death was on 30 March. \c\cIn response to the initial spike in coronavirus cases, Governor David Ige issued a state-wide lockdown, which lasted from 24 March to 30 April. After another spike occurred a few months later, a second lockdown was issued from 27 August to 9 September. It was then extended until 24 September. \c\cThe center of the outbreak is on the island of Oahu, where most Hawaii residents live. Cases have also been reported on Hawaii Island, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kauai. No cases have been reported on Niʻihau, Kahoʻolawe and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021[update], Hawaii had the lowest case rate of all 50 states at 4,042 per 100,000 people and the lowest death rate at 39.9 per 100,000 people. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021[update], the US state of Hawaii had a cumulative total of 54,366 confirmed cases, 2,869 probable cases, 565 deaths and 3,220 hospitalizations. \c\cAs of 2 November 2020, the islands confirmed 96 coronavirus cases and two deaths. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021 in reporting to the WHO, there have been 224 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 2 deaths; and as of 5 August, 63,302 vaccines doses have been administered. \c\cOn 11 November 2020, Vanuatu recorded its first COVID case by a man who tested positive after returning from the United States via Auckland and Sydney. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021 in reporting to the WHO, there have been 3 confirmed COVID-19 cases and zero deaths; and as of 15 August, 27,716 vaccines doses have been administered. \c\cThe government declared a national emergency as a preventive measure, suspending all but one weekly flight to the country and instituting a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021 in reporting to the WHO, there have been zero confirmed COVID-19 cases; and as of 15 July, 14,784 vaccines doses have been administered. \c\cOn 27 March 2020, Prime Minister Pohiva Tu'i'onetoa announced that the country would be under a lock-down 29 March – 5 April. \c\cAs a precautionary measure, various travel and quarantining restrictions have been put in place. Cruise ships and yachts have also been banned from docking in the country. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021 in reporting to the WHO, there have been zero confirmed COVID-19 cases; and as of 15 August, 51,816 vaccines doses have been administered. \c\cCirca 26 March 2020, the acting governor general declared a state of emergency. As a precautionary measure, visitors will not be allowed to land without first undergoing 14 days of isolation in an approved third-party state. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021 in reporting to the WHO, there have been zero confirmed COVID-19 cases; and as of 15 August, 4,772 vaccines doses have been administered. \c\cAs a precautionary measure, all passenger services to the Pitcairn Islands have been suspended. The territory's entire population was vaccinated in May 2021, with vaccines that arrived via ship from New Zealand. \c\cAs of 24 August 2021 in reporting to the WHO, there have been no confirmed COVID-19 cases; and as of 21 July, 73 vaccines doses have been administered. \c\cIn late July 2021, UNICEF and the government of Japan announced US$20.8 million partnership to support Pacific Island governments regarding their battle against COVID-19. Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihide Suga had previously announced financial aid to boost health sectors in Pacific island nations during the 9th Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM9). 
The COVID-19 vaccination program in Canada is an ongoing, intergovernmental effort coordinated between the bodies responsible in the Government of Canada to acquire and distribute vaccines to individual provincial and territorial governments who in turn administer authorized COVID-19 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Some provinces have asked local municipal governments, hospital systems, family doctors and independently owned pharmacies to aid in part, or in full with vaccination rollout. The vaccination effort in full is the largest such immunization effort in the nation's history; it started in mid-December 2020 and is currently ongoing. \c\cHealth Canada is responsible for approval and regulation of vaccines (and other pharmaceuticals), while the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and chronic disease control and prevention. Vaccines are authorized by Health Canada, purchased by the Government of Canada and distributed by PHAC to individual provinces and territories in tranches based on various factors such as population size and prioritized peoples. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has also issued recommendations on how vaccines should be distributed. \c\cThe National Research Council Canada (NRC) has made investments in the domestic development of vaccine candidates, including candidates by the University of Saskatchewan and Variation Biotechnologies. In May 2020, the NRC announced a planned agreement to conduct clinical trials of a vaccine candidate by Chinese company CanSino Biologics, and plans to manufacture it at its facilities in Montreal once authorized. However, the deal collapsed due to strained Canada–China relations, and the federal government later announced commitments to purchase vaccines being produced by AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Pfizer. \c\cFrom about mid-January until mid-February, both Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna did not ship the agreed upon quantities of secured vaccines to Canada and other countries, due to manufacturing challenges. By February 18, Major General Dany Fortin, who led vaccine logistics at the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC),  announced that the vaccine delivery was back on track and that there will now be an "abundance of supplies" which will result in a "significant scaling-up of immunization plans in provinces." Significant increases in manufacturing and delivery of vaccines in conjunction with a recommendation by NACI to extend second dose administration to a maximum of 16 weeks resulted in a larger ramp-up in vaccine delivery across the nation in March - June 2021. By July 2021, Canada's vaccine supply had grown to allow a return to shortened dose intervals. \c\cWith Health Canada granting emergency authorization to the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine on December 9, 2020, mass vaccination efforts began across the country on December 14, 2020. The agency later authorized the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna on December 23, 2020. \c\cOn February 26, 2021, Health Canada authorized the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine for use, and its first shipments arrived in Canada on March 3, 2021. Following concerns of blood clotting events, although continuing to be authorized, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been largely discontinued as a first dose, and those who had already received a first dose are encouraged to receive an mRNA vaccine as their second. The Janssen vaccine was authorized on March 5, 2021, to become the fourth vaccine to receive Health Canada approval; However, Canada did not receive a delivery of the Janssen vaccine until April 28, 2021; which was then destroyed due to contamination issues at its factory of origin. There are no plans for Canada to use the Janssen vaccine. \c\cCanada became the first country to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine for people younger than 16 after approving Pfizer's vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 on May 5, 2021. In August 2021, the Moderna vaccine was authorized for use in children aged 12 and up. On September 16, 2021, Health Canada granted full approval to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. \c\cIn March 2020, the federal government announced a CA$275 million investment for "coronavirus research and medical countermeasures" and on April 23, 2020 over CA$1 billion in additional financial support was announced. This funding for "national medical research strategy to fight COVID-19" included "vaccine development, the production of treatments, and tracking of the virus."\c\cNancy Harrison and Cédric Bisson are co-chairs of the Therapeutics Task Force (TTF), which is tasked with prioritizing "financial support for promising COVID-19 treatment projects." The secretariat of the Therapeutics Task Force is housed at the Department of Innovation, Science and Industry (ISED).  Joanne Langley and J. Mark Lievonen are the co-chairs of the Vaccine Task Force (VTF) advising the federal government on "vaccine development, related bio-manufacturing and international partnerships". The secretariat of the VTF is supported by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). The NRC was tasked with identifying potential vaccine candidates, and helping to expedite clinical trials and approval of them in Canada. \c\cThe NRC signed agreements with several companies that had been developing vaccine candidates, including Variation Biotechnologies (which has a facility in Ottawa), and the University of Saskatchewan Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization–International Vaccine Centre (VIDO–InterVac). Canada did not have facilities capable of producing COVID-19 vaccines at the outbreak of the pandemic; the NRC earmarked $45 million to upgrade its laboratories in Montreal in anticipation of vaccine production. \c\cOn May 6, 2020, the NRC reached an agreement with Chinese pharmaceutical company CanSino Biologics to conduct clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate Ad5-nCoV at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. The NRC cited its "strong collaborative history" with CanSino, and past work on adenovirus vaccines, as part of its decision. CanSino's candidate was the first to enter phase II trials, and was considered by the VTF to be one of the top candidates. \c\cThe NRC would have received "a non-exclusive right to use, produce, and reproduce the vaccine for emergency pandemic use", free-of-charge. The agreement was announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on May 12 during a press briefing, and trials were expected to begin within the next two weeks. The trials were formally approved on May 15; the NRC stated that it hoped to produce between 70,000—100,000 doses of the CanSino vaccine per-month. \c\cThe CanSino agreement was impacted by Canada's strained relations with China; the shipments of vaccine doses were blocked by Chinese customs, and the State Council of the People's Republic of China refused to authorize the shipment.  In July 2020, after reports emerged over the delays, the NRC stated that CanSino "[remained] very committed to the Canadian clinical trials."\c\cWith the CanSino deal falling through, and the VTF revising its recommendations based on clinical trial data from other countries, Minister of Public Services and Procurement Anita Anand announced on August 5, 2020 that the federal government had committed to purchasing doses of the Moderna and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines. In anticipation of a COVID-19 vaccine, the Canadian government purchased more than 75 million hypodermic needles and syringes. \c\cAfter the NRC found that its current lab would not meet good manufacturing practices Prime Minister Trudeau announced on August 31 a federal investment of $126 million to "design, construct, commission and qualify a new biomanufacturing facility"—the Biologics Manufacturing Centre, which was projected to be completed by the end of July 2021. It would be built next to the NRC's current Royalmount site in Montreal and have a production capacity of approximately 2 million does per-month". \c\cIn September 2020, the federal government committed to purchasing 20 million doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine. It also announced that it would make a $440 million investment in the COVAX initiative, to help fund the equitable procurement of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. \c\cIn November 2020, Conservative Party leader Erin O\'Toole criticized the federal government for focusing too heavily on the CanSino agreement, arguing that he "would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China."\c\cOn December 9, 2020, Health Canada authorized emergency use of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine under the Interim Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to COVID-19. The Public Health Agency of Canada  supervises the rollout and administration of the vaccine. By mid-December 2020, Pfizer had agreements to supply 20 million doses to Canada. Healthcare institutions began administering the first 30,000 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Canada on December 14. A total of 249,000 doses was expected to be delivered by the end of 2020. \c\cBecause of the cold storage logistics, the initial doses were delivered to 14 distribution sites in the provinces, with none being sent to the Canadian territories since they could not properly store the vaccine. The 14 original distribution sites are located in St. John's, Halifax, Charlottetown, Miramichi, Quebec City, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton, Calgary, and two in the Greater Vancouver area. The Canadian government expects the vaccine to be administered to high-priority groups, designated by each province, until the end of March. Most provinces were first prioritizing some subset of healthcare workers, except for Quebec, which is prioritizing residents of long-term care homes, as well as British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, which are prioritizing both. Most provinces also have plans to expand priority status to additional groups—such as the elderly, or adults in Indigenous communities—before expanding to the general public. \c\cIn the same week as initial vaccinations for the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Health Canada authorized the Moderna vaccine on December 23, and it was announced that Canada would receive 168,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine before the end of 2020. Unlike the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, the Moderna vaccine does not require extreme cold temperature storage which meant that as of December 28, Northwest Territories and Yukon had received their first shipments of 7,200 each of the Moderna vaccine. Vaccinations in each territory are not scheduled to occur until mid-January. \c\cOn February 2, 2021, Trudeau announced a deal with Novavax to produce COVID-19 vaccines at the Biologics Manufacturing Centre, making it the first to be produced domestically. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is currently awaiting approval by Health Canada. This is the first deal signed by Canada that allows a domestic manufacturing of a foreign vaccine. The contract with Novavax is for 52 million doses of the vaccine. Following VTF and TTF recommendations, the federal government announced investment in two biomanufacturing companies—Vancouver-based Precision NanoSystems Incorporated (PNI) and Markham, Ontario-based Edesa Biotech Inc. (Edesa). PNI, biotechnology company, will receive up to $25.1 million to build a "$50.2 million biomanufacturing centre to produce vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as infectious diseases, rare diseases, cancer and other areas of unmet need". Edesa will receive up to $14 million to Edesa Biotech to "advance work on a monoclonal antibody therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is the leading cause of COVID-19 deaths. \c\cBy February 2021, the NRC and the ISED support for domestically-produced vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19 included $37 million in stage 1 funding for six vaccine candidates, and seven therapeutics candidates. \c\cIn mid to late January, details emerged about manufacturing delays by both authorized vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna affecting the country's vaccine rollout in late January through the month of February. On February 3, the European Commission approved delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to Canada, in spite of production constraints in Europe. Canada was one of many countries that applied for delivery and does not have its own manufacturing capacity. By February 4, Major General Fortin said while that Pfizer explained its dramatically lower vaccine shipments—with a decrease of 80% in all Pfizer shipments—as caused by "plant upgrades at a facility in Belgium", Moderna has offered no explanation for similar delays. By early 2021, the speed of Canada's deployment of COVID-19 vaccines had become the topic of widespread public discussion, along with the related question of why the vaccines were not being produced in Canada. \c\cFortin said that 180,000 Moderna doses had arrived in Canada on the morning of February 4 and Canada is "still expecting 2 million Moderna doses by the end of March. On February 4, Fortin said that about 70,000 Pfizer-BioNTech doses will arrive in the next week. \c\cOn February 3, COVAX published the country-by-country vaccine distribution forecast to COVAX participants—Canada will receive 1,903,200 doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine by the end of the first half of 2021. \c\cOn February 12, the minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) announced that Canada had "negotiated an accelerated delivery schedule for Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine." By the end of September, Canada will receive the 40 million Pfizer-BioNTech doses. \c\cMajor General Fortin announced on February 18, that the period in which Canada experienced limited supplies, is now over and there will be an "abundance of supplies" in the spring and summer months. This will result in a "significant scaling-up of immunization plans in provinces." Pfizer's new "locked in" delivery schedule includes 475,000 doses in February and 444,600 per week in March, according to the PHAC's vaccine distribution tracker. A February 18, 2021 article in New York Times said that Canadians were concerned about the rollout of the vaccination program. According to the same Times columnist, who had interviewed those involved in "vaccine development, epidemiology, infection control and medical supply chains", they all said it was not surprising that Canada's rollout was not happening as planned. While they could understand why Canadians were frustrated,  they said, this is the "nature of new vaccines". \c\cOn February 26, Health Canada authorized the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for use. The agency authorized the use of two versions of the same vaccine, one to originate from the United Kingdom, and the other produced in India by the Serum Institute of India (trade name "Covishield"). The first shipment of 500,000 doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca arrived on March 3, 2021. The doses were marked with an April 2, 2021 expiry date, necessitating speedy administration. \c\cThe Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was authorized on March 5, 2021 to become the fourth vaccine to receive Health Canada approval. The vaccine was the first single-dose vaccine to be authorized in Canada. Delivery times for the vaccine remain unknown. \c\cAfter an agreement was reached with Pfizer to move up some deliveries, it was projected a total of 8 million vaccine doses (from three suppliers) will be available in Canada by the end of March 2021. To maximize distribution of first doses, NACI issued a recommendation that second doses be administered up to four months after the first dose. \c\cMinister Anand confirmed on March 26, 2021 that 1.5 million Oxford-AstraZeneca shots would arrive from the United States on March 30, 2021, and that 10 million shots of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine would arrive between April and September 2021. \c\cIn mid-April 2021, the Government of Canada reached a deal with Pfizer to receive 8 million more vaccines on top of what was already ordered, with more than 2 million vaccines coming into the country per week beginning in the month of May. Moderna however continued to delay deliveries and slashed an order for the end of April from 1.2 million vaccines to 650,000. \c\cDue to public frustration with variable vaccine booking systems across the country, a small volunteer group known as Vaccine Hunters Canada created a website, Twitter and Facebook page to help "eligible Canadians find vaccines." The group posts relevant information on appointments available, eligibility requirements and other tips to the public that might otherwise not be common knowledge. On April 28, 2021 the City of Toronto officially partnered with the group to provide them end of day information in regards to vaccine availability and appointments that are currently unused, as well as information for pop-up vaccine clinics. \c\cThe first shipment of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine arrived in Canada on April 28, 2021. The country received 304,800 doses of the single-shot vaccine in its first shipment.  However, Health Canada held the shipment for a safety review, citing production issues at the facilities of Emergent BioSolutions. \c\cIn May 2021, NACI stated a recommendation that mRNA-based vaccines were preferred over viral vector vaccines such as the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines due to the rare risk of post-vaccination embolic and thrombotic events, with vice-chairman Shelly Deeks stating that "individuals need to have an informed choice to be vaccinated with the first vaccine that’s available, or to wait for an mRNA vaccine." NACI received criticism for the recommendation, with critics arguing that it contradicted the view that patients should receive the first vaccine they are offered, and that the statement was mixed messaging over the safety of the vaccines that could lead to increased hesitancy. \c\cOn May 5, 2021, Canadian health officials authorized Pfizer's vaccine for adolescents 12 to 15 years old, becoming the first country in the world to do so. \c\cOn May 11 and 12, multiple provinces, including Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan, announced that they would suspend their use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for first doses, citing supply shortages, with some provinces also citing the blood clot risk. \c\cDeliveries from manufacturers continued to accelerate in mid-May. In the week of May 16, Canada was expected to receive a record 4.5 million doses of the two mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. \c\cIn British Columbia, the Vancouver Coastal Health authority apologized on May 31 after accidentally administering the Moderna vaccine to 12 adolescents who were to receive the Pfizer vaccine per the approval. \c\cBy May 22, 2021, at least half of the overall population had received at least one vaccine dose, with Canada having administered 20.328 million vaccine doses overall. The country has passed other large countries in coverage like the U.S. vaccination program. \c\cAs new arrivals of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine came into the country in late May, provinces chose whether to administer second doses, for example as Ontario is going forward with, or providing people who took a first dose to choose a different second vaccine, as in British Columbia. \c\cThe country's percentage of single doses had been disproportionately high in comparison to second doses, due to NACI's earlier recommendations for intervals of up to four months. This led to calls from medical experts for provinces to prioritize second doses, citing the possibility having only one dose would make populations vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 variants. By late-May, amid an increased supply, several provinces had begun to shorten their intervals for second doses. NACI followed suit on May 28, issuing new guidance that second doses should be administered "as soon as possible", especially to high-risk individuals. \c\cFor the week following the Victoria Day weekend, Canada expected a smaller vaccine shipment than normal, as Pfizer-BioNTech sent more vaccine the previous week. \c\cThe government had previously indicated that Canada would have 55 million doses delivered by the end of July 2021, but this mostly included Pfizer distributions.  Moderna had now committed to delivering 11 million doses in July 2021, with 5 million of those doses potentially arriving in June.  Combined with an expected 9 million Pfizer doses to be delivered, this would be enough to give Canada 68 million doses by the end of July. \c\cOn August 13, 2021, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc and Transport Minister Omar Alghabra announced that the federal government plans to mandate the vaccination of all federal public servants, employees in federally-regulated transport industries, and passengers of commercial air travel, interprovincial rail service, and large marine vessels with overnight accommodations (e.g. cruise ships). The government will also "expect" the vaccination of all employees in industries regulated by the Canada Labour Code. At the time of the announcement, the Government of Canada estimated that there are approximately 19,000 employers and 1,235,000 employees (8% of all workers in Canada) subject to the vaccine mandate. \c\cSoon after the announcement by the Government of Canada, some provinces began mandating vaccination for their public servants, starting with the Ontario government, who announced on August 17 that public health services and school boards will be required to have a "vaccination policy" in place that would require an employee to either be fully vaccinated or undergo regular testing. The same day, the Quebec government announced that healthcare workers in both the public and private sector must be fully vaccinated by October 1, 2021. New Brunswick was the next province to follow, mandating vaccination or regular testing for provincial public servants. \c\cOn August 27, 2021 the Moderna vaccine was authorized for emergency use in children aged 12 and up. \c\cOn September 16, 2021, with the expiration of the aforementioned Interim Order, Health Canada officially granted full approval to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for individuals aged 12 and older. \c\cAdditionally, 198,370 Moderna, 5,850 Pfizer-BioNTech and 460 Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine doses have been kept for "Federal Application" for use with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), Canadian Armed Forces and the Correctional Service of Canada. \c\cOn a federal scale, the Government of Canada has mandated all federal workers be vaccinated by October 29, 2021 or face termination. Travellers on federally regulated modes of transportation (e.g. air, train and cruise ships) within Canada must show proof of full vaccination beginning October 30, 2021 or provide a recently negative test. The testing accommodation will be removed on November 30, 2021. \c\cMany private companies nationwide like Air Canada and major accounting firms have mandated vaccination policies internally. Most education institutions like colleges and universities nationwide have announced mandates for employees and students and for-profit long term care home companies such as Chartwell Retirement Residences, Revera and Sienna Senior Living have all announced mandates for vaccination for employees. \c\cThe following is a table representing individual provincial measures, policies and mandates for vaccination requirements by province and territory:\c\cThere are several COVID-19 vaccines at various stages of development around the world. As of 2 December 2020[update] the Canadian government had invested over $1 billion, including pre-placed orders for seven different vaccines, four of which are now authorized for use by Health Canada. These pre-orders total more than 400 million doses. Six of the seven vaccines require two doses each to be effective, with the exception of the Janssen Pharmaceutica (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine which only requires one dose. \c\cAs the COVID-19 vaccines are relatively new, certain aspects of delivery and pharmacological care of the products have changed rapidly over the course of the vaccination programme. \c\cEarly in the vaccination effort, debate on when to administer the second dose of the approved vaccines appeared medically and politically. Each manufacturer had recommended respectively 21 days apart for Pfizer-BioNTech; 28 days apart for Moderna; and 4–12 weeks apart for Oxford-AstraZeneca. New data suggested the manufacturer's recommendation could be lengthened, in theory allowing for more people to be vaccinated as supply efforts ramped up. Stanley Plotkin and Neal Halsey wrote an article published by Oxford Clinical Infectious Diseases that urged single dose interim use in order to extend vaccination to as many people as possible until vaccine availability improved. Several other articles and media provided evidence for delaying 2nd doses in the same line of reasoning. The province of Quebec began to withhold second dose administration, and eventually adopted a 90-day strategy. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) had initially only recommended a maximum of 42 days in between doses. The province of British Columbia had also followed suit and began plans to extend second dose administration to a four month delay. \c\cOn March 4, 2021, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended that a maximum of four months or 112 days could be achieved effectively between second doses. Other provinces began to adjust their administration programme based on the federal-level recommendation. \c\cQuebec no longer recommends a second dose for those previously infected with COVID-19, as the immunity is considered strong enough. People still wanting to receive a second dose will be allowed to get it. \c\cBeginning May 24, 2021, Saskatchewan became one of the first provinces to offer second dose administration on a shortened interval timeline, allowing people to book second dose appointments based on their age (beginning 80+) or first dose administration date. Meanwhile, Ontario allowed people who received their first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine between March 10 and 19, 2021 to book second dose appointments of the same vaccine. \c\cIn January 2021, the province of Saskatchewan discovered it could draw extra doses of the Pfizer vaccine out of vials labelled as having 5 doses. \c\cAs Pfizer prepared for industrial retooling to match international demands for its vaccine, causing a supply slowdown in Canada in January and February 2021, the company announced that their vials indeed contained 6 doses of vaccine, rather than 5. Health Canada accepted the relabelling of the product, however the revelation required the acquisition of millions of low dead space syringes in order to extract the last dose from the vial. \c\cInitially the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was required to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures (between -80 and -60 °C) in perpetuity, until application (in which time after dilution, the vaccine must be used within 6 hours). On February 25, Health Canada recommended that the vaccine could be stored at regular freezer temperatures (between -25 and -15 °C)  for up to two weeks. \c\cOn March 1, 2021, two days after the first delivery of the vaccine, the NACI announced that it would recommend that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine not be given to patients older than 65 due to “the insufficiency of evidence of efficacy in this age group at this time.” This recommendation was based on clinical trial data that only went as far as December 7, 2020. Quebec did not follow this recommendation, but its own Immunization Committee recommended that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines be given to higher-priority groups in the event of limited vaccine availability (with the AstraZeneca vaccine given to lower-priority groups). On March 16, NACI revised its recommendations based on newly-obtained efficacy data from other countries. \c\cOn March 29, 2021, NACI recommended that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine not be given to patients younger than 55, citing reports of a rare, increased risk of blood clots with low levels of blood platelets (post-vaccination embolic and thrombotic events). Most provinces adhered to this recommendation. In April 2021, due to the third wave of infections, and increased hesitancy towards the vaccine due to these side effects, multiple provinces (including Alberta and Ontario) went against NACI guidance and began to distribute the vaccine to people as young as 40. On April 23, NACI changed its guidance to recommend the vaccine be offered to patients as young as 30 years old if benefits outweigh the risks, and the patient "does not wish to wait for an mRNA vaccine". \c\cDue to increased reports of post-vaccination embolic and thrombotic events, on May 11, 2021, the provinces of Alberta and Ontario decided to cease offering first dose appointments of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. On May 12, Nova Scotia and Manitoba also announced similar restrictions, with Quebec following the next day. \c\cHealth Canada and NACI began looking into the possibility of mixing different vaccines in about April 2021. As the future of AstraZeneca vaccines in Canada became increasingly uncertain, due to both shipment delays and the risk of rare blood clots, and preliminary data on the subject became increasingly available, provincial governments\' interest in the proposal grew. In early May, Quebec became the first province to approve of the mixing of an adenovirus vaccine (AstraZeneca) with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), albeit only under certain circumstances: only people under 45 who have received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine would be able to receive one of the mRNA vaccines as their second dose. A couple of weeks earlier, Quebec had exceptionally allowed for the mixing of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to go ahead in long-term care homes, as the supply of Moderna doses was low. \c\cOn May 20, it was announced that Canada would be performing its own country-wide study on the effectiveness of mixing vaccines. \c\cOn June 1, NACI approved the mixing of the three approved vaccines in Canada (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca-Oxford). Specifically, they recommended mixing a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine with a second dose of one of the mRNA vaccines and mixing a first dose of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine with a second dose of either mRNA vaccine. Two weeks later, they changed their recommendations to suggest that a second dose of one of the mRNA vaccines after a first shot of AstraZeneca is "preferred", due to new evidence that seems to demonstrate an improved immune response on a mixed vaccine schedule. \c\cIn December 2020, the NACI issued initial recommendations for a multi-stage rollout of vaccines that would prioritize specific populations in sequence, beginning with residents 70 and older, health care workers, and the employees and residents of long-term care facilities (due to the pandemic's disproportionate impact on them); and progressing towards wider age ranges, first responders, essential workers, and residents with comorbidities, before progressing towards the wider general public. \c\cBrigadier-General Krista Brodie, Vice President Logistics and Operations, PHAC (began role May 17, 2021)\c\cPatty Hajdu, Minister of Health\c\cHarjit S.

An earthquake struck Pakistan's Balochistan province near the city of Harnai on 7 October 2021, killing at least 20 and injuring 300. The deadly moment magnitude 5.9 Mw  quake struck near the anniversary of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which killed 87,000 people. \c\cPakistan is directly influenced by the ongoing oblique convergence between the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate. Along the northern margin of the India-Eurasia convergent boundary is the Main Himalayan Thrust which accommodates north-south continental collision. Thrust faulting in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya region is the direct result of the plate interaction. In the Balochistan region, the convergence is highly oblique, involving the large Chaman Fault; a strike-slip structure and many thrust faults. The 2005 Kashmir earthquake occurred near the vicinity of the Main Himalayan Thrust. The more recent and larger manitude 7.7 quake in 2013 in Balochistan was the result of oblique-slip faulting along this highly oblique boundary. That earthquake killed at least 800 and caused major damage in the province. \c\cAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake occurred during the rupture of a thrust fault under the Sulaiman Mountains and Central Brāhui Range. It was followed by a magnitude 4.6 aftershock. It was the largest earthquake in Pakistan since the a major tremor in 2013 which occurred nearby. The earthquake was revised from an initial estimation of 5.7 at 20.8 km depth to 5.9 at 9.0 km. \c\cStriking early in the morning at just after 03:00 local time, the earthquake collapsed many homed where residents were asleep. At least 20 people died, mostly women and children. An unspecified number of residents were buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings, and rescued by survivors. The number of injured people stands at 300, with many hospitals in Balochistan overwhelmed by the influx of patients. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) (PDMA), severe damage was reported in the Harnai District and Shahrag area, where at least 70 homes were affected. Damage was also reported in the cities of Sibi and Quetta. \c\cFollowing the quake, troops from the Pakistan Army were dispatched in Harnai to aid in recsue and relief operations. At least nine injured victims in need of medical treatment were transported via helicopters from the affected region to Quetta. The Inter-Services Public Relations, army, medical personnel, response workers, and officials are working together to coordinate the rescue and relief works. A team of search and rescue individuals from Rawalpindi was sent to Harnai to find survivors among the wreckage."}
The COVID-19 pandemic in Victoria is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in the Australian state of Victoria was identified on 19 January 2020, when a man returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cOn 10 March, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews warned Victorians to expect "extreme measures" in the wake of the federal government updating the travel advice for Italy. These could include cancelling major sporting events, requiring entire economic sectors to work from home, and calling recently retired health professionals to return to work. \c\cA state of emergency was declared on 16 March, which was extended on 12 April, with existing directions remaining in place including staying at home, restrictions on particular activities, detention, restrictions on airports and cruise ships, aged care, hospitals and isolation for people diagnosed with COVID-19.[citation needed] It was extended further on 11 May,[citation needed] and again on 19 July to 16 August. \c\cOn 22 March, the school holiday was brought forward from 27 to 24 March. \c\cOn 14 April, Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced that Victoria would have the widest coronavirus testing in Australia, with anyone having COVID-19 symptoms able to get tested. The statement was issued that those who presented with fever or chills, in the absence of any other alternative diagnosis that explained the issue, or acute respiratory infection characterised by coughing, sore throat or shortness of breath should be tested for coronavirus. \c\cOn 20 June, the Victorian Government re-tightened restrictions on household gatherings following a spike in community transmitted cases over the previous week, reported to be mainly caused by family-to-family transmission in large household gatherings. From 22 June, households could once again only have five visitors; and most easing of restrictions that were to take place were postponed. \c\cOn 30 June, the Victorian Government re-enforced local lockdowns across 10 different Melbourne postcodes. Residents there would need to comply with the four acceptable reasons to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes. \c\cOn 2 July, the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced the "Judicial Inquiry into Hotel Quarantine Program". This followed some cases of coronavirus in Victoria being linked by DNA sequencing to a breach in hotel quarantine infection control. The Inquiry was to "... examine the operation of Victoria's hotel quarantine program for returning travellers." It was headed by retired judge Jennifer Coate, and was scheduled to deliver its report to the Governor by 25 September. The inquiry was delayed by lockdown restrictions. Andrews noted that "it is abundantly clear that what has gone on here is completely unacceptable and we need to know exactly what has happened." An interim report was published on 6 November, and the inquiry's final report was published on 21 December. The Government response to the interim report was published in November. \c\cOn 4 July, the Victorian Government announced two more postcodes affected by the lockdown until 29 July 2020. Nine public housing towers housing 3,000 residents were also added, with the additional condition that residents could not leave the tower under any circumstances for five days, with the possibility of an extension to 14 days. The Victorian ombudsman later found the lockdown of the public housing towers breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 6 July, the Victorian and NSW state Governments announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July. \c\cOn 7 July, after recording 191 new cases, Premier Andrews announced that metropolitan Melbourne and the Shire of Mitchell would re-enter lockdown from 12 am on 9 July, for 6 weeks. \c\cOn 19 July, following a "concerning increase in coronavirus cases", Premier Andrews announced that "face coverings" were to be made mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne, and Mitchell Shire. This was not enforced until after 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday 22 July to allow the populace time to acquire a face covering. In addition, the state of emergency was extended until 16 August 2020. \c\cFrom 22 July, as the chance of coronavirus infection remained high in aged care and health care settings, visits were restricted to carers only, and with a limit of one hour per day. \c\cFrom 23 July, "face coverings" in metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire became mandatory whenever residents leave their homes. A fine of A$200 was imposed to those not complying, though medical and other exemptions were allowed, such as not being required for children under 12 years of age. \c\cOn 2 August, a state of disaster was declared and metropolitan Melbourne was moved to Stage 4 restrictions. A curfew across Melbourne from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. was imposed, a 5 km (3.1 mi) radius restriction as added, and other restrictions that had previously been applied only to selected postcodes were applied to the whole of metropolitan Melbourne. A permit system was introduced for any residents that still needed to travel to work outside of their 5 km radius. \c\cOn 6 September (Father's Day), the "Roadmap for Reopening" was announced; a series of four steps towards "COVID Normal" which would begin on 13 September. In the "First Step", which applied to metropolitan Victoria, several restrictions were eased including a reduction of the curfew, some loosening of rules around outdoor exercise and social interactions, the introduction of a "bubble" that allowed single people living alone to nominate one person to be allowed to visit them during the first two steps, and increased limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. At the same time, it was announced that regional Victoria would move to the "Second Step", which included a staged return of students to onsite learning as well as the reopening of outdoor public pools and further increases to limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. \c\cOn 18 October, regional Victoria was moved to "Step Three", which included the reopening of most businesses to the public, increased seating for hospitality, the allowance of visitors for all residents and the resumption of some indoor sports. At the same time, the 5 km limit in metropolitan Victoria was increased to 25 km (16 mi) and the two-hour time limit was removed, however the border between metropolitan and regional Victoria (often referred to as the "ring of steel") was strengthened with extra checkpoints added. \c\cOn 26 October, metropolitan restrictions were eased, with residents allowed to leave home for any reason, all retail businesses allowed to reopen, hospitality venues allowed to seat patrons, further relaxations on outdoor gatherings, and allowance of visitors to all residents, with some caveats. The 25 km restriction and "Ring of steel" remained in place, however. \c\c With a length of 112 days, Victoria's second lockdown was the longest continuous lockdown world-wide, as of October 2020. \c\cOn 8 November, metropolitan restrictions were brought into line with regional restrictions with travel now being allowed to and from anywhere in the state. Indoor recreation, community and entertainment venues were also reopened. Restrictions on accommodation were also loosened in an effort to encourage intrastate tourism. It was also announced that, subject to public health advice, Victoria would move to the "Last Step" on 22 November. \c\cOn 27 November, Victoria recorded its 28th consecutive day of 0 new cases and 0 deaths, and had 0 active cases, epidemiologically eliminating the virus. \c\cOn 30 November, the Victorian government announced that a new dedicated agency, "COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria" (CQV), had been created. The interim Commissioner of CQV is the Commissioner of Corrections, Emma Cassar. CQV is part of the government's response to the COVID-19 Hotel Quarantine Enquirys\' interim report. It will oversee all parts of the Victorian quarantine program: mandatory quarantine for people entering Australia, Health Hotels for positive and suspected cases, or close contacts, and Frontline Worker Accommodation. The CQV Commissioner will be supported by three Deputy State Controllers. Deputy Chief Health Officer Professor Ben Cowie will lead the CQVs\' health management. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Ross Guenther will provide expertise in enforcement. As of 15 January 2021[update] the third Controller was still to be appointed. On 5 May 2021, the CQV general manager of infection control, Matius Bush, was stood down by the Minister for Government Services Danny Pearson pending a conduct review. Bush breached infection controls twice by: refusing a COVID test at a quarantine hotel when requested by Defence personnel; and failing to sanitise or change his mask when returning to a quarantine hotel from a coffee shop. Reports about the breaches were leaked and published in The Australian newspaper. \c\cOn 17 December, the Victorian ombudsman tabled a report in the Victorian Parliament in which she found the 4 July lockdown of public housing towers In Melbourne breached human rights laws. \c\cOn 30 December, Victoria's 61-day streak of zero community cases came to an end as three community cases were identified, linked to the New South Wales outbreak. As a precautionary measure for New Year's Eve the Victorian Government reduced household gatherings from 30 people to 15 and mandated masks within an indoor setting. The border to New South Wales closed at 11:59 pm on 31 December, with returning Victorian residents from "green zones" that returned before the deadline made to isolate until they received a negative test result. Those that returned afterwards would have to get tested and isolate for 14 days, aligning the restrictions with visitors from the Northern Beaches and Greater Sydney that had been enforced 11 days prior. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, a quarantine hotel worker at the Grand Hyatt Melbourne, a "resident support officer" involved in the Australian Open tennis quarantine program, was found to have COVID-19. From 11:59 pm Victoria immediately reintroduced some rules, tightened some, and put off imminent easing of some restrictions. The plan to, from 8 February (Monday), allow up to 75 per cent of office workers back into their workplaces was put on hold. Masks are mandatory inside, and only 15 persons are allowed at private events. The man visited at least 14 businesses from 29 January to 1 February, but was able to give contact tracers a detailed list of places and times. Anyone who was at those places at those times, must be tested, and isolate for 14 days. Testing site hours were extended from 4 February, opening at 8 am. More drive-through lanes were added, and additional testing sites opened. By 5 February, genomic sequencing confirmed that the Hyatt worker was infected with the more contagious "UK strain" of COVID-19. \c\cOn 12 February, it was announced that a five-day lockdown under Stage 4 restrictions would take effect beginning at 11:59 pm. AEDT, due to a cluster of 13 cases tied to a Holiday Inn quarantine hotel near Melbourne Airport, which have been assumed to be the UK variant. It was alleged by health officials to have been spread on a hotel floor due to a patient's use of an aerosol-generating nebuliser, which is normally banned under hotel quarantine. By 14 February the cluster had grown to 16, and by 16 February, the number of confirmed infections had increased to 19. By 19 February,  the Melbourne Holiday Inn outbreak had increased to 22, one person was admitted to intensive care, and about 3,515 contacts were quarantined. \c\cResidents may not leave their homes except for essential shopping, exercise, caregiving, essential work, or participating in a professional sporting event. Residents may only shop or exercise within five kilometres of their homes. Face masks are mandatory at all times out-of-home, all public gatherings are banned, and all schools are closed. As they account for the majority of UK variant cases, international arrivals into Victoria were also suspended. All Australian states and territories have placed travel restrictions upon Victoria. Premier Andrews stated that these infections were "moving at a velocity that has not been seen anywhere in our country over the course of these last 12 months." Special dispensation was given to the 2021 Australian Open, which became crowdless effective 11:30 pm. AEDT on 12 February in the midst of the night's final match (play was temporarily suspended at that time to remove all spectators from the court). \c\cThe lockdown was lifted as anticipated at 11:59 pm on 17 February. Despite this, Victoria will not allow any incoming international flights "indefinitely". \c\cRemaining restrictions included:\c\cMasks mandatory inside,\c\cMasks outdoors when unable to keep social distance,\c\c5 person limit on home visits,\c\c20 person limit for outdoor gatherings. \c\cAs of 9 May 2021 Victoria had no cases of community transmission for 72 days. \c\cOn 24 May in northern Melbourne, 4 cases of COVID-19 in the community were reported; this broke Victoria's streak of 86 days with no community transmission. Another 5 community cases, for a total of 9, were reported on 25 May. 4 of them were family contacts of a man, who may be the source of the outbreak, who tested positive on 2 May. As a result, restrictions in Greater Melbourne were again tightened from 6pm on Tuesday, 25 May, to at least Friday, 4 June. Restrictions included:\c\cmandatory wearing of masks indoors (children under 12 exempted)\c\cprivate gatherings, limited to 5 people\c\cpublic gatherings, limited 30 people\c\climits on visitors to hospitals and aged care reinstated\c\cMelbourne residents were allowed to travel out of the city, but had to observe restrictions as if they were still in Melbourne\c\cno changes to the number of people allowed in workplaces, shops, bars, or beauty services. \c\cRelaxation of "density caps" in hospitality venues had been planned, was put on hold. Cultural and sports event were allowed, but the AFL "paused" ticket sales for Victorian-based games. \c\cBy 27 May the Melbourne outbreak had risen to 26 cases. There were over 150 exposure sites and 11,000 contacts had been linked through contact tracing to the outbreak. As a result of the growing outbreak Victoria entered its fourth lockdown, statewide, as of 11:59pm on 27 May. The restrictions were initially planned to last for at least 7 days until 11:59pm on 3 June. By 1 June the number of cases in the Victorian outbreak had reached 60 and on 2 June the lockdown was extended for another 7 days. By June 7 there were 81 active COVID cases in the outbreak. The lockdown ended, with some restrictions remaining, just before midnight on 10 June. \c\cDuring the lockdown leaving home was initially only allowed for 5 reasons:\c\cFood and supply shopping (only within 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) of home)\c\cAuthorised work\c\cCare and caregiving, health\c\cExercising, for up to two hours:\c\cwith no more than one other person\c\cwithin 5 km of home\c\cTo get a COVID-19 vaccination. \c\cOtherwise:\c\cSchools closed (some exemptions)\c\cHigher education, online only\c\cChildcare centres and kindergartens, stay open\c\cHairdressers, beauty salons and similar, closed\c\cEntertainment venues, closed\c\cOnly take-away food allowed from cafes and restaurants\c\cNo public or private gatherings\c\cNo hospital or nursing home visits (some exemptions)\c\cFunerals limited to 10 people, plus those running the event\c\cWeddings not allowed (some exemptions)\c\cMasks mandatory outside the home, unless exempted. \c\cThere were anti-lockdown protests in Melbourne on 28 May. \c\cDue to the outbreak, all Australian states imposed a range of restrictions on travellers from Victoria, either banning entry, only allowing state residents back in, requiring home isolation for 7 days under Victorias\' rules, 14 days hotel quarantine, or other measures. New Zealand paused the travel bubble with Victoria from 7:59pm on 25 May. As a result of the pausing of the travel bubble, the Melbourne Rebels\' scheduled Super Rugby Trans-Tasman match against the Highlanders was forced to be relocated from Queenstown, New Zealand to Sydney. On 3 June the stay-at-home order from NSW Health, for anyone in NSW who had been in Victoria since May 27, was extended by a week. \c\cThe fourth lockdown meant that a number of other interstate professional sporting matches that were due that week had to either be played in empty stadiums, or relocated to alternative venues. The A-League match between Western United and Melbourne Victory on 28 May, the AFL match between the Western Bulldogs and Melbourne on 28 May and the AFL matches scheduled on 29 May (Collingwood against Geelong at the MCG and St Kilda against North Melbourne at Marvel Stadium) were played in empty stadiums, while the AFL match between Richmond and Adelaide scheduled for Sunday 30 May and the NRL match between the Melbourne Storm and the Gold Coast Titans scheduled for 5 June were both relocated interstate, to Sydney and the Sunshine Coast respectively. \c\cAfter the number of cases in the Victorian outbreak had reached 60 by 1 June, on 2 June the lockdown was extended for another 7 days. Some restrictions were eased:\c\cthe 5 km travel limit was extended to 10 km (6.2 miles),\c\cschool attendance allowed for years 11 and 12,\c\cauthorised work now includes some outdoors work. \c\cUse of the Service Victoria QR code check-in is required across Victoria for places like supermarkets and shops. \c\cThe Victorian outbreak rose to 63 cases by 3 June, all in Greater Melbourne. As a result, from 11:59 pm that day some lockdown restrictions in regional Victoria were eased:\c\cmovement in regional areas was unrestricted (to Melbourne is still restricted)\c\cstudents could return to school\c\cThere were 81 active COVID cases in the outbreak by June 7. There were also 3 separate clusters with unknown sources in Victoria by then: 32 cases in Whittlesea; 9 at the Arcare aged care centre in Maidstone; and 14 at a cluster in West Melbourne. The West Melbourne cluster was found to be of the fast spreading Delta COVID variant, raising the possibility the fourth Victorian lockdown could be extended again. \c\cThe lockdown ended on 10 June at 11:59 pm, with some restrictions remaining. \c\cno visitors in the home\c\cmust wear a mask both indoors and outdoors\c\ctravel limited to 25 km (16 mi) radius of home. \c\cDue to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, from 11:59pm on 24 June, border entry was barred to non-Victorian residents who had been in Greater Sydney and Wollongong in the previous 14 days as those areas were considered to be red zones. Returning Victorians had to get a red zone permit and quarantine at home for 14 days. \c\cFrom 11:59pm on July 11, Victoria closed its border to all New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory residents to try to prevent the delta variant entering the state. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr tweeted that it was "incredibly disappointing and frustrating" after more than a year with no local COVID-19 cases that the border was being closed to Canberrans. \'Border bubble\' arrangements for border towns remained in place. \c\cOn 14 July, after 11 COVID cases were detected in the state, Victoria reintroduced the requirement to wear face masks in workplaces, in schools, and when social distancing was not possible, outdoors. Most cases are linked to removalists from NSW who picked up from the Ariele apartments in Maribyrnong on 8 July without face masks. On return to NSW the removalists tested positive. Because of them the apartment block, with 130 residents, was put into a 14 day lockdown on 13 July, which was \'reset\' by the new cases. \c\cOn 15 July, it the Premier announced that Victoria would enter a snap lockdown for 5 days from 11:59pm on 15 July (Thursday) until 11:59pm on 20 July (Tuesday). This will be the third Victorian lockdown in 2021, and the fifth since the start of the pandemic in Australia. There are 18 cases in the current outbreak in Victoria, 4 recorded on this day, all of which link back to "incursions" from NSW. There are 1,500 primary close contacts and 75 exposure sites in Victoria. \c\cOn 20 July the Premier announced that Victoria's snap lockdown would be extended, with current settings to continue for the next seven days until Tuesday, 27 July at 11.59pm - the Delta variant is confounding Victoria’s public health experts and is moving faster than anything they\'ve seen before. \c\cOn 22 July, the death of a 48-year-old woman from Victoria the previous week was linked by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to "probable" thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS),  after vaccination with AstraZeneca. \c\cOn 24 July there was an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne. There were 6 arrests, 4 people charged, and 74 infringement notices issued. There were also protests in Brisbane, and in Sydney where several people were arrested, infringement notices issued and over 50 people charged. Assistant police commissioner Luke Cornelius responds: "It beggars belief that the protest today could, if mass spreading occurs, result in an extension of the very thing they are protesting for: an end to the current lockdown and a reopening of business, which is something we are all working so hard to achieve."\c\cOn 27 July at 11:59pm the 5th lockdown was lifted with strict restrictions still remaining. It is unknown when the restrictions will ease further. \c\cno visitors in the home\c\cmust wear a mask both indoors and outdoors\c\cstudents can return to school\c\cpublic gatherings are limited to 10 people\c\cpubs, restaurants, bars, gyms and retail can reopen with density limits\c\ccommunity sport is back but spectators not allowed\c\cOn 5 August 2021, in response to the detection of six new community cases, the Victorian Government announced their sixth lockdown, commencing that evening at 8 pm for seven days. At about 7pm that day there was an anti-lockdown protest of up to 400 people in Flinders Street, Melbourne. \c\cRegional Victoria was released from its sixth lockdown early on 10 August.[citation needed]\c\cOn 11 August the lockdown was extended for 7 days. This followed the state having 20 new cases, 5 with an unknown source. \c\cOn 16 August the lockdown was extended for another 14 days, with the overnight curfew reinstated and a target end date of 2 September. \c\cOn 19 August, Melbourne marked 200 days of lockdowns since the beginning of the pandemic. \c\cOn 4 October, Melbourne marked 245 days of lockdowns and became the city with the longest cumulative time in lockdown in the world. \c\cOn 21 August at 1pm, regional Victoria was also placed into its seventh lockdown and other restrictions tightened, such as the 5 km limit for essential shopping, and exercise activities. Hospitality was again takeaway only, most retail stores closed and schooling online only. Sporting venues, skate parks, playgrounds, and outdoor exercise equipment all closed. Construction statewide returned to a 25 per cent capacity limit. The 9pm-5am curfew in metropolitan Melbourne was not enacted in regional Victoria. This action followed 61 new state cases of COVID-19 on 19 August, one in Shepparton. By the afternoon of 20 August rapid PCR testing brought the cluster in Shepparton at least 21 cases. 48 of the new locally acquired cases from 19 August were linked to known outbreaks, 22 were in isolation during their infectious period. 11 separate "mystery cases" were in suburbs including Airport West, Frankston, Keysborough, Docklands and Yarraville. After there were 27 cases in 2 days at a childcare centre in Broadmeadows, among others, childcare centres were restricted to essential workers. \c\cThe same day there was another anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne city, which became violent. Up to 4,000 people marched and over 200 were arrested, 3 for assaulting police. Police responded with pepper spray when protesters threw objects at them. 7 police officers were injured, 6 of those hospitalised. 236 fines were issued. Those arrested can each be fined AU$5,452. Smaller protests were also held in Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Perth, and in Sydney where over 45 people were arrested. \c\cOn 29 August, following a year high 92 new cases detected in the community in a single day, the Victorian Government announced that the statewide lockdown was to be extended. \c\cOn 31 August the deaths of 2 women with COVID-19 were reported in Victoria. The women both died at their homes, one was aged in her 40s from Darebin, the other was in her 60s from Hume. They were the first COVID deaths reported in Victoria since 30 November 2020, 9 months. The same day there were 76 new locally acquired cases, 45 linked to existing outbreaks and 36 in isolation while they were infectious. \c\cOn 1 September, following new cases reaching triple digits (120 cases) in a single day for the first time since 2 September 2020, the lockdown was extended again with a target end date of 23 September. An additional target was getting 70% of the eligible population of Victoria receiving their first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines by that date. \c\cOn 3 September, another overnight death from COVID-19 death was reported, a man in his 60s, bringing state deaths to 823. There were also 208 new cases of COVID-19. There were 1,176 active cases coming from 48,572 test results on 2 September.

There were also 445 new COVID cases. By the same day:\c\cOver 65% of the over 16-year-old population had received one dose of vaccine\c\cOver 40% were fully vaccinated. \c\cOn 15 September, another 2 deaths were reported, bringing state deaths to 828, as well as 443 new cases. There were 4,083 active cases, 173 were hospitalised, 44 in intensive care and 23 on ventilators. \c\cAlso on 15 September, at 11:59pm Ballarat went back into lockdown, it's eighth, for at least 7 days. This followed the town having 4 recent COVID cases as well as "widespread" wastewater detection. The Ballarat International Foto Biennale photographic exhibition, already delayed from 28 August by the regional lockdown, had been rescheduled to open on the 15th. \c\cOn 19 September, at 11:59pm Greater Geelong, Surf Coast Shire and Mitchell Shire went back into lockdown, their eighth, for at least 7 days. This followed both Greater Geelong and Mitchell reporting cases and Surf Coast showing positive waste water detections with no confirmed source.[citation needed] Greater Geelong and the Surf Coast exited lockdown by 27 September as scheduled, but the Mitchell Shire lockdown was extended with no set end date. \c\cBy 22 September, Victoria had another 3 deaths in 24 hours bringing the state COVID-19 death toll to 836, and 628 new cases, exceeding the previous record of 625 daily new cases set in 2020. The lockdown of Ballarat ended at midnight this day. \c\cBy 23 September there were another 4 deaths, taking the outbreak total to 20, and total state deaths to 240 since March 2020. With 766 new daily cases, another record high was set. Active cases were at 6,666. \c\cThe dead were:\c\c3 men: 1 in his 70s and 1 his 80s both from Hume, and 1 in his 80s from Moreland\c\c1 woman in her 90s from Hume\c\c257 were hospitalised with COVID-19.

As of this date, the city is expected to be locked down until "late October". \c\cOn 26 September at 11:59pm, the 7 day Geelong and Surf Coast lockdowns ended as scheduled, but Mitchell Shire's lockdown was extended with no end date set. \c\cOn 28 September, the Latrobe Valley went into lockdown for 7 days. Restrictions will be the same as Melbourne, but there will be no curfew. \c\cOn 20 September, there was a violent protest by hundreds of people against mandatory vaccination for construction workers outside the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) headquarters. In order to be allowed to work, tradespeople were required to have had at least one dose of vaccine by  23 September (Thursday). The union building was damaged and riot police employed pepper spray and rubber bullets. As a consequence, combined with an increase in transmission of COVID-19 in the industry, from 11.59pm that night all building and construction industry worksites in Ballarat, Geelong, Metropolitan Melbourne, Mitchell Shire and the Surf Coast were shut down for two weeks. By 5 October, 7 COVID cases were linked to this protest. \c\cOn 21 September in Melbourne, there was another large protest against a wide range of pandemic response related issues, including the previous days\' construction industry shut down. The "Victorian Workers Rally For Freedom" march started near to the CFMEU headquarters at 10pm, went through the CBD, past state Parliament, Flinders Street railway station, then onto and blocking the West Gate Freeway. At least one  media reporter was assaulted and objects thrown at police. Riot police again used tear gas and rubber bullets. The construction shutdown could cost the industry nearly AU$500 million per day. There were 62 arrests related to the protest. \c\cOn 22 September in Melbourne city there was yet another protest with up to 1,000 people converging on the Shrine of Remembrance. After a stand-off for a few hours with police surrounding them, protesters dispersed at about 5pm. Two police officers were injured by thrown bottles and more than 200 people were arrested. An estimated 300 fines were issued for not complying with stay-at-home directives. The Shrine was left strewn with left behind garbage and its walls had been urinated on. At least one protester there was hospitalised by the next day with COVID-19. \c\cOn 23 September a strong police presence was seen in Melbourne at State Parliament, CFMEU offices, and the Shrine. 92 arrests were made as police checked that people were lawfully in the CBD in compliance with the current Chief Health Officers\' directives. Some arrests were for outstanding warrants. \c\cThe protests, with verbal and physical abuse of their staff in public places on their way to work resulted in the closure, for at least four days, of a vaccination centre at Melbourne Town Hall, and also a drop-in clinic for the homeless near Queen Victoria Market. \c\cOn 24 and 25 September, there was again a strong presence of police in Melbourne to stop protesters gathering. More than 200 were arrested across the city on the 24th as police acted to prevent people assembling, and more than 90 arrests on the 25th in Melbourne and St Kilda. \c\cOn 2 October there was another street protest against mandatory vaccination requirements for authorised workers. \c\cOn 5 October Victoria reported 4 deaths.

On 13 October 2021, a man shot multiple people with a bow and arrow in Kongsberg, Norway, a town about 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of the capital city Oslo. Several people have been injured and killed, and a suspected perpetrator has been taken into custody. The attacker reportedly moved through the town and targeted people at several locations before being arrested.
On 13 October 2021, a man shot eight people with a bow and arrow at locations in Kongsberg, Viken, Norway, a town about 70 kilometres (43 mi) southwest of the capital city Oslo. Five people were killed, and three others were injured. The suspect, identified as 37-year-old Espen Andersen Bråthen, a Danish citizen born in Norway, was subsequently taken into custody. \c\cPolice were first notified of a person walking around Kongsberg with a bow and arrows in a quiver on his shoulder at 18:12 CEST. Upon receiving the first calls, a patrol was quickly sent to the location of the attack, followed by three others. Armed officers first confronted the perpetrator six minutes after the first calls, but he fired several arrows at them and escaped. Afterwards, he launched the attack and killed his victims, according to the police chief. \c\cThe perpetrator is said to have first started firing inside a Coop Extra supermarket in Kongsberg and then moved over a large area. Pictures have been published of arrows lodged in walls at the scene. As the attack continued, police cordoned off several parts of Kongsberg. An arrest was eventually made at 18:47. A warning shot was fired at the time of the arrest, according to the police chief. \c\cBy the time of the suspect's arrest, the attack had spurred a large emergency response including 22 heavily-armed police patrols, more than ten ambulances, and two helicopters. The attack was the deadliest in Norway since the 2011 attacks committed by Anders Behring Breivik. \c\cFive people were killed in the attack, and three others were injured. The five killed were four women and one man, aged 50 to 70 years. The three survivors did not sustain life-threatening injuries; one of them was an off-duty police officer. The investigation indicated that the victims were all attacked in different locations. \c\cThe suspect was taken to a police station in Drammen, where his defence lawyer said he was questioned for more than three hours, was co-operating with authorities, and has confessed to the attack. The Norwegian Police Security Service launched a terrorism investigation. \c\cThe suspect is 37-year-old Espen Andersen Bråthen, who authorities believe acted alone. He was born in Norway to a Norwegian father and a Danish mother and had lived his entire life in the country. Bråthen was living in Kongsberg at the time of the attack. He has several prior criminal convictions for break-ins, cannabis possession, and threats against family members. \c\cBråthen was known to the police and had converted to Islam around 2016. Police had last been in contact with him in 2020, and they had been concerned about his possible extremist views. However, he did not appear on their radar in 2021. The chairman for the board of a Kongsberg mosque recalled Bråthen visiting the mosque three times years ago; according to him, Bråthen was tense and did not pray or know a lot about Islam. He considered contacting the police but did not have anything to go on. \c\cNorwegian police constables, who are usually unarmed, were ordered to temporarily carry firearms nationwide after the attack. However, there was no change to the national threat level in the country. Questions were raised about the inability by police to stop the attack during their first confrontation with the perpetrator; officers in Norway are trained to immediately respond to an ongoing incident without waiting for other units. On the day after the attack, flags were flown at half-mast on all public buildings and candles were lit on the steps of Kongsberg Church."}
On 15 October 2021, a suicide bombing occurred at the Imam Bargah mosque, a Shia mosque during Friday prayers in Kandahar, Afghanistan, killing at least 65 people and wounding more than 70 others. The Islamic State – Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the attack according to a statement released by the group's media wing, Amaq. It came a week after a bombing claimed by the Islamic State – Khorasan Province at a Shia mosque in Kunduz killed at least 50 people. Following the attack, the Taliban promised to provide security at Shia mosques."}
Sir David Amess, the British Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Southend West, was stabbed to death on 15 October 2021. The attack occurred at a constituency meeting in Leigh-on-Sea. A 25-year-old man was arrested. \c\cSir David Amess was a long-serving politician who entered Parliament in 1983 as the MP for Basildon. He held no senior positions but was an "instantly recognizable" member of the Conservative Party and had been knighted for his commitment to public service. He is said to have been socially conservative and held relatively centrist views, notably opposing abortion and campaigning in favour of Brexit; for stronger animal welfare protections; and to award Southend-on-Sea city status. \c\cFollowing the murder of Jo Cox whilst on her way to meet constituents at a constituency surgery in 2016, Amess said in his 2020 autobiography that fears of similar attacks "rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians" and that he had faced harassment and insecurity at his home. MPs are protected by armed police when inside Parliament, with security being tightened after the 2017 Westminster attack. However, they are generally not given police protection during surgeries and they are normally accompanied by one member of staff only. After Cox's murder, parliamentary spending on MPs\' personal security rose from under £200,000 to £4.5 million in two years. \c\cOn 15 October 2021, Amess was at a constituency surgery at Belfairs Methodist Church on Eastwood Road North, Leigh-on-Sea, where he was scheduled to meet with constituents from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. BST. He first met with constituents on the steps of the Church, and entered the building at around 12:05 p.m., to speak with people who had arrived earlier. Inside the Church, his attacker emerged from the group of people waiting to speak with Amess, and stabbed him multiple times. Police were alerted to the attack shortly after it occurred, and armed police, as well as medical and police helicopters, attended. The suspect was arrested inside the Church before being taken away; once the suspect was removed from the scene, a police cordon was set up. An air ambulance landed on a nearby playing field at 2:13 p.m. to take Amess to hospital; the medical team already in attendance decided that his condition was not stable enough to transport Amess and continued to work at the scene instead. He died just before 3:00 p.m., at the age of 69. \c\cThe motivations of the attacker are unknown. Counter-terrorist police officers are involved in the early stages of the investigation. Essex Police said a "25-year-old man was quickly arrested after officers arrived at the scene on suspicion of murder and a knife was recovered". At around 6:32 p.m. on 15 October, Essex Police announced that the investigation had been handed over to counter-terrorist officers. Later in the day, the BBC reported that a government source said the suspect is a British national who may have Somali heritage. \c\cAt about 00:30 a.m. on 16 October, the police declared the stabbing a terrorist incident. \c\cPrime Minister Boris Johnson returned to Westminster in the wake of the attack, where flags were lowered to half-mast. Various parliamentary groups and current and former politicians from across the political spectrum expressed shock and offered condolences, as did relatives of Jo Cox. A vigil for Amess was held in his Southend West constituency at 6:00 p.m. on the day he died. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, announced that the security of MPs will be reviewed. Conservative MP and Chairman Oliver Dowden announced that, in light of Amess's death, campaigning activities on behalf of the Conservative Party would be suspended nationwide until further notice. Stéphane Dujarric,  spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, said that politicians should be able to undertake their duties without fear of attack. \c\cBBC One changed its evening schedule out of respect, replacing topical news satire show Have I Got News for You with a rerun of panel show Would I Lie to You?; crime scene comedy The Cleaner with a rerun of sitcom Miranda; and slasher film Halloween with romance  The Light Between Oceans.
A series of protests by the Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government began on 20 September 2021, triggered by the government's decision to ban Serbian license plates, and ended on 2 October 2021. The protests had mostly consisted of blocking traffic near border crossings. The ban meant that people who owned vehicles with Serbian license plates in Kosovo would have had to switch for Kosovar license plates at a government vehicle registration center. The ban intended to mirror the former ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia. The Republic of Serbia does not recognise the Republic of Kosovo and considers the Kosovo–Serbia border only temporary. The protests have led the relations between Serbia and Kosovo, which had been improving, to worsen. The Serbian Armed Forces are on heightened combat readiness as a result. Both sides have accused each other of great overreach. International powers have called for de–escalation, with Russia criticising Kosovo. On 30 September 2021, an agreement was reached to end the ban starting 4 October 2021, according to which the protests also ended on 2 October 2021. Kosovar license plates in Serbia and Serbian license plates in Kosovo now have their national symbols and country codes covered with a sticker. \c\cNorth Kosovo is majority Serb and has been a region largely opposed to an independent Kosovo, with frequent protests since Kosovo declared independence. It has not recognised the Government of Kosovo and has acted independently of it until the 2013 Brussels Agreement. According to the Brussels Agreement, by 2016 the Community of Serb Municipalities was to be formed. The Community would be a self–governing association of municipalities with a Serbian majority in Kosovo. As of 2021, it has not yet formed, because of the Government of Kosovo freezing the Brussels Agreement and its Constitutional Court declaring some parts of the agreement to be unconstitutional. \c\cUp until 2011, Serbia issued Serbian license plates for towns in North Kosovo. In 2011, Serbia agreed to stop issuing these license plates and that they should be changed for Republic of Kosovo (RKS) or the neutral Kosovo (KS) license plates. The KS license plates do not bear any state symbols. Serbia has allowed the KS license plates on its territory, but not the RKS license plates. The agreement lasted 5 years until 2016, when it was expected a better solution would be found. The same terms were renewed on 14 September 2016 and were valid until 14 September 2021. After 14 September 2021 the conditions remained the same, but a ban on Serbian license plates was issued in Kosovo on 20 September 2021. The KS license plates were also declared invalid by the Government of Kosovo which were used by some vehicles in Kosovo, including by owners who often had to travel across the Kosovo–Serbia border. \c\cThe motive of the Kosovan government in the ban had been to mirror the former, similar policy of the Serbian Government by which Republic of Kosovo(RKS) license plates had been banned since Kosovo declared independence, and vehicles with RKS license plates in Serbia had to switch them for temporary Serbian plates. Vehicles with Serbian license plates in Kosovo were supposed to, up to the 30 September 2021 Agreement in Brussels, have their Serbian license plates taken off and switched for Kosovar license plates at a government vehicle registration center. Drivers who had visited the country with Serbian license plates had to get temporary plates. The temporary plates costed a 5 euro (2021 value) tax and were valid for 60 days. The ban would have reportedly impacted around 9,500 vehicles with Serbian license plates in North Kosovo which were to have to wear permanent Kosovar license plates. This was originally supposed to be done after the 2011 agreement, but no attempts were made to enforce it. \c\cThe protests organised by the Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government began on 20 September 2021. On the same day, over 20 vehicles of the Kosovo Police, of which over 10 were armoured, came to the site of the protests. Hundreds of local ethnic Serbs had been protesting daily. They were blocking the roads leading to the two border crossings with Serbia in North Kosovo, near Jarinje and Brnjak, with vehicles and barricades reinforced by gravel. On 23 September 2021 the traffic block consisting of vehicles became 3 kilometres long on the Mitrovica–Raška road in Jarinje. Protesters were sleeping next to the protest sites in improvised tents. Representatives of the Serb List also attended the protests. \c\cThe protests had been mostly calm. However, on 25 September 2021, two government vehicle registration centers in Zvečan and Zubin Potok were attacked by arson, and allegedly with hand grenades that failed to explode. On 23 September 2021, the Kosovo Police was accused of injuring three people unrelated to the protests, two seriously, who are now in hospital. Kosovo has denied involvement and says that it's "disinformation". \c\cAccording to the agreement between Kosovo and Serbia mediated by the European Union (EU) Representative for the Balkan–Pristina Dialogue Miroslav Lajčák in Brussels, reached on 30 September 2021, the Kosovar special police withdrew by 16:00 local time on 2 October 2021. Along with this, the barricades set up by the protesters were removed by local Serbs and the traffic blocks ended, leading to border traffic resuming. KFOR troops replaced the police units and will be present for the next two weeks. \c\cThe decision to ban Serbian license plates and the ongoing protests prompted Serbian authorities to raise the combat readiness of the Serbian Armed Forces on the border with Kosovo. The army started transporting military equipment to the border area, including its fighter jets and helicopters, and tanks, on 26 September 2021. The President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić has described Kosovo's license plate ban as a "criminal action". He made the withdrawal of Kosovar special police ROSU a condition for starting EU-mediated negotiations to resolve the dispute. \c\cThe Prime Minister of Kosovo Albin Kurti has accused Serbia of "inciting and supporting" the attacks on government buildings. He also accused Serbia of "exploiting Kosovo citizens to provoke a serious international conflict." The attacks were described by the Interior Ministry of Kosovo as "having terrorist elements". The mayors of majority Serbian municipalities on 27 September also requested a withdrawal of the units and more KFOR prsence, citing the incident on 23 September 2021 when 3 Serbs were injured as a concern. The special police units withdrew as part of the 30 September 2021 Agreement in Brussels on 2 October 2021. \c\cOn 30 September 2021, an agreement was reached in Brussels that effectively ended the ban on Serbian license plates, starting 08:00 local time, 4 October 2021. The agreement also effectively ended the ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia. The agreement is intended as a temporary solution. The solution is to cover the national symbols of Kosovo on Kosovar RKS license plates in Serbia, as well as to cover the national symbols of Serbia on Serbian license plates in Kosovo and their country codes RKS and SRB with a sticker. A working group was formed and met on 21 October 2021 in Brussels for the first time, to try and find a permanent solution in accordance with EU standards. Miroslav Lajčák said that "he trusts they will present concrete findings in 6 months", when negotiators and delegations will present their proposals for the permanent solution. \c\cOn 26 September 2021, Russian diplomats together with the Serbian Defense Minister Nebojša Stefanović visited an inspection of Serbian forces in the military base of Rudnica. Rudnica is a few kilometres away from the Kosovo–Serbia border. Russia will deploy air defense forces to Serbia for joint military exercises which will be held in October. On 27 September 2021, the NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, the Kosovo Force, stepped up the amount and duration of its patrols. The increase is most notable near the border crossings, moving armored vehicles close to protesters\' border blocks. 
On 15 October 2021, Sir David Amess, a British Conservative Party politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for Southend West, died after being stabbed multiple times during a political surgery at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Ali Harbi Ali, a 25-year-old male British citizen, was arrested at the scene and was later charged with murder and the preparation of terrorist acts. \c\cAmess was a long-serving politician who entered Parliament in 1983 as MP for Basildon. He had held no senior positions but was described by Nick Paton Walsh as an "instantly recognisable" member of the Conservative Party and had been knighted for his political and public service. He was a devout Catholic and a socially conservative politician who opposed abortion, supported capital punishment, and campaigned in favour of Brexit. He was a supporter of animal welfare and was one of the few Conservative MPs to support a ban on fox hunting. He also supported a campaign to award city status to Southend-on-Sea, Essex. \c\cFollowing the murder of MP Jo Cox on her way to a constituency surgery in 2016, Amess wrote in his 2020 autobiography that fears of similar attacks "rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians" and that he had faced harassment and insecurity at his home. MPs are protected by armed police when inside Parliament, with security tightened after the 2017 Westminster attack. They are generally not given police protection during surgeries, and they are normally accompanied by one member of staff only. After Cox's murder, parliamentary spending on MPs\' personal security rose from under £200,000 to £4.5 million in two years. \c\cOn 15 October 2021, Amess was at a one-to-one constituency meeting at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall on Eastwood Road North in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, where he was scheduled to meet with constituents from 10 am to 1 pm. He first met with constituents on the steps of the church and entered the hall at around 12:05 pm to speak with people who had arrived earlier. While inside the church hall, a man armed with a knife emerged from the group of constituents and stabbed him multiple times. \c\cArmed units and medical and police helicopters arrived at the scene within minutes. The suspect waited inside the church hall, where he was arrested and a police cordon was set up. An air ambulance landed on Belfairs Sports Ground at 2:13 pm to take Amess to hospital, but the medical team decided that his condition was not stable enough to transport him and so continued to work on him at the scene. He was declared dead just before 3 pm. \c\cCounter-terrorist police officers were involved in the early stages of the investigation. Essex Police said that a "25-year-old man was quickly arrested after officers arrived at the scene on suspicion of murder and a knife was recovered". At approximately 6:32 pm on 15 October 2021, Essex Police announced that the investigation had been handed over to the Counter Terrorism Command of London's Metropolitan Police Service. \c\cOn the evening of 16 October, the Metropolitan Police Service confirmed the suspect had been detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000, and that magistrates had extended the period the suspect could be held in custody for questioning until 22 October 2021. Just after midnight, police identified the stabbing as a terrorist incident potentially motivated by Islamic extremism. Police searched three addresses in London over the weekend following the stabbing. \c\cAmess's close links to Qatar, which backs Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, have been examined by police. \c\cAli was born in 1996 in Southwark, Central London, to Somali immigrant parents. In 2014, as a teenager, Ali was referred to the Prevent programme, Britain's voluntary programme for those thought at risk of radicalisation, from which he was referred on to the Channel Programme. He is believed to not have spent long in the programme, and he was not a "subject of interest" to MI5. He lived in Kentish Town. North London. \c\cOn 21 October 2021, Ali Harbi Ali, a British-born national of Somali heritage was charged with the murder of Amess and the preparation of terrorist acts. On 22 October, he appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from Belmarsh, during which he was remanded in custody. \c\cAfter the attack, the prime minister Boris Johnson returned from a holiday, to Westminster, where flags were lowered to half-mast. Various parliamentary groups, and current and former politicians from across the political spectrum, expressed shock and offered condolences, as did members of the royal family, international politicians, and relatives of Jo Cox. A vigil for Amess was held in his Southend West constituency at 6 pm on the day of his death, with another being held the next day. \c\cThe Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, announced that the security of MPs will be reviewed. The safety of MPs during open, public constituency surgeries was debated by politicians. Calls to enact a law to crack down on online targeting of MPs and end anonymity were made. The Conservatives suspended political campaigning. \c\cA Catholic priest reported he was not allowed to enter the crime scene to administer the last rites for Amess. Following Amess's killing, British Catholic policymakers issued statements affirming Amess's commitment to his faith and lauding his achievements. Labour MP Mike Kane also sought to add an "Amess amendment" to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that would ensure Catholic priests access to crime scenes in order to administer the last rites. \c\cOn 16 October, Boris Johnson and the Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer, accompanied by Sir Lindsay Hoyle and the home secretary Priti Patel, laid wreaths at the church hall where Amess was killed. On 18 October, a minute's silence was held in the House of Commons before MPs paid tribute to Amess. That evening, a service of remembrance for Amess was held by MPs at St Margaret's Church, Westminster. The service, which included an address by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, was streamed live by the ITV News YouTube channel. MPs paid tribute in a book of condolence that was placed in the House of Commons Library, as well as in Westminster Hall and Portcullis House. Tributes were also laid at Belfairs Methodist Church Hall, where Amess was killed. \c\cIn the days following Amess's death, a number of MPs, including Conservative Chris Skidmore and Labour's Charlotte Nichols, voiced their support for a campaign to give Southend-on-Sea city status as a way of honouring Amess's memory; he had frequently spoken on the topic in Parliament. During tributes to Amess on 18 October, the Prime Minister announced that the Queen had agreed to Southend being given city status. \c\cAs a result of Amess's death, a by-election was triggered to fill his former seat. Major and minor parties announced they would not stand a candidate to oppose the Conservatives, as a sign of respect, following the precedent set in the 2016 Batley and Spen by-election.
On 19 December 2016, a truck was deliberately driven into the Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at Breitscheidplatz in Berlin, leaving 12 people dead and 56 others injured. One of the victims was the truck's original driver, Łukasz Urban, who was found shot dead in the passenger seat. The truck was eventually stopped by its automatic brakes. The perpetrator was Anis Amri, an unsuccessful asylum seeker from Tunisia. Four days after the attack, he was killed in a shootout with police near Milan in Italy. An initial suspect was arrested and later released due to lack of evidence. Nearly five years after the attack, a man who was critically injured in the attack died from complications related to his wounds, becomong the 13th victim. \c\cThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant gave Anis Amri instructions. ISIL released a video of Amri pledging allegiance to the terror group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. \c\cThe Berlin attack took place during a time of heightened Islamist terrorist activity in Europe. Several terrorist attacks in 2016, in Germany and in neighboring countries, have been linked to ISIS; some of them were similar to the truck attack on the Christmas market in Berlin (e.g. the 2014 Nantes attack and the 2016 Nice truck attack). \c\cIn March, 32 people were killed by three coordinated suicide bombings in the Belgian capital Brussels. On 14 July, a Tunisian man deliberately drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day in the French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Four days later, an Afghan asylum seeker stabbed five people on a train near Würzburg, Germany. On 24 July, a Syrian refugee blew himself up outside a music festival in the German city of Ansbach, wounding fifteen people. Two days later Islamists attacked Christians attending a church service in Normandy, killing an elderly priest. On 26 November a 12-year-old Iraqi-German boy planted a nail bomb at a Christmas market in Ludwigshafen, but it failed to detonate. \c\cOn 21 November, the United States Department of State warned that Americans "should exercise caution at holiday festivals, events, and outdoor markets" throughout Europe. This was in view of the threat from ISIL, Al-Qaeda and affiliated groups, including self-radicalized extremists. Going back to at least 2000, a Frankfurt-based Al-Qaeda plot to bomb the Strasbourg Christmas market was foiled by law enforcement. \c\cThe vehicle involved, a black Scania R 450 semi-trailer truck, bore Polish number plates and belongs to a Polish delivery company, Usługi Transportowe (Transport Services) Ariel Żurawski, based in Sobiemyśl. The truck was on its return leg to Poland, having started its trip in Turin, Italy, and was transporting steel beams to a Berlin warehouse owned by ThyssenKrupp. \c\cThe head of the delivery company, Ariel Żurawski, reported that his cousin Łukasz Robert Urban had been driving the truck to Berlin, but that he could not imagine him being responsible for the attack. Żurawski's company last contacted Urban between 15:00 and 16:00, when Urban reported that he had arrived a day early to the Berlin warehouse and that he had to wait there overnight to unload his truck the following morning. The last photo of Urban still alive was taken at a kebab shop near the ThyssenKrupp warehouse at about 14:00. \c\cThe family had been unable to contact Urban since 16:00. Żurawski suspected that the truck had been hijacked based on its GPS coordinates, as well as indications that the truck was being driven erratically. Żurawski later identified the victim found in the truck as his cousin Urban, the original driver of the semi-trailer. It is believed that Urban was killed by the perpetrator of the attack. According to a post-mortem examination cited by the German media, Urban was shot in the head between 16:30 and 17:30. \c\cOn 19 December 2016, at 20:02 local time, the perpetrator drove the stolen truck through a Christmas market at Breitscheidplatz in the City West of Berlin, killing 11 people and injuring 56. The incident is the deadliest terrorist attack in Germany since an attack at Oktoberfest in Munich in 1980, which killed 13 people and injured 211 others. The truck came from the direction of Hardenbergstraße, drove about 50 metres (160 ft) through the market, and destroyed several stalls before turning back onto Budapester Straße and coming to a stop level with the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. \c\cSeveral witnesses saw the driver leave the truck and flee towards Tiergarten. One witness ran after him. \c\cŁukasz Urban was found dead in the passenger seat of the truck cab; he had been stabbed and shot once in the head with a small-caliber firearm. Investigators initially believed that Urban might still have been alive when the truck reached Breitscheidplatz and might have been stabbed because he tried to stop the attack. Early media reports indicated that he grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the truck to veer left and crash to a stop, and was then shot at the scene of the crash. If this had been true, this act might have saved many lives. However, later media reports have indicated that the truck was brought to a stop by its automatic braking system and Urban was stabbed and shot hours before the attack. No weapons were found at the scene. \c\cThe Christmas market reopened on 22 December. Damaged stalls were removed and memorials were set up in their stead. Concrete barriers were placed along sides facing streets. \c\cThe police and public prosecutor investigated the incident as a terrorist attack. The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, said, "We must assume this was a terrorist attack." The German Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Maizière, described the incident as a brutal attack. The U.S. Department of State had previously warned of terrorist attacks on Christmas markets in Europe after ISIL took control of Raqqa and Mosul. ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack shortly after the release of a Pakistani suspect who was mistakenly detained. \c\cOn the evening of 19 December, police arrested a suspect, believed to have driven the truck during the attack, near the Berlin Victory Column. He had aroused suspicion by running away from the scene of the attack out of fear that he would be considered a suspect. The arrested man, initially identified only as Naved B. (later said to be Naved Baloch by the British newspaper The Guardian), denied involvement and was later identified as a 23-year-old asylum seeker from Turbat, Pakistan. The Berlin SEK police tactical unit stormed the hangar at the former Berlin Tempelhof Airport, which is used as a refugee camp, where the arrested man lived with six others in a room. His mobile phone was seized and analyzed. Police sources later suggested that they might have arrested "the wrong man" because the individual in custody did not carry gunshot residue or any marks that would indicate that he had been in a fight. Furthermore, forensic tests did not indicate that the suspect was inside the cab of the truck. Police therefore believed that the attacker might still be at large. \c\cGerman Public Prosecutor General Peter Frank said, "We have to get used to the idea that the man apprehended may not be the perpetrator or belong to the group of perpetrators." The man was released on the evening of 20 December due to lack of evidence. \c\cIn an interview with The Guardian on 29 December, he narrated the incident of his arrest on 19 December. According to him, after leaving a friend's house and crossing a road in central Berlin on the evening, a car started following him after which he walked faster. When he realised that it was a police car, he stopped when they asked him to and showed his identification documents to them. He was allowed to go, but was called back seconds later and arrested. He claimed that he was tied up, blindfolded and also slapped by the police after refusing to undress for photographs. He said in the interview that he had gone into hiding, fearing for his life. The Guardian also said he had applied for asylum in Germany as a member of a secular separatist movement in Balochistan province of Pakistan. \c\cOn 21 December, police announced that investigators had found, under the truck's driver's seat, a suspension of deportation permit belonging to Anis Amri, a man who was born in Tataouine, Tunisia, on 22 December 1992. Authorities began a Europe-wide search for Amri. According to investigators, Amri entered Germany from Italy in 2015 and had contacts with the network of the recently arrested Salafist preacher Abu Walaa, a known ISIL recruiter in Germany. Amri was sought by the Federal Criminal Police Office. Officials called for a public manhunt, issuing a recent picture, and offering a reward of €100,000, warning that Amri might be armed and dangerous. He was described as being 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall, weighing approximately 75 kilograms (165 lb), with dark hair and brown eyes. \c\cAmri fled from Tunisia to escape imprisonment for stealing a truck and arrived for the first time in Europe in 2011 on a refugee raft at the island of Lampedusa. He lied about his age, pretending to be a minor, and was sent to the temporary migrants reception center on the island. At the center, according to Italian security officials, Amri "took part in a particularly violent riot, when the center was set on fire and several people were injured" and was sentenced for it and robbery to four years in prison, which he served in two jails in Sicily. Amri was released in 2015; according to Italian officials, the Tunisian authorities refused to accept his repatriation to Tunisia, and it is believed that he went to Germany around this time. Per an autopsy on his body, it was found that he frequently consumed drugs. \c\cIn Tunisia, Amri was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison, "reportedly for aggravated theft with violence". Prior to that he had been arrested several times for possession and use of drugs. According to his family, he drank alcohol, took drugs and was initially not religious, but had been radicalized in Italian jails. The man arrived in Germany in July 2015 and applied for asylum in April 2016. He used at least 14 different aliases and posed as a citizen of Syria, Egypt or Lebanon. He reportedly had tried to recruit participants for a terrorist attack since the spring, and once tried to buy a pistol from an undercover police officer. He had been overheard by the German intelligence offering to carry out a suicide attack, but the German authorities had decided not to arrest him because they deemed him a mere errand boy. The German CID warned in March 2016 that he was planning a suicide attack and recommended immediate deportation. However, the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia ruled he could not be deported. In Germany he was involved in a bar brawl and drug dealing; later he was involved in a knife attack over drugs in July 2016 and disappeared after police tried to question him. Three weeks before the attack, Moroccan intelligence warned Germany about the terrorist attack planned by him. He had started spending more time in Berlin before the attack and was being closely monitored, however showed no signs of planning a terrorist attack per a report submitted by the German Interior Minister to the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia. German authorities were seeking to deport him at the time of the attack, however the legal requirements hadn\'t been met because Tunisia initially denied that Amri was their citizen but documents confirming it arrived in Germany after the attack. \c\cA few minutes after the attack, a surveillance camera spotted him at Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station which is close to the Christmas market. At the station, he turned to the camera and raised a finger, a gesture commonly used by Islamists. He later left Germany, travelling to Netherlands, Belgium and France before reaching Italy. On 23 December at around 03:00 CET, Amri was killed in a shootout with police in front of the railway station in Sesto San Giovanni near Milan. He had just arrived by train from Chambéry, France (via Turin). During a routine patrol, two police officers asked to search his backpack after he said he did not have any identity documents. Amri pulled out a gun and shot one of the officers in the shoulder; the other officer shot Amri dead. The Italian Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, stated that a policeman had been hospitalized with a shoulder injury. On the same day, Amaq released a video of Amri pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIL. German officials have confirmed that Amri's fingerprints matched those in the inside of the truck. \c\cOn 28 December, German prosecutors said they had detained a 40-year-old Tunisian man, who they thought may have been involved in the attack. Amri had saved the number of this man in his phone. Prosecutors stated on the next day that he was released after investigations revealed that he was not a suspected contact of Amri. They also confirmed that the attacker had sent a mobile phone voice message and a picture to a contact shortly before carrying out the attack. The German police raided the homes of two suspected associates on 3 January 2017, including a 26-year-old Tunisian man they suspected of being in contact with Amri and knowing about the attack as well as a former flatmate of Amri. The Tunisian suspect who was suspected of either planning the attack or knowing about it was detained with federal prosecutors stating that he had known Amri since the end of 2015, had met him a day before the attack and both had "very intense conversations". Amri's former flatmate was also being investigated and the attacker had tried to contact him twice on 19 December. \c\cItalian police confirmed on 4 January that the gun used in the attack, a .22-caliber Erma Model EP552S pistol (Walther PPK clone), matched the one found on Amri. ZDF reported on 6 January that he might have acquired the gun in Switzerland and lived there for a prolonged period of time whose length investigators were trying to determine. Swiss prosecutors meanwhile opened a case related to the attack. The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland later confirmed that he had spent some time in the country while the German police were investigating whether the gun was acquired by him there. Investigators stated on 18 January that the gun was imported legally into Switzerland in 1990s, but it remained unclear what happened to it afterwards as it didn\'t appear in the weapons registers of cantons of Switzerland and there was no national weapons register at the time. \c\cOn 24 December, Tunisian authorities arrested three men suspected of terrorist links including Amri's nephew. They stated that Amri had urged his nephew to join ISIL and had sent him money to travel to Europe. Tunisian Interior Ministry stated that he had also told him that he was the emir or leader of a German jihadist group called "Abu al-Walaa brigade". Another person was announced to have been arrested on 7 January in Tunisia in relation to the case. However all four were released on the next day as they weren\'t found to have links to the attack or any terrorist group. \c\cItaly's Interior Ministry announced on 12 March that it had deported a 37-year-old Tunisian man whose telephone number was in Amri's contact list. The ministry stated that he had been in contact with the attacker and his number was also linked to a Facebook profile supporting jihadist ideology where he connected with supporters of ISIL. It added that he was living in Latina where he associated with fellow extremists who opposed a moderate imam at a local mosque. In late-March, Turkey arrested more than 6 men allegedly linked to Amri. \c\cSix individuals including some friends of Amri's were arrested on 8 April 2018 for planning a knife attack on a sports event in Berlin. The main suspect was under police surveillance. They were all released after no evidence was found that they were planning a terror attack. \c\cOn 17 May 2017 the Interior Ministry of Berlin stated that already in November 2016 intelligence was given that Anis Amri was involved in criminal offenses concerning drug trafficking. On this basis authorities would have been able to apprehend Amri already at the time, however they did not. An investigation was launched trying to find out to what extent this information was withheld by the State Criminal Police Office of Berlin after the attack happened. Several days later, while the investigation for obstruction of justice was still going on, a speaker of the Interior Ministry said that manipulations of the file of Amri have been carried out by officers of the criminal investigation department after the attack. On 22 May 2017 a commission of inquiry was initiated starting in July. Meanwhile, a special prosecutor was appointed to the case. In addition to the ongoing investigation concerning manipulations of the file and withholding of information, national TV reported on 1 June, that officers who were ordered by an investigating judge in Berlin to observe Amri until October 2016 for criminal offenses and possible terrorist links did not do so and instead included untrue records regarding observing actions in his file. \c\cMany world leaders offered condolences to Germany and the victims of the attack. \c\cNational and international right-wing politicians and commentators blamed the attack partly on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her policy of accepting an unlimited number of asylum seekers and migrants. Euroskeptic politicians also condemned the lack of border checks under the Schengen system for allowing the perpetrator to travel freely through several countries after the attack. By contrast, several other national and international political commentators praised what they described as the cool-headed reaction of the Merkel administration. The editorial board of The New York Times wrote that it was "dangerous" to blame German refugee policy without waiting for facts about the identity of the attacker to emerge. \c\cA petition to award Urban the Bundesverdienstkreuz had gathered over 2,500 signatures by the afternoon of 22 December. A donation page to support his family was set up on GoFundMe and collected more than £110,000 by 23 December by British truck driver Dave Duncan. He was officially thanked by Polish Ambassador to the United Kingdom Arkady Rzegocki at a ceremony at Embassy of Poland, London on 9 January 2017. Polish authorities provided funds for the delivery of Urban to his family as well as the costs of the funeral and the family of Urban received a state pension. German authorities refused to reimburse the value of the destroyed truck which belonged to a company run by Urban's cousin. \c\cMuslims and Christians in Berlin held a vigil in solidarity with the victims of the attack. The funeral of Urban was held on 30 December at the Polish village of Banie and was attended by hundreds of people including President of Poland Andrzej Duda. \c\cThe German government reformed its security rules in response to the attack. Among the proposals in the anti-terror plan were easing the deportations of rejected asylum seekers, increasing surveillance of those to be deported and those considered to be terror risks, limiting movement of some asylum seekers within Germany, using electronic tags on those deemed terror threats without a trial, lengthening the period suspects can be held in custody and limiting development aid to countries that don\'t cooperate in deportation processes. President of Tunisia Beji Caid Essebsi meanwhile stated that Europe "must be calm", vowing to take responsibility for the attacks, but insisted that it was necessary to verify citizenship before accepting deportations. The Bundestag passed a new surveillance law on 9 March in response to the attack as well as other attacks that occurred in Germany in 2016. The law gives priority to public safety when deciding on whether to permit installation of video surveillance in some locations and makes it easier for private companies to install these systems in public places. It also voted for allowing the Federal Police to install surveillance systems for reading and registering licence plate numbers. \c\cIn February 2017, the German Salafist mosque organisation Berliner Fussilet-Moscheeverein was banned by authorities. Amri was said to be among its visitors. In March 2017, the German Muslim community organisation Deutschsprachige Islamkreis Hildesheim was also banned after investigators found that its members were preparing to travel to the conflict zone in Syria to fight for the Islamic State. According to the Federal Agency for Civic Education, these examples show that Salafist mosques not only concern themselves with religious matters, but also prepare serious crimes and terrorist activities. \c\cIn preparation for the Christmas market 2018, the Breitscheidplatz square and its surrounding were fortified against further terrorist attacks. \c\cOn the fourth anniversary in December 2020, a ceremony, which was attended by survivors and relatives of the victims, was held at the Breitscheidplatz to commemorate those killed in the attack. The archbishop of Berlin Heiner Koch said in his prayers that Berlin "was not the same as before". \c\c19 December 2016 – Polish lorry driver Łukasz Urban, 37, has his vehicle hijacked in the heart of Berlin. Shortly after 20:00 local time – The hijacked truck veers into a traditional Christmas market in the shadow of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Eleven people are killed, Urban is found stabbed and shot dead in the cabin. Shortly after the attack, a 23-year-old Pakistani asylum-seeker is arrested nearby based on a description by a witness who had attempted to chase the attacker but lost sight of him. \c\c20 December 2016 – Following 24 hours of confusion, the Pakistani suspect is released by police as no evidence could be found that would link the man to the attack. Police state they believe the actual attacker to still be at large, possibly armed and dangerous. \c\c21 December 2016 – Anis Amri, a Tunisian man with connections to ISIL, whose asylum request to Germany had been rejected, is announced as the new chief suspect after his documents were reportedly found in the wreckage of the hijacked lorry. He is said to have been using six different names under three different nationalities. Later in the day, a reward of up to €100,000 (£85,000) is offered by German authorities for information leading to Amri's arrest. The country's security is placed under fresh scrutiny following revelations that covert surveillance of the 24-year-old Amri had been discontinued after more than six months, due to police finding nothing to substantiate an initial tip-off. \c\c19–22 December 2016 – Amri likely travelled to Nijmegen, the Netherlands, where it is thought he took a bus to the Lyon-Part-Dieu train station in France. He then took a train from Lyon, via Chambéry, France, to Milan, Italy, via the Italian city of Turin. \c\c22 December 2016 – Amri's brother Abdelkader urges Amri to turn himself in, adding that his family "dissociate" themselves from him. The spokeswoman for Germany's federal prosecutor office announces that the fingerprints of Amri had been discovered on the outside of the truck, the driver's door and the vertical support beam in its window area. \c\c23 December 2016 – 1 am – Amri arrives at the Central Station of Milan, Italy, via Turin. 3 am – Italian Police on a routine patrol in Sesto San Giovanni spot a "very suspicious" male walking through the city center. After being approached by the officers and asked to provide identification documents, the man draws a fire-arm from his backpack and begins shooting. In the ensuing shootout one police officer is injured and the suspect, later identified as Amri, is killed. 10 am – Italian interior minister Marco Minniti holds a morning press conference to announce, with "no doubt", that Italian police had shot and killed the Berlin terrorism suspect. Amaq releases a video of Amri pledging allegiance to ISIL during the day. \c\c29 December 2016 – Prosecutors confirm the attacker sent a voice message and a picture to a contact before the attack. \c\c4 January 2017 – A 26-year-old Tunisian man who knew Amri since late 2015 and met him a day before the attack is detained. German police state they are investigating him as well as Amri's former flatmate. Italian police confirm gun used in attack matches the one on Amri. \c\c10 March 2017 – Italian Interior Ministry announces that it has deported a 37-year-old Tunisian man linked to Amri. 
Solar cycle 25 is the current solar cycle pattern of sunspot activity. It began in December 2019, with a smoothed minimum sunspot number of 1.8. It is expected to continue until about 2030. \c\cWidely varying predictions regarding the strength of cycle 25 ranged from very weak with suggestions of slow slide in to a Maunder minimum like state to a weak cycle similar to previous cycle 24 and even a strong cycle. Upton and Hathaway have predicted that the weakness of cycle 25 would make it part of the Modern Gleissberg Minimum.  One published prediction (of a very weak cycle) was retracted due to fundamental errors. \c\cThe Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel predicted in December 2019 that solar cycle 25 will be similar to solar cycle 24, with the preceding solar cycle minimum in April 2020 (± 6 months), and the number of sunspots reaching a (smoothed) maximum of 115 in July 2025 (± 8 months). This prediction is in line with the current general agreement in the scientific literature, which holds that solar cycle 25 will be weaker than average (i.e. weaker than during the exceptionally strong Modern Maximum). \c\cAs of April 2018, the Sun showed signs of a reverse magnetic polarity sunspot appearing and beginning this solar cycle. It is typical during the transition from one cycle to the next to experience a period where sunspots of both polarities exist (during the solar minimum). The polarward reversed polarity sunspots suggest that a transition to cycle 25 is in process. The first Cycle 25 sunspot may have appeared in early April 2018 or even December 2016. \c\cIn November 2019, two reversed polarity sunspots appeared, possibly signaling the onset of cycle 25. \c\cNandy et al., analyzed the polarity orientation of bipolar magnetic regions observed in December 2019 and concluded that magnetic regions with the underlying orientation of solar cycle 25 toroidal field component were brewing in the solar convection zone, representing early signs of the new cycle. \c\cSupersynoptic (time vs. solar latitude) map of the radial component of the solar magnetic field for Cycles 24-25 based on observations from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) shows magnetic activity of cycle 25 beginning November 2019 at about 30 degree latitudes in both solar hemispheres. \c\cA more recent supersynoptic map is available. \c\cSpotless days by year (Solar cycle 25 vs 24)\c\c2021 : 43 (18%)  ...

Solar activity continued to increase in the following months, especially abruptly in October, with flares taking place on a near-daily basis by November. On November 29, an M4.4 flare, the strongest of the cycle to date, took place, possibly indicating the solar cycle would be more active than initially thought. \c\cOn 8 December, a small coronal mass ejection was found heading directly towards Earth shortly after a strong C-class solar flare, hitting the planet on 9/10 December and causing bright aurorae at high latitudes. \c\cThe first X-class solar flare of the cycle happened on July 3, peaking at X1.59. Although likely to create a CME, the event was not directed towards Earth. \c\cOn July 22, six sunspots were seen for the first time since September 6, 2017. \c\cOn October 9, A M1.6 class solar flare erupted sending a coronal mass ejection that hit earth on October 12 triggering a G2 Geomagnetic Storm. \c\cThe second X class flare of the solar cycle erupted on October 28, producing a CME and a S1 Solar radiation storm

The 2021 Salisbury rail crash occurred on 31 October 2021 when two trains collided near Salisbury railway station in the English city of Salisbury in Wiltshire. The incident occurred at around 19:00 UTC at the Fisherton Tunnel near London Road. One of the trains was derailed during the incident. Emergency police and fire vehicles attended the scene, and twelve people were reported to be injured.
On Monday, November 1, 2021, at 2:45 p.m. UTC+01:00 a 22-story building in the Ikoyi neighborgood of Lagos collapsed. The building had been undergoing construction. Three people are confirmed to have died.
On 2 November 2021, a major insurgent attack occurred at the Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan. At least 25 people were killed. \c\cIslamic State began an insurgency in Afghanistan in 2015 and claimed responsibility for a 2017 attack on Daoud Khan hospital. \c\cOn 2 November 2021, bombers and gunmen attacked Daoud Khan Military Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan. Militants attacked the hospital at its entrance gate by explosion and caused another explosion nearby, then continued the attack using guns. The Taliban said that they killed four attackers and arrested another. About 20 people were killed and about 50 others injured. \c\cNo-one has claimed responsibility, but the Taliban said that insurgents of Islamic State – Khorasan Province carried out the attack.
The Islamic State–Taliban conflict is an ongoing armed conflict between the Taliban and the Islamic State's Khorasan branch (IS-K). The conflict escalated when militants affiliated with IS-K killed Abdul Ghani, a senior Taliban commander in Logar province on 2 February 2015. Since then, Taliban and IS-K have engaged in bloody clashes against each other over the control of territory, mostly in eastern Afghanistan but also by cells in the north-west and south-west. \c\cThe Haqqani network supports the Taliban, while IS is supported by High Council of Afghanistan Emirate, Mullah Dadullah Front and Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. \c\cDuring the Taliban insurgency, in January 2015, the IS established itself in Khorasan and formed their branch IS-K. The main objective of IS-K was to occupy the land of Khorasan, that includes the country of Afghanistan. Even though the initial IS-K was formed by Taliban as well as Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan defectors and thus ideologically similar, it became quickly dominated by Salafists. The groups grew religiously distinct, as the Taliban are dominated by Sufi and Maturidi Hanafists whom Salafists criticize as impure Muslims. As a result, Afghan Salafists have been historically suppressed by the Taliban despite short periods of cooperation. The emergence of IS-K provided militant Afghan Salafists with an opportunity to finally set up a rival force, although Salafist support for the group gradually waned as it proved ideologically too extreme and brutal for most Afghan Salafis. \c\cBy 2016, IS-K mostly consisted of eastern Afghans, Pakistanis, and foreign fighters from Central Asia. The latter were mainly former members of the Islamic Jihad Union and the Turkistan Islamic Party. In addition, there were a small number of Arabs. Throughout its existence, IS-K has operated in a very limited area, mainly concentrated in select provinces in eastern Afghanistan, most importantly Nangarhar and Kunar. By 2016, it had appointed shadow governors in other regions as well, but not exerted much influence outside its traditional bases. The group is known to receive support by the Islamis State's central command in form of money and combat trainers from Iraq and Syria. IS-K's combat strength has fluctuated greatly over the years, but has mostly remained in the low thousands. \c\cOn 2 February, militants affiliated with IS-K killed Abdul Ghani, a Taliban commander, in Logar province. \c\cOn 26 May, Asif Nang, governor of Farah province, said the Taliban have been fighting against IS militants for the past three days in Farah province. The clash left 10 Taliban and 15 IS militants dead. \c\cIn May, IS-K militants captured Maulvi Abbas, a Taliban commander who was leading a small squad of insurgent fighters in Nangarhar province. \c\cIn June, IS-K militants beheaded 10 Taliban fighters who were fleeing an Afghan military offensive according to a spokesman of Afghan army corps responsible for the region. \c\cOn 9 November, fighting had broken out between different Taliban factions in the Zabul Province of Afghanistan. Fighters loyal to the new Taliban leader Akhtar Mansour began to fight a pro-IS faction, led by Mullah Mansoor Dadullah. According to Afghan security and local officials, Akhtar Mansour had sent as many as 450 Taliban fighters to crush Mullah Mansoor and Islamic State elements in Zabul. Dadullah's faction received support from IS during the clashes, and IS fighters also joined in on the fighting alongside Dadullah, including foreign fighters from Chechnya and Uzbekistan. Dadullah and IS were eventually defeated by Mansour's forces. Hajji Momand Nasratyar, the district governor of Arghandab, said the fighting took place in three districts of Zabul province and 86 IS militants and 26 Taliban fighters were killed in the clash. Taliban also reported to have killed several IS militants who were responsible for beheading of seven Hazara civilians a few days back. \c\cHajji Atta Jan, the Zabul provincial council chief, said the offensive by Mullah Mansour's fighters was so intense, that at least three Islamic State commanders, all of them ethnic Uzbeks, had surrendered. They were also asking others IS militants to do the same. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, while quoting sources from Southern Afghanistan, reported that some 70 IS militants were also captured in the clash by the Taliban. \c\cOn 13 November, Ghulam Jelani Farahi, an Afghan police chief, said that Mullah Mansoor Dadullah was killed in a clash with Taliban. \c\cIn January, hundreds of Taliban fighters launched an assault against IS bases in eastern Afghanistan. Taliban fighters were successful in capturing two districts from IS in eastern Afghanistan, but it failed to drive the group out of their stronghold in the Nazyan district in Nangarhar province. Ataullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said that 26 IS militants and 5 Taliban fighters were killed in the clashes in Nangarhar. \c\cOn 2 February, US carried out airstrikes targeting IS radio station in eastern Afghanistan. The strike destroyed the radio station and killed 29 IS militants. \c\cIn March, Taliban factions led by Muhammad Rasul and opposed to Mansoor, began to fight against his loyalists in the group. During the fighting, dozens were reported killed. \c\cOn 26 April, Hazrat Hussain Mashriqwal, a provincial police spokesman, said that 10 IS militants, including an IS commander, and 6 Taliban fighters were killed in a clash in Nangarhar. 15 IS militants and 4 Taliban fighters were also wounded during the same clash according to the spokesman. \c\cOn 19 May, local government officials reported that a clash took place between IS and Taliban in Achin and Khogyani district of Nangarhar province. 15 IS militants and 3 Taliban fighters were killed in Achin district, and the remaining were killed in Khogyani. 4 Taliban commanders were also among the dead. \c\cOn 13 August, US defence officials said that ISIL's top leader, Hafiz Saeed Khan, was killed in a drone strike on 26 July in Nangarhar province. \c\cOn 30 October, Ajmal Zahid, a governor of Golestan district, said that ISIL's commander, Abdul Razaq Mehdi, was killed by Taliban fighters in Farah province. \c\cOn 13 April 2017, the United States dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb, known as the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) Mother of All Bombs near Momand village upon a Nangahar's Achin District village in eastern Afghanistan to destroy tunnel complexes used by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP or ISIS-K). The Guardian reported that following the strike, US and Afghan forces conducted clearing operations and airstrikes in the area and assessed the damage. \c\cOn 26 April, a fight occurred after IS captured 3 drug dealers who were involved in selling opium for the Taliban in Jowzjan Province. An Afghan National Police spokesman stated that the Taliban attacked IS in response, saying "The clashes erupted when group of armed Taliban attacked Daesh militants [to secure] the release of 3 drug smugglers who came here to pay 10 million afghanis [$14,780] to the Taliban for a deal." The Taliban's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid had also confirmed clashes were ongoing with IS at the time ,without providing details on the nature of the fight or reasons. Mohammad Reza Ghafori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said that the clashes between Taliban and IS-K had left 76 Taliban and 15 IS militants dead. IS militants also seized 2 districts from the Taliban, according to the spokesman. \c\cOn 24 May, a clash between the Taliban and IS occurred, and at that time, it had reportedly been the largest clash between the two with 22 casualties, 13 of which were IS fighters, and 9 Taliban fighters, according to a Taliban official. The clashes occurred near Iran's border with Afghanistan. The Taliban had attacked an IS camp in the area, an IS commander, who was formerly a Taliban member, said that there was an agreement between the Taliban and IS not to attack each other until there was a dialogue. The commander claimed that the Taliban had violated the agreement and attacked the IS camp. The IS commander also claimed the attack was coordinated with the Iranian military, and that there were Iranians filming dead IS fighters. The Taliban splinter faction Fidai Mahaz has also criticized the Taliban for its relationship with Iran. Days before the battle, the Taliban reportedly met with Iranian officials to discuss regional issues. A spokesman for Fidai Mahaz claimed the meeting was held at the request of the Taliban, as it was weary of the expansion of IS in the country, which also concerned the Iranian government. The spokesman also said that the Taliban received US$3 million in cash, 3,000 arms, 40 trucks, and the ammunition from Iran's intelligence services, in order to fight IS near the Iranian border, although a Taliban spokesman denied the allegations. \c\cOn 27 November, Taliban executed one of its senior commanders for colluding with IS. A week before, IS fighters were mass executed by their fellow militants in Achin district, according to a provincial government spokesman. However, the spokesman did not provide any additional detail, and neither did IS release any official statement on killing its own members. \c\cOn 20 June, after the talks between the Russian government and the Taliban, US assistant secretary of state Alice Wells condemned the Russian government's position on the Taliban that included backing for the group against IS, stating it gave the Taliban legitimacy and challenged the recognized Afghan government. \c\cIn July, the Taliban launched an offensive against IS in the Jowzjan province.  According to a surrendered IS commander, the Taliban had amassed 2,000 fighters for the offensive against IS. The fighters from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, who had sworn allegiance to IS, were also present fighting alongside IS against the Taliban. During the fighting, 3,500 to 7,000 civilians were displaced. By the end of July, IS's hold in the region was reduced to 2 villages, all thanks to the Taliban's campaign. In response, they requested support from the Afghan government, and also agreed to put down their arms in exchange for protection from the Taliban. The Afghan Air Force later carried out airstrikes against the Taliban in exchange for IS's surrender in the region. The agreement between the Afghan government and IS created controversy afterwards. On 17 July, IS militants killed 15 Taliban militants and injured 5 others during a raid on a house belonging to a Taliban commander in Sar-e Pol. Abdul Qayuom Baqizoi, the police chief of Sar-e Pol, told Associated Press that Taliban and IS fighters have been fighting each other in Jowzjan and Sar-e Pol for more than two months, killing hundreds on both sides. \c\cIn August, during the negotiations between the US government and the Taliban in Doha, the Taliban had requested that the US ends airstrikes on the Taliban, as well as provide support to the group in order to fight IS. \c\cOn 22 June, clashes were reported in Kunar between the Taliban and IS, by an Afghan government official. The official also claimed that the Afghan military had killed some IS fighters in the area, and that the Taliban was active in the area as well. \c\cOn 29 June, IS released photos of weapons captured from the Taliban. On the same day, IS published a video of its fighters renewing their Bayah to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In the video, fighters criticized the Taliban for engaging in peace talks and called upon Taliban fighters to join IS. \c\cOn 1 August, the Amaq News Agency claimed that IS had killed 5 Taliban members during clashes in Kunar. \c\cOn 1 October, IS claimed to have killed and wounded 20 Taliban fighters in Tora Bora. \c\cIn March 2020, the Afghan Salafist Council under its emir, Shaikh Abdul Aziz Nooristani, met with Taliban leaders and plegded loyalty to their movement. Salafists had previously provided crucial support to IS-K, but recognized that the latter's position had greatly declined after its defeats in Nangarhar and Kunar. The Salafist Council, represented by 32 scholars and military leaders, stated that they were in no way loyal to IS-K, and wanted to be left out of the Islamic State–Taliban conflict. The Taliban leadership accepted the pledge of loyalty, exploiting it in its propaganda. \c\cThe Taliban finally succeeded in taking over Afghanistan from the Islamic Republic during a large-scale offensive in summer 2021. Kabul fell on 15 August 2021, prompting the leaders of the IS-K to denounce the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The Taliban immediately moved to contain or purge potential opponents, including Islamic State supporters and Salafists. Across the country, the Taliban ordered the closure of Salaffist mosques seminaries and tried to arrest prominent Salafist scholars, prompting many to go into hiding. Among those targeted by the new Taliban authorities were Salafi clerics who had publicly opposed IS-K. Researcher Abdul Sayed argued that the purge was probably organized by hardline anti-Salafist elements within the Taliban and more motivated by long-time resentment than fears about Salafi support for a future IS-K insurgency. On 16 August, the Taliban claimed to have killed around 150 IS-K fighters, including its former chief Abu Umar Khurasani, while prisoners were being released from a jail in Kabul. However, many IS-K militants were able to rejoin the IS-K ranks because of spree of prison breaks across the country organized by the Taliban. \c\cOn 26 August, a suicide bombing and a mass shooting occurred near Abbey Gate at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. The attack began hours after the United States\' State Department told Americans outside the airport to leave due to a terrorist threat. At least 185 people were killed in the attacks, including 13 U.S. service members. The Taliban condemned the attack, saying "evil circles will be strictly stopped". The Taliban later announced that they would take every possible measure to capture IS-KP leader Shahab al-Muhajir. The same day, Saifullah Mohammed, Taliban's CID chief, told The Times that they had captured six militants belonging to IS-K following a gun battle in western side of Kabul. \c\cTaliban militants kidnapped the influential Salafi cleric, Mullah Abu Obaidullah Mutawakil on 28 August; he was brutally murdered one week later. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied the Taliban's role in the killing of Mutawakil, but also did not condemn the murder. Even though Mutawakil was described as an IS-K sympathiser and a large number of his students were part of IS-K, he had not officially backed the Islamic State. IS-K did not offer prayers for him after his demise, stating that he had not been loyal to the Islamic State's caliphate. \c\cOn 6 September, Neda Mohammad, a Taliban governor for Nangarhar province, vowed to continue fighting the IS-K militants. Nangarhar province is the stronghold of IS-K and the governor says that since taking over Nangarhar, his forces had arrested 70–80 suspected militants belonging to IS-K in Nangarhar province. \c\cOn 8 September, Taliban killed Farooq Bengalzai, an ISKP head for a Pakistan's province, in Nimroz, Afghanistan. \c\cOn 18 September, seven people were killed when four bombs planted by suspected IS-KP members exploded in Jalalabad targeting Taliban patrols. \c\cOn 22 September, two Taliban fighters and a civilian were killed by ISIL gunmen who attacked a checkpoint the in Ghawchak district of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan, security sources and witnesses said. \c\cOn 1 October, Taliban forces raided an ISKP base in the city of Charikar, north of Kabul. The Taliban claimed they had killed and arrested a number of ISKP members. \c\cOn 2 October, suspected ISKP militants shot dead two Taliban fighters and two civilians in the city of Jalalabad. \c\cOn 3 October, an explosion at the entrance to the Eidgah Mosque in Kabul leaves at least five dead, where a memorial service was held for the mother of Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. ISKP later claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming they killed several Taliban militants. \c\cOn 4 October, the Taliban says it has "destroyed an IS–K cell" in Kabul following yesterday's bombing at a mosque during the memorial for the mother of Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Mujahid says that a special Taliban unit carried out the operation and that the base was destroyed and everyone inside was killed. \c\cOn 6 October 7 people, including at least one Taliban fighter, were killed in a grenade attack on a religious school in the city of Khost. The ISKP claimed responsibility for the attack. \c\cOn 7 October, the Taliban announced that they had arrested 4 ISKP members after a raid in Paghman district, west of Kabul. On the same day, ISIS claimed responsibility for the capture and execution of a Taliban fighter in District 2 of Jalalabad. \c\cOn 8 October, a Uyghur Islamic State militant, by the name of Muhammad al-Uyghuri killed 55–100 people and injured dozens more after launching a suicide bombing on a Shi\'ite mosque in the city of Kunduz. \c\cOn 9 October, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen announced that there would be no co-operation with the U.S to combat ISKP, saying that the Taliban are \'able to deal with ISIS independently\'. \c\cOn 10 October, the ISKP claimed responsibility for the assassination of two Taliban fighters in District 7 of Jalalabad. \c\cOn 14 October, a bomb killed a Taliban police chief in Asadabad, capital of Kunar province, Afghanistan. They also claim that 11 people were injured, including four Taliban soldiers. \c\cOn 15 October, a bomb explosion occurred in Kandahar at the Shia \'Imam Bargah mosque\', killing at least 65 people and wounding at least 70 more. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. \c\cOn 20 October, the Taliban announced they had arrested at least 250 ISKP operatives between mid-September and mid-October 2021. \c\cOn 23 October, ISKP claimed responsibility for shooting two Taliban fighters dead in District 1 of Jalalabad city. \c\cOn 24 October, a bomb attack in Afghanistan has left at least two civilians dead on Saturday, one of them a child, and four wounded. The device placed on the road in eastern Afghanistan was aimed at a Taliban vehicle On the same day, it was reported that ISKP militants had raised their flag in a village in Uruzgan Province and that ISKP militants were distributing leaflets at mosques in several nearby villages. \c\cOn 25 October 17 people were killed in clashes between several gunmen and Taliban forces in the city of Herat On the same day it was announced that Tajikistan and China had reached an agreement for China to fund construction for a new Tajik military base and that Chinese forces can completely operate a military base near the Afghan border. \c\cOn 2 November, the 2021 Kabul hospital attack took place where assailants attacked the Daoud Khan Military Hospital with guns and suicide bombers killing at least 25 people and wounding 50+ more. The Taliban blamed ISKP for the attack and claimed they killed at least 5 militants in a shootout.
The Tigray War (Tigrinya: ውግእ ትግራይ) is an ongoing civil war that began just before midnight on 3 November 2020 in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. The Special Forces of the Tigray Regional government are fighting the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF), the latter being aided by the Ethiopian Federal Police, regional police, and gendarmerie forces of the neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions with the involvement of the Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF). The Tigrayan Special Forces received reinforcements from defecting ENDF soldiers, local militias, and civilian volunteers; they were integrated into the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF). All sides, particularly the ENDF, EDF, and TDF have committed war crimes during the conflict. Due to the onset of the war, a deep humanitarian crisis has developed. \c\cIn 2019, to distance the country from ethnic federalism and ethnic nationalist politics, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed merged the ethnic and region-based constituent parties of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition and several opposition parties into his new Prosperity Party. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a politically powerful entity that had dominated Ethiopian politics for 27 years as a repressive regime through a one-party dominant system, refused to join the new party. The TPLF then alleged that Abiy Ahmed became an illegitimate ruler because the general elections scheduled for 29 August 2020 were postponed to 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The TPLF, led by its chairman Debretsion Gebremichael, went ahead with regional elections in Tigray in September 2020 in defiance of the federal government, which then declared the Tigray election illegal. \c\cAfter a long build-up of Eritrean and Amhara forces on Tigray's borders, the actual fighting between Tigray forces and the Ethiopia-Eritrea-Amhara alliance began on 3 November 2020, with attacks on the federal Northern Command bases and headquarters of the ENDF in the Tigray Region by Tigray security forces. Counterattacks by the ENDF in Tigray were described as a police action by federal authorities. Federal forces captured Mekelle, the capital of the Tigray Region, on 28 November, after which Prime Minister Abiy declared the Tigray operation "over". The Tigray government stated in late November that it would continue fighting until the "invaders" are out, and on 28 June 2021 the Tigray Defense Forces retook Mekelle. Gradual advances of the Tigray forces prompted the federal government to declare a six-month state of emergency on 2 November 2021, together with a call to arms to protect the capital, Addis Ababa. \c\cMass extrajudicial killings of civilians took place during November and December 2020 in and around Adigrat, Hagere Selam, in the Hitsats refugee camp, and in Humera, Mai Kadra Debre Abbay, and Axum. At least 10,000 people have died, and war rape has become a "daily" occurrence, with girls as young as 8, and women as old as 72, raped, often in front of their families. \c\cFollowing the end of the Ethiopian Civil War in 1991, Ethiopia became a dominant-party state under the rule of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of ethnically-based parties dominated by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The founding and most influential member was the TPLF and the chairperson was Meles Zenawi, who was the prime minister of Ethiopia until his death in 2012. \c\cOn 2 April 2018, the once-powerful TPLF was ousted from power in the federal government owing to a growing discontent within the public, a reaction to 27 years of repression. In a closed-door election to chair the EPRDF, executive committee members from Amhara, Oromia and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples\' regions voted for Abiy Ahmed in defiance of the TPLF, which was hoping to get Shiferaw Shigute elected chairman. After losing the election and being ousted from the federal government, TPLF officials relocated to Tigray and continued administering the region for three years frequently clashing with the federal government. In one instance, the regional administration of Tigray is reported to have defied the federal government and refused to allow Ethiopian Federal Police to arrest Getachew Assefa, the former chief of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) of Ethiopia and executive member of TPLF. \c\cOn 1 December 2019, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed merged the ethnic and region-based parties of the EPRDF (which had governed Ethiopia for 28 years) and several opposition parties into his new Prosperity Party. The TPLF, which had dominated Ethiopian politics, refused to join the new party and alleged that Abiy Ahmed became an illegitimate ruler by rescheduling the general elections set for 29 August 2020 to an undetermined date in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cThe TPLF used to be part of the Ethiopian governing coalition until its 2019 refusal to merge into the Prosperity Party. In 2020, tensions between the federal government and Tigray escalated in the months before the November Tigray military intervention. Not only the TPLF, but even the Tigray branch of Abiy's own Prosperity Party expressed fears for an Eritrean invasion. Abiy, who is of Oromo descent, accused the TPLF Party Members in the Tigray Regional Government of undermining his authority. By contrast, Tigray authorities saw the refusal to recognize the September 2020 election for Tigray's state council (which, along with all elections in Ethiopia, had been delayed by the federal elections board because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia) as the reason for the outbreak of the conflict. Abiy Ahmed's government considered the September Tigray election to be illegal. Several journalists were barred by the federal government (at Addis Ababa airport) from travelling to cover Tigray's regional election. \c\cThe warming of relations between Abiy Ahmed and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, who is poorly regarded in Tigray, was also considered to have fuelled the tension. Ethiopian elite units were transported to Gherghera base near Asmara "as part of a security pact" between Abiy and Isaias in a plan to "strike out of existence the TPLF", according to former Eritrean Minister of Defence, Mesfin Hagos. In late October, the Ethiopian Reconciliation Commission stated that it was trying to mediate between the federal and regional governments and the TPLF, but that pre-conditions set by all sides were blocking progress. \c\cOpponents of the Tigray People's Liberation Front have described it as a heavily armed ethnic nationalist paramilitary insurgency, terrorist organization, political party, and former ruling authoritarian regime of Ethiopia. \c\cAs tension continued to grow, a general appointed by Abiy was prevented by the Tigrayan government from taking up his military post. The day before the Tigray forces 4 November Northern Command attacks, the federal parliament of Ethiopia had suggested designating the TPLF as a terrorist organization. \c\cThe 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia states in Article 39.1, "Every Nation, Nationality, and People in Ethiopia has an unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession."\c\cArticle 62.9 grants the House of Federation the right to "order Federal intervention if any State [government], in violation of [the] Constitution, endangers the constitutional order."\c\cIn late September 2020, the TPLF stated that the constitutional term limit of the House of Federation, the House of Peoples\' Representatives (HoPR), the prime minister, and the Council of Ministers was 5 October 2020 and that for this reason, it would consider "the incumbent" constitutionally illegitimate after 5 October. The TPLF proposed replacing the government with a technocratic caretaker government as detailed in a plan posted on Facebook by the Coalition of Ethiopian Federalist Forces. \c\cOn 3 November 2020, Tigray Special Forces and the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) came into conflict during the TPLF attacks on the ENDF Northern Command headquarters in Mekelle, the Fifth Battalion barracks in Dansha, and other Northern Command bases. Several people were killed and the TPLF claimed the attack was carried out in self-defence. \c\cIn retaliation, an Ethiopian offensive was launched which was accompanied by the declaration of a state of emergency, the creation of the State of Emergency Inquiry Board and a shutdown of government services in the Tigray Region. During the subsequent days, skirmishes continued and the Ethiopian parliament declared the creation of an interim government for Tigray. Ethiopian offensives in the north were accompanied with airstrikes and several towns and cities were retaken. \c\cOn the night of 9 to 10 November 2020, 600 civilians, mostly Amharas and Welkait, were killed in a massacre in the town of Mai Kadra with machetes and knives used by local militias and police loyal to the TPLF, according to preliminary investigations by Amnesty International and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission. While refugees interviewed by the Financial Times and Reuters said it was the Amhara militia who were the perpetrators and Tigrayans who were the victims. Two days later, refugees interviewed by the Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The New York Times stated that Amhara militias, including Fano, and the ENDF carried out beatings and a massacre of 20 Tigrayans in Humera. Humera was shelled from the direction of the Eritrean–Ethiopian border for two days around 9–11 November. The ENDF gained control of Humera on 12 November. \c\cOffensives of joint ENDF-Amhara Region-Eritrean forces into Tigray were facilitated by the intervention of "Pterosaurus" drones, launched by the United Arab Emirates from its base in Assab, Eritrea. The Chinese-made, armed drones bombed Tigrayan towns and defense forces.[dubious  – discuss] \c\cIn the late hours of 13 November 2020, Tigray forces fired a rocket towards the airports of Bahir Dar and Gondar in the Amhara Region. On 14 November 2020, Tigrayan forces launched rockets at the Eritrean capital of Asmara, but the missiles missed. The Tigray government claimed these locations contained military terminals that served as bases to carry out airstrikes. \c\cOn 17 November 2020, the Ethiopian government accused the TPLF of blowing up four main bridges leading to Mekelle. The Tigray government denied the accusations. From 17 to 19 November, Ethiopian forces captured the Raya district and the cities of Shire, Alamata, Adwa, and Axum. In Raya there were an estimated 760 casualties from both forces. While fighting between Tigray and Ethiopia continued in Zalambessa and Ethiopian forces starting moving towards Adigrat. Fighting between Tigray and Eritrea took place in Adi Quala, Zalembesa, Taruna, Ali Tina, Wadqomdi, and Bademe. \c\cOn 23 November, Ethiopian forces reached the regional capital of Mekelle and encircled it. A military spokesperson for Ethiopia, Colonel Dejene Tsegaye, announced that Mekelle would be shelled, and told Tigray civilians to flee the city because Ethiopian forces would show no mercy. Many residents of Mekelle had already left the city due to airstrikes in and around the city, but many others still remained in the city. \c\cEven though TPLF leaders, Tigray Special Forces, and militia forces had already left the city, the Ethiopian forces still began their direct assault on Mekelle on the morning of 28 November and started heavy shelling of the city. By the evening Prime Minister Abiy declared Ethiopian forces had taken full control of the city. In total 27 civilians were killed and 100 others were injured. The Tigray government vowed to continue fighting. Two days later Prime Minister Abiy claimed no civilians were killed. \c\cAfter Ethiopian federal forces and their allies captured Mekelle and other major cities, forces loyal to the Tigray government began to regroup into mountainous areas of Tigray and reorganized under the banner of the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF). The TDF also began to dig into their positions in rural Tigray. Afterwards the TDF then started a guerrilla campaign against Ethiopian-allied forces from the mountains, and, by mid-December, fighting had reached Hagere Selam, Samre, Dogu’a, Kolla Tembien, May Tsemre and localities around Maychew. During this time, a violently enforced curfew was set up by Ethiopian forces along with Eritrean soldiers. In one town over 200 people were killed and the town left deserted. The Ethiopian government denied involvement in the killing. \c\cThe early gains made by the ENDF and Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) against the Tigray forces did not lead to decisive defeats of the re-organized and invigorated TDF. In late January 2021, the TDF had rallied and were intensifying their insurgency against Ethiopian forces despite initial setbacks and heavy losses. During this time fighting was reported to have taken place around Mekelle and the ENDF retreated from rural positions towards Mekelle. Mutinies were also reported in the city with ENDF personnel refusing to launch an offensive into the mountains and fight the TDF. The most fierce of these clashes took place in mid-February in Samre, a small town 40 km (24.85m) south-west of Mekelle. Thousands of Ethiopian troops supported by artillery, tanks, and airstrikes fought forces loyal to the Tigray regional government that were dug in. The Guardian reported in late April 2021 that there was renewed fighting in the area. \c\cIn April 2021, the TDF was in control of the rural areas of central and southern Tigray along with parts of eastern and south-eastern Tigray, while the ENDF was in control of the main roads and urban areas. Amhara and Eritrean forces also controlled parts of Tigray in the west and north, respectively. Both sides prepared for a prolonged conflict as the war reached a stalemate. All sides wished to secure a military victory, but they lacked the ability to do so in the near term. The Tigray Defense Forces were engaged in a war of attrition with popular support from the people of Tigray, who value the autonomy of the region. This was backed up by the TDF growing in strength while being under pressure on all sides. Many Tigrayans also began to support secession from the Ethiopian government – a stance which would inflame Amhara-Tigray territorial disputes. \c\cAccording to people who were in Tigray when the war broke out and according to refugees, the EDF would then go on to kill 80–150 in Idaga Hamus on 30 November, and kill 17 in Hadish Hiwot on 2 December after forcing the victims to loot the Goda factory. The EDF would also kill 13 boys aged 12–15 from 1 to 14 December in Tokot.[dubious  – discuss]\c\cOn 26 December 2020, it was reported that Eritrea started withdrawing some of its troops from Tigray. \c\cOn 9 January 2021, Ethiopian TV reported that 300 refugees in Hitsats camp were executed by the TPLF. According to refugees, pro-TPLF forces used Hitsats as a base for several weeks in November 2020, killing several refugees who wanted to leave the camp to get food and, in one incident, killed nine young Eritrean men in revenge for having lost a battle against the EDF. On 18 February 2021, unidentified militiamen ambushed a passenger bus in Adi Mesino, killing six and injuring 10. On 20 February, Yemane Niguse, a prominent Tigrayan dissident was assassinated in his birth town of Hewane by unknown assailants. The allegiance of the assassins is unknown. The federal Ethiopian authorities accused the TPLF of responsibility. \c\cOn 1 April 2021, a video surfaced that purported to show Ethiopian troops executing 11 unarmed men before disposing of their bodies near Mahibere Dego. The video has not been dated as of yet. \c\cOn 6 May 2021, Ethiopia's House of Peoples’ Representatives declared the TPLF as a terrorist organization. On 21 May, Ethiopia's military prosecutors convicted 3 soldiers of rape and pressed charges against 28 others suspected of killing civilians in Tigray, 25 other soldiers are charged with rape and other forms of sexual violence, according to a statement by the attorney general's office. The statement also confirmed reports of two massacres in Tigray: It said 229 civilians were killed in the town of Mai Kadra at the beginning of November. Moreover, and for the first time, the Ethiopian government accused troops from Eritrea of killing civilians: 110 civilians killed in the city of Axum on 27 and 28 November. \c\cOn 28 and 29 November 2020, witnesses and survivors, including refugees in Sudan, reported that the Eritrean Defence Forces carried out the Axum massacre of about 720 to 800 civilians. \c\cThe Eritrean government stated that it was angered by Amnesty International's report on the massacre, that the report was "fallacious" and that the Eritrean government had not been contacted by Amnesty International prior to publication. The Eritrean government also said: "It must be underscored that Amnesty made absolutely no attempt to seek any information from Eritrea. Moreover, the fabricated Axum accusation has mutated over the last month from a \'massacre of Orthodox Christians at St. Mary's Church\' to \'house-to-house\' killing of civilians."\c\cThe situation on the ground has changed drastically following a guerilla warfare campaign by the TDF and in February 2021, the UN chief coordinator of humanitarian efforts Mark Lowcock said that up to 40% of Tigray was not controlled by Ethiopian troops. He said that much of that area was under the control of Eritrean soldiers pursuing their own objectives independent of Ethiopian command. \c\cRefugees told VICE World News that Eritrea was in control of parts of the northern Maekelay Zone and most likely extending beyond the zone. Different refugees told VICE that not only did Eritreans cross into border areas, but they also took control of the area. One refugee from Maekelay told them "Since the war started, we haven\'t seen a single Ethiopian soldier. Only Eritreans, they occupy the rural areas."\c\cOn 16 June 2021, the Ethiopian ambassador to the UN stated that Eritrean troops in Tigray were to "definitely leave soon". \c\cOn 22 June 2021, an Ethiopian military cargo plane was shot down over Samre, marking a turn of the war in the TDF's favor. On 28 June 2021, the Tigray Defense Forces retook the city of Mekelle. People celebrated in the streets of Mekelle as the TDF took the city. Ethiopian soldiers, police and administrators were seen leaving, ahead of the occupation by the TDF. Shortly after hearing news of the TDF advance, the Ethiopian government declared an immediate unilateral ceasefire across the Tigray Region. BBC News reporter Vivienne Nunis characterised the ceasefire as an attempt by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to save face, the government having little other option. \c\cOn 29 June 2021, Tigrayan forces vowed to continue their offensive and drive into Eritrea or the Amhara Region if necessary and said that Mekelle was 100% under the control of Tigrayan forces. On 30 June 2021, the TDF had entered the town of Shire, some 140 kilometres (87 mi) northwest of Mekelle, after it had been abandoned by Eritrean troops. The International Crisis Group claimed that the TDF now controlled most of the Tigray region. The Ethiopian government claimed, on 30 June, that it could re-enter Mekelle in less than three weeks if it wanted to. In the same announcement, the Ethiopian government stated that all Eritrean forces had withdrawn from the region, though this was not confirmed by the Eritrean government. \c\cOn 6 July 2021, the Tigrayan government began a mobilisation to retake western Tigray from Amhara forces. A TDF offensive that started on 12 July resulted in Tigrayan forces capturing southern Tigray, including the towns of Alamata and Korem. The TDF subsequently crossed the Tekezé River and advanced westward, capturing the town of Mai Tsebri in the Tselemti district and prompting Amhara officials to call on its militias to arm themselves and mobilise. Following the TDF's rapid advances, Abiy threatened to resume war with Tigray and crush the rebels, raising fears of genocide. He called on other regions of Ethiopia to mobilise their special forces. The Oromia, Sidama, and SNNPR regions answered the call and mobilised. \c\cIn response the TDF invaded the Afar Region to its east, prompting the Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambela, Harari and Somali regions to also join the war. Heavy fighting in western Afar has displaced over 54,000 people and resulted in the TDF reportedly capturing three districts in the region. \c\cWhile the Tigray government claimed it only entered Afar to target federal forces, experts believe their aim was to sever a portion of National Highway A1, a vital trade route for landlocked Ethiopia, linking the capital of Addis Ababa to the Port of Djibouti from which most of its petroleum products are imported. Following the TDF's counter-attack on two districts of his region, the Amhara regional President, Agegnehu Teshager, called for the total mobilisation of all people of all ages who are armed in the region to fight against the Tigrayans. A similar call was made in Afar. Meanwhile, the city of Weldiya was besieged by the TDF before subsequently being captured on 12 August 2021. \c\cOn 4 August 2021, some Agaw people (also known as Agew people) declared themselves independent from the Amhara Region and formed the Agew Liberation Front (ALF), aligning itself with the TDF.[citation needed] The very next day Lalibela was reported to have been seized by Tigrayan forces. On 9 August, UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore expressed concern about reports that over 200 people, including 100 children, had been killed in attacks on displaced families sheltering at a health facility and a school in the Afar Region. On 11 August, the TDF and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) announced an alliance to overthrow Abiy Ahmed's government saying they are also in talks with other rebel groups to establish a "grand coalition". With the TDF advancing deeper into Amhara, various cities across the region began enforcing curfews. \c\cOn 9 September 2021, the Ethiopian government claimed Tigrayan forces had been "routed" and heavily defeated in the Afar Region. Tigrayan spokesperson Getachew Reda said its forces had seen no fighting in Afar and had redeployed to the adjoining Amhara Region. On 30 September, amid UN concerns about a blockade of aid deliveries to Tigray, the Ethiopian government expelled 7 top UN officials, reportedly because of "meddling" in its internal affairs, giving the officials 72 hours to leave the country. \c\cOn 8 October 2021, Tigrayan spokesperson Getachew Reda said an intensive air campaign by the Ethiopian Air Force (ETAF) began against TDF positions in North Wollo and North Gondar zones of the Amhara Region, mostly around the towns of Wegeltena, Wurgessa and Haro. He also stated there was a "massive build up of forces on all fronts". The federal government and Amhara Regional Government did not respond to the claim. On 11 October, Ethiopian-allied forces launched coordinated ground attacks "on all fronts" against the TDF with combined arms including tanks, helicopters, heavy artillery, warplanes, and drones according to the Tigrayan government. General Tsadkan Gebretensae, member of the central command of the TDF said both sides had been preparing for the offensive for months, and predicted that battle would be “decisive”. \c\cThe new offensive effectively ended the unilateral ceasefire declared by the federal government in June. The offensive further deepened fears of the developing famine in Tigray, with a federal government blockade still preventing most aid from arriving. Meanwhile, the continued war prompted regional leaders, including Kenyan President Kenyatta, to voice their concerns and urge peace, while US Secretary of State Blinken met with the AU envoy to Ethiopia, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, to discuss the crisis. \c\cOn 13 October, Getachew claimed fighting continued intensifying with "staggering" casualties. He also claimed clashes were taking place near Weldiya and that fighting had resumed in Afar, within the Awra and Chifra districts near the Amhara border. A humanitarian worker citing witnesses said the EDF were fighting the TDF in Berhale, a town in Afar 71 kilometres (44 mi) northeast of Mekelle. \c\cThere has been weeks of fighting around Dessie, with reports of a lynching carried out by Amhara miliitia on Wollo University professors. On 30 October 2021, it was reported that Dessie had fallen to the Tigray Defense Forces. This would be a major development, as it is the largest city in South Wollo and puts the TDF in a position to launch attacks into several strategic areas of Ethiopia. However, control over the city was not immediately certain, with the Federal Government denying its capture and reports of fierce fighting coming from the region. On 31 October 2021, the TDF captured Kombolcha, to the east of Dessie, and the Ethiopian government accused the TDF of massacring over 100 youths in the town Meanwhile, fighters from the OLA seized control over several towns on the A2 Highway to Addis Ababa, and later declared they were considering an offensive towards the capital. The TDF claimed they were poised to link up with the OLA. Meanwhile, it was reported that a new roundup of ethnic Tigrayans had occurred in Addis Ababa. \c\cOn 2 November 2021, as the offensive came deeper into federally-controlled territory, Addis Ababa declared a six-month state of emergency, which envisages the possibility to arrest and detain critics of the government without a court warrant, impose curfews, institute censorship, restrict freedom of movement as well as to call any adult person to fight in the war, for fear of serving from three to ten years in prison. Authorities in Addis Ababa also told residents to register arms in order to fend off the anticipated offensive, and four other regional governments also made a call to arms. \c\cThousands of people were believed to have been killed in the conflict and around 44,000 fled to Sudan. On 29 November, claims that South Sudan was giving safe haven to Debretsion, led to the Ethiopian ambassador to South Sudan abruptly returning to Ethiopia, and South Sudanese diplomats in Ethiopia allegedly being given 72 hours to leave the country. \c\cOn 15 December, four Sudanese soldiers were killed, and 27 others were injured near the Ethiopia–Sudan border, in what Sudan claimed to be an ambush by Ethiopian forces and militias. A Sudanese soldier later claimed that Ethiopian forces had launched artillery attacks on them and intruded into the Jebel al-Teyyour area, located 7 kilometers inside Sudan. Other soldiers claimed that the attackers were Amhara Region militias. Ethiopia claimed the clashes were Ethiopia trying to stop a Sudanese militia which had tried to cross into Ethiopian territory and seize farmlands. \c\cIn response to the killings, Sudan started to build up its military along the border with Ethiopia. Military sources claimed that Sudan had recaptured Jebel al-Teyyour. On 19 December, Sudanese army and Rapid Support Forces were reported to have retaken areas previously taken by Ethiopia and Amhara Region militias in Al Qadarif, Sudan. \c\cOn 7 December heavy fighting broke out between African Union Mission to Somalia and Ethiopian troops in Halgan District, Somalia, when Ethiopian troops tried to disarm Tigrayan troops within their ranks. In total 21 Ethiopian soldiers of Tigrayan origin and 20 other Ethiopian soldiers were killed in the internal military mutiny. \c\cSince the outbreak of the Tigray War, there have been multiple unconfirmed reports of Somali troops being sent from a secret training base in Eritrea ran by the National Intelligence and Security Agency to fight against the newly formed TDF. The first of these reports came in January 2021 from unverified social media accounts. The same month Somalia's information minister, Osman Abukar Dubbe, confirmed Somali soldiers were training in Eritrea but denied any of these troops had been sent to Tigray. According to the Voice of America, several sources with direct knowledge of the program, including three Somali officials and a foreign diplomat, confirmed to them that Somali troops have been training in neighbouring Eritrea. \c\cA small group of parents also protested in Mogadishu about what they said was the government’s mismanagement of the issue. They demanded information on their loved ones who they say they haven\'t seen in a year. The head of Somalia's parliamentary committee on foreign affairs would also ask the Somali president to investigate claims by family members that their sons had gone off to fight in Ethiopia and are now missing. On 19 January 2021, the Somalian government denied the claim that Somali troops had trained in Eritrea and then deployed in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. \c\cAccording to the former head of the Somali National Intelligence and Security Agency, Abdilsalan Guld, Somali troops were in fact sent to Tigray. Guld said that the soldiers, aged from 20 to 30 years old, were secretly taken from Mogadishu and sent to Asmara for military training. Guld stated that 370 of the Somali troops trained by Eritrea were killed in Tigray, and hundreds of others were wounded. \c\cNumerous war crimes have been committed by the Ethiopian, Eritrean and Amhara Regional forces during the Tigray War. \c\cIn a first report of Tigrayan forces killing a large number of civilians since they seized territory in the Amhara Region, Sewnet Wubalem, the local administrator in Dabat [a town 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the village of Chenna Teklehaymanot where the killings took place on 1 and 2 September 2021] said "So far we have recovered 120 bodies. They were all innocent farmers. But we think the number might be higher. There are people who are missing," to Reuters by phone after the area had been re-occupied by the Ethiopian federal army. Reuters clarified that, like many reported atrocities in this war, they were unable to independently verify the report. \c\cTwo days later, the Associated Press (AP) visited the area and found that poorly trained village militia members of both genders, some in military clothing, had been killed. Residents said that Tigrayan forces had killed villagers who had resisted looting but also blamed Ethiopian federal forces for abandoning the villagers to defend themselves unaided by regular troops. The report filed by AP contained numerous high-quality photographs of the village, its villagers and corpses four days after the fighting. \c\cMany sources have accused the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments of engaging in ethnic cleansing of Tigrayans. Some have gone so far as to accuse the Ethiopian government of genocide, including the non-profit Genocide Watch classifying these actions as step 9 of genocide: eradication as well as step 10: denial. According the EU's special envoy to Ethiopia, Pekka Haavisto, senior members of the Ethiopian government have vowed to wipe out all Tigrayans for 100 years. The Ethiopian Government has denied these allegations. \c\cAccording to the United Nations (UN), some 2.3 million children have been cut off from desperately needed aid and humanitarian assistance. Since the start of the conflict, the Ethiopian federal government has strictly controlled access to the Tigray region, and the UN has said it is frustrated that talks with the Ethiopian government had not yet secured adequate humanitarian access for "food, including ready-to-use therapeutic food for the treatment of child malnutrition, medicines, water, fuel, and other essentials that are running low" said UNICEF. By 13 March 2021, the UN and its partners reached about 0.9 million people with complete food baskets, and 0.7 million people with clean water. Despite the progress made, many are still hard to reach due to ongoing fighting. About 4.5 million people of are still in need of aid and about 1 million of that are not in accessible areas due to ongoing fighting. \c\cSince the start of the conflict, there has been limited access to clean water due to hygiene and sanitation services largely being disrupted across Tigray. The Tigray Regional Water Bureau reported that out of 36 villages it assessed, only 4 had partially functioning water sources. Along with that, an estimated 250 motorized water pumping systems have been out of order, and the status of 11,000 hand pumps in rural areas was unknown. Because of this, there has been a heightened risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases and COVID-19. \c\cIn February 2021, it was reported by GOAL Ethiopia, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), MCMDO, MSF-Spain, and World Vision, that nearly one in seven children in 16 woredas and town administrations across Tigray were found to be acutely malnourished. While in Enderta, Abi Adi and Shire, GOAL and IRC reported that 16.6% of children screened had acute malnutrition with 3.5% suffering from severe acute malnutrition. \c\cAccording to the Emergency Coordination Center[who?], out of more than 260 health centres in Tigray before the war, only 31 are fully functional, while 7 are partially functional. According to WHO, all of the functioning hospitals and health centres in Tigray had a lack of medical supplies, drugs, and equipment. UN partners reported continued looting of health facilities. Only 16% of the health facilities had vaccination services and only 17% had maternal services (antenatal care, birth delivery, etc.). \c\cOn 31 August 2021, USAID's mission director in Ethiopia, Sean Jones said: "We do have proof that several of our warehouses have been looted and completely emptied in the areas, particularly in Amhara, where TPLF soldiers have gone into, I do believe that the TPLF has been very opportunistic," in a televised interview with state broadcaster EBC in Addis Ababa. \c\cIn November 2020, the Amhara Region Special Force and Amhara militias loyal to the Amhara regional government took control of the western zone of Tigray in order to settle a decades-old land dispute. They claim the area was taken from them by force in 1992 after TPLF forces overthrew the communist PDRE government and divided the country into 9 ethnic regional states. They have also claimed the woredas (districts) of Welkait, Tegede, Kafta Humera, Tselemti, and Raya to be theirs. Since then, the area has been under the de facto control of Amhara regional authorities. Their control has been marked by reports of ethnically motivated violence and forced displacement. By February 2020, about 45,000 civilians had been forced to leave the zone due to extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, and the disappearances of people, especially young men. One refugee interviewed by Reuters said that if they didn\'t leave when they did, they would have been killed by Amhara forces. 41 other refugees interviewed have also described attacks, looting, and threats by Amhara forces. \c\cThe administrator of the disputed zone, Yabsira Eshetie, has denied any claims of violence or forced displacement by Amhara forces. Mulu Nega, then leader of the government-appointed interim Tigray government had stated the contrary.[clarify][citation needed] The Amhara government also denies reports of forced displacement and has even asked the Ethiopian government to change the regional border. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there have been acts of ethnic cleansing in Tigray. \c\cPossible COVID-19 outbreaks have been feared as refugees fleeing the Tigray conflict have sheltered in crowded camps. \c\cIn November 2020, the UN warned of "very critical" supply shortages for the nearly 100,000 Eritrean refugees who, prior to the war, were registered in four camps in Tigray region. Later that same month, the UN reported that people in Tigray were fleeing Mekelle. The federal government had warned of "no mercy" if Tigray forces and residents remained intermingled. \c\cAs of December 2020, the UN estimated more than one million people have been internally displaced by the fighting. More than 50,000 people have fled to Sudan due to the conflict. Communications and travel links were still blocked, and Human Rights Watch warned that "actions that deliberately impede relief supplies" would violate international humanitarian law. \c\cThere have been "deeply distressing reports of sexual and gender-based violence, extrajudicial killings, [and the] widespread destruction and looting of public and private property by all parties" according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. More than 136 cases of rape have also been reported in hospitals in Mekelle, Ayder, Adigrat and Wukro in eastern Tigray between December 2020 and January 2021, with indications that there are many more such unreported cases. \c\cAs of 2 February 2021, 20,000 of the Eritrean refugees in Tigray, mostly from the Hitsats and Shimelba camps, remained unaccounted for, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \c\cThe fighting has killed thousands, according to International Crisis Group. \c\cThere have been several reported attacks on humanitarian workers, including attacks by Ethiopian government soldiers. The Danish Refugee Council and the International Rescue Committee reported killings of their staff in early December 2020. \c\cAlthough the Ethiopian federal government claims to have given "full and unhindered access for humanitarian actors to operate in all parts of the region," many humanitarian agencies report they have been repulsed at army checkpoints and blocked from entry to various regions. There have been accusations by US officials that belligerents were specifically singling out humanitarian workers for attack. On 23 March 2021, a driver from Médecins Sans Frontières was beaten by Ethiopian soldiers after witnessing extrajudicial killings by Ethiopian government soldiers. Following the 23 June bombing of Togoga, there were reports of Ethiopian government soldiers firing on ambulances to prevent them from reaching the injured. On 25 June 2021, three Médecins Sans Frontières workers were found murdered near their car in Tigray. \c\cClaire Wilmot, writing in The Washington Post, found that a significant number of new, single-issue Twitter accounts were opened in the immediate aftermath of the 4 November attacks. Most appeared to be authentic accounts from people seeking to raise international awareness of the conflict in the midst of a communications blackout in Tigray. The Ethiopian government cited disinformation and hate speech to justify communications blackouts. Researchers suggested that reducing access to information could help to create contexts where misinformation can thrive because it reduces the ability to verify information. The Ethiopian government tried to control the information environment by positioning itself as the sole provider of reliable information. In February, pro-government groups called on their supporters in Ethiopia and the diaspora to combat what they called "TPLF fake news" online. Pro-government groups used tactics similar to those of pro-Tigray groups to push their narrative of the conflict, though as of 5 February, pro-government campaigns had produced fewer Tweets overall. BBC News showed examples of manipulated photos which misleadingly endorsed both the federal Ethiopian government and the TPLF. Researchers found that groups use tactics such as "copy and paste" campaigns hosted on websites, which include instructions for opening new accounts, copying and pasting pre-written tweets, and tagging influencers. Both campaigns produced disinformation and misinformation, though the majority of content produced was activist in nature. Wilmot suggested that the lines between authentic political activity and deliberate manipulation of online content during the conflict were increasingly blurred. \c\cEthnic profiling against Tigrayans occurred during the Tigray War, with Ethiopians of Tigrayan ethnicity being put on indefinite leave from Ethiopian Airlines or refused permission to board, prevented from overseas travel, and an "order of identifying ethnic Tigrayans from all government agencies and NGOs" being used by federal police to request a list of ethnic Tigrayans from an office of the World Food Programme. Tigrayans\' houses were arbitrarily searched and Tigrayans\' bank accounts suspended. Ethnic Tigrayan members of Ethiopian components of United Nations peacekeeping missions were disarmed and some forcibly flown back to Ethiopia, at the risk of torture or execution, according to United Nations officials. The State of Emergency Taskforce stated that the Tigrayan peacekeepers were returned to Ethiopia because of "infiltration of TPLF elements in various entities". On November 1st 2021, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed stated that "we should closely follow those who work for the enemy and live amongst us", as reports of a new roundup of ethnic Tigrayans came out of Addis Ababa. \c\cSeveral proposals for peace negotiations and mediation were made involving some of the main groups involved in the war. Around 9 November 2020, Debretsion asked the African Union (AU) to stop the war and requested peace negotiations; Abiy refused to negotiate. On 25–27 November, a trio of former African presidents appointed by AU chair Cyril Ramaphosa visited Ethiopia with the aim of mediating; they met Abiy and representatives of the Transitional Government of Tigray (that he had appointed to officially replace the elected government led by the TPLF). An emergency Intergovernmental Authority on Development summit of East African heads of government and state met on 20 December 2020 in Djibouti, resulting in a statement of support for the Ethiopian constitutional order and humanitarian access to Tigray Region. \c\cOn 19 February 2021, the TPLF expressed its wish for peace negotiations, declaring eight preconditions for the negotiations. On 20 February, the National Congress of Great Tigray (Baytona), Tigray Independence Party (TIP) and Salsay Weyane Tigray (SAWET) published six demands to the international community that closely overlapped with the TPLF's pre-conditions. \c\cOn 11 March 2021, the US ambassador to Ethiopia, Geeta Pasi, announced support for joint humanitarian activities by international partners and the federal government of Ethiopia. During early August 2021, the government of Sudan attempted to act as a mediator in supporting a peace deal, but its efforts were rejected by the Ethiopian government, who claimed that due to the ongoing border dispute between the two countries over al-Fashaga, Sudan would not be able to act as a neutral mediator. \c\cIn July and August, a mediation group called "A3+1" (or A3 plus one), consisting of three African countries, Kenya, Niger and Tunisia and one non-African country, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, was formed, in the spirit of "African solutions to African challenges". The A3+1 group called for "mediation of the deep divides as part of an Ethiopian-owned process" with support from existing peace and conflict resolution structure, "especially those of the African Union". \c\cIn the first week of November 2020, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) issued a statement saying "ONLF is gravely concerned about the ... outbreak of war in and around Tigray. The nations of Ethiopia have had their share of wars and natural disasters, and were expecting a period of reprieve and recuperation. Consensus and dialogue are the only way forward for all to reach a win-win solution". An anonymous civil society member in Jigjiga stated: "We oppose the decision of [Somali Region] President Mustafe to portray Somalis in Ethiopia as supporters of the war against Tigray". \c\cOn 12 November 2020, the TPLF chairman Debretsion Gebremichael denied allegations that the Tigray forces had surrendered, stating that "we are still holding. These people cannot defeat us. We cannot be beaten."\c\cOn 27 November, Ethiopian Attorney General, Gedion Timothewos, pressed by the BBC's Stephen Sackur to clarify if his country was now "sinking into civil war", responded: "If the Prime Minister were to let the TPLF go on with the kind of things they have been doing, if he had let them acquire the heavy weaponry they wanted to acquire by attacking the Northern Command, yes, we would have descended into that kind of situation; but by taking the measures we are taking right now, we will be able to avert that possibility."\c\cWhen Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018, he made significant reforms to Ethiopia's judicial system, economy, and foreign policy. According to an article by Hailemariam Desalegn, the former prime minister of Ethiopia, TPLF officials were concerned these moves were going to threaten their political and economic position in the federation. Thus, according to Hailemariam, TPLF officials started defying the orders from the federal government and made overt and covert actions to undermine and delegitimise the Ethiopian parliament, armed forces and the federal government. \c\cOn 10 September 2021, a collective of 24 Ethiopian civil society organisations called for peace in Ethiopia:\c\cThe call was issued by the Association of Human Rights in Ethiopia (AHRE),\c\cCenter for Advancement of Rights and Democracy (CARD),\c\cEast African Initiative for Change (I4C),\c\cLawyers for Human Rights,\c\cSetaweet Movement,\c\cEditors Guild of Ethiopia,\c\cAssociation of Human Rights in Ethiopia,\c\cInitiative Africa,\c\cFamily Service Association,\c\cInternational Revival Movement,\c\cCenter for National & Regional Integration Studies (CeNRIS),\c\cEthiopian Women Lawyers Association (EWLA),\c\cEthiopian Human Rights Defenders Center,\c\cTIMRAN,\c\cCenter for Justice,\c\cCenter of Concern,\c\cGood Governance for Africa – Eastern Africa,\c\cNetwork of Ethiopian Women Associations (NEWA),\c\cInterafrica Group,\c\cGate for Opportunity,\c\cNew Millennium,\c\cInlusive Vision for Democratic Ethiopia,\c\cEthiopian Initiative for Human Rights,\c\cEthiopian Media Women’s Association. \c\cAlthough this call was late, 10 months after the start of the conflict, it tends to indicate that moods had changed in Addis Ababa (where most of these organisations are located). \c\c Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne called on all parties to show restraint. Champagne also called for a peaceful solution and protection of civilians. \c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, China objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Djiboutian President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh expressed strong support for Abiy, saying that he had chosen to "restore law and order at the federal level, and punish those seeking to break up the country" and dismissed the prospect of negotiations, saying that the TPLF had "structured itself so as to bring the central government to its knees" and that talks could "only lead to the partition of Ethiopia", setting a precedent for secession by other groups in the region. \c\c Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki politically supported the actions taken by the Ethiopian federal government against Tigray People's Liberation Front.[citation needed]\c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, India objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Japan extended its emergency grant aid of 6.6 million US dollars for people affected by the war. \c\c Kenya, expressed political support for the Ethiopian national government. \c\c Minister of Foreign Affairs (Turkey) Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu stated that the Turkish government "understood" the federal Ethiopian government's decision and "expressed his confidence that the operation would end soon and not compromise the safety of civilians."\c\c Norway said it was "deeply concerned by reports of the use of SGBV in Tigray. Norway joins UN Special Rapporteur Pramilla Patten in calling on all parties to commit to a zero-tolerance policy for SGBV. Obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law must be respected."\c\c The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in response to the massacre in the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, "We strongly condemn the perpetrators of this barbaric crime committed in a place of worship. We expect the Ethiopian authorities to immediately take all possible to clarify its circumstances and punish the perpetrators.” Poland also called "on the parties to the conflict to refrain from violence and respect human rights, to ensure the safety of civilian population, and to properly protect the places of worship and freedom of religion. We appeal for an unimpeded access for humanitarian deliveries to the Tigray province. \c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, Russia objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo politically supports the current military actions taken by the Ethiopian government against Tigray People's Liberation Front. \c\c British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had spoken with Abiy and urged "de-escalation of the Tigray conflict" and further stated that "civilians and humanitarian access must be protected". \c\cBritish House of Lords member, David Alton, called on the British government to investigate the reports of massacres and attacks on refugee camps in Tigray. \c\c Then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged de-escalation of the conflict and immediate action to restore peace, and emphasized the importance of protecting civilians. Then US President-elect Joe Biden's foreign policy adviser Antony Blinken expressed deep concern over the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, ethnic violence and threats to peace and security in the area. He called on the TPLF to protect civilians and take steps to end the conflict. \c\cUS Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Tibor Nagy condemned the Tigray People's Liberation Front for their rocket attacks against Asmara, calling it an "unjustifiable attacks against Eritrea ... its efforts to internationalize the conflict in Tigray."\c\cOn 27 February 2021, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces and Amhara regional forces from Tigray. He also asked the African Union and regional partners, to work with the United States to address the crisis in Tigray. \c\cOn 12 March, the US announced it would be resuming some aid to Ethiopia, which had previously been blocked by the Trump administration over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) dispute, but that security assistance programs would remain suspended due to concerns over the conflict in Tigray. \c\c President Joe Biden met with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta to discuss the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Tigray and the need to prevent further loss of life and to ensure humanitarian access. \c\c On 17 September 2021, President Joe Biden signed a new executive order allowing Washington to take punitive sanctions against the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Tigray People's Liberation Front and the Amhara regional government if they play a role in prolonging the conflict, obstructing humanitarian access or commit serious human rights abuses. \c\c The United Nations (UN) warned of the emergence of a major humanitarian crisis, if a full-scale conflict arose. \c\cUN Security Council: "The UN Security Council on Friday scrapped plans to issue a statement calling for an end to violence in Ethiopia's Tigray region because of opposition from China and Russia, diplomats said."\c\c The European Commission said it was mobilizing an initial €4 million in emergency aid, in order to assist displaced Ethiopian refugees who had fled to Sudan. The EU plans on cutting aid to and sanctioning other regions of Ethiopia due to the conflict. \c\c The African Union (AU) appealed for cessation of hostilities and protection of civilians. The AU also stated that the European Union and United Nations Security Council should not intervene until an African Union envoy is sent to Ethiopia. \c\cThe Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, made a statement defending the Ethiopian Government by tweeting "In #Ethiopia, the federal govt took bold steps to preserve the unity, stability and respect for the constitutional order of the country; which is legitimate for all states.

On 1 November 2021, a high-rise block of flats in Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, collapsed. It was in the process of being built much higher than authorised. At least 22 people were killed. A rescue effort is ongoing and the state government is conducting an investigation. \c\cPrior to the event,[when?] Fourscore Homes, a United Kingdom-based private development company commissioned the construction of a trio of highrise buildings at 44BCD Gerrard Road, in the Ikoyi neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria, called the "360 Degrees Towers". The company is headed by Nigerian Femi Osibona (aka Olufemi Adegoke Osibona). \c\cOne of the buildings undergoing construction was a 21 story luxury residential high-rise. In February 2020, consultancy firm Prowess Engineering Limited withdrew from the project over concerns regarding the integrity of the building. The Lagos State Building Control Agency had approved only 15 floors, but 21 had been been built. \c\cOn 1 November 2021, at 2:45 p.m. UTC+01:00, one of the three "360 Degrees Towers", the 21-story building, collapsed. Fifteen people have been confirmed dead, and an uncertain number of people are believed to be trapped in the rubble; an official estimate is that up to 40 workers were on site at the time. \c\cOsibona was inside the building during the collapse and is reportedly missing. \c\cA rescue effort is being conducted by the National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos State (NEMA), and other responders. It is being supervised by the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development. According NEMA, the military is scheduled to "take over operations". \c\cAs of 2 November, nine people have been rescued. \c\cFemi Hamzat, deputy governor of Lagos, was jeered by crowds who said authorities had been too slow to initiate rescue attempts. \c\cGbolahan Oki, the general manager  of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, announced that the owner of the building has been arrested and would be prosecuted. The state government suspended the chief architect, and is conducting an investigation.
The 2021 United States elections were held, in large part, on Tuesday, November 2, 2021. This off-year election included the regular gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia. In addition, state legislative elections were held in New Jersey and the Virginia House of Delegates (the lower house of the Virginia General Assembly), along with numerous state legislative special elections, citizen initiatives, mayoral races, and a variety of other local elections. Two of six special elections to the United States House of Representatives also took place on November 2 or earlier as a result of either deaths or vacancies. The first of these was held on March 20. \c\cWidely characterized as a "red wave" election, Republican candidates made significant gains up and down the ballot. Glenn Youngkin, the Republican nominee in the Virginia gubernatorial election, prevailed against Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe in a massive upset.  Youngkin promised to ban the teaching of critical race theory within public schools on "day one" of his administration, push back against certain COVID-19 mandates and restrictions, and advocate for a low tax and small government agenda within the state of Virginia. Within the Democratic Party, moderate nominees generally prevailed against left-wing candidates, and progressive policies by and large saw rejection; a proposal to defund and replace the Minneapolis police department was defeated by an overwhelming margin. \c\cThe results were widely seen as a backlash against the social, racial, and COVID-19 migration policies of the Biden administration; its perceived economic interventionism; as well as cultural liberalism and "wokeism" within the Democratic Party. \c\cAs part of the 2020 United States Senate elections, Georgia held run-off elections for both of its Senate seats on January 5, 2021. The run-off elections were triggered because of a Georgia law requiring a second round when no individual wins a majority of the vote in most federal, state, and local elections. Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock were the victors in those special elections, which gave the Democrats a total of 48 seats to the Republicans\' 50. However, the victories resulted in a shift of power to the Democrats; the other two Senators, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, are both independents who belong to the Democrats\' caucus, and since any tied vote is broken by the President of the Senate — in this case Vice President Kamala Harris, also a Democrat — the Democrats technically hold a one-seat majority. \c\cSix special elections were held throughout 2021 to fill vacancies during the 117th U.S. Congress. \c\cLouisiana's 5th congressional district: Republican Julia Letlow defeated Democrat Sandra Christophe and fellow Republican Chad Conerly to succeed her husband Luke Letlow after his death from COVID-19 on December 29, 2020, five days before he would have taken office for the next session of Congress. The district has a partisan index of R+17. \c\cLouisiana's 2nd congressional district: Democrat Troy Carter defeated fellow Democrat Karen Carter Peterson to succeed Cedric Richmond, who resigned on January 15, 2021 to become the director of the Office of Public Liaison and a Senior Advisor to Joe Biden. The district has a partisan index of D+25. \c\cNew Mexico's 1st congressional district: Democrat Melanie Stansbury defeated Republican Mark Moores to succeed Deb Haaland, who resigned on March 16, 2021 to serve as the United States Secretary of the Interior. The district has a partisan index of D+9. \c\cTexas's 6th congressional district: Republican Jake Ellzey defeated fellow Republican Susan Wright to succeed Ron Wright, who died on February 7, 2021 from COVID-19 during the pandemic in Texas. The district has a partisan index of R+6. \c\cOhio's 11th congressional district: Democrat Shontel Brown defeated Republican Laverne Gore to succeed Marcia Fudge, who resigned on March 10, 2021 to serve as United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The district has a partisan index of D+30. \c\cOhio's 15th congressional district: Republican Mike Carey defeated Democrat Allison Russo to succeed Steve Stivers, who resigned on May 16, 2021 to become the president and CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. The district has a partisan index of R+9. \c\cIn May, Puerto Rico held a shadow congressional delegation election to elect two senators and four representatives to replace the shadow delegation first appointed in 2017. The shadow senators and representatives are not seated in Congress, but are charged with advancing Puerto Rico's statehood efforts. In the preliminary results from election night, former at-large senator Melinda Romero and lawyer Zoraida Buxo earned the most votes for senator, and conservative commentator Elizabeth Torres, municipal lawmaker Roberto Lefranc Fortuño, former Ponce Mayor María Meléndez, and Junventud PNP director Adriel Vélez earned the most votes for the House delegation. However, former governor Ricardo Rosselló earned enough write-in votes to gain a seat in the House delegation over Vélez. Voter turnout was at a record low level — 3.92% — in the election. \c\cTwo states held regularly scheduled gubernatorial elections in 2021, and one more state held a recall election:\c\cCalifornia: A recall petition was launched against first-term Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, mainly for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis scheduled the recall election for September 14, 2021; voters began receiving their mail ballots in August. The election featured two questions: whether to recall Newsom, and who would replace him if he were recalled. A large number of candidates were listed on the replacement ballot, with major candidates including talk show host Larry Elder, financial analyst Kevin Paffrath, businessman John H. Cox, former mayor of San Diego Kevin Faulconer, state assemblyman Kevin Kiley, media personality Caitlyn Jenner, and former U.S. Representative Doug Ose, among others. The recall was unsuccessful and Newsom stayed in office. \c\cNew Jersey: One-term Democrat Governor Phil Murphy is eligible for re-election, and is seeking a second term. Former State assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli won the Republican primary. The Libertarian Party nominated Gregg Mele, the Green Party Madelyn Hoffman, and the Socialist Workers Party Joanne Kuniansky. Major media sources, including the Associated Press projected that Murphy has won re-election. \c\cVirginia: Virginia's term limit laws do not allow sitting governors to serve consecutive terms, so incumbent Democrat Governor Ralph Northam is precluded from running again for the office until the next gubernatorial election in 2025. Former governor Terry McAuliffe won the Democratic primary and former co-CEO of The Carlyle Group Glenn Youngkin was nominated at the Republican convention. Liberation Party candidate Princess Blanding ran unsucessfully in the race as well. Major media sources, including DDHQ projected the Republican Nominee Glenn Youngkin to have won the election. \c\cOne state will hold a lieutenant gubernatorial election in 2021:\c\cVirginia: One-term Democratic Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax was eligible to run for a second term, but instead ran unsuccessfully for Governor. State delegate Hala Ayala won the Democratic primary and former state delegate Winsome Sears was nominated at the Republican convention. On November 2, 2021, Sears prevailed and was elected lieutenant governor of Virginia. \c\cOne state will hold an attorney general election in 2021:\c\cVirginia: Two-term Democrat Attorney General Mark Herring initially ran for governor but withdrew to run for a third term. He defeated state delegate Jay Jones in the Democratic primary. State delegate Jason Miyares was nominated at the Republican convention. On election day, it was projected that Miyares would defeat Herring, and would be the next attorney general of Virginia. \c\cLegislative elections will be held for both houses of the New Jersey Legislature and the lower house of the Virginia General Assembly. Democrats currently hold majority control of the New Jersey Senate and the General Assembly. The Virginia House of Delegates is also held by Democrats, though by only a few seats, giving Republicans an opportunity to regain control. \c\c2021 New Jersey General Assembly election\c\c2021 New Jersey State Senate election\c\c2021 Virginia House of Delegates election\c\cA number of major U.S. cities have held mayoral elections in 2021:\c\cBurlington, Vermont: On March 2, three-term Democrat Miro Weinberger narrowly won re-election against Progressive Max Tracy. \c\cSpringfield, Missouri: On April 6, two-term independent Ken McClure won re-election against independent Marcus Aton. \c\cSt. Louis, Missouri: On April 6, Democrat Tishaura Jones narrowly defeated Democrat Cara Spencer to succeed retiring one-term Democrat Lyda Krewson. \c\cSan Antonio, Texas: On May 1, two-term independent Ron Nirenberg won re-election against Greg Brockhouse. \c\cAnchorage, Alaska: On May 11, Republican Dave Bronson narrowly defeated Democrat Forrest Dunbar in a runoff to succeed acting mayor Austin Quinn-Davidson. \c\cOmaha, Nebraska: On May 11, two-term Republican Jean Stothert won re-election against Democrat RJ Neary in a runoff. \c\cArlington, Texas: On June 5, Jim Ross defeated Michael Glaspie to succeed term-limited three-term Jeff Williams. \c\cFort Worth, Texas: On June 5, Mattie Parker defeated Deborah Peoples to succeed retiring five-term Betsy Price. \c\cJackson, Mississippi: On June 8, one-term Democrat Chokwe Antar Lumumba won re-election against independents Les Tannehill and Charlotte Reeves. \c\cBirmingham, Alabama: On August 24, one-term Democrat Randall Woodfin won re-election against Democrats Lashunda Scales and William A.

The 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis is the ongoing state of heightened military tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States of America, along with their respective allies in the Persian Gulf region. Starting in early May 2019, the U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to deter an alleged planned campaign by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. This followed a rise in political tensions between the two countries during the Trump administration, which included the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the imposition of new sanctions against Iran, and the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. In response, Iran designated the United States Central Command as a terrorist organization. \c\cSeveral merchant ships in the Persian Gulf were damaged in two incidents in May and June 2019. Western nations blamed Iran, while Iran denied involvement. In June 2019, Iran shot down an American RQ-4A surveillance drone flying over the Strait of Hormuz, sharply increasing tensions and nearly resulting in an armed confrontation. In July 2019, an Iranian oil tanker was seized by Britain in the Strait of Gibraltar on the grounds that it was shipping oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Iran later captured a British oil tanker and its crew members in the Persian Gulf. Both Iran and the UK later released the ships. Meanwhile, the U.S. created the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), which sought to increase "overall surveillance and security in key waterways in the Middle East", according to the United States Department of Defense. \c\cThe crisis escalated in late 2019 and early 2020 when alleged members of the Kata\'ib Hezbollah militia, part of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces, killed an American contractor in an attack on an Iraqi base hosting U.S. personnel. In retaliation, the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Kata\'ib Hezbollah's facilities in Iraq and Syria, killing 25 militiamen. Kata\'ib Hezbollah responded with an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, which prompted the U.S. to deploy hundreds of new troops to the Middle East and announce that it would preemptively target Iran's "proxies" in Iraq. Days later, the commander of IRGC's Quds Force Qasem Soleimani and PMF commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were both killed in a U.S. drone strike, resulting in Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei pledging to exact revenge on U.S. forces. The U.S. deployed nearly 4,000 troops in response to the tensions, and Israel heightened its security levels. On 5 January 2020, Iran ended its commitments to the nuclear deal, and the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory. \c\cThe U.S. and Iran nearly entered into an open conflict on 8 January 2020 when the IRGC launched ballistic missile attacks against two military bases in Iraq housing U.S. soldiers in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani, a rare direct Iran–U.S. confrontation and the closest to the brink of war between the two nations in decades. Upon initial assessments of no U.S. casualties, the Trump administration curtailed tensions by temporarily ruling out a direct military response but announcing new sanctions. It was later revealed that more than a hundred U.S. troops sustained injuries during the attacks. During the crisis, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down after departing from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport, and Western officials said the plane had been brought down by an Iranian SA-15 surface-to-air missile. On 11 January 2020, the Iranian military admitted in a statement that they had mistakenly shot down the plane due to human error. \c\cThe crisis re-emerged in July 2021 after a third incident targeting merchant ships, in which two crew members were killed. An additional tanker, the MV Asphalt Princess, was captured, and subsequently released hours later. The crisis is a concern for Maritime security as the increased war-like risks present challenges for commercial shipping. \c\cOn 8 May 2018, the United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal, reinstating sanctions against Iran. Iran's oil production hit a historic low as a result of these sanctions. According to the BBC in April 2019, United States sanctions against Iran "led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests". Iranian officials have accused the U.S. of waging hybrid warfare against the country. \c\cTensions between Iran and the U.S. escalated in May 2019, with the U.S. deploying more military assets to the Persian Gulf region after receiving intelligence reports of an alleged "campaign" by Iran and its "proxies" to threaten U.S. forces and Strait of Hormuz oil shipping. U.S. officials cited intelligence reports that included photographs of missiles on dhows and other small boats in the Persian Gulf, supposedly put there by Iranian paramilitary forces. The U.S. feared the missiles could be fired at its Navy. \c\cThe U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to deter what it regards as a planned campaign of belligerency by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the gulf and Iraq. PMF and Kata\'ib Hezbollah were targeted by U.S. airstrikes, claiming their proxy belligerent role on the orders of Iran. \c\cThe International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), formerly known as Operation Sentinel or the Sentinel Program, is a multinational maritime effort established by the U.S. to ensure gulf security following Iranian seizures of commercial tankers. \c\cFollowing Iran's shoot-down of a U.S. surveillance drone on 20 June 2019, the U.S. bolstered its efforts to establish a coalition to deter Iranian attacks in the Persian Gulf. On 19 July, U.S. Central Command acknowledged what it called Operation Sentinel which had the stated goal of de-escalating tensions and promoting maritime stability in international waters "throughout the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait (BAM) and the Gulf of Oman". Sentinel called for participating nations to provide escorts to their flagged commercial vessels in the region and for coordinating surveillance capabilities. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper later commented on the nature of the operation, stating "My view is... we would want to prevent the Iranians seizing or stopping a ship, certainly, for any arbitrary reason whatsoever". Some U.S. allies, particularly European allies, were reportedly reticent towards the Sentinel Program due to qualms associated with signing on to a U.S.-led naval effort that could potentially drag them into a confrontation with Iran; this was coupled with reports of a potential European-led naval security effort separate from the U.S. By September 2019, the U.S. had "rebranded" Operation Sentinel as the "International Maritime Security Construct", reportedly to attract more participation. \c\cIn early August 2019, the United Kingdom agreed to join the U.S. in its maritime program, abandoning the idea of a European-led naval protection force. On 21 August, Australia announced it would join the U.S.-led naval coalition, with plans to deploy a P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft to the Middle East for one month before the end of 2019, a frigate in January 2020 for six months, and Australian Defence Force personnel to the IMSC headquarters in Bahrain. Australia ended its participation in the IMSC on 28 December 2020 after defense minister Linda Reynolds announced a shifting of naval resources to the Indo-Pacific. \c\cOn 16 September, IMSC members held a Main Planning Conference aboard RFA Cardigan Bay along with representatives from 25 additional countries where they reaffirmed commitments to the operation and discussed their efforts to enhance maritime security throughout key waterways in the region. Saudi Arabia joined the coalition on 18 September and the United Arab Emirates joined on 20 September. \c\cIn November 2019, Albania became the seventh nation to join the IMSC. Lithuania joined the coalition in March 2020. \c\c United Kingdom\c\c Bahrain (Headquarters)\c\c United States\c\c Saudi Arabia\c\c United Arab Emirates\c\c Albania\c\c Lithuania\c\c Estonia. \c\c Australia (2019–2020)\c\cOn 6 August 2019, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz reportedly said Israel would participate in the coalition, providing intelligence and other unspecified assistance. \c\cJapan announced on 18 October 2019 that it would not join the IMSC but would instead send its own separate naval assets to the region to guard merchant vessels "related to Japan" while still closely cooperating with the United States. A senior Japanese official said the contingency force would likely include warships and aircraft that will patrol the Gulf of Oman, the Northern Arabian Sea and other regional waters. In February 2020, as part of efforts by the Japanese government to protect the lanes that provide all the oil the Japanese economy depends on, a Japanese warship departed for the Gulf of Oman. \c\cKuwait and Qatar expressed the intention to join in November 2019. \c\cOn 5 May 2019, then-U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton announced that the U.S. was deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and four B-52 bombers to the Middle East to "send a clear and unmistakable message" to Iran following Israeli intelligence reports of an alleged Iranian plot to attack U.S. forces in the region. Bolton said, "The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack." The USS Abraham Lincoln was deployed to the Arabian Sea, outside the Persian Gulf. \c\cOn 7 May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a surprise midnight visit to Baghdad after canceling a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Pompeo told Iraqi President Barham Salih and Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi they had a responsibility to protect Americans in Iraq. On 8 May, an advisor to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran was confident the U.S. was both unwilling and unable to start a war with Iran. On the same day, Iran announced that it would reduce its commitment to the JCPOA nuclear deal which the U.S. had withdrawn from. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani set a 60-day deadline for the EU and world powers to rescue the current deal before it resumed higher uranium enrichment. The United States Air Forces Central Command announced that F-15C Eagle fighter jets were repositioned within the region to "defend U.S. forces and interests in the region". On 10 May, the U.S. deployed the Marine transport ship USS Arlington and a Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) battery to the Middle East. The Pentagon said the buildup was in response to "heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations". \c\cOn 12 May, four commercial ships, including two Saudi Aramco oil tankers, were damaged near the port of Fujairah in the Gulf of Oman. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) claimed the incident was a "sabotage attack", while a U.S. assessment reportedly blamed Iran or Iranian "proxy" elements for the attack. \c\cOn 13 May, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad said U.S. citizens should not travel to Iraq and for those who were already there to keep a low profile. On the same day, The New York Times reported that Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan had presented a military plan to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East if Iran attacked American forces or took steps toward developing nuclear weapons. U.S. president Donald Trump later discredited this, saying he would instead "send a hell of a lot more" than 120,000 troops if necessary. \c\cOn 14 May, both Iranian and U.S. officials said they were not seeking war, even as threats and counter-threats continued. Ayatollah Khamenei downplayed the escalation, saying in comments carried on state television that "no war is going to happen," while Mike Pompeo said while on a visit to Russia, "We fundamentally do not seek a war with Iran." On the same day, Houthi rebels—which have alleged ties to Iranian elements—in Yemen carried out multiple drone attacks on a Saudi oil pipeline deep in Saudi territory. The U.S. said it believed Iran sponsored the attack, though it was unclear if the attack was particularly related to the Iran–U.S. tensions or related to the Yemeni Civil War that began in 2015 and the U.S.-backed Saudi Arabian-led intervention there. On 15 May, the U.S. State Department announced that all non-emergency staff had been ordered to leave the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. \c\cOn 19 May, President Trump warned that in the event of a conflict, it would be "the official end of Iran". Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded that Trump's "genocidal taunts" would not "end Iran". On the same day, a rocket exploded inside the heavily fortified Green Zone sector of Baghdad, landing less than a mile from the U.S. Embassy. On 24 May, the U.S. deployed 1,500 additional troops to the Persian Gulf region as a "protective" measure against Iran. The deployment included reconnaissance aircraft, fighter jets and engineers; 600 of the troops were given extended deployments, meaning 900 would be fresh troops. U.S. Navy vice admiral and Director of the Joint Staff Michael Gilday said the U.S. had a high degree of confidence that Iran's Revolutionary Guard was responsible for the 12 May explosions on four tankers and that it was Iranian proxies in Iraq who fired rockets into Baghdad's Green Zone. \c\cOn 20 May, Trump said: "We have no indication that anything's happened or will happen" in Iran. However, on 25 May, Trump invoked a rarely used legal loophole to approve the sale of $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, declaring that ongoing tensions with Iran amounted to a national emergency. Weapons would also reportedly be sold to the UAE and Jordan. On 28 May, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran was abiding by the main terms of the JCPOA, although questions were raised on how many advanced centrifuges Iran was allowed to have, as that was only loosely defined in the 2015 deal. \c\cOn 1 June, President Hassan Rouhani suggested Iran would be willing to hold talks but asserted that it would not be pressured by sanctions and American military posturing. On 2 June, Mike Pompeo said the U.S. was ready for unconditional discussions with Iran on its nuclear program, but affirmed that it would not relent on pressuring Iran until it starts behaving like a "normal country". "We are prepared to engage in a conversation with no pre-conditions. We are ready to sit down," Pompeo said, while also saying Trump had always been willing to seek dialogue with Iranian leadership. Iran's foreign ministry responded stating, "The Islamic Republic of Iran does not pay attention to word-play and expression of hidden agenda in new forms. What matters is the change of U.S. general approach and actual behavior toward the Iranian nation," which it said needed "reform". The softening dialogue came amid U.S. military exercises in the Arabian Sea, which saw various aircraft "simulating strike operations"; Yahya Rahim Safavi, top military aide to Ayatollah Khamenei, said U.S. military vessels in the Persian Gulf were within range of Iranian missiles and warned that any clash between the two countries would push oil prices above $100 a barrel. \c\cOn 6 June, the Houthis in Yemen shot down an American MQ-9 Reaper (Predator B) drone. The U.S. military claimed the attack was performed with Iranian assistance. U.S. Central Command commander Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. warned that Iran and its "proxy" forces still posed an "imminent" threat to U.S. forces: "I think we\'re still in the period of what I would call tactical warning ... The threat is very real."\c\cAlso on 6 June, the UAE, supported by Norway and Saudi Arabia, told the United Nations Security Council 12 May attacks had the marks of a "sophisticated and coordinated operation", and were most likely performed by a "state actor". Video of the damage to the tankers Amjad, Al Marzoqah, A Michel and Andrea Victory was released to broadcasters. \c\cOn 13 June 2019 two oil tankers caught fire after allegedly being attacked by limpet mines or flying objects in another incident in the Gulf of Oman. As in the May incident, the U.S. blamed Iranian forces for the attacks. On 17 June, the U.S. announced the deployment of 1,000 more soldiers to the Middle East. \c\cTensions reached a new high when, on 20 June, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down a U.S. RQ-4A Global Hawk surveillance drone, saying the drone had violated Iranian airspace. IRGC commander Hossein Salami called the shoot-down a "clear message" to the U.S. while also warning that, though they were not seeking war, Iran was "completely ready" for it. U.S. Central Command later confirmed that the drone was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles but denied that it violated Iranian airspace, calling it an "unprovoked attack", and that it was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran and the U.S. provided conflicting GPS coordinates for the drone's location, making it unclear whether the drone was within Iran's 12-mile territorial boundary. The U.S. requested a 24 June closed-door United Nations Security Council meeting to address the regional tensions with Iran, according to diplomats. \c\cTrump ordered a retaliatory military strike on Iran on 20 June, but withdrew the order minutes before the operation began. Trump said he had decided to halt the operation after being told that as many as 150 Iranians would be killed, although some administration officials said Trump had been advised of the potential casualties before he ordered the operation to be prepared. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton reportedly objected to the reversal. \c\cOn 22 June, it was reported that Trump had approved cyber attacks that disabled IRGC computer systems used to control rocket and missile launches the night of the drone-downing. The cyber strikes were handled by U.S. Cyber Command in conjunction with U.S. Central Command. It represented the first offensive show of force since Cyber Command was elevated to a full combatant command in May 2018. Also on 22 June, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to U.S. industries that Iran was stepping up cyber attacks of critical industries—particularly oil, gas and other energy sectors—and government agencies, and has the potential to disrupt or destroy systems. \c\cOn 23 June, Iranian President Rouhani blamed the United States\' "interventionist military presence" for the high tensions. Iranian Major General Gholam Ali Rashid warned the U.S. of "uncontrollable" consequences should a conflict break out. Meanwhile, during a speech in Israel, U.S. security advisor John Bolton said Iran should not "mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness", emphasizing that future military options are not ruled out and that Trump had only stopped the strike from going forward "at this time". Mike Pompeo visited the Persian Gulf region for talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in a bid to build a coalition to combat perceived Iranian nuclear and "terror" ambitions. \c\cOn 24 June, the Trump administration announced new sanctions against Iranian government and IRGC leadership, including Supreme Leader Khamenei and his office. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions were to block "billions" in assets. On the same day, Trump told reporters he did not need congressional consent for an initial strike on Iran. On 25 June, Iran said the new sanctions prompted a "permanent closure" of their diplomatic ties, and the regime refused to negotiate with Washington until the sanctions were lifted. On 27 June, Javad Zarif tweeted that sanctions are not an "alternative to war; they ARE war" and argued that Trump's usage of the term "obliteration" against Iran is a reference to genocide, a war crime. He also said negotiations and threats are "mutually exclusive" and called the concept of only a short war with Iran an "illusion". \c\cIn classified briefings, Pompeo and other U.S. State Department and Pentagon officials reportedly advised members of the U.S. Congress on what they described as alarming ties between Iran and al-Qaeda—including giving the terrorist organization safe haven in the country. The New York Times reported that lawmakers were leery of assertions of Iranian links to al-Qaeda, notably due to concerns that the administration may be using specious assertions to build a case for military action against Iran based on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists—supposed links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda were used as partial justification to invade Iraq in 2003. On 27 June, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy sharply denied that Pentagon officials linked al-Qaeda to Iran during congressional meetings. "In these briefings, none of the officials mentioned al-Qa\'ida or the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force," Mulroy said, adding that he and the Defense Intelligence Agency instead "described the historical ties between Iran and the Taliban, and I explained that these ties are widely and publicly known and referenced in articles and books". \c\cFollowing the drone shoot-down, the U.S. continued unabated to deploy military assets to the region. By 28 June, the U.S. had deployed nearly a dozen F-22 Raptor fighter jets to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar—the first ever deployment of F-22s to the base—to "defend American forces and interests". \c\cOn 18 July, according to the Pentagon, USS Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone that had closed in within approximately 1,000 yards (910 m) of the ship in the Persian Gulf; U.S. forces jammed the drone, causing it to crash. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi denied any of the country's drones had been brought down. U.S. General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., commander of the U.S. Central Command, subsequently claimed that USS Boxer may have downed a second Iranian drone. \c\cOn 3 July, Gibraltar enacted "Sanctions Regulations 2019" after the March 2019 Sanctions Act, referring to the EU sanctions for Syria (EU No. 36/2012). It also specified the Panama-flagged Iranian tanker Grace 1 as a ship under those regulations. On 4 July, the ship was seized by British authorities while carrying out an off-port limited logistics stop near Gibraltar, on suspicion that the vessel was carrying oil to Syria in breach of the European Union sanctions. A force of 30 Royal Marines boarded the ship from a helicopter and speedboat, accompanied by Royal Gibraltar Police officers and HM Customs Gibraltar officers. Four of the ship's crew, including the captain and chief officer, were arrested but subsequently released on bail without charge. The Spanish Foreign Office lodged a complaint with its British counterpart. Iran demanded the ship's release and denied the vessel was violating sanctions, and an official of the IRGC issued a threat to seize a British ship in retaliation. Ayatollah Khamenei described the incident as a British act of "piracy" which has been given a "legal appearance". Britain offered to release the ship in exchange for an Iranian guarantee that it would not proceed to the Syrian port of Baniyas to deliver oil to the refinery there. On 11 July, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose foiled an Iranian attempt to capture the BP-owned British oil tanker British Heritage as it transited through the Strait of Hormuz. Three boats believed to be from the IRGC approached the tanker and tried to halt it, after which HMS Montrose, which had been shadowing the tanker, moved between the boats and the tanker and trained guns on the boats, warning them to back off. The Iranian boats then turned away. The Royal Navy subsequently deployed the destroyer HMS Duncan to the Persian Gulf to reinforce HMS Montrose. \c\cOn 14 July, a Panamanian-flagged oil tanker, MT Riah, which was operating in the UAE, disappeared from ship tracking maps near Iran after crossing the Strait of Hormuz. Adding to the mystery, no entity claimed ownership of the tanker. \c\cOn 20 July, the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero was seized in a raid by IRGC forces. Four small boats and a helicopter stopped the ship and Iranian commandos rappelled on board from the helicopter. The ship was taken to Bandar Abbas and its crew of 23 detained on board. On 4 September, Iran decided to free only seven crew members of the detained British tanker. A second British-owned and Liberian-flagged ship was also seized but later allowed to continue its journey. In a letter to the UN, Iran said the Stena Impero had collided with and damaged an Iranian vessel, and ignored warnings by Iranian authorities. \c\cThe ship's seizure sparked a diplomatic crisis between the United Kingdom and Iran. The British government condemned the seizure of the ship and demanded its release, warning of "serious consequences". Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi visited Iran to negotiate the release of Stena Impero at the request of the British government. Iran confirmed that it seized the ship as retaliation over the British seizure of Grace 1 in Gibraltar and hinted that it would be willing to release Stena Impero in exchange for the release of Grace 1. \c\cOn 31 July, the United States sanctioned the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, complicating the chances of a diplomatic resolution of the crisis. \c\cOn 4 August 2019, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized an Iraqi tanker for allegedly smuggling oil to other Arab countries. The seven crew members on board were detained, further heightening tensions in the Persian Gulf.[citation needed] Three days later, Britain joined the U.S.-led International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC)—then known as the "Sentinel Program"—to protect oil tankers in the gulf and surrounding seas. \c\cOn 15 August, Gibraltar released Grace 1 after receiving assurances the oil would not be sold to an EU-sanctioned entity, and after rejecting a request from the United States Department of Justice to allow them to seize the ship. The Iranian government later said it had issued no assurances that the oil would not be delivered to Syria and reasserted its intention to continue supplying oil to the Arab nation. On 16 August, the Department of Justice issued a warrant in Washington, D.C. to seize Grace 1, the cargo of oil, and $995,000 on the grounds that the profit from the ship's voyage was intended to enrich the IRGC, which the U.S. had previously designated a terrorist organization. On 18 August, Gibraltar announced that its Justice Ministry had rejected the U.S. warrant, as U.S. sanctions against Iran did not apply in the European Union, and the ship, renamed Adrian Darya 1 and registered under the Iranian flag, was expected to sail imminently from Gibraltar. \c\cAfter releasing the ship, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the tanker and its captain and inputted them in the blacklist. Some days later, Brian Hook, the U.S. Special Representative for Iran, sent emails to the Indian captain of the ship and offered some million dollars in U.S. cash to steer the Adrian Darya 1 to a country where it could be seized by U.S. forces; but he rejected these offers. \c\cOn 3 September, Iran announced that the oil tanker Adrian Darya 1 had delivered its cargo, defying U.S. threats. Satellite imagery had shown the tanker near Syria. On 9 September, Britain's foreign minister accused Iran of selling the oil that was carried in Adrian Darya 1 to Syria. Iran said the oil had been sold to a private company which is not an EU-sanctioned entity, so its assurance to Gibraltar had not been breached. \c\cOn 14 September, the 2019 Abqaiq–Khurais attack took place—a coordinated cruise missile and drone attack that targeted the state-owned Saudi Aramco oil processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais in eastern Saudi Arabia. The Houthi movement in Yemen claimed responsibility, tying it to events surrounding the Saudi Arabian intervention in the Yemeni Civil War. However, claims made by some U.S. officials that the attacks originated in Iran, despite Iran's denial, further escalated the current gulf crisis. \c\cOn 16 September, the IRGC seized another vessel near Iran's Greater Tunb island in the Persian Gulf. It was reported that the vessel was allegedly smuggling 250,000 litres of diesel fuel to the UAE. \c\cOn 23 September, the Iranian president criticized the IMSC, the new U.S.-led maritime coalition set to patrol the region's waterways, and asked the western powers to leave the security of the Persian Gulf to them. \c\cOn 27 September, the British oil tanker Stena Impero departed from Iranian waters after around two months in Iranian detention. The remainder of the ship's 23 crew members who were detained in Iran were released as well, with seven crew members already released on 4 September. On 28 September, Stena Impero, which was also able to transmit signals, docked at Port Rashid, Dubai. The same day, HMS Duncan returned to her homeport, Portsmouth naval base. \c\cOn 7 November 2019, International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) launched official operations in Bahrain to protect the shipping lanes near the troubled Iranian territorial waters. The coalition opened its command center in the kingdom, to ward off the perceived threat to the global oil supply amid the crisis. \c\cIn early December, the Pentagon considered sending reinforcements to the Middle East to deal with escalating tensions due to attacks against international shipping through the Persian Gulf, a missile strike against a Saudi oil facility, violent crackdown of protests in Iran, and heightened Iranian activities in the region. The number of people dead in Iranian demonstrations remained disputed, though Iran had not released any official estimates. U.S. special representative for Iran Brian Hook announced that his country was offering $15 million for information concerning the whereabouts of Abdulreza Shahlai, a senior Iranian commander accused of orchestrating numerous attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and a foiled attempt to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. \c\cOn 27 December, Iran, Russia, and China began a four-day naval exercise in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman. The exercise was launched from Chabahar Port near Pakistan, and included the Chinese Type 051 destroyer Xining. The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed it had deployed ships from the Baltic Fleet in its official newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda. According to Iranian government and military officials over its state news channel Press TV, the exercise was a response to U.S.–Saudi regional maneuvers and was meant to demonstrate that Iran was not isolated despite U.S. sanctions. In contrast, the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, Senior Colonel Wu Qian, claimed the exercise was a "normal military exchange" unconnected to the international tensions. \c\cAlso on 27 December, K-1 Air Base in Iraq's Kirkuk Governorate was attacked with Katyusha rockets, injuring several Iraqi Security Forces personnel, four U.S. soldiers, and killing a U.S. civilian military contractor. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the attacks, blaming Iranian-backed Shi\'ite Muslim militias. On 29 December, U.S. airstrikes targeted Kata\'ib Hizbollah facilities in Iraq and Syria killing 25 militants and injuring at least 55 others. The Department of Defense said the operation was in retaliation for repeated attacks on Iraqi military bases hosting Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) coalition forces, particularly the K-1 Air Base attack. About 5,000 U.S. troops were present in Iraq to deal with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant remnants and to assist the Iraqi military. Kata\'ib Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attacks. \c\cOn 31 December, Iran-backed militiamen under the Popular Mobilization Forces attacked the outer perimeter of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, prompting American diplomats to evacuate to safe rooms. The militiamen later withdrew. An additional 100 U.S. Marines were sent to reinforce the embassy. \c\cA major flashpoint in the crisis occurred on 3 January 2020, when President Donald Trump approved the targeted killing of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. Iraqi paramilitary leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and other IRGC and Iraqi paramilitary personnel were also killed in the drone attack. Shortly after the attack, the U.S. deployed an additional 3,000 ground troops to the Middle East, in addition to 14,000 already stationed there since May the previous year. President Trump defended the move, claiming in an interview with The Ingraham Angle on the Fox News Channel that General Soleimani was planning further attacks against four U.S. Embassies across the Middle East. This was later challenged by U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper in interviews on Face the Nation on CBS and State of the Union on CNN, who claimed that President Trump was not embellishing that there was an Iranian threat but that he had seen no evidence that U.S. embassies were to be targeted. As the funeral procession for Soleimani and al-Muhandis was ongoing in Baghdad, several rockets hit near the U.S. embassy and the Balad Air Base without any casualties. \c\cAmid international fears of a direct confrontation between the two nations, Trump warned Iran on 4 January against attacking U.S. assets or any Americans in the region. He threatened that in the event of an Iranian attack, the U.S. would target 52 Iranian sites, including cultural sites, which represented the 52 hostages taken by Iran in 1979, and would strike "very fast and very hard". The White House officially notified the U.S. Congress about the killing of Qassem Soleimani, in accordance with the 1973 War Powers Resolution, a day after the fact. Meanwhile, thousands of people in 70 cities across the U.S. participated in antiwar demonstrations against a new conflict in the Middle East. On the same day, the UK sent two warships, HMS Kent and HMS Defender, to the Persian Gulf to protect their ships and citizens. The Royal Navy was deployed to accompany British-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz. \c\cOn 5 January, Iran announced that it would not continue to abide by the limitations mentioned in the 2015 nuclear deal. An Iranian government statement on state television said "If the sanctions are lifted ... the Islamic Republic is ready to return to its obligations." Iran also demanded the Iraqi parliament to get rid of the American presence in their country. The Iraqi parliament passed a resolution to expel all foreign, particularly U.S., troops from Iraqi territory through a vote boycotted by Sunni and Kurdish representatives. The media initially reported that the U.S. would comply with the resolution after a draft letter from Brigadier General William H. Seely III addressed to the Iraqi Defense Ministry emerged claiming as such, but Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark A. Milley and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper soon clarified that the letter had been sent in error and the U.S. Armed Forces would not withdraw from Iraq. In response to the Iraqi parliament situation, Trump threatened to impose sanctions on Iraq "like they\'ve never seen before". On 10 January, Acting Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi placed a telephone call to Secretary of State Pompeo demanding that the U.S. send a delegation "to prepare a mechanism to carry out the parliament's resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq". Pompeo rejected Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi's requests. Shortly afterwards Iraq's highest-ranking Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, condemned the U.S.–Iran crisis. \c\cIn response to Iran's violations of the 2015 nuclear deal, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany threatened to activate the deal's dispute mechanism reenacting European Union and United Nations sanctions on Iran, a move supported by the U.S. State Department. In response, the Iranian Foreign Ministry threatened a "serious and strong response", and President Rouhani made a televised Cabinet address on Iranian state television directly threatening European troops while blaming U.S. escalation for the crisis. Soon afterwards, Rouhani claimed the country was enriching uranium at a higher rate per day than before the ratification of the deal, though experts questioned the logistical reality of that claim. \c\cMeanwhile, the legality of the Baghdad Airport strike was brought into question in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. Congress was not consulted before the attack and some congress members sought to restrict the president's ability to attack Iran. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the strike, and declared that Congress needed to be consulted in advance for any such military actions. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would introduce a resolution to limit Trump's ability to take actions against Iran. On 10 January, the House ratified the resolution by a vote of 224–194. The vote was mostly conducted among party lines, with eight Democrats opposing the resolution and three Republicans favoring it. Following the killing of Soleimani, a classified intelligence briefing to the U.S. Senate by CIA Director Gina Haspel was heavily scrutinized by many congressmembers and caused many legislators to question the Trump administration's rationale for the attacks. Shortly afterwards the U.S. State Department cancelled four further briefings on the crisis to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee without rescheduling them. Representative Eliot Engel, the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, invited Mike Pompeo to a 29 January hearing to testify on the crisis and threatened to issue a subpoena against him. \c\cOn 8 January 2020, Iraq's Al Asad Airbase, which hosted U.S.-led coalition troops, was attacked with ballistic missiles as a part of Iran's "Operation Martyr Soleimani", named for general Qasem Soleimani. It was reported that the airbase in Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan was attacked as well. During the attack, the IRGC declared that "fierce revenge by the Revolutionary Guards had begun", indicating it was the official response to the killing of Soleimani. Although among the facilities struck were troop sleeping quarters, some analysts suggested the strike was deliberately designed to avoid causing any fatalities to dissuade an American response. While the U.S. initially assessed that none of its service members were injured or killed, the U.S. Department of Defense ultimately said that 110 service members had been diagnosed and treated for traumatic brain injuries from the attack. \c\cDuring his White House address hours after the attack, Trump ruled out a direct military response, urged rapprochement with Iran, demanded NATO be more involved in regional affairs, and demanded a new Iran nuclear deal be arranged. Trump, however, also announced new sanctions on Iran and affirmed his position that Iran could not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. \c\cOn 9 January, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council announcing that the United States was willing to negotiate with Iran to prevent further escalation. Ayatollah Khamenei rejected the possibility of talks at any level between U.S. and Iranian officials unless the United States returned to the JCPOA; Iranian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Majid Takht-Ravanchi likewise rejected the option. Both ambassadors justified their countries\' military actions under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. On 14 January, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson encouraged the negotiation of a new nuclear deal between the Trump administration and the Iranian government, which President Trump expressed agreement with. \c\cOn 10 January, the Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions targeting Iran's metals industry and eight senior officials who were involved in the prior missile attacks. According to U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, the sanctions would affect "billions" in revenue. The U.S. also warned Iraq that it would freeze its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York if it continued to urge the withdrawal of American troops, which would prevent the Iraqi government from accessing oil revenues, damage the Iraqi economy, and devalue the Iraqi dinar. \c\cOn 15 January, the United States and Iraq resumed joint military operations against the Islamic State after a ten-day suspension following the drone strike on Soleimani. \c\cHours after the ballistic missile attacks, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crashed just after taking off from Tehran International Airport, killing all 176 passengers and crew, including 82 Iranian and 63 Canadian citizens. An investigation was launched to decipher the reason for the crash. On 9 January, U.S. officials said they believe the aircraft had been shot down in error by an Iranian Tor missile, based on evidence from reconnaissance satellite imagery and radar data. Iranian officials initially denied the allegations but, on 11 January, admitted to accidentally shooting down the plane. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged deescalation and claimed that the United States\' escalation of the conflict was partially to blame for the accident, saying "If there was no escalation recently in the region, those Canadians would be right now home with their families. This is something that happens when you have conflict and the war. Innocents bear the brunt of it." The incident slightly worsened Canada–United States relations. The airline shoot-down also reignited anti-government protests within Iran that had previously become dormant during the massive public outcry against the death of Soleimani. Foreign ministers from the countries who lost citizens in the crash—Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan, and the United Kingdom—met at the Canadian High Commission in London and demanded that Iran provide compensation for families of the victims. \c\cOn 12 January, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah called for Iran's allies in the Axis of Resistance—including Iran, the Syrian Arab Republic, Hezbollah, the Popular Mobilization Forces, and the Houthi movement in Yemen—to intensify its military campaigns against the U.S. to expel U.S. forces from the Middle East. During a state visit by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar to Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei called for regional cooperation against the U.S. However, following discussions between Sheikh Tamim and President Rouhani, Tamim concluded that de-escalation and dialogue were the only means to resolve the regional crises. In response to the increased tensions, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and many U.S. states released advisories warning of Iranian cyberattacks, while the Texas Department of Information Resources said Iranian cyberattacks had reached a rate of 10,000 per minute. \c\cOn 17 January, Ayatollah Khamenei personally led Friday prayers in Tehran for the first time since February 2012, speaking at the Imam Khomeini Grand Mosque. During his televised sermon, Khamenei lamented the shootdown of the Ukrainian airliner, sought to present the image that the country was unified despite protests and the international crisis, and lashed out at the UK, France, and Germany, referring to them as "servants" of the "villainous" United States. Khamenei denounced the Trump administration as "clowns" and insisted that the "real punishment" for General Soleimani's assassination would be forcing American forces out of the Middle East. In response Trump, who was vacationing at Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, at the time, made posts on Twitter urging Iranian leadership to stop "killing" Iranian protesters and that it "should abandon terror and Make Iran Great Again!" One of the posts was written in both English and Persian. On the same day, the Asian Football Confederation banned Iran from hosting international football matches. On 18 January, the U.S. sanctioned Brigadier General Hassan Shahvarpour, an IRGC commander in Khuzestan Province, after security personnel fired into protesters without warning during anti-government demonstrations in Mahshahr County. \c\cOn 26 January, three rockets were fired on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, wounding at least one staff member present at the cafeteria at dinner time, with the nationality of the wounded still undisclosed, other sources reported three wounded. \c\cOn 9 February, during routine maritime patrols, U.S. forces aboard the USS Normandy (CG-60) interdicted and seized a cache of Iranian-made weapons aboard a dhow in the Arabian Sea that was purportedly en route to supply Houthi rebels in Yemen. According to the U.S., the shipment consisted of 358 weapons components, including 150 Dehlavieh anti-tank missiles, three Iranian-made SAMs, thermal imaging weapon scopes, and other components for manned and unmanned aerial and surface vessels, such as bomb boats and weaponized drones. \c\cOn 10 February, the Pentagon confirmed that more than a hundred U.S. service members were injured from the 8 January IRGC ballistic missile attacks, with 109 personnel diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. \c\cOn 13 February, the U.S. Senate voted 55–45 to constrain Trump's ability to wage war on Iran without congressional approval. The bipartisan vote for the Iran War Powers Resolution included eight Republican senators. Trump threatened to veto the resolution. On the same day, a rocket hit an Iraqi base in Kirkuk that housed U.S. forces. No casualties were reported. \c\cOn 11 March, Qasem Soleimani's birthday, 15 Katyusha rockets struck Camp Taji, Iraq, killing two U.S. soldiers and one British soldier from the Royal Army Medical Corps. The attack left 12 other American soldiers, contractors and OIR coalition personnel (including a Polish soldier) injured, five critically. On 13 March after midnight, after a previous retaliatory operation, the U.S. launched air raids against Kata\'ib Hezbollah facilities in Karbala and the Babylon area near the Karbala International Airport; the strikes reportedly killed at least three Iraqi soldiers, two policemen and one civilian. 11 Iraqi soldiers were wounded as well as five Popular Mobilization Forces fighters. \c\cOn 14 March, before 11:00 AM, another rocket attack struck Camp Taji; more than 24 107mm caliber rockets struck the coalition compound and the Iraqi Air defenses installation there, injuring three coalition soldiers and two Iraqi soldiers. Iraqi forces subsequently found seven Katyusha rocket launchers with 25 rockets armed but not launched nearby. \c\cOn 16 March, the U.S. announced it would pull out from three of its eight bases on Iraq, amid continued tensions with the Iraqi government and Iran. In the border crossing of al-Qaim, the U.S. handed over equipment to the Iraqi security forces to ensure border security with Syria, a significant move that effectively ended any significant U.S. presence along the Iraqi side of the border. The other two military bases later transferred to the Iraqis were the Qayyarah Airfield and the K-1 Air Base. CJTF-OIR said the base transfers and repositioning of forces were pre-planned in coordination with the Iraqi government in response to progress in the ongoing operation against ISIL and unrelated to the recent base attacks or the COVID-19 viral pandemic situation in the country. The coalition added it would relocate and consolidate personnel and equipment from several Iraqi bases throughout 2020. \c\cOn 17 March, two rockets struck the Besmaya Range Complex, south of Baghdad, where Spanish troops were stationed; no casualties were reported. \c\cThe gradual reduction of NATO and coalition presence in Iraq continued on 24 March when the Czech Republic withdrew troops citing security threats, the global COVID-19 pandemic, and a planned mission restructuring. 30 Czech soldiers participating in Operation Inherent Resolve and the NATO Training Mission in Iraq returned to Prague. \c\cOn 25 March, France announced it would withdraw its forces from training duties in Iraq, mostly trainers to local armed forces, largely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Iraq's military halted all training in early March to minimize the risk of the illness spreading among its forces, including from the OIR coalition. \c\cOn 3 April, the Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed forces Mohammad Bagheri said, "Iran will respond severely if the United States does anything to undermine security of Iran". \c\cOn 7 April, in Iraq, the coalition withdrew from the Abu Ghraib operating base, the al-Sqoor base inside Nineveh Operations Command, and the Al-Taqaddum Air Base, handing control to the Iraqi security forces. However, amidst the force consolidation, by 13 April the U.S. had also installed and activated Patriot air defense systems, an Army C-RAM system, and an AN/TWQ-1 Avenger at Al Asad Airbase and the base at Erbil (the two bases attacked by Iran in January), and at Camp Taji, after gradually moving the systems piece-by-piece into Iraq since January. CENTCOM commander Gen. Frank McKenzie said the Patriots and other systems were taken from another location where they were also needed, without saying where. U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley also added that hundreds of troops from the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, which deployed to Iraq in January as an Immediate Response Force following the embassy attack, would remain until "... the situation with the Shia militia groups and Iran ... 100 percent settled down". \c\cOn 14 April, an oil tanker named SC Taipei sailing under the flag of Hong Kong was seized and released the same day by armed men while anchored 3 nm off Iran's Ras Al Kuh coast. \c\cGulf tensions remained high in mid-April between Iranian and U.S. vessels. On 15 April, during U.S. Army AH-64E Apache deck landing qualifications with the Navy in the northern Persian Gulf, 11 NEDSA speed boats began circling six U.S. vessels partaking in the exercise, including coming within 10 yards of the U.S. Coast Guard's Island-class cutter Maui (WPB-1304) and within 50 yards of the USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB-3). According to the U.S. Navy, "The IRGCN vessels repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of the U.S. vessels at extremely close range and high speeds ... the U.S. crews issued multiple warnings via bridge-to-bridge radio, five short blasts from the ships\' horns and long range acoustic noise maker devices, but received no response." The incident lasted almost an hour, until the Iranian vessels departed, and occurred about two weeks after the U.S. moved a carrier strike group out of the region. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group had departed the Middle East earlier in the month after operating in the region with the Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group, a rare occurrence for the Navy which has not had multiple strike groups in the region for years. On 19 April, the IRGC acknowledged that an incident took place, but dismissed the U.S. version of events. \c\cOn 22 April, in response to the 15 April incident, U.S. president Trump tweeted that he instructed the U.S. Navy to "shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats" if they harassed U.S. ships. Senior Pentagon officials said the tweet reflected a lawful order that would be implemented, though it did not mark a change in the rules of engagement. \c\cPresident Trump vetoed a Senate resolution on 6 May that would have required him to seek congressional authorization before taking military action against Iran. \c\cOn 7 May, the United States removed four Patriot missile batteries, two jet fighter squadrons and dozens of military personnel from Saudi Arabia while considering a reduction in the U.S. Navy presence in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. decision may have been related to the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war as it affected the U.S. oil prices. \c\cOn 10 May, the Iranian frigate Jamaran accidentally launched a Noor anti-ship missile at its support vessel, the Konarak, while the latter was deploying practice targets for a naval exercise. It was later determined that 19 sailors were killed and 15 injured. Some observers concluded that the Iranian friendly fire incident typified the ongoing instability in the Persian Gulf. Fabian Hinz of the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies, an expert on Iran's military, said the incident "... really showed that the situation with Iran is still dangerous because accidents and miscalculations can happen". \c\cOn 12 June, the United Nations concluded that the cruise missiles that struck the Saudi Aramco oil complex in September 2019 likely came from Iran. \c\cMeanwhile, on 19 June, the board of the UN's atomic watchdog agency adopted a resolution calling for Iran to provide inspectors access to sites where the country is thought to have stored or used undeclared nuclear material. \c\cOn 24 June, the U.S. imposed sanctions on five Iranian tanker captains for their links to the export of Iranian gasoline and gasoline components to Venezuela. \c\cOn 29 June, Iran issued an arrest warrant for U.S. president Donald Trump and 35 other individuals on "murder and terrorism charges" for the January drone strike on General Qasem Soleimani and requested international assistance in detaining him. Responding to Iran's request to issue a red notice, Interpol issued a statement that it could not comply as its charter prohibits "intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character." U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook dismissed the warrant as "a propaganda stunt that no one takes seriously and makes the Iranians look foolish." Analysts and commentators identified the issuance of the warrant as symbolic rather than a genuine attempt to arrest Trump. \c\cAlso on 29 June, a report by Al Arabiya released photo evidence of a wooden dhow carrying hundreds of reportedly Iranian weapons and other material bearing Persian language that was intercepted on 17 April. The dhow was found off the coast of Mocha, Yemen. \c\cSpecial representative Brian Hook visited Israel and Saudi Arabia and stated "Israel and the U.S. 'see eye to eye\' on the need to extend the UN conventional arms embargo [against Iran], warning that its expiration would allow it to export more arms to its regional proxies." On 30 June, Chinese ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun said during a virtual UN Security Council meeting the Trump administration could not initiate a Security Council mechanism to nullify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal by re-invoking the arms embargo, saying "Having quit the JCPOA, the U.S. is no longer a participant and has no right to trigger the snapback" of sanctions. Notably, German ambassador Christoph Heusgen concurred with the Chinese stance, though echoed the U.S. concern about "the expiration of these limitations" on Iran's ability to purchase weapons. \c\cOn 1 July, a fire and explosion hit a centrifuge production plant at a nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran. No deaths or injuries were reported. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz denied Israeli involvement, saying "Not every incident that transpires in Iran necessarily has something to do with us."\c\c"All those systems are complex, they have very high safety constraints and I\'m not sure they always know how to maintain them," Gantz told Israel Radio. \c\cOn 6 July, NEDSA commander Admiral Alireza Tangsiri claimed Iran had built offshore missile facilities and underground speedboat and "missile cities" along its southern coast. \c\cAlso on 6 July, the Mossad spy agency reportedly said it recently foiled planned or attempted Iranian attacks on Israeli diplomatic missions in Europe and elsewhere. \c\cOn 7 July, the United Nations Human Rights Council, led by special rapporteur Agnès Callamard, concluded that the killing of General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020 by U.S. forces was "unlawful". Callamard said that based on U.S. evidence, the killing was "arbitrary" and "violated the UN charter." "No evidence has been provided that General Soleimani specifically was planning an imminent attack against U.S. interests, particularly in Iraq, for which immediate action was necessary and would have been justified," Callamard wrote. On 21 July, Ayatollah Khamenei threatened that Iran would eventually conduct a reciprocal strike against the U.S. as further vengeance for the killing of Soleimani. \c\cOn 8 July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hinted at Iranian-links in the 6 July assassination of prominent Iraqi counter-terrorism expert Hisham al-Hashimi, highlighting threats made against him by Iranian-linked groups. \c\cOn 16 July, CNN reported the U.S. had "several" intelligence indications that Iran had put portions of its air defense system on "high alert" in recent days, following unexplained explosions at key facilities tied to the country's military and nuclear programs. On 18 July, according to Iranian media, a large explosion was heard in Ahvaz; further reports linked the explosion to an oil pipeline, though this was not officially confirmed. \c\cOn 24 July, two U.S. F-15 fighter jets briefly intercepted a Mahan Air passenger aircraft flying near a U.S. coalition garrison in Syria while en route from Tehran to Beirut. According to Iranian media and government officials, the intercepting F-15 made "provocative" and "dangerous" maneuvers, causing the airliner's pilot to abruptly lower altitude to avoid collision, injuring several passengers on board, with at least two taken to the hospital upon emergency landing. According to the U.S., however, the F-15s followed proper international procedure and were conducting a standard visual inspection of the airliner after it appeared "to have deviated from" an established commercial air corridor. The intercepting F-15 flew within 1,000-1,500 meters of the aircraft and then departed after identification, a U.S. official added. Iran demanded an international investigation in response to the incident and foreign minister Javad Zarif condemned the intercept and the American "occupation" in Syria as "lawlessness upon lawlessness". \c\cOn 26 July, satellite imagery revealed the IRGC Navy (IRGCN) had towed a replica U.S. Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, first revealed in 2014, from a naval base in Bandar Abbas to the Strait of Hormuz a day prior in preparation for annual live-fire drills similar to the 2015 Great Prophet IX exercise. Iranian officials and state media had yet to publicly acknowledge the development. The actual USS Nimitz entered the region the week prior to replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Arabian Sea after the latter's seven-month deployment. A spokeswoman for the United States Fifth Fleet, headquartered in Bahrain, commented that the fleet remained vigilant and questioned the "... tactical value they would hope to gain by using such a mock-up in a training or exercise scenario." U.S. special representative Brian Hook demanded Iran "spend more time on diplomacy and less time on military stunts". On 28 July, the IRGCN released footage of the drills, dubbed Great Prophet 14 (Great Prophet XIV), which included the mock carrier being assailed by commandos and a range of weaponry including limpet mines, anti-ship cruise missiles, truck-launched ballistic missiles, fast-attack speedboats, glide bombs, and, notably, Shahed 181 and 191 drones reportedly reverse engineered from the American RQ-170 drone captured by Iran in 2011. Iranian media also claimed the exercise was observed by its Nour military satellite launched in April 2020. \c\cOn 31 July, Pléiades commercial satellite imagery revealed Iran's mock carrier had inadvertently capsized while being towed on its way back to port in Bandar Abbas, listing at about 90 degrees with the starboard side facing upwards and "nearly half of the flight deck submerged" in shallow water just outside the harbor entrance, posing a navigation hazard near the main approach channel. Though regional U.S. forces detected the launch of ballistic missiles during Great Prophet XIV, according to Forbes, the satellite imagery did not appear to show extensive ballistic missile damage and, in fact, revealed less overall damage to the vessel than in Great Prophet IX, leaving "the impression that the IRGCN wanted to keep the mock carrier in better condition so it could be reused more easily in future exercises."\c\cOn 2 August, the Iranian foreign ministry announced they would put a sanction on Richard Goldberg. citing Law of "confrontation with human-rights violations and USA adventuresome and terrorist measures in the region". \c\cOn 6 August, China confirmed its support for United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 and affirmed it would veto any council proposal to extend the international Iran nuclear arms embargo, stopping a U.S.-led effort to do so. On 9 August, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) asked the UN to extend the arms embargo on Iran while, on 13 August, Saudi ambassador to the UN Abdul Aziz al-Wasel called for an embargo extension, arguing that Iran "smuggles weapons to militias to disturb the peace in the Middle East". On 15 August, the UNSC voted to deny extending the international arms embargo on Iran. Of the 15-member body, 11 members abstained while Russia and China opposed extension. \c\cLate on 12 August, the U.S. accused Iran of briefly seizing Liberian-flagged oil tanker MT Wila in the Gulf of Oman, with U.S. Central Command releasing video of apparent armed Iranian naval forces fast-roping from a Sea King helicopter and boarding the vessel. According to Coalition Task Force Sentinel, the operational arm of the IMSC maritime coalition, along with statements from an unidentified U.S. official, the seizure took place in international waters off the coast of the UAE's Khor Fakkan and the tanker was held for five hours before being released. The Wila did not make any distress calls before, during, or after the seizure and it was not immediately clear what cargo it carried or why it was seized. By 13 August, Iranian officials and state media had not publicly acknowledged the incident. \c\cOn 13 August, the U.S. seized Iranian fuel cargo for the first time. \c\cOn 13 August, UAE and Israel establish full bilateral diplomatic relations. \c\cOn 14 August, Khamenei again threatened retaliation against the U.S. for the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani. Trump told reporters on 14 August, "We\'ll be doing a snapback (trigger for sanctions)" On 17 August, CNN reported US intelligence agencies assessed that Iran offered bounties to Taliban fighters for targeting American and coalition troops in Afghanistan, identifying payments linked to at least six attacks carried out by the militant group during 2019. On 20 August, Iran summoned UAE chargé d\'affaires in Tehran and seized one UAE ship in their territorial waters after UAE coastguard killed two Iranian fishermen crossing into their territory northwest of Sir Bu Nu\'Ayr island. On 21 August, U.S. imposed sanctions on two UAE-based companies for aiding Iran's Mahan Air stating they assist Syrian and Venezuelan regimes. On 22 August, US State Department spokesman Morgan Ortagus called Iran's nuclear deal "just a failed political document" that has not been approved by any member state in parliament. On 26 August The UNSC blocked a bid by the US to trigger the snapback of all sanctions on Iran lifted by JCPOA.Indonesian representative said many of the 15 member states contested the move because the US withdrew from the accord two years ago. \c\cOn 1 September Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said during a speech that the United Arab Emirates had betrayed the Muslim world and the Palestinians in reaching a deal toward normalizing relations with Israel. \c\cOn 14 September top advisor to supreme leader Ali Akbar Velayati threatened Bahrain and Israel for making peace. \c\cOn 6 September the vice president for Iran's Supreme National Defense University, General Alireza Afshar, stated that the United States, via Oman, had confidentially threatened missile strikes after Iran attacked Al Asad Airbase in Iraq. \c\cOn 9 September Bahrain established full diplomatic ties with Israel. \c\cOn 11 September the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman responded to Microsoft's allegation that Iranians were trying to influence the US elections through spreading disinformation, stating "It does not matter who goes into the White House."\c\cOn 12 September the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps released a statement that "strongly condemned" the normalization of relations between Bahrain and Israel, referring to it as a "conspiracy organized by the White House" and threatened Bahrain with "harsh revenge."\c\cOn 14 September Politico cited US intelligence community report "The Iranian government is considering an assassination attempt against the American ambassador to South Africa Lana Marks."\c\cAt around 11:00 PM on 14 September, Trump threatened Iran on Twitter, saying "Any attack by Iran, in any form, against the United States will be met with an attack on Iran that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!"\c\cFollowing the threat, Iran reportedly warned against making a "strategic mistake", saying "the U.S. will witness Iran's decisive response". \c\cOn 16 September Elliott Abrams said "virtually all UN sanctions on Iran will come back into place this weekend at 8:00 PM EDT on Saturday, 19 September. The arms embargo will now be re-imposed indefinitely and other restrictions will return, including the ban on Iran engaging in enrichment and reprocessing-related activities, the prohibition on ballistic missile testing and development, and sanctions on the transfer of nuclear and missile-related technologies to Iran."\c\cThe Times of Israel cited US intelligence and government officials in New York Times that It said Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is hoping for a less antagonistic US administration come January, but believes a significant conflict between the countries will bolster Trump's odds of holding on to the presidency. \c\cBahraini authorities announced in September that in early 2020 they uncovered a militant attack plot after finding an explosive on the street believed to have been planted to target a "foreign delegation," the pro-government Bahraini newspaper Akhbar Al-Khaleej reported, citing the Interior Ministry accusing IRGC. \c\cand making 9 arrests. \c\cOn 23 September, NEDSA built a new navy base in Sirik, Iran for full access to Hormuz strait passing ships. \c\cOn 24 September, the US put sanctions on some Iranian judges and prisons and Shiraz court of Islamic revolution for the Death of Navid Afkari. \c\cThe Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) projects Iran's real GDP will collapse 12% while adding that the authorities’ belated response "will also fuel popular anger and a humanitarian crisis."\c\cOn 18 October, United Nations arms embargoes that barred Iran from purchasing and exporting military armaments expired, despite insistence by U.S. officials that they are still effective. \c\cOn 21 October, US Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced Iran & Russia have taken to influence public opinion related to the 2020 United States presidential election. \c\cOn 25 October, Rotax announced they will stop selling UAV engines to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. \c\cOn 30 October The Federal Bureau of Investigations and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an advisory warning of an Iranian Advanced Persistent Threat that targeted US voter registration data. \c\cOn 14 November it was reported Israeli agents in Tehran killed Al-Qaeda's second-in-command, Muhammad al-Masri, because of US intelligence on the anniversary of bombings of two US embassies in Africa. \c\cOn 16 November, The New York Times reported that President Trump inquired about military options to strike the primary Iranian nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz, but was dissuaded from pursuing the matter further by senior officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo, who warned it could trigger a regional conflict. \c\cOn 23 November, Israeli media reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mossad director Yossi Cohen, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Mike Pompeo held a secret meeting in Neom on 22 November to discuss the normalization of ties and Iran, but failed to reach an agreement on the former. \c\cOn the same day, Houthis claimed they attacked a big oil facility north of Jeddah and southeast of Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport with a Quds 2 cruise missile and damaged a distribution station. After a days, Aramco oil company confirmed the attack and added the hit took place at 3:50 a.m. and there is no injuries or casualties.

Several hours earlier a rocket had been shot down at Baghdad International Airport. \c\cOn 18 June, the Biden administration started to remove eight Patriot anti-missile batteries from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and Iraq, in addition to the THAAD anti-missile defense system from Saudi Arabia, and announced that most jet squadrons and hundreds of American troops would be withdrawn from the region. The changes came in light of both de-escalating tensions with Iran and the administration changing its focus on countering China. \c\cOn 27 June, President Biden directed airstrikes against Iranian backed militia forces in Iraq and Syria, leaving at least 4 pro-Iranian militia killed. Those groups mounted rocket and drone attacks against US bases in retaliation. \c\cIran denied IAEA access to Natanz nuclear facility.

The ship was operated by the London-based Zodiac Maritime, part of Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer's Zodiac Group. Two crew members, a UK and a Romanian nationals, were killed in the attack. The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations said that the attack took place on Thursday night and happened at a location just northeast of the Omani island of Masirah, nearly 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Oman's capital, Muscat. Israeli officials did not immediately acknowledge the attack, but Israel's Channel 13 quoted a senior Israeli official saying that the attack was "carried out by Iran with the help of a UAV." Later, the U.S. Navy 5th fleet said explosive experts believed a "drone strike" targeted the tanker. U.S., European, and Israeli officials blamed the attack on Iran, and the Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that Israel will respond to it. Iran's Arabic-speaking Al-Alam News Network quoted unnamed sources who said the attack was a response for the "latest Israeli airstrikes on Dabaa airport in Syria," which the Network said resulted in 2 unspecified fatalities, but the Iranian government formally denied involvement in the attack and said it will respond to any retaliation. \c\cOn August 3, four oil tankers called Queen Ematha, Golden Brilliant, Jag Pooja, and Abyss, which were sailing in the Gulf of Oman, announced around the same time that they were "not under command." Around the same time, the UK Maritime Trade Operations reported an incident off the coast of the United Arab Emirates which it described as a "potential hijack" of a tanker named Asphalt Princess, where a group of eight or nine armed individuals were believed to have boarded the vessel without authorisation and ordered the ship to sail to Iran. On August 4, the UK Maritime Trade Operations said that boarders have left the vessel and the incident was "complete". \c\cOn August 10, an oil tanker, Wisdom, which had been used to transfer oil from Iran to Syria, was hit by a mysterious explosion while being moored at the port of Latakia which left two people injured.

On 1 November 2021, a high-rise block of flats in Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, collapsed. It was in the process of being built. At least 36 people were killed. A rescue effort is ongoing and the state government is conducting an investigation. \c\cFourscore Homes, a United Kingdom-registered company financed and was undertaking (including having commissioned subcontractors for) the construction of a trio of highrise buildings at 44BCD (or 20) Gerrard Road, in the Ikoyi neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria, called the "360 Degrees Towers". The company is headed by an experienced Nigerian developer Femi Osibona. \c\cOne of the buildings was a 21-story luxury residential high-rise tower. In February 2020, consultancy firm Prowess Engineering Limited withdrew from the project over concerns regarding the integrity of that building. The Lagos State Building Control Agency had approved only 15 floors, but 21 had been built. \c\cOn 1 November 2021, at 2:45 p.m. UTC+01:00, one of the three "360 Degrees Towers", a 21-story building, collapsed. Thirty-six people have been confirmed dead, and many more are trapped in the rubble; an official estimate is that up to 40 workers were on site at the time. Osibona was near the building at the time of collapse. \c\cA rescue effort is being conducted by the National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos State (NEMA), and other responders. It is being supervised by the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development. According NEMA, the military is scheduled to "take over operations". \c\cAs of 2 November, nine people have been rescued. As of 3 November no new survivors have been found; governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said that the search is ongoing. \c\cGbolahan Oki, the general manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, announced on 2 November that the owner of the building has been arrested and would be prosecuted. The state government suspended the chief architect, and is conducting an investigation through an independent panel, which has been allotted 30 days to disclose findings.
On November 5, 2021 an oil tanker collided with a truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The collision resulted in an explosion that killed at least 99 and injured around 100. \c\cFreetown is a port city with a population of over 1 million people. It has faced several disasters in the past. In March, a major fire in one of the city's slums left 80 injured and more than 5000 displaced.In 2017, heavy rains triggered mudslides that killed over 1000 people. \c\cThe collision and subsequent explosion is believed to have happened at 22:00 GMT on November 5 in the Wellington suburb at a junction outside Choithram Supermarket. Fuel spilled before igniting and mayor Yvonne Aki Sawyerr stated on Facebook that people flocked to collect the fuel from the leaking vehicle. \c\cReports state that a bus full of people were "completely" burnt and nearby shops and markets caught on fire after fuel spilled over the streets. \c\cAt least 99 people were confirmed dead in the tragedy, and more than 100 injured. \c\cMohamed Lamrane Bah, director of the NMDA, stated that the injured had been transferred to hospitals and the bodies were collected. He added that rescue efforts at the scene had ended. Several people are in critical condition. According to a staff member of Connaught Hospital's intensive care unit, about 30 severally burned victims are not expected to survive. President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, offered condolences and promised support to the victims\' families.Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals.Journalist Omar Fofana reported that the hospital services have been stretched.
On November 5, 2021, a human crush occurred during the first night of the Astroworld Festival, a music event operated by rapper Travis Scott. Eight people died during the event with the cause of death still under investigation. A further twenty-three were hospitalized and more than 300 people were treated for injuries at the festival's field hospital. \c\cAstroworld Festival is an annual music festival run by American rapper Travis Scott, held in Houston, Texas. In 2019, three people were injured in a stampede at the Astroworld Festival. \c\cIn 2021, the festival had approximately 50,000 attendees. The Houston Fire Department had fifty-five in-service units present at the festival, including 367 police officers and 241 security officers. Earlier on November 5, hundreds of fans surged at the festival's perimeter in an attempt to get in, knocking over metal detectors. Scott's performance was live streamed on Apple Music. \c\cOn the first night of the Astroworld Festival, the appearance of Scott on the stage led people to push towards the stage en masse, leading to a crush. According to Houston Fire Chief Sam Peña, between 9:00 p.m. and 9:15 p.m., the crowd began "to compress toward the front of the stage". As people began to fall and get injured, additional panic ensued. Peña stated the most fatal events occurred after 9:30 p.m.  The show's paramedics were seen performing CPR on unconscious attendees. At 9:38 p.m., officials declared a "mass causality event" and 17 people were transferred to hospitals. Peña stated that medical personnel was "quickly overwhelmed" as the amount of injuries surged. \c\cScott, along with stage crew, paused during his 75-minute performance when he noticed attendees in distress near the stage. Music was halted for a few seconds when Scott noticed an ambulance in the crowd to ask what was happening. Two members of Scott's staff approached him on stage, though he shooed them away and resumed his performance. A concertgoer was filmed informing a cameraman that "people are dying", but another audience member told him that the crowd would take care of it. \c\cAt least eight people died, ranging from the ages of 16 to 23. The cause of death is still under investigation. \c\cTwenty-three others were evacuated to local hospitals, including eleven people found in a state of cardiac arrest. Drug overdose is being investigated as a potential cause of cardiac arrest. In all, more than 300 people were treated for injuries in a field hospital at the festival itself. \c\cAs a result, the second night on November 6 was cancelled. A reunification center was set up for families searching for relatives. On November 6, Texas governor Greg Abbott stated: "What happened at Astroworld Festival last night was tragic, and our hearts are with those who lost their lives and those who were injured in the terrifying crowd surge."\c\cScott stated he would support the incident's investigation and that he wants to help heal the Houston community. Kylie Jenner, Scott's girlfriend, was criticized for Instagram posts depicting the crowd, including one with an ambulance attempting to make its way through the crowd. Jenner and her sister, Kendall Jenner, were not injured during the event.

On 5 November 2021 a collision between a petrol fuel tanker and a lorry at a busy junction of Sierra Leone's capital and largest city Freetown resulted in an explosion and a fire that killed at least 101 people, and injured more than 100, overwhelming the city's medical services. \c\cFreetown is the capital and largest city of Sierra Leone, with a population of more than 1.2 million people. The accident happened at a busy intersection in the Wellington area, Freetown's main industrial district. The intersection where the accident happened is popularly known as "PMB", short for Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB), a defunct parastatal with its old factory buildings located adjacent the intersection. \c\cAt approximately 22:00 GMT on 5 November 2021, a fuel tanker carrying petrol attempted to make a turn outside Choithram Supermarket in the Freetown suburb of Wellington. A lorry reported to be carrying granite collided with the tanker at the junction creating a fuel leakage. The two drivers came out of their vehicles and warned community residents to stay off the scene, according to Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency. \c\cPetrol spilled from the tanker and locals, particularly the "Okada" (motorbike) taxi-riders, attempted to collect this in containers. An explosion led to a huge fireball that engulfed vehicles, people and passengers that were stuck in traffic created by the initial collision. \c\cThe mayor of Freetown, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, said that the damage was exacerbated by people who gathered at the lorry, scooped the leaking fuel in containers and placed them in close proximity to the crash scene. This created traffic chaos with many people, including passengers in cars and buses, very close to the scene of the accident. \c\cMany of the victims were trapped in vehicles, including a bus full of people which was intensely burnt, killing all inside. Nearby shops and markets caught fire after fuel spilled onto the streets. Footage broadcast by local media outlets showed charred bodies surrounding the tanker. At least 99 people were confirmed to have died in the disaster, and more than 100 others were injured. The death toll rose to 101 three days after the explosion. \c\cMohamed Lamrane Bah, the director of the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), stated that the injured had been transferred to hospitals and the bodies were collected. He added that rescue efforts at the scene had ended by 16:45 GMT 6 November. Several people are in critical condition. According to a staff member of Connaught Hospital's intensive care unit, about 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive. President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, offered condolences and promised support to the victims\' families. Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals. The journalist Omar Fofana reported that the hospital services have been stretched. On 8 November, the victims were buried in a mass ceremony. \c\cThe event has been described as first of its kind in the densely populated city of about 1.2 million and follows a number of similar high-casualty fuel tanker explosions across sub-Saharan Africa where fuel spilled was viewed as wasteful in communities where many struggled to afford petrol. Mass casualties from similar events have occurred in the 2018 Mbuba tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo that killed 50 and the 2019 Morogoro explosion in Tanzania that killed 85.
Israel's COVID-19 vaccination programme, officially named "Give a Shoulder" (Hebrew: לתת כתף), began on 19 December 2020, and has been praised for its speed, having given twenty percent of the Israeli population the first dose of the vaccines\' two dose regimen in the span of three weeks. \c\cAs of June 26, 2021, about 64% of eligible Israelis have received at least one dose (and a world-leading 60% with two doses), making Israel one of the populations with the highest vaccination rates in the world per capita. Coordinated vaccination drives by the country's health authorities, utilizing databases of personal information for Israeli patients, contributed to Israel's success in vaccinating a high proportion of its population in a short period of time, relative to the rest of the world. \c\cMany factors contributed to the quick distribution of vaccines in the state of Israel. Israel's population is younger on average than many other developed countries, with 12% of its population over the age of 65. (→ Demographics of Israel)\c\cIsrael is smaller in land area than many other developed nations. It has a comparatively small population of about 9.3 million people and a high population density (424/km2). \c\cIsrael's organized response in terms of attaining, storing and distributing vaccines was considered to be overall well coordinated. This is in part owed to the centralized nature of Israel's government system, which for example does not defer many health policy decisions to lower state-level bodies of government. The state purchased a substantial amount of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines relative to its population as early as December 2020. In May 2020, the state secured agreements with companies which were developing vaccines, such as Moderna. \c\cEarly into the programme, Israel provided Pfizer with medical information about its citizens as part of a deal for the country to receive a supply COVID-19 vaccines from the company. \c\cThe initial campaign for vaccinations focused on the elderly (people over the age of 60) and other patient groups with a high risk of severe illness in the case of infection, such as those with preexisting conditions, as well as employees of the healthcare sector. After eight weeks, nearly 85% of health workers at a hospital in Jerusalem (Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center) were vaccinated. \c\cIsrael started its campaign on 19 December 2020, with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu being the first person in the country to receive the vaccine, getting injected on live TV to encourage other Israelis to get vaccinated. In less than two weeks, over 10% of Israelis received their first dose. \c\cMass vaccination in Israel has produced evidence that the Pfizer vaccine works to stop transmission of the virus, including asymptomatic infections. The vaccination programme has also curbed deaths in the country. \c\cAs of early February 2021, at least 90% of Israelis over the age of 60 received at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and there was a 41% drop in confirmed infections in the country compared with the previous month. By late February, at least 4.8 million Israelis received at least one dose. This mass vaccination led to a drop in severe COVID-19 cases. Israel passed a law allowing government workers to identify and contact those who have not been vaccinated, in order to convince them to do so. \c\cTo access certain locations such as gyms, hotels, and theatres, immunized residents show a green pass (also known as a "green badge"), which was officially introduced by the Israeli Ministry of Health on February 21. The green pass indicates the holder is immunized against COVID-19, either by vaccination or previous infection. People who have received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine are eligible to receive this certificate of vaccination. It expires after six months. \c\cAs of March 2021, Israel has the highest vaccinated population per capita in the world. About 60% of residents in Israel received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine by March, and certain public places reopened access for those who were vaccinated. Only about 100,000 residents over the age of 50 remained unvaccinated. By March, at least 50% of the Israeli population had received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. \c\cThe perceived success of Israel's vaccination programme has been credited to the centralized systems its health maintenance organizations maintained, especially with regard to managing the personal health data of Israelis. They were able to coordinate national vaccination drives, contacting residents directly using a database of contact information such as phone numbers and emails. Every Israeli citizen must register with one of the country's four HMOs. \c\cOn 10 November 2021, the Israeli Government approved the use of COVID-19 vaccine shots for children between the ages of 5 and 11 years. Israeli epidemiologists and health authorities have identified vaccine hesitancy among parents as an obstacle to getting children vaccinated. \c\cData from the national campaign showed there to be a strong effect of waning immunity from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after 6 months. On 29 July 2021, Israel's Prime Minister announced that the country was rolling out a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to people over the age of 60, based on the data that suggested significant waning immunity from infection over time for those with two doses. The country expanded the availability to all Israelis over the age of 12, after five months since their second shot. On 29 August 2021, Israel's coronavirus czar announced that Israelis who had not received a booster shot within six months of their second dose would lose access to the country's green pass vaccine passport. \c\cIsraeli authorities faced problems with distributing their supply of COVID-19 vaccines early into vaccination drives. This included trouble with scheduling appointments, loosely interpreted eligibility early on which led to supply problems, and lack of sufficient distribution to less-populated villages and Arab-Israeli communities. \c\cDuring the first quarter of 2021, Israel had to address a moderate amount of vaccine hesitancy in its general population, and also address more intense pockets of vaccine hesitancy among young adults and religious/cultural minority groups. The challenges were addressed via a mix of messaging, incentives, extensions to the initial vaccine delivery system, and other measures. Many of the measures addressed the general population, while others were targeted at subgroups with below-average vaccination rates. Once the early adopters had been vaccinated, it took hard, creative work to increase population coverage from 40 to 60% and beyond. \c\cDistribution of vaccines to Palestinians has not been as thorough as to Israeli citizens. In early March, the supply of COVID-19 vaccines was not sufficient to cover all of its healthcare workers. Until March, when Israel began vaccinating Palestinian laborers with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the Palestinian Authority received only enough doses for about 6,000 people. Gaza has a population of about 2 million, by comparison. United Nations officials called for more support for vaccinating Palestinians, and praised Israel's assistance in this regard, while Amnesty International expressed concern that Israel had not done more for Palestinians with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some Israeli health officials urged the government to provide vaccinations to all Palestinians. \c\cAccording to Business Insider, Israeli citizens of any origin as well as Palestinian residents in East Jerusalem were eligible for the vaccine, with people older than 60, healthcare workers, and the "especially vulnerable" being prioritized. However, an estimated five million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza (which are not under Israeli control) were not eligible as their healthcare is under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority per the Oslo Accords. \c\cBy late March, Israel vaccinated more than 100,000 Palestinian laborers. In June 2021, Israel announced it would give over 1 million soon-to-expire Pfizer vaccines to the Palestinian Authority in exchange for a later reimbursement of a similar amount of vaccines which the Palestinian Authority expects to receive from Pfizer in the first quarter of 2022. In June 18, 100,000 of these doses had already been transferred to the West Bank's Palestinian Health Ministry. However, the Palestinian Authority soon pulled out of the exchange deal, saying the doses expired too fast. \c\cAs of March 2021, Haredi Jews and Arab-Israelis had a lower rate of vaccination, compared to other sections of the population in Israel. These demographics were also comparatively more likely to be hesitant or skeptical about taking the vaccine. Haredi Jews are about 12% of Israel's population. 
The COVID-19 pandemic in Israel also known as the coronavirus pandemic in Israel (Hebrew: מגפת הקורונה בישראל) is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in Israel was confirmed on 21 February 2020, when a female citizen tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 at the Sheba Medical Center after return from quarantine on the Diamond Princess ship in Japan. As a result, a 14-day home isolation rule was instituted for anyone who had visited South Korea or Japan, and a ban was placed on non-residents and non-citizens who were in South Korea for 14 days before their arrival. \c\cBeginning on 11 March 2020, Israel began enforcing social distancing and other rules to limit the spread of infection. Gatherings were first restricted to no more than 100 people, and on 15 March this figure was lowered to 10 people, with attendees advised to keep a distance of 2 m (6 ft 7 in) between one another.  On 19 March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a national state of emergency, saying that existing restrictions would henceforth be legally enforceable, and violators would be fined. Israelis were not allowed to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary.  Essential services—including food stores, pharmacies, and banks—would remain open.  Restrictions on movement were further tightened on 25 March and 1 April, with everyone instructed to cover their noses and mouths outdoors.  As coronavirus diagnoses spiked in the city of Bnei Brak, reaching nearly 1,000 infected people at the beginning of April, the cabinet voted to declare the city a "restricted zone", limiting entry and exit for a period of one week. Coinciding with the Passover Seder on the night of 8 April, lawmakers ordered a 3-day travel ban and mandated that Israelis stay within 100 m (330 ft) of their home on the night of the Seder. On 12 April, Haredi neighborhoods in Jerusalem were placed under closure. \c\cOn 20 March 2020, an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor in Jerusalem who suffered from previous illnesses was announced as the country's first casualty. The pandemic occurred during the 2019–2021 Israeli political crisis. All restrictions in Israel were removed throughout the spring of 2021, later reintroducing face mask requirements. Restrictions on non citizens entering the country remained. \c\cIsrael Shield, the country's national program to combat the pandemic, was established in July 2020. As of June 2021, it is led by Salman Zarka, a position known as the "COVID czar."\c\cOn 21 February, Israel confirmed the first case of COVID-19. A female Israeli citizen who had flown home from Japan after being quarantined on the Diamond Princess tested positive at Sheba Medical Center. On 23 February, a second former Diamond Princess passenger tested positive, and was admitted to a hospital for isolation. \c\cOn 27 February, a man, who had returned from Italy on 23 February, tested positive and was admitted to Sheba Medical Center. On 28 February, his wife also tested positive. On 1 March, a female soldier tested positive for the virus. She had been working at the toy store managed by the same man diagnosed on 27 February. On 3 March, three more cases were confirmed. Two contracted the virus at the same toy store: a middle school student who worked at the store, and a school deputy principal who shopped there. Following this, 1,150 students entered a two-week quarantine. One other person, who had returned from a trip to Italy on 29 February, also tested positive for the virus. \c\cThe government has set up a multi-lingual website with information and instructions regarding the pandemic. Among the languages: English, Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, Amharic, French, Spanish, Ukrainian, Romanian, Thai, Chinese, Tigrinya, Hindi, Filipino. The government also set up a dashboard where daily statistics can be viewed. \c\cOn 26 January 2020, Israel advised against non-essential travel to China. On 30 January, Israel suspended all flights from China. On 17 February, Israel extended the ban to include arrivals from Thailand, Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore. On 22 February, a flight from Seoul, South Korea, landed at Ben Gurion Airport. An ad hoc decision was made to allow only Israeli citizens to disembark the plane, and all non-Israeli citizens aboard returned to South Korea. Later, Israel barred the entry of non-residents or non-citizens of Israel who were in South Korea during the 14 days prior to their arrival in Israel. The same directive was applied to those arriving from Japan starting 23 February. On 26 February, Israel issued a travel warning to Italy, and urged cancelling of all travel abroad. By the third week in March, El Al, Israel's national air carrier, responded to a government request to send rescue flights to Peru, India, Australia, Brazil, and Costa Rica to bring home hundreds of Israelis who were stranded around the world due to the worldwide pandemic. On 22 March, 550 Israelis returned from India; a few days before about 1,100 Israeli travelers were repatriated from Peru. \c\cOn 21 February, Israel instituted a 14-day home isolation rule for anyone who had been in South Korea or Japan. A number of tourists tested positive after visiting Israel, including members of a group from South Korea, two people from Romania, a group of Greek pilgrims, and a woman from the U.S. State of New York. 200 Israeli students were quarantined after being exposed to a group of religious tourists from South Korea. An additional 1,400 Israelis were quarantined after having traveled abroad. On 9 March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a mandatory quarantine for all people entering Israel, requiring all entrants to quarantine themselves for 14 days upon entering the country. The order was effective immediately for all returning Israelis, and would apply beginning on 13 March for all foreign citizens, who must show that they have arranged for accommodation during their quarantine period. \c\cOn 2 March, the 2020 Israeli legislative election was held. Multiple secluded voting booths were established for 5,630 quarantined Israeli citizens who were eligible to vote. 4,073 citizens voted in the coronavirus-special voting booths. After the election, numerous Israelis were in quarantine. On 10 March, Israel began limiting gatherings to 2,000 people. A day later, on March 11, Israel further limited gatherings to 100 people. On 14 March, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced new regulations and stated the need to "adopt a new way of life". The Health Ministry posted new regulations, effective 15 March. These included banning gatherings of more than 10 people, and closure of all educational institutions, among them daycare centers, special education, youth movements, and after-school programs. The list of venues required to close included: malls, restaurants, hotel dining rooms, pubs, dance clubs, gyms, pools, beaches, water and amusement parks, zoos and petting zoos, bathhouses and ritual baths for men, beauty and massage salons, event and conference venues, public boats and cable cars, and heritage sites. Take-away restaurants, supermarkets, and pharmacies were to remain open. The pandemic forced many events to be cancelled. Notwithstanding the closure of wedding halls, weddings took place in private homes with the limitation of no more than 10 participants in each room; dancing could take place both indoors and in outdoor courtyards. Weddings were also held on rooftops and yeshiva courtyards. In one case, a Sephardi couple opted to hold their wedding ceremony in an Osher Ad supermarket, which was exempt from the 10-person rule. The Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock closed to prevent contamination of the holy sites. As a result of the government's directive for citizens to remain at home, there was an increase in calls to domestic violence hotlines, and women's shelters were close to full capacity, both due to new arrivals and to current residents who remained due to the pandemic. \c\cOn 9 March, after it was discovered that an employee at the Israeli embassy in Greece had contracted coronavirus and spread it to two family members, it was announced that the embassy was temporarily shutting down. On 12 March, Israel announced that all universities and schools would close until after the Passover (spring) break. After the break, schools remained closed and students learned online. On 3 May, grades one to three were allowed to resume school, with restrictions, and not in all cities. In addition, grades eleven and twelve were allowed to hold revisions for the upcoming Bagrut exams. On 15 March, Justice Minister Amir Ohana expanded his powers and announced that non-urgent court activity would be frozen. As a result, the corruption trial of Prime Minister Netanyahu was postponed from 17 March to 24 May. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel urged the Attorney General to stay the new regulations. On 16 March, the Bank of Israel ordered retail banks to close, but allowed special services to remain open for elderly people. On 22 March, both the open-air Carmel Market in Tel Aviv and the open-air Mahane Yehuda Market in Jerusalem were closed by police. Many supermarkets experienced a shortage of eggs caused by panic buying and fear of shutdown. \c\cAs late as 15 March, doctors complained that guidelines for testing were too restrictive. On 16 March, the Health Ministry approved a number of experimental treatments for patients suffering from COVID-19. On 18 March, the Defense Ministry took over purchasing of Corona-related gear. On the same day, the Israel Institute for Biological Research announced that they are working on a COVID-19 vaccine. On 18 March at 6 pm, Israelis across the country applauded from their balconies for two minutes in appreciation of medical workers and first responders battling coronavirus. On 29 March, Magen David Adom announced that it will collect blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients to treat those most severely affected with the infection. \c\cOn 15 March, the Israeli government proposed allowing the Israel Security Agency (ISA) to track the prior movements of people diagnosed with coronavirus through their mobile phones. The security service would not require a court order for its surveillance. The stated goal of the measure was to identify people with whom infected individuals came into contact in the two weeks prior to their diagnosis, and to dispatch text messages informing those people that they must enter the 14-day self-quarantine. The security measure was to be in place for only 30 days after approval by a Knesset subcommittee, and all records were to be deleted after that point. Critics branded the proposal an invasion of privacy and civil liberties. \c\cOn 17 March, at 1:30 AM, a Knesset committee approved the contact-tracing program, making Israel the only country in the world to use its internal security agency (Shin Bet) to track citizens\' geolocations. Within the first two days, the Ministry of Health text-messaged 400 individuals who had been in proximity to an infected person, and told them to enter a 14-day self-quarantine. On 19 March, the Supreme Court of Israel heard petitions to halt the contact-tracing program, submitted by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, and Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights, and issued an interim order. The same day, several hundred protesters converged on the Knesset to protest the phone surveillance and other restrictions on citizens\' movements, as well as the shutdown of the judicial and legislative branches of the government. Police arrested three protesters for violating the ban on gatherings over 10 people, and also blocked dozens of cars from entering Jerusalem and approaching the Knesset building. On 26 March, the ISA said contact tracing had led to over 500 Israelis being notified who were then diagnosed with coronavirus. On April 26, 2020, the Supreme Court issued its judgment on the contact-tracing petitions. In granting the petitions, the Court held that the Government's decision passed constitutional review under the exigent circumstances at the time it was made, but that further recourse to the Israel Security Agency for the purpose of contact tracing would require primary legislation in the form of a temporary order that would meet the requirements of the Limitations Clause of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. The Court further held that due to the fundamental importance of freedom of the press, ISA contact tracing of journalists who tested positive for the virus would require consent, and in the absence of consent, a journalist would undergo an individual epidemiological investigation, and would be asked to inform any sources with whom he was in contact over the 14 days prior to his diagnosis. \c\cAs of 19 March, public transportation ridership was down 38.5 percent compared to before the virus outbreak. Public bus operations were strictly curtailed by the government, which placed an 8 p.m. curfew on bus operations nightly, and halted all public transportation between Thursday night at 8 p.m. and Sunday morning, going beyond the usual hiatus on public transportation in Israel during Shabbat (from Friday evening to Saturday evening). As of 22 March Israel's Ministry of Transport and Road Safety and its National Public Transportation Authority instituted a notification system allowing passengers using public transportation to inquire whether they had shared a ride with a person sick with COVID-19. The travel histories will be stored through the use of the country's electronic bus card passes, known as Rav-Kav. At the peak of the first wave, on 20 April 2020, public transportation ridership was down 80% compared to before the outbreak. \c\cOn 19 March, Prime Minister Netanyahu declared a national state of emergency. He said that existing restrictions would henceforth be legally enforceable, and violators would be fined. Israelis were not allowed to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary. Essential services would remain open. News reports showed hundreds of Israelis ignoring the new ban on Shabbat, 21 March, and visiting beaches, parks, and nature spots in large numbers, prompting the Ministry of Health to threaten imposing tighter restrictions on the public. \c\cOn 25 March, the government imposed stricter restrictions on citizens\' movements. These include:\c\cPeople must not venture more than 100 m (330 ft) from their homes. Exceptions include:\c\cEmployee arrival to work is permitted according to regulations\c\cAcquiring food, medicine, essential products and receiving essential services\c\cReceiving medical treatment\c\cBlood donation\c\cLegal proceedings\c\cDemonstrations\c\cArriving at the Knesset\c\cReceiving care in the framework of the welfare system\c\cDeparture of an individual or persons living in the same place for a short time and up to 100 meters from the place of residence\c\cProviding medical assistance to another person or assisting a person with difficulty or distress\c\cPrayer in an open place, funerals, weddings, and brit milah, as well as a woman's visit to the mikvah, provided that they pre-arranged the time of their arrival\c\cTransfer of a minor to educational settings for the children of essential workers and special frameworks (in accordance with the Public Health Order). \c\cTransfer of a minor, whose parents live separately, by one of his parents, to the other parent's home. \c\cTransfer of a minor whose responsible parent is required to leave for an essential purpose if there is no responsible place for the child to be left under his care. \c\cPrivate vehicles may have only two passengers. Taxis may have only one passenger. \c\cEssential workers must be tested for fever at their workplace, and anyone with a temperature over 38 °C (100 °F) will be sent home. \c\cViolators will be subject to a 5,000 shekels fine, or up to six months\' imprisonment. \c\cBeginning on April 1 the government proposed to intensify precautionary restrictions on its citizens, requiring them to: refrain from all public gatherings, including prayer quorums of 10 men; limiting outings to two people from the same household; and calling upon them to always wear face masks in public. Beginning on April 12, the government required all Israelis to cover their nose and mouth when leaving their homes. Exceptions include "children under age 6; people with emotional, mental or medical conditions that would prevent them from wearing a mask; drivers in their cars; people alone in a building; and two workers who work regularly together, provided they maintain social distancing". The new law was passed on the same day that the World Health Organization questioned the efficacy of face masks for protecting healthy individuals from catching the virus. \c\cAccording to Israeli Ministry of Health statistics, as of March 24, 24% of all coronavirus infections in Israel with known infection points (35% of all known cases) were contracted in synagogues, 15% in hotels, and 12% in restaurants. The Health Ministry's rules on indoor gatherings, which were reduced from 100 to 10, still took into account the minimum number of members needed for a minyan (public prayer quorum). With stricter restrictions placed on citizens on 25 March (see below), the two Chief Rabbis of Israel called for all synagogues to be closed and prayer services to be held outdoors in groups of 10, with 2 m (6 ft 7 in) between each worshipper. Many synagogues in Jerusalem were locked and prayer services held outdoors. Due to the uptick in coronavirus diagnoses in Bnei Brak and after initially ordering his followers to ignore Health Ministry restrictions, leading Haredi posek Chaim Kanievsky eventually issued an unprecedented statement on 29 March instructing Bnei Brak residents not to pray with a minyan at all, but rather individually at home. Despite this, Kanievsky was accused of secretly arranging public prayers at his house. On 1 April, the Chief Rabbis of Israel published guidelines for observance of Passover laws during the outbreak. The guidelines included praying at home and not in a minyan, selling chametz online, and getting rid of chametz at home in ways other than burning, so as not to go out into the streets for the traditional burning of the chametz. \c\cAfter back-and-forth discussions with representatives of the chevra kadisha (Jewish religious burial society), the Health Ministry allowed burial society members to proceed with many traditional aspects of burial for coronavirus victims. Burial workers will be garbed in full protective gear to perform the taharah (ritual purification) of the body, which will then be wrapped in the customary tachrichim (linen shrouds) followed by a layer of plastic. The funeral service must be held completely outdoors. Funeral attendees do not need to wear protective gear. \c\cOn 26 March, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was closed. Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu\'ayb is a Druze festival called Ziyara celebrated between 25 and 28 April which is officially recognized in Israel as a public holiday. Mowafaq Tarif the current spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, announced that the traditional festivities of the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu\'ayb were canceled for the first time in the history of the Druze community. \c\cOn 2 April, the cabinet voted by conference call to declare Bnei Brak a "restricted zone", limiting entry and exit to "residents, police, rescue services, those bringing essential supplies and journalists", for an initial period of one week. With a population of 200,000, Bnei Brak had the second-highest number of coronavirus cases of all Israeli cities in total numbers, and the highest rate per capita. On 10 April the closure was relaxed to allow residents to leave the city to go to work, attend a funeral of an immediate relative, or for essential medical needs. On April 12, the government imposed a closure on Haredi neighborhoods of Jerusalem, citing Ministry of Health statistics that nearly 75% of that city's coronavirus infections could be traced to these neighborhoods. The closure impacted Mea Shearim, Geula, Bukharim Quarter, Romema, Mekor Baruch, Sanhedria, Neve Yaakov, Ramat Shlomo, and Har Nof. Residents of these neighborhoods were allowed to leave to other areas only to go to work, attend funerals of immediate relatives, and for essential medical needs. The closure was opposed by the Mayor of Jerusalem, Moshe Lion, who reportedly told the government cabinet members: "Take the Ramot neighborhood for example — 60,000 residents and 140 of them sick. Why do we need to close off the whole neighborhood?"\c\cLawmakers enforced a 3-day nationwide lockdown in conjunction with the Passover Seder, which took place in Israel on Wednesday night, April 8. All travel between cities was prohibited from Tuesday evening until Friday evening. From Wednesday at 3 p.m. until Thursday at 7 a.m., all Israelis were prohibited from venturing more than 100 m (330 ft) from their home. The goal of these measures was to prevent the traditional family gatherings associated with the Passover Seder. The lockdown did not apply to Arab towns, where Passover is not observed. Despite the lockdown, several prominent politicians, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, President of Israel Reuven Rivlin, Yisrael Beiteinu party leader Avigdor Lieberman, Minister of Immigration and Absorption Yoav Galant, and Likud MK Nir Barkat were noted by the Israeli press to have celebrated the Seder or other parts of the festival with relatives who did not live with them. A partial nationwide lockdown was again imposed from 14 to 16 April, preventing Israelis from visiting family in other towns, and Jerusalem residents from leaving their own neighborhoods, in conjunction with the seventh day of Passover and the Mimouna holiday the following evening at the end of Passover. \c\cThroughout the month of Ramadan, which began on April 25, stores in towns with majority Muslim populations (including East Jerusalem) were to be closed from 6 pm until 3 am. Indoor prayer for all religions was banned, while outdoor prayer was allowed for groups up to 19 people, distanced at least 2 m (6 ft 7 in) apart. \c\cOn 24 April 2020, the government approved the reopening of street stores and barbershops, effective 26 April 2020. Malls, gyms, and restaurants without delivery services remained closed. On 7 May 2020, malls and outdoor markets reopened, with restrictions on the number of people allowed. On 27 May 2020, restaurants reopened, with 1.6 meter distancing between diners, and masked staff. \c\cOn 3 May 2020, schools reopened for first to third grade, and 11th to 12th grade. Classes were limited in size, and schoolchildren were required to wear masks. By 17 May 2020, limitations on class size were lifted. On 10 May 2020, preschools and kindergartens reopened, with limits on the number of children per class, and on a rotating half-week schedule. Nurseries were reopened with a full-week schedule, but allowing only 70% of the children to attend. Priority was given to children of single or working mothers. On 17 to 19 May 2020, schools reopened fully, with certain social distancing rules in place, including staggered recesses and maintaining 2 meters distance between pupils during breaks. Children arriving at school were required to present a health statement signed by their parents. A number of schools were shut down after reopening due to cases among staff members or students. \c\cOn 4 May 2020, Prime Minister Netanyahu outlined a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, approved by the government. Immediate changes included allowing outdoor meetings of groups not exceeding 20, removal of the 100-meter limit on venturing from homes, and allowing meetings with family members, including elderly. Weddings with up to 50 attendees were also allowed. The easing of restrictions would halt should one of the following occur:\c\c100 new daily cases (excluding individuals arriving from abroad, outbreaks in retirement homes, and cases in other current outbreak hotspots). \c\cthe doubling time of infections decreases to 10 days. \c\cthe number of patients in serious condition reaches 250. \c\cAdditional easing of restrictions was announced on 5 May 2020. On 19 May 2020, the requirement to wear masks outdoors and in schools was lifted for the remainder of the week due to a severe heat wave. On 20 May 2020, beaches and museums reopened, and restrictions on the number of passengers on buses were relaxed. Houses of prayer reopened to groups of up to 50 people. Attendees were required to wear masks and maintain a distance of two meters. \c\cOn 16 March, Israel imposed limitations on the public and private sectors. All non-critical government and local authority workers were placed on paid leave until the end of the Passover holiday. Private sector firms exceeding 10 employees were required to reduce staff present in the workplace by 70%. On 30 March, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced an economic rescue package totaling 80 billion shekels ($22 billion), saying that was 6% of the country's GDP. The money will be allocated to health care (10 billion shekels); welfare and unemployment (30 billion shekels) aid for small and large businesses (32 billion shekels), and to financial stimulus (8 billion). By 1 April, the national unemployment rate had reached 24.4 percent. In the month of March alone, more than 844,000 individuals applied for unemployment benefits—90 percent of whom had been placed on unpaid leave due to the pandemic. During April 2020, Bituah Leumi deposited one-time payments to seniors, disabled people, people receiving income support or alimony payments, and families with children. On 16 June 2020, the Knesset passed a stimulus bill to encourage businesses to bring workers back from unemployment. \c\cOn July 1, the Knesset reauthorized ISA mobile phone tracking of infected individuals by enacting the Law to Authorize the ISA to Assist in the National Effort to Contain the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (Temporary Provisions) 2020–5780. As ISA location tracking resumed, by July 5, over 30,000 Israelis were ordered into quarantine. On 6 July 2020, following over two weeks of continued increase in the number of new daily cases, Netanyahu announced new social distancing guidelines, approved by the government. These included:\c\cRestriction of social gatherings to 20 people. \c\cLimiting the number of synagogue worshippers to 19 people. \c\cClosure of gyms, night clubs, culture venues, and event halls. \c\cLimiting the number of people on public buses to 20. \c\cLimiting the number of restaurant guests to 20 indoors, or 30 for restaurants with outdoor seating. \c\cOn 17 July, additional restrictions were announced. These included:\c\cClosure of all studios and gyms, except for those used by professional athletes. \c\cNo sitting in bars or restaurants (delivery service and take-away allowed). \c\cWeekend lockdown of non-essential businesses from 5:00pm Friday until 5:00am Sunday (supermarkets and pharmacies not included). \c\cClosure of beaches during weekend lockdown, starting 24 July 2020. \c\cGatherings limited to 20 people outdoors, and 10 people indoors. \c\cDue to pressure from business owners, the government backtracked on the closure of restaurants, pools, and beaches. Weekend closures of malls and markets were also cancelled, following claims that the closures had not slowed infection rates. \c\cOn 31 August 2020, the coronavirus cabinet approved the \'traffic-light\' plan introduced by Prof. Ronni Gamzu, in which each city is assigned a color indicating its current level of COVID-19. On 6 September 2020, the government approved closure of schools and a night-time curfew for forty \'red\' communities. This plan replaced Gamzu's proposal of full closure in ten \'red\' towns and went into effect 8 September. The communities affected by the curfews were among the poorest in Israel, with mainly Arab and ultra-Orthodox population. Residents under curfew were restricted to 500 meters distance from their homes, from 7pm to 5am. \c\cOn 10 September 2020, Israel became the country with the highest rate of COVID-19 infections per capita. As confirmed infections continued to rise daily, Israeli officials warned that hospitals would eventually be unable to confront the crisis. On 13 September 2020, the government approved a 3-week country-wide lockdown, beginning Friday, 18 September at 2pm, and ending on 10 October. Restrictions include:\c\cPeople will be limited to within 500 meters of their homes, except for work and essential activities such as buying food and pharmacy goods. \c\cClosure of malls, stores (except food and pharmacies), hotels, restaurants, fitness clubs and swimming pools. \c\cGatherings limited to 10 people indoors, or 20 people outdoors. \c\cClosure of schools except for special education and certain boarding schools (online schooling permitted for all schools). \c\cNo sitting in bars or restaurants (delivery service allowed). \c\cThe 3-week lockdown took place during the high holidays, during which many Jews attend synagogue. The lockdown rules for prayer were as follows:\c\cOutdoor prayer groups limited to 20 people. \c\cIndoor prayer groups limited to \c\cN\c\c{\\displaystyle N}\c\c groups of 10 people, with \c\cN\c\c{\\displaystyle N}\c\c depending on the number of entrances \c\cE\c\c{\\displaystyle E}\c\c, as follows:\c\cN\c\c=\c\c3\c\cE\c\c{\\displaystyle N=3E\\,\\,\\,}\c\c for \c\cE\c\c<=\c\c2\c\c{\\displaystyle E<=2}\c\c. \c\cN\c\c=\c\c6\c\c+\c\c2\c\c×\c\c(\c\cE\c\c−\c\c2\c\c)\c\c{\\displaystyle N=6+2\\times (E-2)\\,\\,\\,}\c\c  for \c\cE\c\c>\c\c2\c\c{\\displaystyle E>2}\c\c. \c\cIn either case, the total number of people 10\c\cN\c\c{\\displaystyle N}\c\c should not exceed \c\cA\c\c/\c\c4\c\c{\\displaystyle A/4}\c\c, where \c\cA\c\c{\\displaystyle A}\c\c is the area of the room in square meters. \c\cOn 23 September 2020, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced stricter lockdown rules after a new daily coronavirus record of 6,923 infections was reported in Israel. These included:\c\cClosure of synagogues, excepted for limited prayers on Yom Kippur. \c\cParticipation in demonstrations only within 1 km from home. \c\cClosure of Ben Gurion Airport to outgoing flights. \c\cOn 13 October the lockdown was extended for an additional week, until midnight 18 October 2020. \c\cWhile restrictions were eased in most of the country, local lockdowns were imposed in the following towns due to high case numbers: Majdal Shams and Masade (starting on 6 November 2020), Buqata (starting on 7 November), Hazor Haglilit (starting on 8 November), Qalansawe and Iksal (starting on 17 November 2020), Nazareth and Isfiya (starting on 21 November). \c\cA number of steps were taken to provide financial assistance:\c\cA one-time payment for each citizen was given out in two instalments: the first for parents of children under the age of 18, and the second for individuals 18 or older. \c\cUnemployment pay was extended through 30 June 2021. \c\cAn additional grant was provided for low-income workers over age 67 who were fired or forced to take a leave of absence. \c\cGrants for businesses whose income suffered due to the pandemic. \c\cOn 21 September 2020, the government unanimously approved a 10% pay cut for all Knesset members and government ministers. \c\cDuring July and August 2020, many protests were held, with protesters voicing frustration over the response of the Netanyahu-led government to the pandemic. On 30 September, Israel's parliament passed a law limiting demonstrations which the opposition said was intended to curb protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged corruption and his mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis. The law prohibited Israelis from holding large gatherings more than one kilometre (5⁄8 mile) from their residences. The government defended the measure as a way to curb COVID-19 infections. On 3 October, numerous anti-Netanyahu protests were held throughout Israel after the passage of legislation limiting demonstrations during the lockdown. The Black Flag movement estimated that 130,000 people took part in Saturday's protests against Netanyahu in cities and towns across Israel. \c\cThe Haredi school year started on 24 August 2020, before the \'traffic light\' plan was approved. All other schools in non-\'red\' cities opened on 1 September 2020. Within a week, a number of schools and kindergartens reported outbreaks, leading to quarantine of exposed staff members and students. Physical schools, kindergartens and nurseries closed at the beginning of the 3-week lockdown, on 13 September, with classes continuing online. Kindergartens and nurseries reopened on 18 October, including in \'red\' cities. Grades 1 to 4 reopened on 1 November, in non-\'red\' cities. Class size was limited to 18 children. Students were required to wear masks throughout the day and eat their meals outdoors or spaced far apart from one another. Grades 5 and 6 returned to school on 24 November. High school grades 11 and 12 returned on 29 November. Schools reopened for remaining grades 7–10 on 6 December. After the Hanukkah break, over 220,000 students from grades 5–12 in \'orange\' and \'red\' cities went back to online studies. \c\cOn 18 October 2020 Israel eased lockdown restrictions in non-\'red\' cities. The first stage of the exit strategy included:\c\cReopening of kindergartens and nurseries. \c\cEateries open to take-out in addition to delivery. \c\cTravel no longer restricted to 1 km from home. \c\cIndoor gatherings of up to 10 people, and outdoor gatherings up to 20, allowed. \c\cReopening of prominent religious sites in Jerusalem, including the Western Wall, the Temple Mount, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. \c\cReopening of beaches and national parks. \c\cOn 1 November 2020 Israel eased restrictions further:\c\cReopening of elementary schools (grades 1–4). \c\cReopening of synagogues (limited to 10 people indoors, 20 outdoors). \c\cReopening of bed-and-breakfasts. \c\cReopening of hair and beauty salons. \c\cResumption of some "one-on-one" activities, including driving lessons and personal fitness training. \c\cOn 8 November 2020, street-front stores reopened. Strip malls reopened on 17 November 2020. 15 malls opened as part of a pilot plan on 27 November 2020. \c\cIn December 2020, cases steadily increased, reaching over 3,000 new cases daily and over 5% test positivity rate. Multiple countries announced the appearance of new and more infectious COVID-19 strains; towards the end of December, first cases of the Alpha variant were detected in Israel. First cases of the Beta variant were detected in January 2021. \c\cOn 20 December 2020, Israel announced an entry ban on all foreign travelers arriving from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Denmark. Israelis returning from these countries were required to enter state-run quarantine hotels. On 24 January 2021, the government announced a week-long ban on most incoming and outgoing flights, effective on Monday January 25 at midnight, to prevent entry of new variants into Israel. The flight restrictions were extended multiple times: until 5 February 2021, then until 21 February 2021, and later until 6 March 2021. Daily flights, for new immigrants and for Israelis stranded outside Israel, were available as of 22 February 2021, for up to 2,000 passengers. The number of daily entries was increased to 3,000 on 7 March 2021. \c\cOn 24 December 2020, the government declared a third nationwide lockdown, to begin on 27 December 2020. Restrictions included:\c\cTraveling limited to 1,000 meter radius from home (individual sporting activities are allowed). \c\cGatherings limited to 10 people indoors or 20 people outdoors, for approved events (e.g. funerals and weddings). \c\cVisiting another person's home is forbidden. \c\cClosure of all non-essential stores and services. \c\cBusinesses that do not receive customers can remain open at 50% capacity or up to 10 employees, whichever is greater. \c\cRestaurants will open for delivery only. \c\cClosure of bed and breakfasts, zoos, safaris and parks. \c\cClosure of alternative medicine centers, beauty, and hair salons. \c\cCancellation of driving lessons. \c\cPublic transportation reduced to 50% capacity. 
Just before 11:00 am GMT on 14 November 2021, a taxi exploded in the car park outside the main entrance of the Liverpool Women's Hospital in Liverpool, England. The passenger was killed and the driver of the taxi was injured. The explosion was later declared as a terrorist incident. \c\cOn 14 November 2021, at approximately 10:59 am GMT, an explosion occurred inside a taxi in the car park in front of the main entrance of the Liverpool Women's Hospital. The explosion was caused by an improvised explosive device which was carried by the taxi's passenger, a man of Middle Eastern origin not known to MI5, who was killed in the incident probably having constructed the device himself. The taxi driver was admitted to hospital and described as "shaken and injured"—including an ear needing to be sewn back on—but released the following day. \c\cMerseyside Police attended the scene, along with fire and ambulance crews; they were accompanied by Military Logistics and the Bomb Squad. The hospital was placed under a lockdown, roads were closed and a cordon was in place around the hospital by the evening, and armed police maintained a presence. \c\cThe bomber's motivation for the attack was not immediately known, however, one theory emerged that he was intending to walk to the cathedral and detonate his device as the congregation left. Police said he had links to both areas of Liverpool that had been raided. \c\cIt was established that the taxi driver, David Perry, picked up the passenger in Rutland Avenue, approximately 10 minutes drive from the hospital. Early reports suggested that on arrival he locked the doors of his vehicle on his passenger before it went up in flames, although a Counterterrorism spokesman noted that officers had not yet spoken to Perry as of Sunday evening. \c\cThe police made three arrests under the Terrorism Act, and although they had not at that point declared the explosion to be a terrorist incident, they said the investigation was being run by counter terrorism officers, "out of caution". Robert Wright of The Financial Times said that any determination that the incident is considered terrorism would be made by the Counter Terrorism Command of the Metropolitan Police. \c\cLiverpool Police armed units raided a property in the Sefton Park area, although the BBC noted that they had not "confirmed whether the two incidents are related". Three men aged 29, 26, and 21 were arrested in the Kensington area of Liverpool under the Terrorism Act. Police later stated the arrests were a direct response to the attack. The arrests were made on Boaler Street, which is within walking distance of the hospital A fourth man was arrested. and a number of houses in the Sefton Park area had been evacuated. The Independent noted that this was a "usual precaution... where explosive materials are suspected or found". A controlled explosion was carried out in the middle of Sefton Park, "a few hundred metres" from Rut;and avenue. \c\cThe Independent questioned whether there was a "connection between the timing of the incident and the fact that it occurred on Remembrance Sunday, with the associated minute’s silence usually observed at 11am." The paper noted that the hospital is a short distance from Liverpool Cathedral, where the remembrance service was taking place attended by thousands of veterans and military personnel with a subsequent parade. On this, the police stated \c\cThe Mayor of Liverpool, Joanne Anderson, made a statement, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated Perry, stating that "it does look as though the taxi driver in question did behave with incredible presence of mind and bravery". The shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth apologised on Monday evening having passed his condolences on to the family of the dead man without mentioning David Perry. He explained that a misreading of the news had led him to understand that the dead man had been an innocent member of the public. \c\cOn 15 November 2021 the police declared the explosion a terrorist incident, and the UK terror threat level was raised from substantial to severe. MI5 joined the investigation on the same day of the incident in a support role for the local police, while COBRA met on Monday morning. The Telegraph reported that the perpetrator was unknown to MI5. \c\cThe event was reported internationally, including by CNN and The New York Times and the Washington Post.
The insurgency in the Maghreb refers to the Islamist insurgency in the Maghreb and Sahel regions of North Africa that followed on from the end of the Algerian Civil War in 2002 to the present day. The Algerian militant group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) allied itself with al-Qaeda to eventually become al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The Algerian and other Maghreb governments fighting the militants have worked with the United States and the United Kingdom since 2007, when Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara began. While the 2011 Arab Spring affected support for the insurgency, it also presented military opportunities for the jihadists. In 2012, AQIM and Islamist allies captured the northern half of Mali, until being fought back less than a year later following a French-led foreign intervention, which was succeeded by the Sahel-wide Operation Barkhane. In Libya, the ISIL/ISIS/IS/Daesh has been able to control some limited territory in the ongoing civil war since 2014, amid allegations of local collaboration between the rival AQIM and ISIL. \c\cWith the decline of the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA), the GSPC was left as the most active rebel group, with about 300 fighters in 2003. It continued an assassination campaign of police and army personnel in its area, and also managed to expand into the Sahara, where its southern division, led by Amari Saifi (nicknamed "Abderrezak el-Para", the "paratrooper"), kidnapped a number of German tourists in 2003, before being forced to flee to sparsely populated areas of Mali, and later Niger and Chad, where he was captured. \c\cSome believe that el-Para actually works for the Algerian government. By late 2003, the group's founder had been supplanted by the even more radical Nabil Sahraoui, who announced his open support for al-Qaeda, thus strengthening government ties between the U.S. and Algeria. He was reportedly killed shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud in 2004. \c\cThe GSPC has declared its intention to attack Algerian, French, and American targets. It has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. Department of State, and similarly classed as a terrorist organization by the European Union. \c\cThe conflict with the GSPC continued to result in a significant number of casualties in Algeria, with over 1,100 killed in clashes with Islamist rebels in 2002. In 2003, a total 1,162 were killed in clashes in Algeria, followed by 429 killed in 2004, 488 killed in 2005, and 323 killed in 2006. In early 2006, the head of the Algerian national police claimed that terrorism had nearly been eliminated in the country, but significant attacks continued, and 2007 would eventually mark a height of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in Algeria. \c\cIn order to improve recruiting and funding, the GSPC aligned itself with al-Qaeda, and on 11 September 2006, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri announced a union between the groups. The GSPC rebranded itself as al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in January 2007, signaling the broadened aspirations of the group. \c\cThe group now aimed to overthrow all North African governments deemed apostate, including those of Algeria, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. Operations were shifted into two broader "sectors", Northern Algeria and Tunisia allocated a "central emirate", and northern Mali, Niger, Mauritania and Libya a "Sahara emirate" led by Djamel Okacha. The strategic leadership of AQIM continued to be headquartered in the mountainous region of Kabylie east of the Algerian capital Algiers, headed by a 14-member Shura council leadership. \c\cAs the Algerian counterterrorism campaign became largely successful in pushing AQIM out of the country, the group established new bases in Sahel countries such as Niger, Mauritania, Chad and Mali. Attacks against government and military installations were frequently underreported by Western media. In 2007, the United States and United Kingdom launched the Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara in support of governments in the region. \c\cFrequent kidnappings of foreigners in 2008 led the Dakar Rally to be cancelled and permanently moved to South America. \c\cIn the earliest major attack as direct spillover of the Algerian conflict, the Mauritanian army base Lemgheity was attacked by the GSPC in June 2005, killing 17 soldiers (and nine jihadists), and wounding another 17. The attack in part led to a coup d\'état in October 2005 by Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who made a campaign against jihadists a major part of his rule. Attacks continued in Mauritania until it was largely successful in thwarting attacks since 2011 following a major military boost and political openings for Islamists. AQIM has however continued to remain active in the eastern border-regions with Mali, with active support systems for logistics and information. A lack of military resources, often due to turmoil and having little population in a very large country, caused Mauritania to rely on support from France, Morocco, and Algeria in order to defeat the AQIM. \c\cIn December 2006 and again in January 2007, Tunisian security forces engaged in clashes with a group linked to the GSPC that had established training camps in mountainous areas near the capital Tunis, killing more than a dozen people. According to French daily Le Parisien at least 60 people were killed in the clashes. The clashes were the most serious terrorist activity in Tunisia since the Ghriba synagogue bombing in 2002. \c\cStarting in 2012, AQIM along with Ansar al-Sharia and the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade active in the mountainous Jebel ech Chambi region outside Kasserine near the Algeria–Tunisia border have been targeted by the Tunisian Army in the Chaambi Operations. In 2014, Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade militants attacked two Tunisian military checkpoints, killing fourteen Tunisian soldiers and injuring twenty-five in what was the deadliest military skirmish in Tunisia since its independence in 1956. Since 2015, Tunisia has simultaneously been targeted by an ISIL terrorist campaign. In March 2016 over 50 militants were killed when ISIL attempted to seize Ben Guerdane near the Libya–Tunisia border. \c\cSince the Libyan Civil War in 2011, south-western Libya has offered sanctuaries to AQIM which has dispatched cells to be established in the region. On 11 September 2012, members of Ansar al-Sharia and AQIM were responsible for coordinated attacks against two United States government facilities in Benghazi, and Ansar al-Sharia was later involved in clashes in Benghazi in 2013. Drawing defectors from AQIM, the rival Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was later able to control some limited territory in the north in the renewed civil war from 2014. After initial official support from AQIM, allegations have continued of local collaboration between the otherwise rivalling groups. After being pushed out of Derna, the remaining ISIL stronghold of Sirte was captured in late 2016. Al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamists led by Ansar al-Sharia have at the same time continued to exert control in other places. \c\cIn 2012, AQIM and allied Islamist groups Ansar Dine and Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA) were able to capture the northern half of Mali after effectively overrunning the preceding Tuareg rebellion, which in turn had been sparked by former Tuareg fighters from the Libyan Civil War. In 2012 Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted in a coup d\'état over his handling of the conflict. After Ansar Dine attempted a push into the south of the country, Mali requested France to launch a military intervention in January 2013 which successfully pushed rebels out. The military intervention was followed by an ongoing Sahel-wide French-led military operation with around 4,000 French soldiers actively deployed. \c\cSmall pockets of armed Islamists have remained active in northern Mali, and attacks have continued against the UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA, which has become one of the UN's deadliest international missions. \c\cHaving cooperated and trained alongside AQIM in the Sahel since 2006, the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram began expanding into Chad and Niger in 2014 after successfully seizing territory in the insurgency in Nigeria. By then controlling a significant area around Lake Chad, a coalition of Western African countries launched an offensive against the group in January 2015. The group eventually departed its alliance with al-Qaeda, pledging allegiance to ISIL in March 2015. By the end of 2015 Boko Haram had been largely pushed to retreat into the Sambisa Forest in Nigeria, although attacks have continued including in Niger. \c\cAlgerian Civil War with the GIA is considered to have ended in February 2002, GSPC continues insurgency. \c\cApril 11, 2002 - Ghriba synagogue bombing killed 22 (14 German tourists, 5 Tunisians, and 2 French nationals and the suicide bomber). \c\cMay 5, 2002 - 15 government soldiers are killed in an ambush near Tizi Ouzou, in the Kabylie region of northern Algeria.

The relationship between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America has been complex since 1949. After 1980 the economic ties grew rapidly. The relationship is one of close economic ties, as well as hegemonic rivalry in the Asia-Pacific. It has been described by world leaders and academics as the world's most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century. \c\cAs of 2021[update], the United States has the world's largest economy and China has the second largest although China has a larger GDP when measured by PPP. Historically, relations between the two countries have generally been stable with some periods of open conflict, most notably during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Currently, the United States and China have mutual political, economic, and security interests, such as the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but there are unresolved concerns relating to the role of democracy in government in China and human rights in China. China is the second largest foreign creditor of the United States, after Japan. The two countries remain in dispute over territorial issues in the South China Sea; China claims sovereignty over virtually the entire South China Sea, while the United States sees it as international waters and claims the right for its warships and aircraft to conduct operations in the area. \c\cRelations with China began slowly until the 1845 Treaty of Wangxia. The US was allied to the Republic of China during the Pacific War against Japan (1941–1945) but, after the victory of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Mainland China during the Chinese Civil War, fought a major armed conflict with the People's Republic of China in the Korean War and did not establish relations for 25 years, until President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. Since Nixon's visit, every US president, with the exception of Jimmy Carter, has toured China. Relations with China have strained under President Barack Obama's Asia pivot strategy. Despite tensions during his term, the Chinese population's favorability of the US stood at 51% in Obama's last year of 2016, only to fall during the Trump administration. According to a 2020 survey by the Pew Research Center, 22% of Americans have a favorable view of China, with 73% expressing an unfavorable view, one of the  most negative perceptions of China. The poll also found that 24% (plurality) of Americans see China as the top threat to the US. Furthermore, a survey of Chinese public opinions also found a corresponding decrease in favorability towards the US, with 61% expressing an unfavorable view. \c\cThe relationship deteriorated sharply under U.S. president Donald Trump and CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, with issues such as China's militarization of the South China Sea and Chinese espionage in the United States arising. The Trump administration labeled China a "strategic competitor" starting with the 2017 National Security Strategy. It subsequently launched a trade war against China, banned US companies from selling equipment to Huawei and other companies linked to human rights abuses in Xinjiang, increased visa restrictions on Chinese nationality students and scholars and designated China as a currency manipulator. During the Trump administration, and especially since the US-China trade war began, political observers have started to warn that a new cold war is emerging. By May 2020 the relationship had deteriorated to the lowest point as both sides were recruiting allies to attack the other regarding guilt for the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cTensions between the United States and China have remained under the Biden administration, which made China one of its focal points in implementing U.S. foreign policy. The more confrontational stance has endured, with the Biden administration focusing on China's treatment of Hong Kong, its threats against Taiwan, the Uyghur genocide, and Chinese cyberwarfare. In response, China has adopted "wolf warrior diplomacy" to deny all accusations of human rights abuses. \c\cHarold Isaacs published Scratches on our Minds: American Images of China and India in 1955. By reviewing the popular and scholarly literature on Asia that appeared in the United States and by interviewing many American experts, Isaacs identified six stages of American attitudes toward China. They were "respect" (18th century), "contempt" (1840–1905), "benevolence" (1905 to 1937), "admiration" (1937–1944); "disenchantment" (1944–1949), and "hostility" (after 1949). In 1990, historian Jonathan Spence updated Isaac's model to include "reawakened curiosity" (1970–1974); "guileless fascination" (1974–1979), and "renewed skepticism" (1980s). \c\cPolitical scientist Peter Rudolf said that Americans see China as a threat to the established order in its drive for regional hegemony in East Asia now, and a future aspirant for global supremacy. Beijing rejects these notions, but continues its assertive policies and its quest for allies. \c\cAs the paramount leader, Mao Zedong was able to impose his views on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the government, and the media. Washington ignored the possibility that its decision in June 1950 to defend South Korea, and then in September to invade North Korea, would alarm China. But it did, and in November 1950 the Chinese responded by a massive invasion of North Korea that pushed the Allies south of the 38th parallel. By 1951 the situation had stabilized close to the original 38th parallel dividing line. The new Eisenhower administration in Washington in 1953 made it clear the fighting had to stop, hinting it might use nuclear weapons if needed. Finding a solution to the problem of repatriating prisoners of war, both sites settled for an armistice in 1953, and China removed its forces from North Korea. No peace treaty was ever signed, and North Korean and South Korean forces remained into the 21st century in a face-off, with a large American contingent still based in South Korea. \c\cIn the late 1950s, Mao could not tolerate the anti-Stalinist program led by Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev. Ideological tensions escalated between Beijing and Moscow almost to the verge of war. In nearly all capitalist countries and colonies, communist movements split between the old established pro-Moscow element, and the more radical upstart pro-Beijing Maoists. Although still not friendly to the United States, Mao realized that the American anti-Soviet posture in the Cold War was to his advantage as long as China was militarily much less powerful than neighboring Soviet Union. \c\cAccording to Cai Xia, a retired professor and political theorist formerly at the CCP Central Party School, it was Mao Zedong who "opened the door", but it was Deng Xiaoping who founded the strategic framework for the "engagement" between the U.S. and China. By the end of the Cultural Revolution, China's economy was at the edge of collapse, shaking the foundation of the CCP's rule. China's subsequent rapid economic development and tremendous changes are inseparable from the help of the US government and the American people in areas such as science, technology, education, culture, and economics. Cai said that Deng also chose the "engagement policy" because China could rely on the strength of the US to hedge against Soviet threats. \c\cCai argued that the "engagement policy" had already ended because there was "fundamental misjudgment by the United States about the nature of the Chinese Communist Party and regime, which in turn has made the US a victim of its own policy." She added, "Wishful thinking about \'engagement\' must be replaced by hardheaded defensive measures to protect the United States from the CCP's aggression—while bringing offensive pressures to bear on it, as the Chinese Communist Party is much more fragile than Americans assume."\c\cThe United States did not formally recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) for 30 years after its founding. Instead, the US maintained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China government on Taiwan, recognizing it as the sole legitimate government of China. \c\cAs the People's Liberation Army moved south to complete the conquest of mainland China in 1949, the American embassy followed Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China government to Taipei, while US consular officials remained in mainland China. In December 1950, the People's Republic seized all American assets and properties, totaling $196.8 million. Prior to this, the US had frozen Chinese assets in America following the PRC's entry into the Korean War in November. \c\cThe Korean War began on 25 June with the invasion of South Korea by the North Korea, a Communist state with close ties to Moscow and Beijing.  In response the United Nations Security Council was passed UNSC Resolution 82, declaring war on North Korea unanimously. The Soviet Union, with veto power, was boycotting UN proceedings. The American-led U.N. offensive pushed the invaders back past the north–south border at the 38th parallel and began to approach the Yalu River on the China-North Korea border. The UN had authorized the reunification of Korea and China could not tolerate hostile forces on its Yalu River border with Korea.  PRC Premier and foreign minister Zhou Enlai's warning that it would intervene in the war on grounds of national security was dismissed by President Truman. \c\c In late October 1950, China's intervention began with the Battle of Onjong. During the Battle of the Ch\'ongch\'on River, the People's Volunteer Army overran or outflanked the UN forces, leading to the defeat of the US Eighth Army. A ceasefire presented by the UN to the PRC shortly after the Battle of the Ch\'ongch\'on River on 11 December 1950 was rejected by the Mao administration which was convinced of its invincibility after its victory in that battle and the wider Second Phase Offensive, and also wanted demonstrate China's desire for a total victory through the expulsion of the UN forces from Korea. The Chinese were victorious in the Third Battle of Seoul and the Battle of Hoengsong, but the UN forces recovered and pushed back to about the 38th parallel. Stalemate resulted. The stalemate ended when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on 27 July 1953. Since then, a divided Korea has become an important factor in US-China relations, with large American forces stationed in South Korea. \c\cThe People's Republic of China provided resources and training to North Vietnam, and in the summer of 1962, Mao agreed to supply Hanoi with 90,000 rifles and guns free of charge. After the launch of the America's Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965, China sent anti-aircraft units and engineering battalions to North Vietnam to repair the damage caused by American bombing, rebuild roads and railroads, and perform other engineering work, freeing additional hundreds of thousands North Vietnamese Army units for combat in American supported South Vietnam. The United States lost 58,159 troops in the Vietnam War. \c\cThe Chinese presence in North Vietnam was well known to US officials, and can explain a number of factors surrounding American strategy in the conflict. In particular, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ruled out the possibility of a ground invasion of North Vietnam early on, for fear of repeating the Korean War but now with a thermonuclear-armed China. However, it is unclear exactly what Beijing's reaction to a US invasion of North Vietnam would have been—Mao Zedong reportedly told journalist Edgar Snow in 1965 that China had no intention of fighting to save the Hanoi regime and would not engage the US military unless it crossed into Chinese territory. On other occasions, Mao expressed confidence that the People's Liberation Army could take on the US again, much like it did in Korea. Whatever Chinese plans might have been, the Johnson administration was unwilling to tempt fate and so US ground troops never crossed into North Vietnam. \c\cBetween 1949 and 1971, US–China relations were uniformly hostile, with frequent propaganda attacks in both directions. At the 1954 Geneva Conference, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles forbade any contact with the Chinese delegation, refusing to shake hands with Zhou Enlai, the lead Chinese negotiator.[citation needed] Relations deteriorated under President John F. Kennedy (1961–1963). Before the Cuban Missile Crisis, policymakers in Washington were uncertain whether or not China would break with the Soviet Union on the basis of ideology, national ambitions, and readiness for a role in guiding communist activities in many countries. New insight came with the Sino-Indian border war in November 1962 and Beijing's response to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy administration officials concluded that China was more militant and more dangerous than the Soviet Union, making better relations with Moscow desirable, with both nations trying to contain Chinese ambitions.  Diplomatic recognition of China remained out of the question, as a crucial veto power on the UN Security Council was held by America's ally on Taiwan.  The United States continued to work to prevent the PRC from taking China's seat in the United Nations and encouraged its allies not to deal with the PRC. The United States placed an embargo on trading with the PRC, and encouraged allies to follow it. \c\cThe PRC developed nuclear weapons in 1964 and, as later declassified documents revealed, President Johnson considered preemptive attacks to halt its nuclear program. He ultimately decided the measure carried too much risk and it was abandoned. Instead Johnson looked for ways to improve relations. The American public seemed more open to the idea of expanding contacts with China, such as relaxation of the trade embargo. But the War in Vietnam was raging with China aiding North Vietnam. Mao's Great Leap Forward had been a humiliating failure, and his Cultural Revolution was hostile to the U.S. In the end Johnson made no move to change the standoff. \c\cDespite official non-recognition, the United States and the People's Republic of China held 136 meetings at the ambassadorial level beginning in 1954 and continuing until 1970, first in Geneva and in 1958–1970 in Warsaw. \c\cThe Cultural Revolution brought about near-complete isolation of China from the outside world and vocal denunciations of both U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. \c\cBeginning in 1967, the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission established the China Claims Program, in which American citizens could denominate the sum total of their lost assets and property following the Communist seizure of foreign property in 1950. American companies were reluctant to invest in China despite (future leader) Deng Xiaoping's reassurances of a stable business environment. \c\cThe end of the 1960s brought a period of transformation. For China, when American president Johnson decided to wind down the Vietnam War in 1968, it gave China an impression that the US had no interest of expanding in Asia anymore while the USSR became a more serious threat as it intervened in Czechoslovakia to displace a communist government and might well interfere in China. \c\cThis became an especially important concern for the People's Republic of China after the Sino-Soviet border conflict of 1969. The PRC was diplomatically isolated and the leadership came to believe that improved relations with the United States would be a useful counterbalance to the Soviet threat. Zhou Enlai, the Premier of China, was at the forefront of this effort with the committed backing of Chairman Mao Zedong. In 1969, the United States initiated measures to relax trade restrictions and other impediments to bilateral contact, to which China responded. However, this rapprochement process was stalled by the Vietnam War where China was supporting the enemies of the United States. Communication between Chinese and American leaders, however, was conducted through Romania, Pakistan and Poland as intermediaries. \c\cIn the United States, academics such as John K. Fairbank and A. Doak Barnett pointed to the need to deal realistically with the Beijing government, while organizations such as the National Committee on United States–China Relations sponsored debates to promote public awareness. Many saw the specter of Communist China behind communist movements in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, but a growing number concluded that if the PRC would align with the US it would mean a major redistribution of global power against the Soviets. Mainland China's market of nearly one billion consumers appealed to American business. Senator J. William Fulbright, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, held a series of hearings on the matter. \c\cRichard M. Nixon mentioned in his inaugural address that the two countries were entering an era of negotiation after an era of confrontation. Although Nixon during his 1960 presidential campaign had vociferously supported Chiang Kai-Shek, by the second half of the decade, he increasingly began to speak of there "being no reason to leave China angry and isolated". Nixon's election as president in 1968 was initially met with hostility by Beijing—an editorial in the People's Daily denounced him as "a chieftain whom the capitalist world had turned to out of desperation". Nixon believed it was in the American national interest to forge a relationship with China, even though there were enormous differences between the two countries.  He was assisted in this by his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger. Domestic politics also entered into Nixon's thinking, as the boost from a successful courting of the PRC could help him in the 1972 American presidential election. He also worried that one of the Democrats would preempt him and go to the PRC before he had the opportunity. \c\cIn 1971, an unexpectedly friendly encounter between the American and Chinese ping-pong athletes called Glenn Cowan and Zhuang Zedong in Japan opened the way for a visit to China, which Chairman Mao personally approved.  In April 1971, the athletes became the first Americans to officially visit China since the communist takeover. The smooth acceptance of this created the term "ping-pong diplomacy", and gave confidence to both sides. The ping-pong diplomacy allowed reporters into the country as well, opening up communication to both sides, and breaking a barrier that had been there previously. This smoothed out the start of the trade partnership that was going to happen later. In July 1971, Henry Kissinger feigned illness while on a trip to Pakistan and did not appear in public for a day. He was actually on a top-secret mission to Beijing to negotiate with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. \c\cKissinger and his aides did not receive a warm welcome in Beijing, and the hotel they stayed in was equipped with pamphlets excoriating US imperialism. However, the meeting with Zhou Enlai was productive, and the Chinese premier expressed his hope for improved Sino-US relations. He commented that the US had intentionally isolated China, not vice versa, and any initiative to restore diplomatic ties had to come from the American side. Zhou spoke of the late President Kennedy's plans to restore relations with China and told Kissinger "We are willing to wait as long as we need to. If these negotiations fail, in time another Kennedy or another Nixon will come along."\c\cOn 15 July 1971, President Richard Nixon revealed the mission to the world and that he had accepted an invitation to visit the PRC. \c\cThis announcement  caused immediate shock around the world. In the United States, some hard-line anti-communists (most notably libertarian Republican Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater) denounced the decision, but most public opinion supported the move and Nixon saw the jump in the polls he had been hoping for. Since Nixon had sterling anti-communist credentials he was all but immune to being called "soft on communism." Nixon and his aides wanted to ensure that press coverage offered dramatic imagery. Nixon was particularly eager for strong news coverage. \c\cWithin the PRC there was also opposition from left-wing elements. This effort was allegedly led by Lin Biao, head of the military, who died in a mysterious plane crash over Mongolia while trying to defect to the Soviet Union. His death silenced most internal dissent over the visit. \c\cInternationally, reactions varied. In the communist world, the Soviets were very concerned that two major enemies seemed to have resolved their differences, and the new world alignment contributed significantly to the policy of détente. Romania's president Nicolae Ceaușescu praised the US initiative as a "move for world peace".[This quote needs a citation] Several communist regimes, including Cuba, Albania, and North Vietnam, accused China of "capitulationism to the imperialists".[This quote needs a citation] North Korea proclaimed that it was the reverse and that the US had been forced to capitulate to China, having failed to isolate it. \c\cAmerica's European allies and Canada were pleased by the initiative, especially since many of them had already recognized the PRC. In Asia, the reaction was far more mixed. Japan was annoyed that it had not been told of the announcement until fifteen minutes before it had been made, and feared that the Americans were abandoning them in favor of the PRC. A short time later, Japan also recognized the PRC and committed to substantial trade with the continental power. South Korea and South Vietnam were both concerned that peace between the United States and the PRC could mean an end to American support for them against their communist enemies. Throughout the period of rapprochement, both countries had to be regularly assured that they would not be abandoned. Taiwan have a criticize by Chiang Kai-Shek: "Today any international appease movement to evil power to seek for political power balance would never helpful for the world peace, instead it elongated the hardship of our 700 million people, and expand the disaster of the world."\c\cFrom 21 to 28 February 1972, President Nixon traveled to Beijing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. At the conclusion of his trip, the US and the PRC issued the Shanghai Communiqué, a statement of their respective foreign policy views. In the Communiqué, both nations pledged to work toward the full normalization of diplomatic relations. This did not lead to immediate recognition of the People's Republic of China but \'liaison offices\' were established in Beijing and Washington. The US acknowledged the PRC position that all Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait maintain that there is only one China and that Taiwan is part of China. The statement enabled the US and PRC to temporarily set aside the issue of Taiwan and open trade and communication. Also, the US and China both agreed to take action against \'any country\' that is to establish \'hegemony\' in the Asia-Pacific. On several issues, such as the ongoing conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and Israel, the US and China were unable to reach a common understanding. \c\cMost major anti-US propaganda disappeared in China after the Nixon visit; although there was still occasional criticism of US imperialism, the Soviet Union had definitively become China's arch-foe in the 1970s. \c\cThe rapprochement with the United States benefited the PRC immensely and greatly increased its security for the rest of the Cold War. It has been argued that the United States, on the other hand, saw fewer benefits than it had hoped for, inasmuch as China continued to back America's enemies in Hanoi and Pyongyang. Eventually, however, the PRC's suspicion of Vietnam's motives led to a break in Sino-Vietnamese cooperation and, upon the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1979, the Sino-Vietnamese War. Both China and the United States backed combatants in Africa against Soviet and Cuban-supported movements. The economic benefits of normalization were slow as it would take decades for American products to penetrate the vast Chinese market. While Nixon's China policy is regarded by many as the highlight of his presidency, others such as William Bundy have argued that it provided very little benefit to the United States.[citation needed]\c\cIn May 1973, in an effort to build toward formal diplomatic relations, the US and the PRC established the United States Liaison Office (USLO) in Beijing and a counterpart PRC office in Washington. In 1973 to 1978, such distinguished Americans as David K. E. Bruce, George H. W. Bush, Thomas S. Gates, Jr., and Leonard Woodcock served as chiefs of the USLO with the personal rank of ambassador. China made clear that it considered the Soviet Union its chief adversary, and urged the United States to be powerful, thereby distracting Moscow. Liaison officer George Bush concluded, "China keeps wanting us to be strong, wanting us to defend Europe, wanting us to increase our defense budgets, etc." Bush concluded that American engagement was essential to support markets, allies, and stability in Asia and around the world. \c\cPresident Gerald Ford visited the PRC in 1975 and reaffirmed American interest in normalizing relations with Beijing. Shortly after taking office in 1977, President Jimmy Carter again reaffirmed the goals of the Shanghai Communiqué. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Carter's National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, and senior staff member of the National Security Council Michel Oksenberg encouraged Carter to seek full diplomatic and trade relations with China. Although Brzezinski sought to quickly establish a security relationship with Beijing to counter the Soviet Union, Carter sided with Vance in believing that such a deal would threaten existing U.S.-Soviet relations, including the SALT II negotiations. Thus, the administration decided to cautiously pursue political normalization and not military relations. Vance, Brzezinski, and Oksenberg traveled to Beijing in early 1978 to work with Leonard Woodcock, then head of the liaison office, to lay the groundwork to do so. The United States and the People's Republic of China announced on 15 December 1978, that the two governments would establish diplomatic relations on 1 January 1979. \c\cIn the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, dated 1 January 1979, the United States transferred diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The US reiterated the Shanghai Communiqué's acknowledgment of the Chinese position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of China; Beijing acknowledged that the American people would continue to carry on commercial, cultural, and other unofficial contacts with the people of Taiwan. \c\cTaiwan, although fully expecting this step, nonetheless expressed disappointment at having not been consulted first. The reaction of the communist world was similar to 1972, with the Soviet Union and its allies in Eastern Europe mostly being noncommittal, Romania welcoming the move, and Cuba and Albania being strongly against it. North Korea issued a statement congratulating "our brotherly neighbors for ending long-hostile relations with the US".[This quote needs a citation]\c\cVice Premier Deng Xiaoping's January 1979 visit to Washington initiated a series of important, high-level exchanges which continued until the spring of 1989. This resulted in many bilateral agreements, especially in the fields of scientific, technological, and cultural interchange, as well as trade relations. Since early 1979, the United States and the PRC have initiated hundreds of joint research projects and cooperative programs under the Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology, the largest bilateral program. \c\cOn 1 March 1979, the two countries formally established embassies in each other's capitals. In 1979, outstanding private claims were resolved and a bilateral trade agreement was completed. Vice President Walter Mondale reciprocated Vice Premier Deng's visit with an August 1979 trip to China. This visit led to agreements in September 1980 on maritime affairs, civil aviation links, and textile matters, as well as a bilateral consular convention. \c\cThe threats of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia were major factors that brought Washington and Beijing closer than ever before. US-China military cooperation began in 1979; American arms sales to China were initiated, and in 1981 it was revealed that a joint US-China listening post had been operated in Xinjiang, near the Soviet border. \c\cChinese demands for advanced technology from the US were not always met, in part due to opposition from Congressmen who either distrusted technology transfer to a communist nation out of principle, or concern that there was no guarantee that such technology would not end up in the hands of unfriendly third parties. In 1983, the US State Department changed its classification of China to "a friendly, developing nation",[This quote needs a citation] thereby increasing the amount of technology and armaments that could be sold. The skepticism of some US Congressmen was not entirely unmerited as China during the 1980s continued to sell arms to Iran and other states that were openly hostile to American interests. \c\cAs a consequence of high-level and working-level contacts initiated in 1980, US dialogue with the PRC broadened to cover a wide range of issues, including global and regional strategic problems, political-military questions, including arms control, UN, and other multilateral organization affairs, and international narcotics matters. New York City and Beijing became sister cities. \c\cHigh-level exchanges continued to be a significant means for developing US–PRC relations in the 1980s. President Ronald Reagan and Premier Zhao Ziyang made reciprocal visits in 1984. Reagan's visit to Beijing went well, however a speech he made criticizing the Soviet Union and praising capitalism, democracy, and freedom of religion was not aired on Chinese state television. In July 1985, Chinese President Li Xiannian traveled to the United States, the first such visit by a PRC head of state. Vice President Bush visited the PRC in October 1985 and opened the US Consulate General in Chengdu, the US's fourth consular post in the PRC. Further exchanges of cabinet-level officials occurred between 1985 and 1989, capped by President Bush's visit to Beijing in February 1989. \c\cShortly after being elected president in 1980, Ronald Reagan made a speech criticizing the PRC and welcoming restoration of ties with Taiwan. These remarks aroused initial concern in Beijing, but Reagan's advisers quickly apologized for his comments, and the president-elect soon retracted them. Reagan's first two years in office saw some deterioration in US-China relations due to the president's vociferous anti-communism, as well as the inability of the two nations to come to a common understanding over the Korean conflict, the Israel–Palestine conflict, or the Falklands War. In 1982, Deng Xiaoping, in a reiteration of Mao Zedong's "Three Worlds" theory, criticized both the US and Soviet Union for imperialism. In 1983, there were quarrels over a Chinese tennis player, Hu Na, who defected to the US, and over an incident where an Olympic parade float in New York City displayed the flag of Taiwan rather than the PRC's flag. \c\cIn the period before the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, a growing number of cultural exchange activities gave the American and Chinese peoples broad exposure to each other's cultural, artistic, and educational achievements. Numerous mainland Chinese professional and official delegations visited the United States each month. Many of these exchanges continued after the suppression of the Tiananmen protests. \c\cSince the renewal of US-China relations in early 1979, the Taiwan issue remained a major source of contention. After the announcement of the intention to establish diplomatic relations with Mainland China (PRC) on 15 December 1978, the Republic of China (Taiwan) immediately condemned the United States, leading to rampant protests in both Taiwan and in the US. In April 1979, the US Congress signed into law the Taiwan Relations Act, permitting unofficial relations with Taiwan to flourish, on the one hand, yet the right of the US to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character, on the other. The expanding relationship that followed normalization was threatened in 1981 by PRC objections to the level of US arms sales to the Republic of China on Taiwan. Secretary of State Alexander Haig visited China in June 1981 in an effort to resolve Chinese concerns about America's unofficial relations with Taiwan. Vice President Bush visited the PRC in May 1982. Eight months of negotiations produced the US-PRC Joint Communiqué of 17 August 1982. In this third communiqué, the US stated its intention to gradually reduce the level of arms sales to the Republic of China, and the PRC described as a fundamental policy their effort to strive for a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan question. \c\cWhen Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, contention over the Taiwan issue intensified; President Trump became the first sitting US president since Jimmy Carter in 1979 to have any formal political or diplomatic contacts with Taiwan when he decided to receive a phone call from president Tsai Ing-Wen. Trump has expanded the duties of the US\' de facto embassy in Taipei-American Institute in Taiwan - by adding more security personnel, and has overseen increasing non-diplomatic visits of Tsai Ing-Wen and Congressmen to each other's countries/regions. In addition, American warships have reportedly crossed the Taiwan strait and increased military drills with Taiwan, which mainland China views as a direct threat to its sovereignty. The Taiwanese government has also warned the Solomon Islands not to switch recognition to the PRC as part of a bid to preserve its shrinking number of allies worldwide. \c\cAmericans who had been optimistic about the emergence of democratic characteristics in response to the rapid economic growth and China were stunned and disappointed by the brutal crackdown of the pro-democratic Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.  The U.S. and other governments enacted a number of measures against China's violation of human rights. The US suspended high-level official exchanges with the PRC and weapons exports from the US to the PRC. The US also imposed a number of economic sanctions. In the summer of 1990, at the G7 Houston summit, the West called for renewed political and economic reforms in mainland China, particularly in the field of human rights. \c\cTiananmen event disrupted the US-China trade relationship, and US investors\' interest in mainland China dropped dramatically. Tourist traffic fell off sharply. The Bush administration denounced the repression and suspended certain trade and investment programs on 5 and 20 June 1989, however Congress was responsible for imposing many of these actions, and the White House itself took a far less critical attitude of Beijing, repeatedly expressing hope that the two countries could maintain normalized relations. Some sanctions were legislated while others were executive actions. Examples include:\c\cThe US Trade and Development Agency (TDA): new activities in mainland China were suspended from June 1989 until January 2001, when President Bill Clinton lifted this suspension. \c\cOverseas Private Insurance Corporation (OPIC): new activities have been suspended since June 1989. \c\cDevelopment Bank Lending/International Monetary Fund (IMF) Credits: the United States does not support development bank lending and will not support IMF credits to the PRC except for projects that address basic human needs. \c\cMunitions List Exports: subject to certain exceptions, no licenses may be issued for the export of any defense article on the US Munitions List. This restriction may be waived upon a presidential national interest determination. \c\cArms Imports – import of defense articles from the PRC was banned after the imposition of the ban on arms exports to the PRC. The import ban was subsequently waived by the Administration and reimposed on 26 May 1994. It covers all items on the BATFE's Munitions Import List. During this critical period, J. Stapleton Roy, a career US Foreign Service Officer, served as ambassador to Beijing. \c\cAfter Tiananmen Square, Sino-US relations deteriorated sharply, falling to their worst since the 1960s, with Beijing accusing the US of "a decades-long conspiracy to subvert Chinese socialism".[This quote needs a citation] The 2+1⁄2 years from 1989 to 1992 also witnessed a revival of hard-line Maoist ideologies and increased paranoia by the PRC as communist regimes collapsed in Eastern Europe. Nonetheless, China continued to seek foreign business and investment. \c\cUS-China military ties and arms sales were abruptly terminated in 1989 and as of 2020 have never been restored. Chinese public opinion became more hostile to the United States after 1989, as typified by the 1996 manifesto China Can Say No. The angry authors called for Beijing to take more aggressive actions against the United States and Japan in order to build a stronger international position. The Chinese government at first endorsed the manifesto, then repudiated it as irresponsible. \c\cRunning for president in 1992, Bill Clinton sharply criticized his predecessor George H. W. Bush for prioritizing profitable trade relationships over human rights issues in China. As president, 1993–2001, however, Clinton backed away from his position. He did articulate a desired set of goals for China. They included free emigration, no exportation of goods made with prison labor, release of peaceful protesters, treatment of prisoners in terms of international standards, recognition of the distinct regional culture of Tibet, permitting international television and radio coverage, and observation of human rights specified by United Nations resolutions. China refused to comply, and by summer 1994 Clinton admitted defeat and called for a renewal of normalized trade relations. However congressional pressure, especially from the Republican Party, force Clinton to approve arms sales to Taiwan, despite the strong displeasure voiced by Beijing. \c\cIn 1993, the U.S. Navy stopped a Chinese container ship, the Yinhe, en route to Kuwait on international waters, held it in place for several weeks, alleging it was carrying precursors of chemical weapons for Iran, and eventually forced an inspection of the ship in Saudi Arabia.  However, no precursors of chemical weapons were found. This incident was viewed in China as international bullying by the United States. \c\cIn 1996, the People's Liberation Army conducted military exercises in the Taiwan Strait in an apparent effort to intimidate the Republic of China electorate before the pending presidential elections, triggering the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. The United States dispatched two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region. Subsequently, tensions in the Taiwan Strait diminished and relations between the US and the PRC improved, with increased high-level exchanges and progress on numerous bilateral issues, including human rights, nuclear proliferation, and trade. China's leader Jiang Zemin visited the United States in the fall of 1997, the first state visit to the US by a paramount leader since 1979. In connection with that visit, the two sides came to a consensus on implementation of their 1985 agreement on Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation, as well as a number of other issues. President Clinton visited the PRC in June 1998. He traveled extensively in mainland China, and had direct interaction with the Chinese people, including live speeches and a radio show which allowed the President to convey a sense of American ideals and values. President Clinton was criticized by some, however, for failing to pay adequate attention to human rights abuses in mainland China. \c\cRelations were damaged for a time by the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999, which was stated by the White House to be miscoordination between intelligence and the military, although which some Chinese believed to be deliberate. In any case, Beijing for several days was rocked by massive anti-US demonstrations. By the end of 1999, relations began to gradually improve. In October 1999, the two countries reached an agreement on compensation for families of those who were victims, as well as payments for damages to respective diplomatic properties in Belgrade and China. US-China relations in 1999 were also damaged by accusations that a Chinese-American scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory had given US nuclear secrets to Beijing. \c\cIn April 2001, a PLAAF J-8 fighter jet collided with a US Navy EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft flying south of the PRC in what became known as the Hainan Island incident. The EP-3 was able to make an emergency landing on PRC's Hainan Island despite extensive damage; the PRC aircraft crashed with the loss of its pilot, Wang Wei. The crew were detained by the PLA after destroying all classified documents pertaining to the aircraft's operation. Following extensive negotiations resulting in the "letter of the two sorries," the crew of the EP-3 was released from imprisonment and allowed to leave the PRC eleven days later. The US aircraft was returned by Beijing three months later in pieces, after which the relationship between the US and the PRC gradually improved once more. \c\cAs a presidential candidate in 2000, George W. Bush repeatedly criticized the Clinton-Gore administration for being too friendly with China, which he warned was a strategic competitor. Early on as president Bush increased arms sales to Taiwan, including 8 submarines. Bush's hostile position toward China was suddenly reversed after the September 11 terrorist attacks, and his friendly attitude toward Taiwan became a casualty. Soon he was calling China a strategic partner in the war on terror and postponing deals with Taiwan. \c\cTwo PRC citizens died in the attacks on the World Trade Center.  Chinese companies and individuals sent expressions of condolences to their American counterparts. The PRC, itself troubled by Muslim separatists in Xinjiang, offered strong public support for the War on Terror in APEC China 2001. The PRC voted in favor of UNSCR 1373, publicly supported the coalition campaign in Afghanistan, and contributed $150 million of bilateral assistance to Afghan reconstruction following the defeat of the Taliban. Shortly after the 11 September terrorist attacks, the US and PRC also commenced a counterterrorism dialogue. The third round of that dialogue was held in Beijing in February 2003. \c\cIn the United States, the threat of terrorist attacks by al-Qaeda greatly changed the nature of discourse. It was no longer plausible to argue, as the Blue Team had earlier asserted, that the PRC was the primary security threat to the United States, and the need to focus on the Middle East and the War on Terror made the avoidance of potential distractions in East Asia a priority for the United States. \c\cThere were initial fears among the PRC leadership that the war on terrorism would lead to an anti-PRC effort by the US, especially as the US began establishing bases in Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and renewed efforts against Iraq. Because of setbacks in America's Iraq campaign, these fears have largely subsided. The application of American power in Iraq and continuing efforts by the United States to cooperate with the PRC has significantly reduced the popular anti-Americanism that had developed in the mid-1990s. \c\cThe PRC and the US have also worked closely on regional issues, including those pertaining to North Korea and its nuclear weapons program. The People's Republic of China has stressed its opposition to North Korea's decision to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, its concerns over North Korea's nuclear capabilities, and its desire for a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula. It also voted to refer North Korea's noncompliance with its International Atomic Energy Agency obligations to the UN Security Council. \c\cTaiwan remains a volatile issue, but one that remains under control. The United States policy toward Taiwan has involved emphasizing the Four Noes and One Without. On occasion the United States has rebuked Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian for provocative pro-independence rhetoric. However, in 2005, the PRC passed the Anti-Secession Law which stated that the PRC would be prepared to resort to "non-peaceful means" if Taiwan declared formal independence. Many critics of the PRC, such as the Blue Team, argue that the PRC was trying to take advantage of the US war in Iraq to assert its claims on Republic of China's territory. In 2008, Taiwan voters elected Ma Ying-jeou. Ma, representing the Kuomintang, campaigned on a platform that included rapprochement with mainland China. His election has significant implications for the future of cross-strait relations. \c\cChina's paramount leader Hu Jintao visited the United States in April 2006. Bush visited Beijing in August for four days to attend  the 2008 Olympics. The president and his wife Laura were accompanied by Bush's father, the former president, and his mother Barbara. \c\cClark Randt, U.S. Ambassador to China from 2001 to 2008 examined "The State of U.S.-China Relations in a 2008 lecture at the USC U.S.-China Institute. \c\cA public opinion poll of the entire population of China conducted by Pew in spring 2008 shows:\c\cThe 2008 US presidential election centered on issues of war and economic recession, but candidates Barack Obama and John McCain also spoke extensively regarding US policy toward China. Both favored cooperation with China on major issues, but they differed with regard to trade policy. Obama expressed concern that the value of China's currency was being deliberately set low to benefit China's exporters. McCain argued that free trade was crucial and was having a transformative effect in China. Still, McCain noted that while China might have shared interests with the US, it did not share American values. \c\cThe election of Barack Obama in 2008 generated positive reactions from most locals and state-run media outlets in China. His presidency fostered hopes for increased co-operation and heightened levels of friendship between the two nations. On 8 November 2008, Hu Jintao and Barack Obama shared a phone conversation in which the Chinese President congratulated Obama on his election victory. During the conversation both parties agreed that the development of US-China relations is not only in the interest of both nations, but also in the interests of the world. \c\cOther organizations within China also held positive reactions to the election of Barack Obama, particularly with his commitment to revising American climate change policy. Greenpeace published an article detailing how Obama's victory would spell positive change for investment in the green jobs sector as part of a response to the financial crisis gripping the world at the time of Obama's inauguration. A number of organizations, including the US Departments of Energy and Commerce, non-governmental organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institution, and universities, have been working with Chinese counterparts to discuss ways to address climate change. Both US and Chinese governments have addressed the economic downturn with massive stimulus initiatives. The Chinese have expressed concern that "Buy American" components of the US plan discriminate against foreign producers, including those in China. \c\cAs the two most influential and powerful countries in the world, there have been increasingly strong suggestions within American political circles of creating a G-2 (Chimerica) relationship for the United States and China to work out solutions to global problems together. \c\cThe Strategic Economic Dialogue initiated by then-US President Bush and Chinese President Hu and led by US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi in 2006 was broadened by the Obama administration. Now called the U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, it is led by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and US Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner for the United States and Vice Premier Wang Qishan and Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo for China. The focus of the first set of meetings in July 2009 was in response to the economic crisis, finding ways to cooperate to stem global warming and addressing issues such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and humanitarian crises. \c\cUS President Barack Obama visited China on 15–18 November 2009 to discuss economic worries, concerns over nuclear weapon proliferation, and the need for action against climate change. The USC US-China Institute produced a digest of press comments on this visit and on earlier presidential trips. \c\cIn January 2010, the US proposed a $6.4 billion arms sale to the Republic of China (Taiwan). In response, the PRC threatened to impose sanctions on US companies supplying arms to Taiwan and suspend cooperation on certain regional and international issues. \c\cOn 19 February 2010, President Obama met with the Dalai Lama, accused by China of "fomenting unrest in Tibet." After the meeting, China summoned the US ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman, but Time has described the Chinese reaction as "muted," speculating that it could be because "the meeting came during the Chinese New Year... when most officials are on leave." Some activists criticized Obama for the relatively low profile of the visit. \c\cIn 2012, the PRC criticized Obama's new defense strategy, which it said was aimed at isolating China in the East Asian region. Obama is looking to increase US military influence in the area with a rotating presence of forces in friendly countries. \c\cIn March 2012, China suddenly began cutting back its purchases of oil from Iran, which along with some signs on sensitive security issues like Syria and North Korea, showed some coordination with the Obama administration. \c\cIn March 2013, the US and China agreed to impose stricter sanctions on North Korea for conducting nuclear tests, which sets the stage for UN Security Council vote. Such accord might signal a new level of cooperation between the US and China. \c\cIn an effort to build a "new model" of relations, President Obama met Paramount leader Xi Jinping for two days of meetings, between 6 and 8 June 2013, at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, California. The summit was considered "the most important meeting between an American president and a Chinese Communist leader in 40 years, since President Nixon and Chairman Mao," according to Joseph Nye, a political scientist at Harvard University. The leaders concretely agreed to combat climate change and also found strong mutual interest in curtailing North Korea's nuclear program. However, the leaders remained sharply divided over cyber espionage and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Xi was dismissive of American complaints about cyber security. Tom Donilon, the outgoing U.S. National Security Adviser, stated that cyber security "is now at the center of the relationship," adding that if China's leaders were unaware of this fact, they know now. \c\cObama has supported the One-China policy. In 2014, President Obama stated that "We recognize Tibet as part of the People's Republic of China. We are not in favor of independence."\c\cIn May 2015, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter warned China to halt its rapid island-building in the South China Sea. \c\cPresident Obama hosted Chinese leader Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China for a bilateral meeting on the margins of the Nuclear Security Summit on 31 March 2016. \c\cThe presidency of Donald Trump led to a shift in U.S. relations with China. \c\cPresident-elect Trump's telephone conversation with the president of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen on 2 December 2016 was the first such contact with Taiwan by an American president-elect or president since 1979. It provoked Beijing to lodge a diplomatic protest ("stern representations"). Trump went on to clarify his move by telling Fox News, "I fully understand the \'one China\' policy, but I don\'t know why we have to be bound by a \'one China\' policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade."\c\cOn Trump's inauguration day, an official from the People's Liberation Army wrote on the official website that the US's military build-up in Asia, and its push to arm South Korea with the THAAD missile-defense system were provocative "hot spots getting closer to ignition" and that the chances of war had become "more real". \c\cOn 23 January, speaking about China's claims to sovereignty over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, "It's a question of if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of China proper, then yeah, we\'re going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country."\c\cOn 4 January, on a visit to Japan, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed Washington's commitment under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan to defending Japan, including the Senkaku Islands (the East China Sea) that are claimed by China. \c\cOn 9 February, Trump spoke with China's leader Xi Jinping over the phone discussing a wide range of issues; Trump was said to have re-iterated the United States\' commitment to the status quo \'one-China\' policy. \c\cParamount leader Xi Jinping reiterated before President Trump, in a telephone conversation held between the two men on 3 July 2017, that "China-US relations have made great progress in recent days, but they have also been affected by some negative factors." By "negative factors," Geng Shuang, a Chinese government spokesmen, explained in a televised briefing: "Under the pretext of navigational freedom, the American side once again sent military vessels into the Chinese territorial waters of Xisha (Paracel) Islands. It has violated Chinese and international law, infringed upon Chinese sovereignty, and disrupted order, peace and security of the relevant waters and put in jeopardy facilities and personnel on the relevant Chinese islands. It is a serious political and military provocation. The Chinese side is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to the relevant actions by the US."\c\cOn 13 March 2018, the out-going US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, said: "Much work remains to establish a clear view of the nature of our future relationship with China, how shall we deal with one-another over the next fifty years, and ensure a period of prosperity for all of our peoples, free of conflict between two very powerful nations."\c\cChina enforced punitive tariffs on 128 categories of American goods on 1 April 2018 in retaliation for the Trump Administration's national-security levies on steel and aluminum imports the previous month. The Chinese Government's response is measured, affecting $3 billion in annual trade or about 2% of U.S. goods exports to China. By late September 2018, the Trump Administration had placed tariffs (25% tax increase) on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, in an attempt to offset the trade imbalance between the two countries. \c\cIn what put additional strain on US-China relations, Huawei's vice-chair and CFO Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada on 1 December 2018 at the behest of U.S. authorities. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse accused China of undermining U.S. national security interests, often "using private sector entities" to by-pass US sanctions against the sale of telecom equipment to Iran. \c\cAccording to political analyst, Andrew Leung, "China is perceived as the antagonist and rival of the United States," and that China's rise is seen as a "threat to the world order underpinned by American dominance or American values." He claimed, moreover, that the arrest of the CFO of Huawei on 1 December 2018 corresponded with the suspicious death on that same day of a leading Chinese-national quantum physicist and venture capitalist at Stanford University, Professor Shou-Cheng Zhang, who was on a H-1B visa, giving rise to conspiracy theories.  In August 2018, the U.S. government signed an update to legislation for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., broadening governmental scrutiny to vetting VC-backed, and especially Chinese state-funded, investments in U.S. tech startups. \c\cBoth sides signed the US–China Phase One trade deal on 15 January. Unlike other trade agreements, the agreement did not rely on arbitration through an intergovernmental organization like the World Trade Organization, but rather through a bilateral mechanism. \c\cMichael D. Swaine warned in 2019, "The often positive and optimistic forces, interests, and beliefs that sustained bilateral ties for decades are giving way to undue pessimism, hostility, and a zero-sum mindset in almost every area of engagement."\c\cAccording to two experts on US-China relations, Professor Rosemary Foot at Oxford University and Senior Lecturer Amy King at Australian National University, the consensus of experts is that:\c\cFoot and King emphasize China's aggressive efforts in developing cutting-edge technologies with significant military and commercial implications, while the United States sees the need to defend itself aggressively against technological theft. \c\cU.S. academics have made various policy prescriptions for the United States within the context of its deteriorating relationship with China. \c\cAccording to Hong Kong economics professor Lawrence J. Lau, a major cause of the deterioration is the growing battle between China and the U.S. for global economic and technological dominance. More generally, he argues, "It is also a reflection of the rise of populism, isolationism, nationalism and protectionism almost everywhere in the world, including in the US." According to Ian Bremmer, the U.S and China are in a technology cold war and Trump's technology war against the PRC has been his administration's biggest foreign policy win, saying, "on the issue of tech decoupling that it was America out front with most allies on board." According to Greg Autry, an academic at the University of Southern California, Trump's China policy was working, pointing to increased revenue intakes by the Treasury Department and offshoring by US manufacturing supply chains from China, and crediting the administration for being the first to fully recognize that globalization hadn\'t delivered for Americans and that China was an existential threat. \c\cFormer Obama administration officials Samantha Power and Susan Rice have criticized China's actions on trade, over the Meng Wenzhou affair and in Hong Kong while simultaneously criticizing the Trump administration for inadequate pushback. \c\cIn 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated a "China Initiative" to "combat economic espionage". One of the first studies of the impact of the initiative was published in 2020, concluding that how the initiative operates unfairly stigmatizes researchers of Chinese ethnicity, through implying "threat by association."\c\cIn 2019, a report of U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission suggested that everyone should stop calling the Chinese leader Xi Jinping by his title of "President," under Xi's one-party leadership and instead use the term General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. \c\cThe Director of Policy Planning at the United States Department of State, Kiron Skinner drew international attention in April 2019 for stating at a foreign policy forum that the U.S. competition with China would be especially bitter, because unlike the Cold War with the Soviet Union which is "a fight within the Western family", “it’s the first time that we will have a great-power competitor that is not Caucasian". \c\cOn 29 January 2020, the Interior Department's fleet of more than 800 Chinese-made drones, including those by DJI, were grounded, citing security concerns. \c\cOn 18 February 2020, the US government announced five Chinese state media firms would be designated "foreign missions," requiring them to be legally registered with the US government as a foreign government entity. On the following day, China took action against three American journalists with The Wall Street Journal by revoking their press credentials over a coronavirus opinion column which their paper had run. According to China, the column was racist and libelous; the CEO of the company that published the WSJ defended the article, as did the State department. A March 2020 article by Reuters said that Washington slashed the number of journalists allowed to work at U.S. offices of major Chinese media outlets to 100 from 160 due to Beijing's "long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists." In response, China expelled about a dozen American correspondents with The New York Times, News Corp's Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, which prompted criticism from the State Department. On 8 May, the US moved Chinese citizens at non-American news outlets from open-ended work visas to extendable 90-day work visas and in June the State Department designated a further four Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies. \c\cAmericans, especially older Republican voters, took an increasingly negative view of China and of Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping during the COVID-19 pandemic, expressing economic, human-rights, and environmental concerns. \c\cBy May 2020 relations had deteriorated as both sides were accusing the other of guilt for the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Washington has mobilized a campaign of investigations, prosecutions and export restrictions. Beijing, meanwhile, has stepped up military activities in the contested South China Sea, and launched denunciations of American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and publicly speculating that the American military deliberately unleashed the virus in China. In the growing aspersion, on 15 May 2020, the US blocked shipments of semi-conductors to Huawei, while China, for its part, has threatened to place Apple, Boeing, and other US firms on "unreliable entities" lists, and has blamed the US government of using state power under the excuse of national security, and of abusing export control measures to continuously oppress and contain specific enterprises of other countries. Orville Schell, the director of the Center on US-China Relations at the Asia Society, summed up the situation as follows: "The consequences of the breakdown in US-China relations is going to be very grave for the world and for the global economy because the ability of the US and China to work together was the keystone of the whole arch of globalization and global trade. With that pulled out, there's going to be a tremendous amount of disturbance."\c\cAmerican polls show the public has increasingly negative views of China. \c\cIn June 2020, US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft sent a letter to the U.N. secretary general explaining the US position on China's "excessive maritime claims."\c\cOn 17 June 2020, President Trump signed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which authorizes the imposition of U.S. sanctions against Chinese government officials responsible for detention camps holding more than 1 million members of the country's Uyghur Muslim minority. On 9 July 2020, the Trump administration imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, including Chen Quanguo, a member of China's powerful Politburo. \c\cA research paper by the Begin–Sadat Center for Strategic Studies said that Chinese state-controlled media enthusiastically covered the protests and rioting attending the murder of George Floyd, comparing the American protests to the protests in Hong Kong and used the rioting and violence in the US as evidence that the democratic system was hypocritical and morally bankrupt. A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said that racial tensions in the United States was a key area of focus for "a campaign of cross-platform inauthentic activity, conducted by Chinese-speaking actors\c\cand broadly in alignment with the political goal of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to denigrate the standing of the US."\c\cIn July 2020, FBI Director Christopher Wray called China the "greatest long-term threat" to the United States. He said that "the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours. Of the nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases currently under way across the country, almost half are related to China."\c\cA July 2020 article by Larry Diamond asserted the end of China's peaceful rise, saying that while two generations of American scholars held out hope that China would become a responsible stakeholder, in 2020, those hopes had been dashed. \c\cIn July 2020, the Trump administration ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston. In response, the Chinese government ordered the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu. \c\cOn 20 July 2020, the United States sanctioned 11 Chinese companies, restricting any trade deal with America for what the US government said was their involvement in human rights violations in Xinjiang, China, accusing them specifically of using Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in forced labor. \c\cOn 23 July 2020, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the end of what he called "blind engagement" with the Chinese government. He also criticized Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as "a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology."\c\cIn August 2020, Washington imposed sanctions on 11 Hong Kong and Chinese officials over what it said was their role in curtailing political freedoms in Hong Kong through the imposition of the Hong Kong national security law; China retaliated  by sanctioning 6 Republican lawmakers and 5 individuals at non-profit and rights groups. American lawmakers have introduced a bill to change the way the federal government refers to the general secretary of the CCP, prohibiting the use of the term "president". \c\cIn September 2020 the United States had under a 29 May presidential proclamation revoked more than 1,000 visas for PRC students and researchers visas who the US government said had ties to the Chinese military in order to prevent them from stealing and otherwise appropriating sensitive research. \c\cOn 26 September 2020, the US Commerce Department put restrictions on Chinese chip maker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), following which the suppliers were required to have an export license for exporting the chip. The restrictions were imposed after the US concluded that an "unacceptable risk" equipment supplied to SMIC could potentially be used for military purposes. \c\cOn 1 October 2020, U.S. Congressman Scott Perry introduced legislation to add the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the Top International Criminal Organizations Target (TICOT) List and provide the United States law enforcement agencies a strategic directive to target the CCP's malign activity. \c\cOn 6 October 2020, Germany's ambassador to the UN, on behalf of the group of 39 countries including Germany, the U.K. and the U.S., made a statement to denounce China for its treatment of ethnic minorities and for curtailing freedoms in Hong Kong. \c\cOn 9 October 2020, the Department of Justice disallowed the use of its fund to purchase DJI drones, which the DoJ classified as a "Covered Foreign Entity."\c\cAccording to sources, the State Department suggested President Trump to include China's Ant Group to its trade blacklist, following concerns regarding access to banking data of future users. \c\cOn October 21, 2020, the US approved arms sales of $1.8 billion to Taiwan. It involved three packages that included high technology weapons such as SLAM-ER missiles, HIMARS M142 Launchers and Recce Pods. On 26 October 2020, China announced its intentions to impose sanctions on US businesses and individuals, including Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. Taiwan welcomed the arms sales and disapproved of the sanctions. Taiwan also said it would continue buying arms from America. \c\cOn 27 October 2020, the United States and India signed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), enabling greater information-sharing and further defense cooperation, to counter China's growing military power in the region. \c\cA December 2020 report stated that U.S. intelligence officials assessed that China had supervised a bounty program paying Afghan militants to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. \c\cOn 5 December 2020, the U.S. State department ended five cultural exchange programs with China, which are - “the Policymakers Educational China Trip Program, the U.S.-China Friendship Program, the U.S.-China Leadership Exchange Program, the U.S.-China Transpacific Exchange Program and the Hong Kong Educational and Cultural Program.” They described these programs as soft power propaganda tools of Chinese government. \c\cIn December 2020, an investigation by Axios was published that detailed the suspected activities of Christine Fang, a Chinese national who has been suspected by U.S. officials of having conducted political espionage for the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) while she was in the United States from 2011 to 2015. While Fang's suspected activities prior to the Axios investigation had already drawn scrutiny from federal law enforcement agencies, the subsequent reactions to its publication drew further scrutiny from politicians and the media. \c\cOn 19 January 2021, Mike Pompeo officially declared that China is committing a genocide against Uighurs in the Xinjiang region. Pompeo called for “all appropriate multilateral and relevant juridical bodies, to join the United States in our effort to promote accountability for those responsible for these atrocities." Salih Hudayar, the prime minister of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile (who claim to be the legitimate government of Xinjiang), has said, “We hope that this designation will lead to real strong actions to hold China accountable and bring an end to China’s genocide."\c\cRelations with the new Biden administration in 2021 included heightened tensions over trade, technology, and human rights, particularly regarding Hong Kong, and the treatment of minorities in China. In addition international tensions regarding control of the South China Sea remained high. However the Biden and Xi administrations agreed to collaborate on long-term projects regarding climate change, nuclear proliferation, and the global COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cOn 20 January 2021, China imposed sanctions against outgoing US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former secretary of health and human services Alex Azar, former under secretary of state Keith J. Krach, outgoing US ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft, and 24 other former Trump officials. Biden's National Security Council called the sanctions "unproductive and cynical." In his nomination hearing, Blinken endorsed Pompeo's report that China is committing a genocide against Uyghur Muslims, reaffirming Biden's campaign stance. \c\cWith respect to "China policy," Biden plans to continue Trump's strict, hardline policy, but take a more collaborative, multilateral approach to China by enlisting the support of American allies, to maximize leverage on Beijing in matters relating to security and economic growth. This is seen as a departure from the bellicose rhetoric and unilateral approach taken by the previous Trump administration. In late January 2021, China's Ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, reasserted China's long-standing position of seeking peaceful coexistence with the United States, and called out to the new American administration to address differences through dialogue. \c\cThe new American Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, called-out China on its treatment of the ethnic Uighurs. President Biden, in his first foreign policy address, labeled China as "the most serious competitor" to the US. During his first visit to the Pentagon on 9 February 2021, Biden urged the United States Department of Defense to review its national security policy concerning China. \c\cOn 22 February 2021, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Biden to lift the multiple sanctions imposed by Trump, including restrictions on trade and people-to-people contact. He also called for the new administration to stop interfering in China's internal affairs. \c\cOn March 18–19, 2021, bilateral talks in Alaska took place. Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan met with Politburo member Yang Jiechi and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. The Americans unleashed heated attacks on China's policies regarding human rights, cyberattacks, Taiwan, and its crackdown in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. The Chinese side countered that the U.S. "does not have the qualification... to speak to China from a position of strength", that the U.S. does not serve as a model to others, and that China's "development and strengthening is unstoppable". In the week ahead of the talks, the administration met with U.S. allies in Asia and imposed sanctions on senior Chinese officials. \c\cIn June 2021 the Chinese Defense Ministry described a short visit to Taiwan by three US Senators as an “extremely vile political provocation.”\c\cAt their annual meeting on June 13, 2021, leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) democracies sharply criticized China for a series of abuses. The G7 nations—the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan—had been hesitant about acting separately. Pressured by US President Joe Biden they unanimously agreed on a sharp criticism, followed the next day by a similar strong unanimous attack by NATO members.  The criticisms focused on the mistreatment of the Muslim Uyghur minority,  the systematic destruction of democracy in Hong Kong, repeated military threats against Taiwan, unfair trade practices, and lack of transparency regarding the origins of COVID-19. China has rejected all criticism of what it considers to be strictly internal policy matters. On the other hand, the constellation of critics is essential to the Chinese economy in terms of jobs, investments and purchases of its huge quantity of exports. \c\cIn July 2021, the US Commerce Department enlisted 34 foreign firms to an export blacklist, of which 23 were from China and were tied to the genocide against the Uyghur Muslim minorities. The sanctions were imposed on these firms for “acting contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States”. Other blacklisted companies were based in Iran, Russia, the UAE, the UK, Singapore, Lebanon, Canada, the Netherlands, Pakistan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey. \c\cIn August 2021, China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile, hypothesized as part of a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System, that circled the globe before speeding towards its target. The Financial Times reported that "the test showed that China had made astounding progress on hypersonic weapons and was far more advanced than U.S. officials realized."\c\cIn September 2021, Biden urged Xi not to "veer into conflict," while agreeing to engage "openly and straightforwardly" amid US frustration at lack of progress in relations. \c\cOn 6 October 2021, a high level meeting between US national security adviser Jake Sullivan and top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi in Zürich, Switzerland focused on a number of contentious aspects of Chinese-American relations, including the existence of Taiwan, trade disputes, the COVID-19 origin theories, as well as civic freedoms in Hong Kong. Despite continued differences between the two nations on these issues, both sides agreed to continue their cooperation "in the spirit of fair and peaceful competition". \c\cOn 21 October 2021, President Biden said the U.S. would defend Taiwan if China attacked. \c\cBiden held his first virtual meeting with Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping on November 15, 2021. \c\cIn 1991, China only accounted for 1% of total imports to the United States.  For many years, China was the most important country which required an annual waiver to maintain free trade status. The waiver for the PRC had been in effect since 1980. Every year between 1989 and 1999, legislation was introduced in Congress to disapprove the President's waiver. The legislation had sought to tie free trade with China to meeting certain human rights conditions that go beyond freedom of emigration. All such attempted legislation failed to pass. The requirement of an annual waiver was inconsistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization, and for the PRC to join the WTO, Congressional action was needed to grant permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) to China. This was accomplished in 2000 (United States–China Relations Act of 2000), allowing China to join WTO in 2001. China's most favoured nation (MFN) status was made permanent on 27 December 2001. \c\cSince the entry of China into the WTO in December 2001, the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs has accelerated (the China shock). The Economic Policy Institute estimated that the trade deficit with China cost about 2.7 million jobs between 2001 and 2011, including manufacturing and other industries. \c\cThe PRC and the US resumed trade relations in 1972 and 1973. Direct investment by the US in mainland China covers a wide range of manufacturing sectors, several large hotel projects, restaurant chains, and petrochemicals. US companies have entered agreements establishing more than 20,000 equity joint ventures, contractual joint ventures, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises in mainland China. More than 100 US-based multinationals have projects in mainland China, some with multiple investments. Cumulative US investment in mainland China is valued at $48 billion. The US trade deficit with mainland China exceeded $350 billion in 2006 and was the United States\' largest bilateral trade deficit. Some of the factors that influence the U.S. trade deficit with mainland China include:\c\cUS Import Valuation Overcounts China: there has been a shift of low-end assembly industries to mainland China from newly industrialized countries in Asia. Mainland China has increasingly become the last link in a long chain of value-added production. Because US trade data attributes the full value of a product to the final assembler, mainland Chinese value added is overcounted. \c\cUS demand for labor-intensive goods exceeds domestic output: the PRC has restrictive trade practices in mainland China, which include a wide array of barriers to foreign goods and services, often aimed at protecting state-owned enterprises. These practices include high tariffs, lack of transparency, requiring firms to obtain special permission to import goods, inconsistent application of laws and regulations, and leveraging technology from foreign firms in return for market access. Mainland China's accession to the World Trade Organization is meant to help address these barriers. \c\cThe undervaluation of the Renminbi relative to the United States dollar. \c\cBeginning in 2009, the US and China agreed to hold regular high-level talks about economic issues and other mutual concerns by establishing the Strategic Economic Dialogue, which meets biannually. Five meetings have been held, the most recent in December 2008. Economic nationalism seems to be rising in both countries, a point the leaders of the two delegations noted in their opening presentations. The United States and China have also established the high-level US-China Senior Dialogue to discuss international political issues and work out resolutions. \c\cIn September 2009 a trade dispute emerged between the United States and China, which came after the US imposed tariffs of 35 percent on Chinese tire imports. The Chinese commerce minister accused the United States of a "grave act of trade protectionism," while a USTR spokesperson said the tariff "was taken precisely in accordance with the law and our international trade agreements." Additional issues were raised by both sides in subsequent months. \c\cWhen a country joins the World Trade Organization they commit to keep their Tariffs beneath the bound rate, which is generally around 39 percent.  China's reaction is due to the fact that nations usually keep their Tariffs at an average of 9 percent, but when the U.S raised their Tariff on Chinese imported tires to 35 percent, it was still below the average bound rate. \c\cPascal Lamy cautioned: "The statistical bias created by attributing commercial value to the last country of origin perverts the true economic dimension of the bilateral trade imbalances. This affects the political debate, and leads to misguided perceptions. Take the bilateral deficit between China and the US. A series of estimates based on true domestic content can cut the overall deficit – which was $252bn in November 2010 – by half, if not more."\c\cIn early 2012, a dispute over rare earth minerals was brought into the light between the two countries. President Obama made an announcement that the United States would be one of a few countries to file a dispute with China.  Amongst the United States, Japan and other Western European countries would also be filing disputes as well.  This is simply just one of few disputes between the United States and China.  It is believed by many experts, including Chris Isidore, a writer for CNN Money, that "any one of the disputes could damage the economies of both countries as well as the relationship between them."  The dispute was filed, and China was charged with putting unfair restrictions on the exportation of rare earth minerals.  These minerals were crucial and in high demand by all countries.  President Obama believed the United States should have those minerals in the United States whereas China disagreed.  China denied all of the said charges brought forth "saying its rules are defensible on grounds of environmental and economic sustainability, and suggests there would be consequences if the United States presses the case."  It is important to understand the relationship between the United States and China, especially economically.  There is not one without the other.  China's state news agency commented that "past experiences have shown that policymakers in Washington should treat such issues with more prudence, because maintaining sound China-U.S. trade relations is in the fundamental interests of both sides"\c\cChina was the biggest trading partner of the United States until 2019, when it dropped to the third place because of the ongoing trade war. \c\cIn November 2021, U.S. producer Venture Global LNG signed a twenty-year contract with China's state-owned Sinopec to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG)." China's imports of U.S. natural gas will more than double. U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas to China and other Asian countries surged in 2021, with Asian buyers willing to pay higher prices than European importers. \c\cChina has been a currency manipulator during the 21st century. Economist C. Fred Bergsten, writing for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that, between 2003 and 2014, "China bought more than $300 billion annually to resist upward movement of its currency by artificially keeping the exchange rate of the dollar strong and the renminbi's exchange rate weak. China's competitive position was thus strengthened by as much as 30 to 40 percent at the peak of the intervention. Currency manipulation explained most of China's large trade surpluses, which reached a staggering 10 percent of its entire GDP in 2007." During this period, China's currency manipulation was a point of conflict with the United States. Domestic leaders within the United States pressured the Obama administration to take a hard-line stance against China and compel them to raise the value of their currency, and legislation was introduced to the United States Congress calling on the President to impose tariffs on Chinese imports until China properly values its currency. \c\cSince 2014, the situation changed dramatically, as China stopped artificially deflating its currency, as the growth in the Chinese economy slowed and Chinese investors made more investments outside the country, leading to a drop in the yuan's value in relation to the dollar, as well as a decline in China's reserves. \c\cIn August 2019, US Treasury designated China as a currency manipulator. However, it removed the designation on 13 January 2020, as part of efforts to reach a trade deal on the ongoing trade war. \c\cChina is a major creditor and the second largest foreign holder of US public debt and has been critical of US deficits and fiscal policy, advising for policies that maintain the purchasing value of the dollar, although it had few options other than to continue to buy United States Treasury bonds. China condemned the US monetary policy of quantitative easing, responding to S&P's downgrade of U.S. credit rating, and advised the United States not to continue with the accumulation of debt, concluding with the statement that America cannot continue to borrow to solve financial problems. \c\cThe PRC's investment in its military is growing rapidly. The United States, along with independent analysts, remains convinced that the PRC conceals its real extent of its military spending. According to its government, China spent $45 billion on defense in 2007. In contrast, the United States had a $623-billion budget for the military in 2008, $123 billion more than the combined military budgets of all other countries in the world. Some very broad US estimates maintain that the PRC military spends between $85 billion and $125 billion. According to official figures, the PRC spent $123 million on defense per day in 2007. In comparison, the US spent $1.7 billion ($1,660 million) per day that year. \c\cConcerns over the Chinese military budget may come from US worries that the PRC is attempting to threaten its neighbors or to challenge the United States. Concerns have been raised that China is developing a large naval base near the South China Sea and has diverted resources from the People's Liberation Army Ground Force to the People's Liberation Army Navy and to air force and missile development. \c\cAndrew Scobell wrote that under President Hu, objective civilian control and oversight of the PLA appears to be weakly applied. \c\cOn 27 October 2009, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates praised the steps China has taken to increase transparency of defense spending. In June 2010, however, he said that the Chinese military was resisting efforts to improve military-to-military relations with the United States. Gates also said that the United States would "assert freedom of navigation" in response to Chinese complaints about US Navy deployments in international waters near China. Admiral Michael Mullen said that the United States sought closer military ties to China but would continue to operate in the western Pacific. \c\cA recent report stated that five of the six US Air Force bases in the area are potentially vulnerable to Chinese missiles, and it called for increased defenses. \c\cMeanwhile, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists wrote in a 2010 report that the Chinese continue to invest in modernization of their nuclear forces because they perceive that their deterrent force is vulnerable to American capabilities and that further improvement in American missile defenses will drive further Chinese spending in that area. \c\cChinese Defense Minister Liang Guanglie said that China is 20 years behind the United States in military technology. \c\cThe International Institute for Strategic Studies, in a 2011 report, argued that if spending trends continue, China will achieve military equality with the United States in 15–20 years. \c\cA 2012 article in the Wall Street Journal said that China was developing capacity for attacking satellites and for cyberwarfare. \c\cIn 2012, it was reported that the United States would invite a team of senior Chinese logisticians to discuss the possibility of the first logistics co-operation agreement between the two countries. \c\cProfessor James R. Holmes, a specialist on China at the US Naval War College, has said that China's investments towards a potential future conflict are closer to those of the United States than may first appear because the Chinese understate their spending, the internal price structures of the two countries are different, and the Chinese need to concentrate only on projecting military force a short distance from their own shores. The balance may shift to the advantage of the Chinese very quickly if they continue double-digit annual growth, and the US and their allies cut back. \c\cIn line with power transition theory, the idea that "wars tend to break out... when the upward trajectory of a rising power comes close to intersecting the downward trajectory of a declining power," some have argued that conflict between China, an emerging power, and the United States, the current superpower, is all but inevitable. \c\cIn 2003, the United States declared that despite some positive momentum that year and greater signs that the People's Republic of China was willing to engage with the US and others on human rights, there was still serious backsliding. China has acknowledged in principle the importance of protection of human rights and claimed to have taken steps to bring its own human rights practices into conformity with international norms. Among those steps are the signing of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in October 1997, which was ratified in March 2001, and the signing of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in October 1998, which has not yet been ratified. In 2002, China released a significant number of political and religious prisoners and agreed to interact with UN experts on torture, arbitrary detention, and religion. However, international human rights groups assert that there has been virtually no movement on those promises,[citation needed] with more people having been arrested for similar offences since then. Those groups maintain that China still has a long way to go in instituting the kind of fundamental systemic change that will protect the rights and liberties of all its citizens in Mainland China. The US State Department publishes an annual report on human rights around the world, which includes an evaluation of China's human rights record. \c\cIn a decision that was criticized by human rights groups, the US State Department did not list China as one of the world's worst human rights violators in its 2007 report of human rights practices in countries and regions outside the United States. However, the assistant secretary of the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Jonathan D. Farrar stated that China's overall human rights record in 2007 remained poor. \c\cSince 1998, China has annually published a White Paper detailing the human rights abuses by the United States and since 2005 has also published a White Paper on its own political system and democratic progress. \c\cOn 27 February 2014, the United States released its China report on human rights practices for 2013, which, according to its executive summary, described the PRC as an authoritarian state and a place in which repression and coercion were routine. On 28 February 2014, China published a report on human rights in the United States that cited surveillance on its own citizens, mistreatment of inmates, gun violence, and homelessness, despite having a vibrant economy, as important issues. \c\cUS criticism of China on human rights, especially on the issue of the Xinjiang re-education camps, significantly expanded at the end of 2018 and in 2019. In March 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indirectly compared China to the Nazi Germany by saying that the roundup of Muslim minorities to into camps had not been seen "since the 1930s." In May 2019, the United States government accused China of putting Uyghurs in "concentration camps." The US government has also considered sanctioning Chinese officials involved in the camps, including Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party Secretary of Xinjiang and a member of the 19th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party although no Chinese Politburo member has ever been sanctioned by the US government. In July 2019, Vice President Mike Pence accused China of persecuting Christians, Muslims and Buddhists. \c\cOn 4 October 2019, the Houston Rockets\' general manager, Daryl Morey, issued a tweet that supported the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Morey's tweet resulted in the Chinese Basketball Association's suspension of its relationship with the Houston Rockets and the issuance of a statement of dissatisfaction from the consulate office of China in Houston. On 6 October, both Morey and the NBA issued separate statements addressing the original tweet. Morey said that he never intended his tweet to cause any offense, and the NBA said the tweet was "Regrettable." The statements were criticized by US politicians and third-party observers for the perceived exercise of economic statecraft by the PRC and insufficiency of the NBA's defense of Morey's tweet. Critics also contrasted the league's disparate response to Morey's tweet with its history of political activism and compared the incident to an 2 October South Park episode "Band in China" which parodies the self-censorship of the American entertainment industry to meet PRC censorship demands. The statements also drew criticism from PRC state-run media for their perceived insufficiency, as Morey did not apologize. \c\cIn June 2020, the White House on 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, asked Beijing to respect human rights, carry out its due commitments \c\con Hong Kong, as well as flog persecution of ethnic and religious minorities. On 9 July 2020, the United States announced sanctions against Chinese politicians, who as per its record were responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. \c\cOn 20 July 2020, US government sanctioned 11 new Chinese companies from purchasing American technology and products over human rights violations in China targeting Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region. \c\cMany American companies, including Delta Air Lines, Coach New York, Marriott International, Calvin Klein and Tiffany & Co. have apologized to China after "offending" the country and China's ruling Communist Party. \c\cOn September 15, 2020, the US government decided to take steps to block some exports from China's Xinjiang region, over the country's alleged human rights abuses directed mostly against the Muslim Uyghurs minority group of the region. \c\cIn 2020, Chinese diplomats increasingly adopted "wolf warrior diplomacy" to deny all accusations of human rights abuses. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian tweeted that as long as the US had problems itself, it "had no right" to criticize China on human rights abuses. \c\cOn January 19, 2021, outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that China is committing a genocide against the Uighurs and crimes against humanity. In a written letter, Pompeo wrote, “I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state.” Pompeo called for “all appropriate multilateral and relevant juridical bodies, to join the United States in our effort to promote accountability for those responsible for these atrocities." China strongly denies that human rights abuses are going on in Xinjiang. Pompeo has previously stated that China is trying to "erase its own citizens." Salih Hudayar, the prime minister of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile (who claim to be the legitimate government of Xinjiang), has said, “We hope that this designation will lead to real strong actions to hold China accountable and bring an end to China’s genocide." Antony Blinken, Joe Biden's nominee for Secretary of State, said that he agrees with Pompeo's assessment. \c\cAround the time of President Biden's inauguration on the 20th, China announced sanctions against Pompeo and 27 other former officials as well as their immediate family members. China accused them of having "planned, promoted and executed” interfering with China's internal affairs. The sanctions bar them from entering China, Hong Kong or Macau. It has also restricted companies associated with them from doing business in China. A spokesperson for Biden's National Security Council called the sanctions "unproductive and cynical."\c\cChina's economic rise has led to some geo-political friction between the US and China in East Asia as well as to an extent in Southeast Asia and in Central Asia including Afghanistan. For example, in response to China's response to the bombardment of Yeonpyeong by North Korea, "Washington is moving to redefine its relationship with South Korea and Japan, potentially creating an anti-China bloc in Northeast Asia that officials say they don\'t want but may need." The Chinese government fears a conspiracy by the US to encircle it.[better source needed]\c\cChina and the US have recently led competing efforts to gain influence in Asian trade and development.  In 2015, China led the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank with the goal of financing projects that would spur the development of the lower-tier Asian economies, thus facilitating improved economic ties across the region. It has been suggested that the United States considered the AIIB to be a challenge to the US-backed Asian Development Bank and the World Bank and saw the Chinese effort as an attempt to set the global economic agenda on terms that would be formulated by the Chinese government. The Obama administration led an effort to enact the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, a multilateral trade pact between a number of Pacific Rim countries, which excluded China. According to the US Trade Representative, the agreement was designed to "promote economic growth; support the creation and retention of jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in the signatories\' countries; and promote transparency, good governance, and enhanced labor and environmental protections."  The Partnership was anticipated to impose costs on businesses dependent on regional markets. The deal was placed on hold after the US withdrew from the agreement on 23 January 2017. The efforts are among the attempts by both the US and China to increase their influence over the Asia-Pacific by strengthening their economic ties within the region. \c\cIn 2009, the United States requested China to open the Wakhjir Pass on the Afghan-Chinese border as an alternative supply route for the U.S. and NATO in their campaign in Afghanistan. China chose to refuse the request. \c\cAccording to an article published in Jura Gentium, Journal of Philosophy of International Law and Global Politics, there is a "new Sphere of Influence 2" that is shaped mainly by China and the US. Even on social media, if Western, Japanese, and South Korean events and daily life are linked through Facebook, Chinese and American habits and customs are disconnected by the lack of sharing on social media.[citation needed][original research?] That strategy to avoid American influences from social networks is preserved by the Chinese government.[citation needed]\c\cIn response to increased American drone strikes against militants in Pakistan's border areas during the Obama administration, the PRC offered additional fighter jets to Pakistan.[better source needed]\c\cCountries in Southeast Asia have responded to Chinese claims for sea areas by seeking closer relations with the United States. American Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that in spite of budget pressures, the United States would expand its influence in the region to counter China's military buildup. \c\cOn 7 June 2013, Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East–West Center in Honolulu, argued in The Diplomat that the United States and China must stop striving for trust but instead emphasize verification: "The argument that trust leads to peace is built on the premise that the suspicions between China and the U.S. are unfounded and would evaporate with more and deeper dialogue. Unfortunately, however, at least some of these suspicions are all too warranted." Whether international law should govern regional affairs in Asia, whether China should be allowed to make expansive sovereignty claims, and what the future strategic roles of South Korea and Japan should be are issues that Roy considers to be irreconcilable between China and the US and so strategic trust is not attainable. "The two countries should strive to manage their inevitable bilateral strategic tensions by reaching agreements where both see a benefit and where compliance is measurable... for these inherent rivals and potential adversaries, the emphasis belongs on \'verify,\' not \'trust.\'"\c\cIn the context of US-China relations, a potential application of MAR would be the US pledging not to move its forces into North Korea in the event of a regime collapse, which could be followed by a commitment from China not to move its troops to the Demilitarized Zone in that event. \c\cThe problems between the US and China continue to grow in 2021 with President Joe Biden having ordered a review by the US intelligence to assess the possibility of the coronavirus being engineered in a laboratory in China, the likelihood of which had already been under investigation by the WHO. In June 2020, the tensions between the US and China saw a similar intensification when an offer made by the UAE to test the staff at the US embassy was ‘politely declined’ due to its developing ties with China, a country known for abusing human rights. The company in question was a result of the joint venture between China's BGI headed by Wang Jian and UAE's G42 chaired by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, both accused in the past of abusing user/patient data privacy, a violation of human rights. The influence of China over the UAE jeopardized its reputation with the States, a western ally whose then-President had long been in a verbal conflict with his Beijing counterpart. The offer was declined considering the involvement of Chinese firms and technologies that became a highly potential point of concern for the patient's privacy. \c\cThe US Department of Justice investigation into fundraising activities uncovered evidence that Chinese agents sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the 1996 presidential campaign. The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., was used to co-ordinate contributions to the DNC. \c\cIn 2014, Chinese hackers hacked the computer system of the US Office of Personnel Management, resulting in the theft of approximately 22 million personnel records that were handled by the office. Former FBI Director James Comey stated, "It is a very big deal from a national security perspective and from a counterintelligence perspective. It's a treasure trove of information about everybody who has worked for, tried to work for, or works for the United States government."\c\cIn October 2018, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on the threat to the US posed by China. Before the hearing, Bloomberg released an article that stated that China is embedding technology in microchips that are sent to America that collect data on American consumers. However, both FBI Director Christopher Wray and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen declined to confirm that statement. Nielsen said that China has become a major threat to the US and also confirmed, in an answer to a question from a senator, that China is trying to influence US elections. \c\cIn 2019, two Chinese nationals were indicted for the Anthem medical data breach. About 80 million company records were hacked, stoking fears that the stolen data could be used for identity theft. In February 2020, the United States government indicted members of China's PLA for hacking into Equifax and plundering sensitive data as part of a massive heist that also included stealing trade secrets. Private records of more than 145 million Americans were compromised in the 2017 Equifax data breach. \c\cThe Voice of America reported in April 2020 that "Internet security researchers say there have already been signs that China-allied hackers have engaged in so-called "spear-phishing" attacks on American political targets" ahead of the 2020 United States elections. \c\cAs of 7 July 2020, the U.S. government was \'looking at\' banning Chinese video streaming application, TikTok due to national security concerns. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration had been aware of the potential threat and has "worked on this issue for a long time". On 19 September 2020, a complaint was filed in Washington by TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, challenging the recent moves made by the Trump administration to prevent the application from operating in the US. The court documents argued that the US government took the step for political reasons rather than to stop an "unusual and extraordinary threat". \c\cIn relation to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on politics, the Trump administration referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", terms which have been criticized for being racist and "distract[ing] from the Trump administration's failure to contain the disease". In return, some Chinese officials, including Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier acknowledgement of the coronavirus outbreak starting in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories that the virus originated in the U.S. or Italy.The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government cable outlining a communications strategy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, quoted as "Everything is about China. We\'re being told to try and get this messaging out in any way possible". Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly been pressured by the Trump administration to find intelligence supporting conspiracy theories regarding the origins of the virus in China. \c\cAccording to a New York Times report in April 2020, the U.S. intelligence community says China intentionally under-reported its number of coronavirus cases. Some outlets such as Politico and Foreign Policy have said China's efforts to send aid to virus-stricken countries is part of a propaganda push for global influence. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned there is "a geo-political component including a struggle for influence through spinning and the \'politics of generosity\'". Borrell also said "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the U.S., it is a responsible and reliable partner." China has also called for the U.S. to lift its sanctions from Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries. Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3. Trade in medical supplies between the United States and China has also become politically complicated. Exports of face masks and other medical equipment to China from the United States (and many other countries) spiked in February, according to statistics from Trade Data Monitor, prompting criticism from The Washington Post that the United States government failed to anticipate the domestic needs for that equipment. Similarly, The Wall Street Journal, citing Trade Data Monitor to show that China is the leading source of many key medical supplies, raised concerns that US tariffs on imports from China threaten imports of medical supplies into the United States. The trade war between China and the US alongside Beijing's behavior during the COVID-19 crisis have combined to worsen American public opinion about China. \c\cOn September 22, 2020, Donald Trump called on the United Nations to "hold China accountable for their actions", in a speech to the world body's General Assembly. President Trump blamed the Chinese government for the global spread of COVID-19, which had infected 31 million people worldwide and killed more than 965,000, by then.
General elections will be held in Tonga on 18 November 2021, to elect 17 of the 26 seats to the Legislative Assembly of Tonga. A final result is expected on election night at 10pm (UTC+13:00). \c\cThe 2017 general elections results in a landslide victory for the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands, and ʻAkilisi Pōhiva was re-elected as Prime Minister, defeating former Deputy Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni 14 votes to 12. In September 2019 Pohiva died, and Pohiva Tuʻiʻonetoa was elected as Prime Minister with the support of the nobles, independent MPs, and 5 former members of the DPFI. His cabinet included three nobles, who had previously been excluded under Pohiva. \c\cIn December 2020 Democratic party leader Semisi Sika submitted a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Tuʻiʻonetoa. The motion was backed by Deputy Prime Minister Sione Vuna Fa'otusia, who subsequently resigned from Cabinet. The Legislative Assembly rejected the no-confidence motion 13-9 on 12 January 2021. \c\cThe Legislative Assembly of Tonga has up to 30 members, of which 17 are directly elected by first-past-the-post voting from single-member constituencies. The island of Tongatapu has ten constituencies, Vavaʻu three, Haʻapai two and ʻEua and Niuatoputapu/Niuafoʻou one each. Nine seats are held by members of the nobility who elect representatives amongst themselves. The Cabinet formed by a Prime Minister may include up to four members not elected to the Assembly, who then automatically become members of the legislature. \c\cParliament was dissolved on 16 September. 75 candidates, including 12 women, registered to contest the election. One candidate, Sione Fonua, later withdrew, while a second one died, leaving 73 candidates in total. Despite a week-long lockdown due to a COVID-19 case, the election was not delayed."}
COVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines are series of stay-at-home orders and cordon sanitaire measures implemented by the government of the Philippines through its Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). \c\cThere are two active measures implemented in the Philippines: the original classification system introduced in 2020 which had four main tiers of quarantine at its peak and the alert level system (ALS) introduced in Metro Manila in September 2021. The country is gradually shifting to the latter system. \c\cIn the original classification system, the strictest community quarantines is the "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ), which effectively is a total lockdown. \c\cGiven the rapidly increasing number of cases in Metro Manila, Albay 2nd district representative Joey Salceda proposed a week-long lockdown of the region to prevent the disease from spreading nationwide. Salceda specifically proposed the closure of the Philippine expressway network and public transportation accessing the region, in addition to the suspension of classes and work. President Rodrigo Duterte initially rejected the proposal claiming it would "hamper the flow of basic commodities". Health Secretary Francisco Duque, however, raised the possibility of a lockdown on certain cities or towns if cases of community-based transmissions are reported, but not an entire region. On March 12, President Duterte announced a partial lockdown covering Metro Manila, that began on March 15. \c\cAt one point during President Duterte's pronouncement about the Metro Manila "community quarantine," he said that "they are afraid to call it a lockdown, but it is a lockdown." This statement left many confused. His cabinet secretary, Karlo Nograles, later made it clear that the proper term is "community quarantine" and the President's comment means that the event "is like a lockdown". Nograles further said that the term "lockdown" can lead to different interpretations, while "community quarantine" is a technical term that medical authorities can give meaning, which does not create public fear. \c\cWhen the "community quarantine" was applied to Luzon, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo, said that the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) is equivalent to an "absolute lockdown or total lockdown." Secretary Eduardo Año of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) also said that "enhanced community quarantine" should be considered as a "total lockdown."\c\cIn addition, President Duterte advised local government units outside of the National Capital Region to implement a community quarantine in cases where, in a given level of local government, at least two COVID-19 cases are confirmed within a lower level of its jurisdiction; for example, a province-wide quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two COVID-19 cases confirmed within different cities or municipalities in the same province, while a city/municipality-wide quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two COVID-19 cases confirmed within different barangays in the same city or municipality. Local government units were also authorized to utilize their quick response funds upon declaration of a state of emergency. \c\cThe national government has given local government units under enhanced community quarantine in Visayas and Mindanao and relevant field offices of the Department of Health the power to lift or extend the lockdown period in their jurisdiction. The imposition of a "localized lockdown" involving measures at the barangay, sitio, and/or purok level instead of fully lifting ECQs has been proposed. \c\cOn April 6, 2020, the following localities were under enhanced community quarantine: all regions of Luzon, Western Visayas, Caraga Region, Zamboanga Peninsula, Samar, Biliran, Cebu, Negros Oriental, Camiguin, Bukidnon, Sultan Kudarat, Lanao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Cotabato, South Cotabato, Tawi-Tawi, and the municipality of Catarman in Northern Samar. \c\cOn April 24, 2020 it was clarified that local government units can no longer impose quarantine measures without the consent of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). Prior to that period, localities could impose such measures with coordination with the DILG. President Rodrigo Duterte issued Executive Order 112, extending enhanced community quarantine in select localities until May 15 and imposing a general community quarantine in the rest of the country, also overriding existing quarantine measures by local government units, starting May 1. \c\cIn March 2021, the government introduced a new designation known as NCR Plus, which covers the Greater Manila Area, for the purpose of managing quarantine measures. This area covers Metro Manila, also known as the National Capital Region (NCR) and the adjacent provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal. \c\cThe two main levels of community quarantine measures are the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) and the general community quarantine (GCQ). Variations of ECQ and GCQ also had been introduced over time such as the modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) and the modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) which are generally less stricter than their standard counterparts. Although exact measures per level may vary over time due to the government revising its guidelines, the strictest of these measures is the ECQ and the most lenient being the MGCQ. \c\cLocalities under an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) are generally ordered to stay at home, with its residents restricted from traveling to other cities or barangays. ECQ is equivalent to a total or complete lockdown. Barangay governments can issue quarantine passes allowing residents to buy essential goods outside curfew hours and within the issuing barangays\' jurisdiction. The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act which was effective in 2020 also provides measures related to the ECQ, such as:\c\cLimitations on all forms of transportation\c\cWork suspensions and the setting up of alternative working arrangements such as teleworking\c\cEnsuring the supply of food and medical products\c\cMeasures against profiteering and hoarding of essential goods\c\cProvision allowing a 30-day grace period for loan and rental payments during the quarantine period\c\cCancellation of mass gatherings\c\cClosure of non-essential businesses\c\c24/7 opening of essential businesses and utilities in 100% operational capacity\c\cWhen ECQ was reintroduced in March 2021 in the Greater Manila Area (or NCR Plus as designated by the IATF-EID); new set of measures were observed. \c\cAll households are required observe strict home quarantine. Movement outside the place of residence is limited to Authorized Persons Outside Residence (APORs), those accessing essential goods and services, and workers in establishments allowed to operate. People aged 18-years below and above 65, people with comorbidities, and pregnant women are barred from going out their homes except to either obtain essential goods and services or to report for work. \c\cMass gatherings (more than 10 persons outside and non-household members indoors) and face-to-face classes are not allowed in ECQ zones. Religious gatherings and dine-in services are not allowed. Shopping malls are allowed to operate for essential services. \c\cLimitations on mass transportation. \c\cEssential and priority constructions projects are allowed to resume in accordance with Department of Public Works and Highways guidelines\c\cIn addition to front-line services (health and other emergency services); full operations is allowed for certain operations including agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and delivery and courier services of essential goods. \c\cLimited operations for certain sectors. \c\cUnlike in 2020, ECQ measures as of 2021 had more lenient restrictions on transportation allowing for operations of public transportation at a limited capacity. However, with the ECQ period in March–April 2021 coinciding with the Holy Week and late release of guidelines of the Department of Transportation, this resulted in the virtual absence of public transportation in some areas. \c\cThe general community quarantine (GCQ), which was introduced on May 1, is generally less stringent than ECQ. Public transportation is allowed at a reduced capacity and select businesses are allowed to operate at 50 to 100 percent of their regular capacity depending on their industry. Shopping malls are also allowed to operate, although only select stalls and stores are allowed to open. \c\cA level under GCQ, is called a modified general community quarantine (MGCQ).[citation needed]\c\cSporting activities has been allowed in areas under GCQ since July 2020, although live spectators are not allowed for sports events. \c\cOn June 28, 2021, the government announces new quarantine status under GCQ: GCQ with some restrictions and GCQ with heightened restrictions. \c\cNon-contact sports are allowed. \c\cLottery and horse racing with off-track betting stations are temporarily allowed. \c\cGyms and fitness centers are permitted to operate at 40% while indoor sports courts may be opened at 50% capacity. \c\cIndoor tourist attractions, specifically historical situated museums defined by DOT, are allowed for 40%. \c\cMeetings, conferences and exhibitions must also be at 40% capacity but if it will be used for social events, it must be limited to 10% capacity. \c\cPersonal care services are allowed to operate at 50% as long as they are not requiring mask removal. If the establishment has a Safety Seal, they may operate an additional 10% capacity. \c\cOutdoor tourist attractions are allowed at 50% capacity but with strict compliance to minimum public health protocols. \c\cStaycation hotels are allowed to operate for up to 100% venue capacity while other DOT-accredited establishments may operate at 30% capacity. There are no age restrictions for these establishments as long as public health standards are followed. \c\cIndoor dining is allowed for 40% capacity while outdoor dining is allowed for 50%. \c\cNon-contact sports are allowed. \c\cLottery and horse racing with off-track betting stations are temporarily allowed. \c\cPersonal care services are allowed to operate at 30% as long as they are not requiring mask removal. If the establishment has a Safety Seal, they may operate an additional 10% capacity. \c\cOutdoor tourist attractions are allowed at 30% capacity but with strict compliance to minimum public health protocols. \c\cStaycation hotels are allowed to operate for up to 100% venue capacity while other DOT-accredited establishments may operate at 30% capacity. There are no age restrictions for staycations. \c\cIndoor dining is allowed for 20% capacity while outdoor dining is allowed for 50%. Indoor dining may increase by 10% capacity if the establishment has Safety Seal. \c\cThe "New Normal" classification was introduced sometime in May 2020, but was never used since quarantine measures were first imposed. The classification of measures  was intended to be a level under MGCQ. It was a proposed that an area needs to be placed under MGCQ prior to the imposition of new normal measures. The use of the classification was deferred in mid-June 2020.As stated in the IATF Omnibus Guidelines on the Implementation of Community Quarantine in the Philippines, areas which are no longer under Community Quarantine will be transitioned to the New Normal. This classification was never used. \c\cThe COVID-19 alert level system was introduced with pilot implementation of the system in Metro Manila beginning on September 16, 2021. The old quarantine system is still to be used outside Metro Manila pending the nationwide adoption of the ALS. The ALS was introduced to areas outside Metro Manila on October 20, 2021. The nationwide implementation will be done in phases. \c\cThere are types of quarantine or lockdown measures aside from the ECQ and GCQ. Additional measures have been imposed under an "extensive enhanced community quarantine" or "extreme enhanced community quarantine" (EECQ). An EECQ is generally stricter than an ECQ. Prior to the imposition of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon, a more lenient measure, which includes a stay-at-home order and a curfew, was imposed in Metro Manila and was officially called a "community quarantine". \c\cSeveral LGUs has used the term "hard lockdown," which is an area under disease monitoring and mass testing for the virus. In May 2020, additional terms were coined by the government to categorize the community quarantine according to its risk assessment and those new terms are "modified enhanced community quarantine," "modified general community quarantine" and "new normal."\c\cA "total lockdown" measure, distinct from an ECQ, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving their places of residence and mandate the closure of all public establishments. According to presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, this measure is considered as an option. \c\cA "granular lockdown" can be applied to single barangay, or a portion of it such as a certain road, with a high concentration or clustering of active cases of COVID-19. Granular lockdowns could also cover just a single affected house. The granular lockdown strategy took a more prominent role when the alert level system (ALS) was introduced in September 2021 to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. \c\cThe enhanced community quarantine in Luzon covers the island of Luzon and its outlying islands, or eight out of seventeen regions of the Philippines. An indefinite enhanced community quarantine, was imposed in Caraga, alternatively known as One Shield Caraga, started on April 7, and in the Davao Region which took effect on April 4. \c\cProvinces that imposed an enhanced community quarantine include Iloilo (March 21), Antique (March 22), Negros Occidental (March 30), Cebu (March 30), and Negros Oriental (April 3). \c\cThe independent cities of Bacolod (March 30), Iloilo City (March 21), and Cebu City (March 28) also imposed ECQ measures. \c\cEnhanced community quarantines (ECQs) were extended in Metro Manila, Central Luzon (excluding Aurora), and Calabarzon regions as well as in the provinces of Benguet, Pangasinan, Iloilo, Cebu, and the cities of Bacolod and Davao until May 15 as per President Rodrigo Duterte's Executive Order 112. All other areas were placed under general community quarantine (GCQ) unless otherwise approved by the IATF-EID. Albay and Zamboanga City were also included among local government units placed under ECQ. The IATF-EID allows local government units, the imposition or extension of ECQ at a municipal or barangay level with the concurrence of their respective regional IATF-EID. \c\cThe municipality of San Jose remained under ECQ while the rest of Occidental Mindoro downgraded to GCQ. Marinduque and Bacolod also remained under ECQ. \c\cRequest to extend ECQs in the following areas were rejected by the IATF-EID: the provinces of Camarines Sur, La Union, Mountain Province, Isabela, Lanao del Norte, and Lanao del Sur, and the cities of Marawi and Butuan. \c\cOn May 12, 2020, it was originally announced that community quarantine measures will be lifted in 41 provinces and 11 cities across the country due to their being low risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but were eventually upgraded to modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) after receiving petitions from LGUs starting May 16. \c\cOn May 15, 2020, the IATF-EID approved the appeal of Mayor Lani Mercado-Revilla placing the city of Bacoor in the province of Cavite under modified enhanced community quarantine. \c\cThe IATF-EID issued Resolution No. 37, overriding prior plans, placing Metro Manila, the cities of Angeles and Bacoor, as well as the provinces of Laguna, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Zambales under modified enhanced community quarantine, which is more lenient than an ECQ but stricter than a GCQ. Cebu City and Mandaue were placed under ECQ while the rest of the country was placed under GCQ. The measure became effective on May 16 with quarantine measures to be reassessed on May 31. \c\cThe IATF-EID issued Resolution No. 41 to override prevailing quarantine measures in the country starting June 1. Measures in Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Central Visayas regions transitioned to general community quarantine (GCQ). GCQ remained in Cagayan Valley, Pangasinan (except Dagupan), Zamboanga City and Davao City, while the rest of the country was placed under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ). However, Marc Brian Lim, the city mayor of Dagupan, suspended the implementation of GCQ measures in the city to MGCQ as directed by the IATF-EID. This followed Dagupan recording 14 additional COVID-19 cases on May 31, the day prior the city was supposed to transition to MGCQ. Lim appealed to the IATF-EID for the task force to allow his city to remain under GCQ. \c\cDue to the sudden increase number of community transmissions in the area, the IATF-EID recommended the reimposition of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) to Cebu City starting on June 16, the most stringent lockdown-measure tier with the neighboring Talisay being reimposed under the modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ). Meanwhile, GCQ was extended or reimposed in the areas of Metro Manila, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Occidental Mindoro, the rest of Central Visayas, Zamboanga City and Davao City. \c\cOn June 23, the IATF-EID temporarily removed the "new normal" classification which meant that all areas in the country will still be under varying levels of community quarantine after the June 16–30 measures. \c\cThe GCQ were either reimposed or extended to the provinces of Benguet, Cavite, Leyte (except Tacloban), Rizal, Southern Leyte, and several parts of Cebu. Only Cebu City remained under ECQ as the city confirms more cases. \c\cOn July 15, quarantine measures continued to ease as Cebu City shifted to MECQ. Metro Manila remains under GCQ for another two weeks. Other areas under GCQ includes the provinces of Agusan del Norte, Basilan, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, and Southern Leyte, as well as the cities of Butuan, Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, Ormoc, and Zamboanga. The rest of the country shifts to MGCQ. \c\cQuarantine measures for August 1 to 15 were decided on July 30 and was announced on July 31. Cebu City's MECQ has finally been downgraded to GCQ. Other places that are still under GCQ includes: the Metro Manila, the provinces of Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal, the cities of Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, Talisay, and Zamboanga, and the municipalities of Consolacion and Minglanilla in Cebu. The rest of the country are still under MGCQ. \c\cOn August 2, the IATF-EID responded to the appeal of 40 medical societies led by the Philippine College of Physicians to place Metro Manila under ECQ again due to rising COVID-19 cases. The meeting later decided to place Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal back under MECQ from August 4 to 18. \c\cThe provinces of Batangas, Nueva Ecija, and Quezon in Luzon and Iloilo City in the Visayas were placed under GCQ again on August 16. While the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu, and Talisay, and the municipalities of Minglanilla and Consolacion in the Cebu province remained under GCQ. Zamboanga City was placed under MGCQ. \c\cOn August 17, on the recommendation of the IATF-EID, President Duterte announced that Metro Manila and its neighboring provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal will be downgraded to GCQ starting August 19. His speech was broadcast from Davao City. \c\cOn August 21, Catbalogan was placed under ECQ, following Samar Governor Reynolds Michael Tan signed an executive order amid a spike of cases. Tuguegarao was placed under MECQ for ten days, from August 26 to September 4. \c\cOn August 31, President Duterte approved the recommendation of IATF-EID, to place Iligan under MECQ. The GCQ in Metro Manila, Batangas, and Bulacan was also extended, while the quarantine measures in Bacolod and Tacloban were upgraded to GCQ. The rest of the country were placed under MGCQ on September 1. \c\cLanao del Sur and the city of Bacolod were also placed under MECQ from September 8 to 30, due to the sudden rise of COVID-19 cases linked to local transmissions within these areas. \c\cThe cities of Koronadal and General Santos were also placed under GCQ from September 11 to 25 and September 13 to 27, respectively, while the province of South Cotabato was placed under GCQ from September 16 to 30. Iloilo City was placed under MECQ, from September 25 to 30, originally scheduled to end on October 9. \c\cOn September 28, President Duterte announced that the GCQ in Metro Manila, Bacolod, Batangas, Iloilo City, and Tacloban will be extended from October 1 to 31, while the MECQ in Iligan will be downgraded to GCQ. Lanao del Sur (including Marawi) on the other hand, will be placed under MECQ for the entirety of October. The rest of the country will remain under MGCQ. \c\cIlagan in Isabela was placed under MECQ from October 6 to 16, then to ECQ from October 16 to 30, amid rising cases in the city. Enrile in Cagayan was placed under MECQ from October 6 to 16. Northern Samar was placed under GCQ from October 20 until November 3. \c\cOn October 27, President Duterte announced in his televised address from Davao City, that the GCQ in Metro Manila, Bacolod, Batangas, Iloilo City, Tacloban, and Iligan will be extended until November 30, while Lanao del Sur will be placed under GCQ. The rest of the country will remain under MGCQ. \c\cDavao City was also placed under GCQ from November 20 until November 30, amid sudden rise of COVID-19 cases in the city. Laoag in Ilocos Norte was placed under MECQ from November 27 until December 11, due to spike in cases in the city. \c\cOn November 30, President Duterte announced that the quarantine measures in Metro Manila, Batangas, Davao City, Iligan, Iloilo City, Lanao del Sur, and Tacloban will remain as they are until December 31. Davao del Norte was upgraded to a GCQ due to its high positivity rate, while Bacolod was downgraded to a MGCQ. The rest of the country will remain under MGCQ. \c\cLaoag was downgraded to GCQ from December 12 until December 25. On December 14, the province of Isabela was placed under GCQ and will be under that quarantine measure until December 30. \c\cOn December 28, President Rodrigo Duterte has announced that the GCQ in Metro Manila, Batangas, Davao del Norte, Isabela, Lanao del Sur, Davao City, Iligan, Iloilo City and Tacloban will be extended until January 31, while Santiago will be upgraded to GCQ. The rest of the country will be placed under MGCQ. \c\cOn January 1, Isabela and Iloilo City has been downgraded to MGCQ. Laoag was placed under GCQ on January 11. Tuguegarao was placed under ECQ from January 20 until January 29, due to the spike of cases in the city. It was extended until February 3, as the cases were still rising. Passi was placed under ECQ from January 28 until February 11. \c\cOn January 29, it was announced that the following areas will be placed under GCQ: the Cordillera Administrative Region and Metro Manila, the provinces of Batangas, Davao del Norte, and Lanao del Sur, and the cities of Tacloban, Davao City, and Iligan for the whole month of February. The rest of the country will be under a more lenient MGCQ, unless otherwise stated. \c\cThere was a plan to place the entire country under MGCQ by March 2021, which was first proposed by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) to allow the reopening of industries closed under stricter quarantine measures. The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) supported this proposal and said that it would harmonize travel restrictions throughout the country. However, President Rodrigo Duterte issued a directive against the proposal but was open to ease the restrictions nationwide as soon as the national government starts its vaccination program. On February 27, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced that the GCQ in Metro Manila, Apayao, Baguio, Batangas, Davao City, Iligan, Kalinga, Lanao del Sur, Mountain Province, and Tacloban will still be in place for the entire month of March. \c\cOn March 21, in view of the grim rising of new COVID-19 cases, President Duterte approved the IATF-EID recommendation placing Metro Manila and its neighboring provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal under GCQ "with additional restrictions" from March 22 to April 4. These areas within the Greater Manila Area were collectively given the designation "NCR Plus" and the restrictions placed on the area was described essentially as a GCQ–MECQ hybrid. However, on March 29, the Greater Manila Area was placed under ECQ due to the increasing trend in the number of cases in the area. \c\cOn March 29, President Rodrigo Duterte announced community quarantine measures that would prevail from April 1 to 30 with most of the Philippines to be placed under MGCQ. Quirino and the city of Santiago in Isabela will placed under MECQ, while the Cordillera Administrative Region, Cagayan, the rest of Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, Batangas, Lanao del Sur and the cities of Tacloban, Iligan, Davao City will be under GCQ and the quarantine measures in the NCR Plus area were retained. The ECQ in NCR Plus was supposed to end on April 4, but was extended until April 11. From April 12 to 30, the Greater Manila Area was placed under MECQ. For the same period, Abra was also placed under MECQ, while Quezon was placed under GCQ. \c\cOn April 28, 2021, President Rodrigo Duterte announced that the MECQ in the Greater Manila Area ("NCR Plus") will remain in place until May 14 while that of in Santiago City, Quirino, and Abra will remain until May 31. The GCQ in the provinces of Apayao, Batangas, Benguet, Cagayan, Ifugao, Isabela, Kalinga, Lanao del Sur, Mountain Province, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quezon, and the cities of Baguio, Davao City, Iligan, and Tacloban will remain in place until May 31, while the rest of the country will remain under MGCQ. \c\cHowever, quarantine measures for Ifugao were raised to MECQ which will be active from May 1 to 14, and Palawan was placed under GCQ for the whole month. \c\cOn May 13, 2021, President Duterte approved the IATF-EID recommendations in downgrading the quarantine classification of the NCR Plus under GCQ "with heightened restrictions" from May 15 to May 31. MECQ would be in place in the provinces of Ifugao and Quirino and the cities of Santiago and Zamboanga City due to the rise in COVID-19 cases in those areas. The GCQ in the rest of the Cordillera and Calabarzon, the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, Lanao del Sur, Nueva Vizcaya, and the cities of Davao City, Iligan and Puerto Princesa would remain in place until May 31, while the rest of the country would remain under MGCQ. 
The Tigray War (Tigrinya: ውግእ ትግራይ) is an ongoing civil war that began on 3 November 2020 in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. The local Tigray Defense Forces (TDF) are fighting the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF), the Ethiopian Federal Police, regional police, and gendarmerie forces of the neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions with the involvement of the Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF). All sides, particularly the ENDF, EDF, and TDF have committed war crimes during the conflict. Due to[clarify] the onset of the war, a deep humanitarian crisis has developed. \c\cIn 2019, to distance the country from ethnic federalism and ethnic nationalist politics, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed merged the ethnic and region-based constituent parties of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition and several opposition parties into his new Prosperity Party. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a politically powerful entity that had dominated Ethiopian politics for 27 years as a repressive regime through a one-party dominant system, refused to join the new party. The TPLF then alleged that Abiy Ahmed became an illegitimate ruler because the general elections scheduled for 29 August 2020 were postponed to 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The TPLF, led by its chairman Debretsion Gebremichael, went ahead with regional elections in Tigray in September 2020 in defiance of the federal government, which then declared the Tigray election illegal. \c\cAfter a long build-up of Eritrean and Amhara forces on Tigray's borders, fighting between Tigray forces and the Ethiopia-Eritrea-Amhara alliance began on 3 November 2020, with attacks on the Northern Command bases and headquarters of the ENDF in the Tigray Region by Tigray security forces. Counterattacks by the ENDF in Tigray were described as a police action by federal authorities. Federal allied forces captured Mekelle, the capital of the Tigray Region, on 28 November, after which Prime Minister Abiy declared the Tigray operation "over". The Tigray government stated in late November that it would continue fighting until the "invaders" are out, and on 28 June 2021 the Tigray Defense Forces retook Mekelle and advanced into the Amhara and Afar regions in July. In early November 2021, the TDF together with the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) took control of several towns on the highway south from Tigray Region towards Addis Ababa, and the TPLF stated that its was "considering marching on Addis Ababa. Together with seven smaller rebel groups, the TPLF and OLA declared a coalition aiming to "dismantle Abiy's government by force or by negotiations, and then form a transitional authority."\c\cMass extrajudicial killings of civilians took place during November and December 2020 in and around Adigrat, Hagere Selam, in the Hitsats refugee camp, and in Humera, Mai Kadra Debre Abbay, and Axum. At least 10,000 people have died, and war rape became a "daily" occurrence, with girls as young as 8, and women as old as 72, raped, often in front of their families. \c\cPeace and mediation proposals included an early November 2020 African Union (AU) mediation proposed by Debretsion and refused by Abiy; an AU trio of former African presidents who visited Ethiopia in late November; an emergency Intergovernmental Authority on Development summit of East African heads of government and state that met in late 20 December 2020 in Djibouti; and peace proposals on 19 February 2021 by the Tigray government and on 20 February by the National Congress of Great Tigray (Baytona), Tigray Independence Party (TIP) and Salsay Weyane Tigray (SAWET). In July and August 2021, the "A3+1" mediation group, consisting of three African countries, Kenya, Niger and Tunisia and one non-African country, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, was formed and called for an "Ethiopian-owned process" supported by peace resolution processes, especially those of the AU, in the spirit of "African solutions to African challenges". Olusegun Obasanjo, former president of Nigeria, talked to Abiy and Debretsion separately and stated on 8 November to the AU Peace and Security Council that both leaders agreed that "the differences opposing them are political and require political solution through dialogue."\c\cFollowing the end of the Ethiopian Civil War in 1991, Ethiopia became a dominant-party state under the rule of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of ethnically-based parties dominated by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The founding and most influential member was the TPLF and the chairperson was Meles Zenawi, who was the prime minister of Ethiopia until his death in 2012. \c\cOn 2 April 2018, the once-powerful TPLF was ousted from power in the federal government owing to a growing discontent within the public, a reaction to 27 years of repression. In a closed-door election to chair the EPRDF, executive committee members from the Amhara, Oromia and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples\' regions voted for Abiy Ahmed in defiance of the TPLF, which was hoping to get Shiferaw Shigute elected chairman. After losing the election and being ousted from the federal government, TPLF officials relocated to Tigray and continued administering the region for three years frequently clashing with the federal government. In one instance, the regional administration of Tigray is reported to have defied the federal government and refused to allow Ethiopian Federal Police to arrest Getachew Assefa, the former chief of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) of Ethiopia and executive member of TPLF. \c\cOn 1 December 2019, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed merged the ethnic and region-based parties of the EPRDF (which had governed Ethiopia for 28 years) and several opposition parties into his new Prosperity Party. The TPLF, which had dominated Ethiopian politics, refused to join the new party and alleged that Abiy Ahmed became an illegitimate ruler by rescheduling the general elections set for 29 August 2020 to an undetermined date in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cThe TPLF used to be part of the Ethiopian governing coalition until its 2019 refusal to merge into the Prosperity Party. In 2020, tensions between the federal government and Tigray escalated in the months before the November Tigray military intervention. Not only the TPLF, but even the Tigray branch of Abiy's own Prosperity Party expressed fears for an Eritrean invasion. Abiy, who is of Oromo descent, accused the TPLF Party Members in the Tigray Regional Government of undermining his authority. By contrast, Tigray authorities saw the refusal to recognize the September 2020 election for Tigray's state council (which, along with all elections in Ethiopia, had been delayed by the federal elections board because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia) as the reason for the outbreak of the conflict. Abiy Ahmed's government considered the September Tigray election to be illegal and responded by slashing federal funding to the region. Several journalists were barred by the federal government (at Addis Ababa airport) from travelling to cover Tigray's regional election. \c\cThe warming of relations between Abiy Ahmed and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, who is poorly regarded in Tigray, was also considered to have fuelled the tension. Ethiopian elite units were transported to Gherghera base near Asmara "as part of a security pact" between Abiy and Isaias in a plan to "strike out of existence the TPLF", according to former Eritrean Minister of Defence, Mesfin Hagos. In late October, the Ethiopian Reconciliation Commission stated that it was trying to mediate between the federal and regional governments and the TPLF, but that pre-conditions set by all sides were blocking progress. \c\cOpponents of the Tigray People's Liberation Front have described it as a heavily armed ethnic nationalist paramilitary insurgency, terrorist organization, political party, and former ruling authoritarian regime of Ethiopia. \c\cAs tension continued to grow, a general appointed by Abiy was prevented by the Tigrayan government from taking up his military post. The same day before the Tigray forces Northern Command attacks, the federal parliament of Ethiopia had suggested designating the TPLF as a terrorist organization. \c\cThe 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia states in Article 39.1, "Every Nation, Nationality, and People in Ethiopia has an unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession."\c\cArticle 62.9 grants the House of Federation the right to "order Federal intervention if any State [government], in violation of [the] Constitution, endangers the constitutional order."\c\cIn late September 2020, the TPLF stated that the constitutional term limit of the House of Federation, the House of Peoples\' Representatives (HoPR), the prime minister, and the Council of Ministers was 5 October 2020 and that for this reason, it would consider "the incumbent" constitutionally illegitimate after 5 October. The TPLF proposed replacing the government with a technocratic caretaker government as detailed in a plan posted on Facebook by the Coalition of Ethiopian Federalist Forces. \c\cJust before midnight on 3 November 2020, Tigray Special Forces and the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) came into conflict during the TPLF attacks on the ENDF Northern Command headquarters in Mekelle, the Fifth Battalion barracks in Dansha, and other Northern Command bases. Several people were killed and the TPLF claimed the attack was carried out in self-defence. \c\cIn retaliation, an Ethiopian offensive was launched on 4 November, which was accompanied by the declaration of a state of emergency, the creation of the State of Emergency Inquiry Board and a shutdown of government services in the Tigray Region. During the subsequent days, skirmishes continued and the Ethiopian federal parliament declared the creation of an interim government for Tigray. Ethiopian offensives in the north were accompanied with airstrikes and several towns and cities were retaken. \c\cOn the night of 9 to 10 November 2020, 600 civilians, mostly Amharas and Welkait, were killed in a massacre in the town of Mai Kadra with machetes and knives used by local militias and police loyal to the TPLF, according to preliminary investigations by Amnesty International and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission. While refugees interviewed by the Financial Times and Reuters said it was the Amhara militia who were the perpetrators and Tigrayans who were the victims. Two days later, refugees interviewed by the Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The New York Times stated that Amhara militias, including Fano, and the ENDF carried out beatings and a massacre of 20 Tigrayans in Humera. Humera was shelled from the direction of the Eritrean–Ethiopian border for two days around 9–11 November. The ENDF gained control of Humera on 12 November. \c\cOffensives of joint ENDF-Amhara Region-Eritrean forces into Tigray were facilitated by the intervention of "Pterosaurus" drones, launched by the United Arab Emirates from its base in Assab, Eritrea. The Chinese-made, armed drones bombed Tigrayan towns and defense forces.[dubious  – discuss] \c\cIn the late hours of 13 November 2020, Tigray forces fired a rocket towards the airports of Bahir Dar and Gondar in the Amhara Region. On 14 November, Tigray forces launched rockets at the Eritrean capital of Asmara, but the missiles missed. The Tigray government claimed these locations contained military terminals that served as bases to carry out airstrikes. \c\cOn 17 November 2020, the Ethiopian government accused the TPLF of blowing up four main bridges leading to Mekelle. The Tigray government denied the accusations. From 17 to 19 November, Ethiopian forces captured the Raya district and the towns of Shire, Alamata, Adwa, and Axum. In Raya there were an estimated 760 casualties from both forces. While fighting between Tigray and Ethiopia continued in Zalambessa and Ethiopian forces starting moving towards Adigrat. Fighting between Tigray and Eritrea took place in Adi Quala, Zalembesa, Taruna, Ali Tina, Wadqomdi, and Bademe. \c\cOn 23 November, Ethiopian forces reached the regional capital of Mekelle and encircled it. A military spokesperson for Ethiopia, Colonel Dejene Tsegaye, announced that Mekelle would be shelled, and told Tigray civilians to flee the city because Ethiopian forces would show no mercy. Many residents of Mekelle had already left the city due to airstrikes in and around the city, but many others still remained in the city. \c\cEven though TPLF leaders, Tigray Special Forces, and militia forces had already left the city, the Ethiopian forces still began their direct assault on Mekelle on the morning of 28 November and started heavy shelling of the city. By the evening Prime Minister Abiy declared Ethiopian forces had taken full control of the city. In total 27 civilians were killed and 100 others were injured. The Tigray government vowed to continue fighting. Two days later Prime Minister Abiy claimed no civilians were killed. \c\cAfter Ethiopian federal forces and their allies captured Mekelle and other major cities, forces loyal to the Tigray government began to regroup into mountainous areas of the region and reorganized under the banner of the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF). This retreat was partially caused by the fact that a large portion of the TDF's artillery had been destroyed by air strikes. The TDF also began to dig into their positions in rural Tigray. Afterwards the TDF then started a guerrilla campaign against Ethiopian-allied forces from the mountains, and, by mid-December, fighting had reached Hagere Selam, Samre, Dogu’a, Kolla Tembien, May Tsemre and localities around Maychew. During this time, a violently enforced curfew was set up by Ethiopian forces along with Eritrean soldiers. According to the Europe External Programme with Africa (EEPA), in Wukro over 200 people were killed and the town was left deserted. The Ethiopian government denied involvement in the killing. \c\cThe early gains made by the ENDF and Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) against the Tigray forces did not lead to a decisive defeat of the re-organized and invigorated TDF. In late January 2021, the TDF had rallied and were intensifying their insurgency against Ethiopian forces despite the initial setbacks and heavy losses. During this time fighting was reported to have taken place around Mekelle, and the ENDF had retreated from rural positions towards the city. Several of these clashes took place in mid-February at Samre, a small town 45 km (28 mi) south-west of Mekelle. Thousands of Ethiopian troops supported by artillery, tanks, and airstrikes fought dug-in forces loyal to the Tigray regional government. The Guardian reported in late April 2021 that there was renewed fighting in the area. \c\cIn April 2021, the TDF was in control of the rural areas of central and southern Tigray along with parts of eastern and south-eastern Tigray, while the ENDF was in control of the main roads and urban areas. Amhara and Eritrean forces also controlled parts of Tigray in the west and north, respectively. All sides wished to secure a military victory, but they lacked the ability to do so in the near term and so they began to prepare for a prolonged conflict. The Tigray Defense Forces were engaged in a war of attrition with popular support from the people of Tigray, who were infuriated by war crimes committed by Eritrean and Ethiopian soldiers and worried about a potential decrease in the region's autonomy. This resulted in the TDF growing in strength and the concept of secession from Ethiopia gaining popularity in Tigray, a stance which was considered likely to inflame Amhara-Tigray territorial disputes. \c\cAccording to refugees, the EDF killed 80–150 people in Idaga Hamus on 30 November, part of a larger series of extrajudicial killings known as the Adigrat massacres. On 26 December 2020, it was reported by EEPA that Eritrea had started to withdraw some of its troops from Tigray. \c\cOn 9 January 2021, Ethiopian TV reported that 300 refugees in Hitsats camp were executed by the TPLF. According to refugees, pro-TPLF forces used Hitsats as a base for several weeks in November 2020, killing several refugees who wanted to leave the camp to get food and, in one incident, killed nine young Eritrean men in revenge for having lost a battle against the EDF. On 18 February 2021, unidentified militiamen ambushed a passenger bus in Adi Mesino, killing six and injuring 10. On 20 February, Yemane Niguse, a prominent Tigrayan dissident was assassinated in his birth town of Hewane by unknown assailants. The federal Ethiopian authorities accused the TPLF of responsibility for the assassination. \c\cOn 1 April 2021, an undated video surfaced that purported to show Ethiopian troops executing 11 unarmed men before disposing of their bodies near Mahibere Dego. On 6 May 2021, Ethiopia's House of Peoples’ Representatives declared the TPLF as a terrorist organization. On 21 May, Ethiopia's military prosecutors convicted 3 soldiers of rape and pressed charges against over 50 others suspected of killing civilians in Tigray or committing rape and other forms of sexual violence. The statement also confirmed reports of two massacres in Tigray, stating that 229 civilians were killed in the town of Mai Kadra at the beginning of November, and accusing troops from Eritrea of killing 110 civilians in the city of Axum on 27 and 28 November. \c\cOn 28 and 29 November 2020, witnesses and survivors, including refugees in Sudan, reported that the Eritrean Defence Forces carried out the Axum massacre of about 720 to 800 civilians. \c\cThe Eritrean government stated that it was angered by Amnesty International's report on the massacre, that the report was "fallacious" and that the Eritrean government had not been contacted by Amnesty International prior to publication. The Eritrean government also said: "It must be underscored that Amnesty made absolutely no attempt to seek any information from Eritrea. Moreover, the fabricated Axum accusation has mutated over the last month from a \'massacre of Orthodox Christians at St. Mary's Church\' to \'house-to-house\' killing of civilians."\c\cThe situation on the ground has changed drastically following a guerilla warfare campaign by the TDF and in February 2021, the UN chief coordinator of humanitarian efforts Mark Lowcock said that up to 40% of Tigray was not controlled by Ethiopian troops. He said that much of that area was under the control of Eritrean soldiers pursuing their own objectives independent of Ethiopian command. \c\cRefugees told VICE World News that Eritrea was in control of parts of the northern Maekelay Zone and most likely extending beyond the zone. Different refugees told VICE that not only did Eritreans cross into border areas, but they also took control of the area. One refugee from Maekelay told them "Since the war started, we haven\'t seen a single Ethiopian soldier. Only Eritreans, they occupy the rural areas."\c\cOn 16 June 2021, the Ethiopian ambassador to the UN stated that Eritrean troops in Tigray were to "definitely leave soon". \c\cOn 22 June 2021, an Ethiopian military cargo plane was shot down over Samre, marking a turn of the war in the TDF's favor. On 28 June 2021, the Tigray Defense Forces retook the city of Mekelle. People celebrated in the streets of Mekelle as the TDF took the city. Ethiopian soldiers, police and administrators were seen leaving, ahead of the occupation by the TDF. Shortly after hearing news of the TDF advance, the Ethiopian government declared an immediate unilateral ceasefire across the Tigray Region. BBC News reporter Vivienne Nunis characterised the ceasefire as an attempt by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to save face, the government having little other option. \c\cOn 29 June 2021, Tigrayan forces vowed to continue their offensive and drive into Eritrea or the Amhara Region if necessary and said that Mekelle was 100% under the control of Tigrayan forces. On 30 June 2021, the TDF had entered the town of Shire, some 140 kilometres (87 mi) northwest of Mekelle, after it had been abandoned by Eritrean troops. The International Crisis Group claimed that the TDF now controlled most of the Tigray region. The Ethiopian government claimed, on 30 June, that it could re-enter Mekelle in less than three weeks if it wanted to. In the same announcement, the Ethiopian government stated that all Eritrean forces had withdrawn from the region, though this was not confirmed by the Eritrean government. \c\cOn 6 July 2021, the Tigrayan government began a mobilisation to retake western Tigray from Amhara forces. A TDF offensive starting on 12 July resulted in Tigrayan forces capturing southern Tigray, including the towns of Alamata and Korem. The TDF subsequently crossed the Tekezé River and advanced westward, capturing the town of Mai Tsebri in the Tselemti district and prompting Amhara officials to call on its militias to arm themselves and mobilise. Following the TDF's rapid advances, Abiy threatened to resume war with Tigray and crush the rebels, raising fears of genocide. He called on other regions of Ethiopia to mobilise their special forces. The Oromia, Sidama, and SNNPR regions answered the call and mobilised. \c\cIn response the TDF invaded the Afar Region to its east, prompting the Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambela, Harari and Somali regions to join the war. Heavy fighting in western Afar displaced over 54,000 people and resulted in the TDF reportedly capturing three districts in the region. \c\cWhile the Tigray government claimed it only entered Afar to target federal forces, experts believe their aim was to sever a portion of National Highway A1, a vital trade route for landlocked Ethiopia, linking the capital of Addis Ababa to the Port of Djibouti, from which most of its petroleum products are imported. Following the TDF's counter-attack on two districts of his region, the Amhara regional President, Agegnehu Teshager, called for the total mobilisation of all people of all ages who are armed in the region to fight against the Tigrayans. A similar call was made in Afar. Meanwhile, the city of Weldiya was besieged by the TDF, then captured on 12 August 2021. \c\cOn 4 August 2021, some Agaw people (also known as Agew people) declared themselves independent from the Amhara Region and formed the Agew Liberation Front (ALF), aligning itself with the TDF.[citation needed] The next day Lalibela was reported to have been seized by Tigrayan forces. On 9 August, UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore expressed concern about reports that over 200 people, including 100 children, had been killed in attacks on displaced families sheltering at a health facility and a school in the Afar Region. On 11 August, the TDF and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) announced an alliance to overthrow Abiy Ahmed's government, saying they were also in talks with other rebel groups to establish a "grand coalition". With the TDF advancing deeper into Amhara, various cities across the region began enforcing curfews. \c\cOn 9 September 2021, the Ethiopian government claimed Tigrayan forces had been "routed" and heavily defeated in the Afar Region. Tigrayan spokesperson Getachew Reda said its forces had seen no fighting in Afar and had redeployed to the adjoining Amhara Region. On 30 September, amid UN concerns about a blockade of aid deliveries to Tigray, the Ethiopian government expelled 7 top UN officials, reportedly because of "meddling" in its internal affairs, giving the officials 72 hours to leave the country. \c\cOn 8 October 2021, Tigrayan spokesperson Getachew Reda said an intensive air campaign by the Ethiopian Air Force began against TDF positions in the North Wollo and North Gondar zones of the Amhara Region, mostly around the towns of Wegeltena, Wurgessa and Haro. He also stated there was a "massive build up of forces on all fronts". The federal government and Amhara Regional Government did not respond to the claim. On 11 October, Ethiopian-allied forces launched coordinated ground attacks "on all fronts" against the TDF with combined arms including tanks, helicopters, heavy artillery, warplanes, and drones according to the Tigrayan government. General Tsadkan Gebretensae, member of the central command of the TDF said both sides had been preparing for the offensive for months, and predicted that battle would be “decisive”. \c\cThe new offensive effectively ended the unilateral ceasefire declared by the federal government in June and further deepened fears of the developing famine in Tigray, with a federal government blockade still preventing most aid from arriving. Meanwhile, the continued war prompted regional leaders, including Kenyan President Kenyatta, to voice their concerns and urge peace, while US Secretary of State Blinken met with the AU envoy to Ethiopia, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, to discuss the crisis. \c\cOn 13 October, Getachew claimed fighting continued intensifying with "staggering" casualties. He also claimed clashes were taking place near Weldiya and that fighting had resumed in Afar, within the Awra and Chifra districts near the Amhara border. A humanitarian worker citing witnesses said the EDF were fighting the TDF in Berhale, a town in Afar 71 kilometres (44 mi) northeast of Mekelle. \c\cOn 30 October, it was reported that Dessie had fallen to the TDF. However, control over the city was not immediately certain, with the federal government denying its capture and reports of fierce fighting coming from the town. On 31 October, the TDF claimed to have captured Kombolcha, a town 12 km (7.5 mi) east of Dessie, and the Ethiopian government accused the TDF of massacring over 100 youths in the town. On the same day, the Amhara Regional Government declared a state of emergency, which included a region-wide curfew. South of Kombolcha, the OLA claimed to have seized control over Kamisee on the A2 Highway which links Mekelle to the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, and later declared they were considering an offensive towards the capital. The TDF claimed they also linked up with the OLA. Meanwhile, it was reported that a new roundup of ethnic Tigrayans had occurred in Addis Ababa. \c\cOn 2 November 2021, as the counter-offensive came deeper into federal-controlled territory, the Ethiopian government declared a six-month state of emergency, which envisages the possibility to arrest and detain critics of the government without a court warrant, impose curfews, institute censorship, restrict freedom of movement as well as to call any adult person to fight in the war, for fear of serving from three to ten years in prison. Authorities in Addis Ababa also told residents to register their weapons in order to fend off the anticipated offensive. Four other regional governments also made a call to arms. On 5 November, the TPLF, OLA and other rebel groups declared the creation of a nine-group coalition, called the United Front of Ethiopian Federalist and Confederalist Forces. \c\cOn 22 November, the President Abiy Ahmed announced that he will be leading the army from the battlefront. \c\cBy 28 November 2020, thousands of people were believed to have been killed in the conflict and around 44,000 fled to Sudan. On 29 November, claims that South Sudan was giving safe haven to Debretsion, led to the Ethiopian ambassador to South Sudan abruptly returning to Ethiopia, and South Sudanese diplomats in Ethiopia allegedly being given 72 hours to leave the country. \c\cOn 15 December 2020, four Sudanese soldiers were killed, and 27 others were injured near the Ethiopia–Sudan border, in what Sudan claimed to be an ambush by Ethiopian forces and militias. A Sudanese soldier later claimed that Ethiopian forces had launched artillery attacks on them and intruded into the Jebel al-Teyyour area, located 7 kilometers inside Sudan. Other soldiers claimed that the attackers were Amhara Region militias. Ethiopia claimed the clashes were Ethiopia trying to stop a Sudanese militia which had tried to cross into Ethiopian territory and seize farmlands. \c\cIn response to the killings, Sudan started to build up its military along the border with Ethiopia. Military sources claimed that Sudan had recaptured Jebel al-Teyyour. On 19 December, Sudanese army and Rapid Support Forces were reported to have retaken areas previously taken by Ethiopia and Amhara Region militias in Al Qadarif, Sudan. \c\cOn 7 December heavy fighting broke out between African Union Mission to Somalia and Ethiopian troops in Halgan District, Somalia, when Ethiopian troops tried to disarm Tigrayan troops within their ranks. In total 21 Ethiopian soldiers of Tigrayan origin and 20 other Ethiopian soldiers were killed in the internal military mutiny. \c\cSince the outbreak of the Tigray War, there have been multiple unconfirmed reports of Somali troops being sent from a secret training base in Eritrea ran by the National Intelligence and Security Agency to fight against the newly formed TDF. The first of these reports came in January 2021 from unverified social media accounts. The same month Somalia's information minister, Osman Abukar Dubbe, confirmed Somali soldiers were training in Eritrea but denied any of these troops had been sent to Tigray. According to the Voice of America, several sources with direct knowledge of the program, including three Somali officials and a foreign diplomat, confirmed to them that Somali troops have been training in neighbouring Eritrea. \c\cA small group of parents also protested in Mogadishu about what they said was the government’s mismanagement of the issue. They demanded information on their loved ones who they say they haven\'t seen in a year. The head of Somalia's parliamentary committee on foreign affairs would also ask the Somali president to investigate claims by family members that their sons had gone off to fight in Ethiopia and are now missing. On 19 January 2021, the Somalian government denied the claim that Somali troops had trained in Eritrea and then deployed in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. \c\cFormer head of the Somali National Intelligence and Security Agency, Abdilsalan Guld, has claimed that Somali troops were sent to Tigray. Guld stated that the soldiers, aged from 20 to 30 years old, were secretly taken from Mogadishu and sent to Asmara for military training. Guld stated that 370 of the Somali troops trained by Eritrea were killed in Tigray, and hundreds of others were wounded. \c\cNumerous war crimes have been committed by the Ethiopian, Eritrean and Amhara Regional forces during the Tigray War. \c\cMany sources have accused the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments of engaging in crimes against humanity via ethnic cleansing of Tigrayans. The Ethiopian and Eritrean governments have also been accused of genocide. The non-profit Genocide Watch classified the events as step 9 of genocide, eradication, as well as step 10, denial. According to the EU's special envoy to Ethiopia, Pekka Haavisto, senior members of the Ethiopian government called for "wip[ing] out" all Tigrayans for 100 years. The Ethiopian Government denied the allegations. \c\cIn early September 2021, the Tigray Defense Forces were accused of extrajudicially killing 100–200 villagers in Chenna Teklehaymanot in the Amhara Region. A visit by the Associated Press (AP) found that poorly trained village militia members of both genders, some in military clothing, had been killed. Residents said that Tigrayan forces had killed villagers who had resisted looting but also blamed Ethiopian federal forces for abandoning the villagers to defend themselves unaided by regular troops. \c\cInvestigations into the war crimes include the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) joint investigation, which published its findings on 3 November 2021, and the ACHPR Tigray investigation by the African Commission on Human and Peoples\' Rights (ACHPR), expected to publish its findings by the end of 2021. \c\cAccording to the United Nations (UN), some 2.3 million children have been cut off from desperately needed aid and humanitarian assistance. Since the start of the conflict, the Ethiopian federal government has strictly controlled access to the Tigray Region, and the UN has said it is frustrated that talks with the Ethiopian government had not yet secured adequate humanitarian access for "food, including ready-to-use therapeutic food for the treatment of child malnutrition, medicines, water, fuel, and other essentials that are running low" said UNICEF. By 13 March 2021, the UN and its partners reached about 0.9 million people with complete food baskets, and 0.7 million people with clean water. Despite the progress made, many are still hard to reach due to ongoing fighting. About 4.5 million people of are still in need of aid and about 1 million of that are not in accessible areas due to ongoing fighting. \c\cSince the start of the conflict, there has been limited access to clean water due to hygiene and sanitation services largely being disrupted across Tigray. The Tigray Regional Water Bureau reported that out of 36 villages it assessed, only 4 had partially functioning water sources. Along with that, an estimated 250 motorized water pumping systems have been out of order, and the status of 11,000 hand pumps in rural areas was unknown. Because of this, there has been a heightened risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases and COVID-19. \c\cIn February 2021, GOAL Ethiopia, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), MCMDO, MSF-Spain, and World Vision, found that nearly one in seven children in 16 woredas and town administrations across Tigray were acutely malnourished. While in Enderta, Abi Adi and Shire, GOAL and IRC reported that 16.6% of children screened had acute malnutrition with 3.5% suffering from severe acute malnutrition. According to the UN, out of more than 260 health centres in Tigray before the war, only 31 are fully functional, while 7 are partially functional. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), all of the functioning hospitals and health centres in Tigray had a lack of medical supplies, drugs, and equipment. UN partners reported continued looting of health facilities. Only 16% of the health facilities had vaccination services and only 17% had maternal services (antenatal care, birth delivery, etc.). \c\cOn 31 August 2021, USAID's mission director in Ethiopia, Sean Jones said: "We do have proof that several of our warehouses have been looted and completely emptied in the areas, particularly in Amhara, where TPLF soldiers have gone into, I do believe that the TPLF has been very opportunistic," in a televised interview with state broadcaster EBC in Addis Ababa. All parties to the conflict have been accused by USAID of looting aid shipments. \c\cIn November 2020, the Amhara Region Special Force and Amhara militias loyal to the Amhara regional government took control of the western zone of Tigray in order to settle a decades-old land dispute. They claim the area was taken from them by force in 1992 after TPLF forces overthrew the communist PDRE government and divided the country into ethnic regional states. They have also claimed the woredas (districts) of Welkait, Tegede, Kafta Humera, Tselemti, and Raya to be theirs. Since then, the area has been under the de facto control of Amhara regional authorities. Their control has been marked by reports of ethnically motivated violence and forced displacement. By February 2021, about 45,000 civilians had been forced to leave the zone due to extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, and the disappearances of people, especially young men. One refugee interviewed by Reuters said that if they didn\'t leave when they did, they would have been killed by Amhara forces. 41 other refugees interviewed have also described attacks, looting, and threats by Amhara forces. \c\cIn March 2021, Mulu Nega, then leader of the federal-government-appointed Transitional Government of Tigray, stated that Amhara de facto administrators of Western Tigray used violence against ethnic Tigrayans and forcibly displaced them. Yabsira Eshetie, the administrator of the area, denied the claims. The Amhara government also denied the reports of forced displacement and asked the Ethiopian government to modify the border between the Amhara and Tigray regions. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that there had been acts of ethnic cleansing in Tigray. \c\cPossible COVID-19 outbreaks were feared as refugees fleeing the Tigray conflict sheltered in crowded camps. \c\cIn November 2020, the UN warned of "very critical" supply shortages for the nearly 100,000 Eritrean refugees who, prior to the war, were registered in four camps in Tigray region. Later that same month, the UN reported that people in Tigray were fleeing Mekelle. The federal government had warned of "no mercy" if Tigray forces and residents remained intermingled. \c\cAs of December 2020, the UN estimated more than one million people had been internally displaced by the fighting. More than 50,000 people have fled to Sudan due to the conflict. Communications and travel links were still blocked, and Human Rights Watch warned that "actions that deliberately impede relief supplies" would violate international humanitarian law. \c\cThere were "deeply distressing reports of sexual and gender-based violence, extrajudicial killings, [and the] widespread destruction and looting of public and private property by all parties" according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. More than 136 cases of rape have also been reported in hospitals in Mekelle, Ayder, Adigrat and Wukro in eastern Tigray between December 2020 and January 2021, with indications that there are many more such unreported cases. \c\cAs of 2 February 2021, 20,000 of the Eritrean refugees in Tigray, mostly from the Hitsats and Shimelba camps, remained unaccounted for, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. By March, Shire Inda Selassie had become a major centre for internally displaced people and humanitarian aid distribution. \c\cIn September 2021, the humanitarian situation continued to worsen in Tigray, Afar and Amhara Regions both due to the armed conflict itself and due to bureaucratic obstruction. Two thousand displaced people returned to the Fantí Rasu zone in Afar Region after the ENDF and Afar Special Forces regained control and OCHA partner organisations\' access to improved. \c\cThere have been several reported attacks on humanitarian workers, including attacks by Ethiopian government soldiers. The Danish Refugee Council and the International Rescue Committee reported killings of their staff in early December 2020. \c\cAlthough the Ethiopian federal government claimed to have given "full and unhindered access for humanitarian actors to operate in all parts of the region," many humanitarian agencies reported having been repulsed at army checkpoints and blocked from entry to various regions. There were accusations by US officials that armed forces were specifically singling out humanitarian workers for attack. On 23 March 2021, a driver from Médecins Sans Frontières was beaten by Ethiopian soldiers after witnessing extrajudicial killings by Ethiopian government soldiers. Following the 23 June bombing of Togoga, there were reports of Ethiopian government soldiers firing on ambulances to prevent them from reaching the injured. On 25 June 2021, three Médecins Sans Frontières workers were found murdered near their car in Tigray. \c\cClaire Wilmot, writing in The Washington Post, found that a significant number of new, single-issue Twitter accounts were opened in the immediate aftermath of the 4 November attacks. Most appeared to be authentic accounts from people seeking to raise international awareness of the conflict in the midst of a communications blackout in Tigray. The Ethiopian government cited disinformation and hate speech to justify communications blackouts. Researchers suggested that reducing access to information could help to create contexts where misinformation can thrive because it reduces the ability to verify information. The Ethiopian government tried to control the information environment by positioning itself as the sole provider of reliable information. In February, pro-government groups called on their supporters in Ethiopia and the diaspora to combat what they called "TPLF fake news" online. Pro-government groups used tactics similar to those of pro-Tigray groups to push their narrative of the conflict, though as of 5 February, pro-government campaigns had produced fewer Tweets overall. BBC News showed examples of manipulated photos which misleadingly endorsed both the federal Ethiopian government and the TPLF. Researchers found that groups use tactics such as "copy and paste" campaigns hosted on websites, which include instructions for opening new accounts, copying and pasting pre-written tweets, and tagging influencers. Both campaigns produced disinformation and misinformation, though the majority of content produced was activist in nature. Wilmot suggested that the lines between authentic political activity and deliberate manipulation of online content during the conflict were increasingly blurred. \c\cIn November 2021, the Ethiopian Media Authority (EMA) threatened to cancel the media licences of BBC News, Reuters, CNN and Associated Press, accusing the news organisations of having "consistently disseminated news that sowed seeds of animosity among people and compromised the sovereignty of the country." The EMA cited "reporting the Law enforcement operation as a genocidal campaign" as an example of misleading information aiming to "undermin[e] the [federal] government's efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region". \c\cEthnic profiling against Tigrayans occurred during the Tigray War, with Ethiopians of Tigrayan ethnicity being put on indefinite leave from Ethiopian Airlines or refused permission to board, prevented from overseas travel, and an "order of identifying ethnic Tigrayans from all government agencies and NGOs" being used by federal police to request a list of ethnic Tigrayans from an office of the World Food Programme. Tigrayans\' houses were arbitrarily searched and Tigrayans\' bank accounts suspended. Ethnic Tigrayan members of Ethiopian components of United Nations peacekeeping missions were disarmed and some forcibly flown back to Ethiopia, at the risk of torture or execution, according to United Nations officials. The State of Emergency Taskforce stated that the Tigrayan peacekeepers were returned to Ethiopia because of "infiltration of TPLF elements in various entities". On 1 November 2021, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed stated that "we should closely follow those who work for the enemy and live amongst us", as reports of a new roundup of ethnic Tigrayans came out of Addis Ababa. \c\cSeveral proposals for peace negotiations and mediation were made involving some of the main groups involved in the war. Around 9 November 2020, Debretsion asked the African Union (AU) to stop the war and requested peace negotiations; Abiy refused to negotiate. From 25 to 27 November 2020, a trio of former African presidents appointed by AU chair Cyril Ramaphosa visited Ethiopia with the aim of mediating; they met Abiy and representatives of the Transitional Government of Tigray (that he had appointed to officially replace the government led by the TPLF). An emergency Intergovernmental Authority on Development summit of East African heads of government and state met on 20 December 2020 in Djibouti, resulting in a statement of support for the Ethiopian constitutional order and humanitarian access to the Tigray Region. \c\cOn 19 February 2021, the TPLF expressed its wish for peace negotiations, declaring eight preconditions for the negotiations. On 20 February, the National Congress of Great Tigray (Baytona), Tigray Independence Party (TIP) and Salsay Weyane Tigray (SAWET) published six demands to the international community that closely overlapped with the TPLF's pre-conditions. The possibility of Tigray seceding from Ethiopia was debated by Tigrayans in 2021. As of 2021[update], secession was opposed by senior officials within the TPLF and popular among younger people in Tigray, with expectations that an independence referendum could be organised. \c\cOn 11 March 2021, the US ambassador to Ethiopia, Geeta Pasi, announced support for joint humanitarian activities by international partners and the Government of Ethiopia. During early August 2021, the Government of Sudan attempted to act as a mediator in supporting a peace deal, but its efforts were rejected by the Ethiopian government, who claimed that due to the ongoing border dispute between the two countries over al-Fashaga, Sudan would not be able to act as a neutral mediator. \c\cThe "A3+1" (or A3 plus one), consisting of three African countries, Kenya, Niger and Tunisia and one non-African country, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, is a mediation group in the spirit of "African solutions to African challenges". The A3+1 group called for "mediation of the deep divides as part of an Ethiopian-owned process" with support from existing peace and conflict resolution structure, "especially those of the African Union". \c\cIn the first week of November 2020, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) issued a statement saying "ONLF is gravely concerned about the ... outbreak of war in and around Tigray. The nations of Ethiopia have had their share of wars and natural disasters, and were expecting a period of reprieve and recuperation. Consensus and dialogue are the only way forward for all to reach a win-win solution". An anonymous civil society member in Jigjiga stated: "We oppose the decision of [Somali Region] President Mustafe to portray Somalis in Ethiopia as supporters of the war against Tigray". \c\cOn 12 November 2020, TPLF chairman Debretsion Gebremichael denied allegations that the Tigray forces had surrendered, stating that "we are still holding. These people cannot defeat us. We cannot be beaten."\c\cOn 27 November, Ethiopian Attorney General, Gedion Timothewos, pressed by the BBC's Stephen Sackur to clarify if his country was now "sinking into civil war", responded: "If the Prime Minister were to let the TPLF go on with the kind of things they have been doing, if he had let them acquire the heavy weaponry they wanted to acquire by attacking the Northern Command, yes, we would have descended into that kind of situation; but by taking the measures we are taking right now, we will be able to avert that possibility."\c\cWhen Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018, he made significant reforms to Ethiopia's judicial system, economy, and foreign policy. According to an article by Hailemariam Desalegn, the former prime minister of Ethiopia, TPLF officials were concerned these moves were going to threaten their political and economic position in the federation. Thus, according to Hailemariam, TPLF officials started defying the orders from the federal government and made overt and covert actions to undermine and delegitimise the Ethiopian parliament, armed forces and the federal government. \c\cOn 10 September 2021, a collective of 24 Ethiopian civil society organisations called for peace in Ethiopia, stating:\c\c Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne called on all parties to show restraint. Champagne also called for a peaceful solution and protection of civilians. \c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, China objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Djiboutian President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh expressed strong support for Abiy, saying that he had chosen to "restore law and order at the federal level, and punish those seeking to break up the country" and dismissed the prospect of negotiations, saying that the TPLF had "structured itself so as to bring the central government to its knees" and that talks could "only lead to the partition of Ethiopia", setting a precedent for secession by other groups in the region. \c\c Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki stated in a February 2021 Eritrean television interview that the 2018 Ethiopia–Eritrea peace agreement had been "a clear indication that the role of [the TPLF had] ended or \'game over\'". He stated that Eritrea had "the responsibility and obligation to support Ethiopia more than any of our other neighbouring countr[ies]", which "is why [Eritrea is] supporting Ethiopia and the conflict over the [previous] 3 months". \c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, India objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Japan extended its emergency grant aid of 6.6 million US dollars for people affected by the war. \c\c Kenya, expressed political support for the Ethiopian national government. \c\c Minister of Foreign Affairs (Turkey) Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu stated that the Turkish government "understood" the federal Ethiopian government's decision and "expressed his confidence that the operation would end soon and not compromise the safety of civilians."\c\c Norway said it was "deeply concerned by reports of the use of SGBV in Tigray. Norway joins UN Special Rapporteur Pramilla Patten in calling on all parties to commit to a zero-tolerance policy for SGBV. Obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law must be respected."\c\c The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in response to the massacre in the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, "We strongly condemn the perpetrators of this barbaric crime committed in a place of worship. We expect the Ethiopian authorities to immediately take all possible to clarify its circumstances and punish the perpetrators.” Poland also called "on the parties to the conflict to refrain from violence and respect human rights, to ensure the safety of civilian population, and to properly protect the places of worship and freedom of religion. We appeal for an unimpeded access for humanitarian deliveries to the Tigray province. \c\c At the UN Security Council meeting, Russia objected to interfering in Ethiopia's internal affairs. \c\c Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo politically supports the current military actions taken by the Ethiopian government against Tigray People's Liberation Front. \c\c British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had spoken with Abiy and urged "de-escalation of the Tigray conflict" and further stated that "civilians and humanitarian access must be protected". \c\cBritish House of Lords member, David Alton, called on the British government to investigate the reports of massacres and attacks on refugee camps in Tigray. \c\c Then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged de-escalation of the conflict and immediate action to restore peace, and emphasized the importance of protecting civilians. Then US President-elect Joe Biden's foreign policy adviser Antony Blinken expressed deep concern over the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, ethnic violence and threats to peace and security in the area. He called on the TPLF to protect civilians and take steps to end the conflict. \c\cUS Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Tibor Nagy condemned the Tigray People's Liberation Front for their rocket attacks against Asmara, calling it an "unjustifiable attacks against Eritrea ... its efforts to internationalize the conflict in Tigray."\c\cOn 27 February 2021, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces and Amhara regional forces from Tigray. He also asked the African Union and regional partners, to work with the United States to address the crisis in Tigray. \c\cOn 12 March, the US announced it would be resuming some aid to Ethiopia, which had previously been blocked by the Trump administration over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) dispute, but that security assistance programs would remain suspended due to concerns over the conflict in Tigray. \c\c President Joe Biden met with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta to discuss the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Tigray and the need to prevent further loss of life and to ensure humanitarian access. \c\c On 17 September 2021, President Joe Biden signed a new executive order allowing Washington to take punitive sanctions against the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Tigray People's Liberation Front and the Amhara Regional government if they play a role in prolonging the conflict, obstructing humanitarian access or commit serious human rights abuses. \c\c The United Nations (UN)\c\cIn November 2020, the UN warned that, if a full-scale conflict arose, it could lead to a major humanitarian crisis. \c\cThough the UN Security Council had planned "to issue a statement calling for an end to violence in Ethiopia's Tigray region," these plans were canceled on 5 March 2021 due to Chinese and Russian opposition. \c\cOn 3 November 2021, the UN said that all sides in the conflict had "committed violations of international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, some of which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity."\c\cOn 5 November 2021, the United Nations Security Council unanimously issued a statement calling "for a cessation of hostilities." A follow-up meeting is expected in the following week. \c\c The European Commission said it was mobilizing an initial €4 million in emergency aid, in order to assist displaced Ethiopian refugees who had fled to Sudan. The EU plans on cutting aid to and sanctioning other regions of Ethiopia due to the conflict. \c\c The African Union (AU) appealed for cessation of hostilities and protection of civilians. The AU also stated that the European Union and United Nations Security Council should not intervene until an African Union envoy is sent to Ethiopia. \c\cThe Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, made a statement defending the Ethiopian Government by tweeting "In #Ethiopia, the federal govt took bold steps to preserve the unity, stability and respect for the constitutional order of the country; which is legitimate for all states. It cannot be denied, however, that the crisis in #Tigray has provoked large scale displacement. We encourage #IGAD to support #Ethiopia in addressing the humanitarian dimensions. Particular attention should be paid to refugees and displaced people. #IgadSummit."\c\cWorldwide, humanitarian organizations and the scientific community asked for a rapid ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Tigray. \c\cInternational petitions for humanitarian aid to Tigray have been launched, for instance by concerned scientists (Professors Jan Nyssen, Eloi Ficquet, Wolbert Smidt, Jozef Deckers, Istvan Tarrosy, Paolo Billi, Sil Lanckriet, Kjetil Tronvoll and others), and another one on Avaaz. \c\cOn 9 February 2021, when religious leaders started a visit to Mekelle organized by federal authorities to show that the situation was "normal", protestors used stones and burnt tires to block central parts of the town in objection to the claim that the situation had returned to normality. Soldiers fired at the protestors, killing one. The head of the transport division of Ayder Referral Hospital and his son was beaten by soldiers and stated that there were many injured who were not being brought to the hospital. \c\cOn 30 May 2021, more than 10,000 pro-Ethiopia protestors gathered in Addis Ababa to protest "Western intervention" in the domestic affairs of Ethiopia. On 8 August 2021, thousands of protesters gathered in Addis Ababa to denounce the TDF. On 7 November 2021, thousands of protesters gathered in Addis Ababa to denounce the TPLF and diplomatic efforts to end the war. \c\cEthiopians and Eritreans in the diaspora took to the streets to protest and express their views.

Piracy in the Gulf of Guinea  affects a number of countries in West Africa as well as the wider international community.  By 2011, it had become an issue of global concern.  Pirates in the Gulf of Guinea are often part of heavily armed criminal enterprises, who employ violent methods to steal oil cargo. In 2012, the International Maritime Bureau, Oceans Beyond Piracy and the Maritime Piracy Humanitarian Response Program reported that the number of vessels attacks by West African pirates had reached a world high, with 966 seafarers attacked during the year. According to the Control Risks Group, pirate attacks in the Gulf of Guinea had by mid-November 2013 maintained a steady level of around 100 attempted hijackings in the year, a close second behind the Strait of Malacca in Southeast Asia. \c\cPiracy in the Gulf of Guinea continues to be a concern to the shipping industry, which is affected significantly. At the same time, governments in the region generally highlight that the fight against piracy requires a broad understanding of maritime security throughout the Gulf of Guinea. \c\cThe Gulf of Guinea stretches from Senegal to Angola, covering over 6,000 km of coast line. It comprises 20 coastal states, islands and landlocked states and forms two regions: West Africa and Central Africa. The sea basin is of geo-political and geo-economic importance for the transport of goods to and from central and southern Africa. Additionally, it is a choke point for the African energy trade, with intensive oil extraction in Nigeria's Niger Delta. \c\cThe term ‘piracy’ is widely used in the media and in official reports to generally refer to maritime crime in the region, but this is formally incorrect, as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea defines piracy as an act conducted on the high seas i.e. beyond territorial waters. Similar criminal activities that take place within territorial waters are not defined as acts of piracy following this definition in international law. \c\cReports of attempted or actual attacks considered acts of piracy, differ wildly. This has added to a general confusion with regards to understanding the scope of the problem, fuelled significantly by the varied use of the term piracy itself, the uncoordinated and heterogeneous sources of information drawn from to prepare reports and the different stakeholders\' interests in portraying the problem one way or another. \c\cEven though piracy in the region is not a new phenomenon, it has widely changed in the new century, with regards both to the typology and the number of attacks carried out. In the past, the vast majority of incidents could be categorized as simple maritime robbery: individual sailors, usually carrying cash, were often targeted for robbery on shore, and attacked when ships were at port or transferring cargo close to shore.  However, since the early 2010s, attacks have started to differ from this profile: operations have become more sophisticated and organised. To facilitate successful operation, the pirates now draw on extensive piracy networks to gain access to security and economic resources. This includes government officials, businesspeople, armed groups, and transnational mafia. Incursions have been more serious and aimed at directly acquired cargos containing refined petroleum, as the region has increasingly been marred by illegal oil-bunkering. According to a European Parliament report, this was due to the discovery of large amounts of offshore hydrocarbon, from which only the central government, local elites, and oil companies have actually profited. Consequently, some of those excluded from welfare have turned to such illegal maritime activity, in the form of \'petro-piracy\'. \c\cBy 2010, 45 and by 2011 64 incidents were reported to the UN International Maritime Organization. However, many events go unreported. Piracy acts interfere with the legitimate trading interests of the affected countries that include Benin, Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. As an example, trade of Benin's major port, the Port of Cotonou, was reported in 2012 to have dropped by 70 percent. The cost of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea due to stolen goods, security, and insurance has been estimated to be about $2 billion. Navies and law enforcement agencies trying to tackle problems with piracy in the Gulf of Guinea have to conduct a thorough analysis of different types of attacks. \c\cAs of 2014, pirate attacks in West Africa mainly occur in territorial waters, terminals and harbours rather than in the high seas. This incident pattern has hindered intervention by international naval forces. Pirates in the region operate a well-funded criminal industry, which includes established supply networks. They are often part of heavily armed and sophisticated criminal enterprises, who increasingly use motherships to launch their attacks. The local pirates\' overall aim is to steal oil cargo. As such, they do not attach much importance to holding vessels for ransom. Additionally, pirates in the Gulf of Guinea are especially noted for their violent modus operandi, which frequently involves the kidnapping, torture and shooting of crewmen. The increasingly violent methods used by these groups is believed to be part of a conscious "business model" adopted by them, in which violence and intimidation plays a major role. \c\cAccording to the 2018 Oceans Beyond Piracy report, covering the year 2017, the number of seafarers affected by piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea has decreased slightly compared to 2016. In total 1,726 seafarers were affected by piracy and armed robbery in 2017 in West African waters, compared to the 1,921 the year before. While 880 failed attacks or boarding occurred, 21 episodes of kidnapping took place and 100 seafarers were taken hostages. In total, there were 97 piracy and robbery incidents involving weapons, 13 of those with guns and 2 with heavy machine guns. The total estimated cost in the area due to stolen goods, contracted maritime security, insurance has been $818.1 million. \c\cThe International Maritime Bureau said that 130 seafarers were kidnapped in 22 separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea in 2020, surpassing the 2019 record of 121 kidnappings. \c\cA combination of root causes can be attributed to the pervasive presence of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, most of which display considerable overlap. Overall, research seems to indicate that when speaking of piracy, it is important not to focus on one single solution, and instead approach the battle from a multi-layered perspective, solving multiple issues with a combination of national, regional, and international efforts. The following section breaks down some of the identified root causes for the pervasiveness of piracy in the region. \c\cFindings from Nigeria have indicated corruption as a major cause of piracy, typically attributed to the weak legal and jurisdictional systems, law enforcement and the security apparatus of the nation. This lack of development is attributed to and identified in many of the Gulf of Guinea states. \c\cCorruption represents a threat to democracy when powerful individuals or organizations, particularly those linked to the military and security sectors, utilize their positions to serve their own interests at the expense of the integrity of other persons, authorities, and institutions in charge of protecting the properties and assets within the nation. These pervasive practices also manifest in matters of the sea, as evidenced from the Nigerian navy, who have routinely engaged in oil bunkering, while public officials have also reportedly benefited from piracy in a multitude of ways, including engaging in corrupt practices that arise opportunistically when producing and exporting oil in the Niger Delta, resulting in the disappearance billions of dollars into overseas bank accounts of corrupt public officials and politicians. The challenges in studying the association between corruption and piracy have been in finding the clear connections between corrupt officials and pirates, and in revealing whether piracy works primarily as ad hoc, short-term relationships between pirates, powerful organizations and corrupt public officials, or if it is deeply entrenched in the wider governmental structures. \c\cA state’s incapability to maintain control over its own territorial waters can lead to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which marginalises local fishermen who may in turn resort to criminal activity, including piracy (see also youth unemployment below). \c\cAccording to the Food and Agriculture and Agriculture Organization, Illegal fishing is which is that conducted ‘by national or foreign vessels in waters under the jurisdiction of a state, without the permission of that state, or in contravention of its laws and regulations’, and it also includes vessels fishing in breach of other national and international laws or obligations, including in the high seas. \c\cIn Somalia, after the collapse of its government institutions in the early 1990s, foreign commercial fishing vessels had begun fishing off the Somali coastline, invading its territorial waters and EEZ and catching over three times as much fish stock as Somali fishermen could, a venture that has proven to be a generously profitable alternative to legal fishing (IUU valued somewhere between “$15.5 and $36.4 billion annually and accounts for 20 to 50% of the global catch.”, according to Stimson center). This unbridled exploitation damages ecosystems and local communities alike and, as shown in Somalia, causes economic grievances that drive many Somalis into the ranks of Piracy organizations. This way, fishermen stand to earn several thousand US dollars from a single pirate attack, a substantially higher amount than would otherwise be possible by toiling hard for months in the legal economy. \c\cThe very institution of elections has been related to an increase in political violence (particularly homicides), as government officials worry about keeping their power, and the fragile political structures may fail to protect their interests. When the stakes are high, violence is produced, notably and overwhelmingly by weaker incumbents, while more powerful ones are more likely to resort to non-violent methods, such as manipulation. Terrorist attacks have also been reported to peak around election time, particularly in dictatorships, and in democracies with lower levels of electoral permissiveness. \c\cBy extrapolating political violence and piracy and relating it to the electoral process in weakened states, we see these two phenomena share multiple similarities. Elections threaten to disrupt the already established deals between pirates and the incumbent authorities. Hence, during elections, especially highly competitive ones, there is an increase in piratical activity. This activity signals two conditions:\c\c-       Due to the uncertainty caused by a possible change in regime, there is an increased incentive to engage in piracy before the instability caused by the new incumbents settles in, possibly disrupting existing relationships. \c\c-       Pirates displaying their influence to local elites, whose support they also need in order to stabilize the environments in which these pirates operate. \c\cAdditionally, opportunities for piracy also rise in accordance with the strength of the political institutions neighbouring the attack (weaker institutions permitting a higher frequency of attacks), as piracy tends to thrive in environments in which the rule of law is weakened, corruption is abundant and governance is weak, as also supported by the higher frequency of attacks occurring further from the nearest capital with strong governance. As such, a lofty goal for the Gulf of Guinea is to pursue a tight adherence to the rule of law and good governance, not only at a national level but at a regional level, since local efforts to tackle piracy are hardly enough when the overall regional governance is substandard. \c\cYouth unemployment is an identified root cause of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, a link that is particularly accentuated when linking African youth unemployment to piracy in Nigeria. As prime victims of unemployment and marginalization, this subsector of society is made more likely to resort to criminality, such as piracy and oil theft, in order to make a living. The Nigerian state particularly offers the perfect conditions for young Nigerians to feel aggrieved and organize: Seeing their government receive money from the proceeds of the sale of oil, while most people are excluded from participating in this sector, creates the perfect storm for conflicts and hostile behaviour, and ultimately lead these youths to become militants and engage in piracy. \c\cWhile the adherence of Nigerian youth to piracy as having a spillover effect in the wider region of the Gulf of Guinea remains contested, research from Somalia indicates that state-building alone is not enough, and must be paired along with tackling youth unemployment, income inequality and environmental degradation, in order to combat the wider growth of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. \c\cThe argument goes that it is not enough to tackle piracy as it stands, but it is equally necessary to minimise the incentives for individuals to join piracy in the first place. Somali fishermen, seeing their waters increasingly overfished (also see: Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing above) by foreign industrial vessels their small embarkations cannot compete with, had become alienated from the ‘legal economy’. This, added to the dumping of toxic materials in the water, further reduces the existing stock, damaging the fishermen’s income and worsening their access to the economy. Seduced by the vast gains to be made for each successful attack, it becomes easier to engage in piracy, and a whole industry (backed by financiers and merchants who rely on these disenfranchised fishermen to prop up) is established as these illegal endeavours become increasingly more justifiable whenever successful attacks occur. Conversely, as economic opportunities increase, it becomes harder to justify risking capture and incarceration by authorities versus the income from working in the legal economy. \c\cThe perfect storm, then, seems to be a combination of huge gains to be made from piracy versus the small or null to be made in the legal economy, allied to the low likelihood of getting caught and punished due to government weakness, and an ever-expanding pool of recruits as the number of successful piracy incidents increase and incentivise further piracy attempts, all of which need to be addressed in conjunction in order to effectively tackle piracy. \c\cWhile piracy in Somalia now seems to be reducing in numbers, in no small part due to improved security aboard ships and overall awareness, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea is nonetheless on the rise, and hence the lessons from the Somalian experiment may prove increasingly valuable as a case study. Piracy is also raising in complexity, evolving from simple armed robberies to planned and violent assaults on oil tankers, further adding to the urgency in tackling these issues. \c\cThe structural characteristics of governmental institutions also have a significant impact on the prevalence of piratical activity, as state weakness is represented as the most common explanation for maritime piracy, despite disagreements as to exactly at what level of governance this weakness is most relevant to piracy. Regional analyses have shown that fiscal decentralization (spreading of control of finances across a network, as opposed to having the control focused on one lone entity within) at a national level lowers the number of piratical incidents, as regions have larger stakes in the revenue streams that typically arise from peaceful settings, while a political decentralisation (distribution of institutional power across several actors within a network) analysis indicates that bigger governmental institutions at the lower tiers of governance seem to foster an increase in piracy incidents, due to reduced competition among local jurisdictions. When bottom line institutions are smaller, however, more institutions can flourish and inter-judicial competition becomes, in itself, a deterrent to piracy. Interestingly, larger autonomy at a regional level and in bottom tier elections reduce piracy, as local officials gain enough power to take ownership of their law enforcement policies. \c\cOverall, the overwhelming research indicates that the fragility of the state, when allied to a lack of economic opportunities are factors that increase piracy. Weak states also lack a combination of coastal security personnel, run ineffective courts and house corrupt elites which, when allied to substantial inequality and unemployment, cause considerable grievance in the population and facilitate the creation of sanctuaries for criminal activity. \c\cSea blindness as a concept is inherent to the novelty that is the study of Maritime security and refers to a generalised ‘neglect’ of the importance of the sea, which also extends to the political and scholarly class. Sea blindness manifests in a multitude of ways, from the NATO countries being guilty of inattention in modernizing their navy, to the general populations of the UK and Australia being largely ignorant as to their regional dependence on the sea, to the UK government’s substantial ‘need for security, vulnerability to interruption of supply, and a weakened naval force structure’. \c\cThis phenomenon, while not a direct cause for the rise of piracy, indicates a much broader overlook of the importance of sea matters at a global scale, from academics to policymakers, which in turn allows piracy and other maritime crimes such as environmental degradation and fishery crimes to flourish largely unbridled. Maritime security has become a core issue among major global security actors, and yet the scholarly fields of International Relations and security studies have scarcely studied it, as the bulk of the literature tends to only focus on such issues in relation to the study of precise geographic hot spots or during the study of precise threats such as piracy, organized crime in West Africa and human trafficking in the Mediterranean. Related issues, such as fishery crimes and environmental crimes rarely go explored, as are the underlying connections between these themes. \c\cGiven the proximity of some of the world’s major capitals to coastal areas, with around 80% of the world population living within a 160 kilometres range of the coastline as of 2017, and our overwhelming dependence on sea trade, which still accounts for 90% of all our goods traded globally, (See also: Blue economy) the study of maritime security becomes of supreme importance in all its forms if we are to understand and tackle definite issues such as piracy and fishery crimes. Zooming out of specific maritime crimes and geographic locations and into the wider holistic study of maritime security may have the desired knock-on effect over specific issues of crime at sea by osmosis. \c\cThis section provides a detailed account of the number and kind of attacks occurred in the Gulf of Guinea in the last years. This is done by resorting to the IMB's annual reports, in particular those ranging in the ten-year span between 2009 and 2018. These reports are the most detailed and complete source of piracy related facts, and provide a vast amount of information. However, IMB relies on ship-owners’ willingness to report piracy incidents, and needs the shipping industry to be comfortable to do so. As IMB itself admitted, this is not always the case. In fact, they may lack the willingness or simply the technical ability to do so, especially in the case of very small boats. This results in unreported acts of piracy, with some attacks falling outside the official statistics.  Below, two tables list the actual and attempted attacks for the past ten years, where the numbers are all drawn from the same source for consistency purposes. \c\cAlthough several policy initiatives and legal reforms have been undertaken to combat piracy in the region, the question remains as to the efficiency of current arrangements. Only a few collective responses have been forthcoming to prevent or effectively eliminate the threat. Above all, the strategic plan to combat piracy has been inadequate in acknowledging fully the causes contributing to piracy. Traditionally, the principal means to combat piracy has been through military intervention. However, the coastal states in the Gulf of Guinea have limited maritime capacity and restrained capabilities to handle piracy and other threats at sea. \c\c‘Operation Prosperity’ was an initiative launched by Nigeria and Benin in 2011 to ensure a secure maritime environment. The project was initially supposed to last for a period of six months, and was extended for another six months. The deal between the two countries foresaw that the Nigerian navy would provide the vessels and most of the logistics and human resources for the operation, while the Benin navy would open its waters for Nigerian naval vessels to patrol. Between the end of 2011 and the start of 2012, the area saw a reduction of attempted and actual attacks, thanks to the continuous presence of military forces in the maritime domain, and the two navies’ information and intelligence sharing. In addition to technical collaboration, the Benin navy also benefitted from training with its Nigerian counterpart. \c\cAnother interesting countermeasure is the launch of the Maritime Trade Information Sharing Centre Gulf of Guinea (MTISC-GOG). As reported by RDDC, this ‘was initiated mainly by the industry as a result of the lack of involvement by regional states in maritime security’. This centre, which changed its name in 2016 to Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade – Gulf of Guinea, works as a voluntary reporting system, and encourages vessels to report their position and course of direction as well as any suspect activity they might encounter. \c\cOn June 25, 2013, 25 countries from West and Central Africa gathered in Yaoundé, Cameroon to lay the basis for a common regional strategy to prevent and prosecute illicit activities in the waters of the Gulf of Guinea. The Yaoundé Summit led to the creation of three mechanisms: the Yaoundé Code of Conduct, the Heads of States Declaration and the Memorandum of Understanding between regional organisations. The Yaoundé Code of Conduct (YCOC), is a comprehensive regional maritime security framework aimed at enhancing cooperation and information-sharing in the wider Gulf of Guinea. It is the widest and most ambitious regional initiative taken so far to counter piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. Despite piracy and armed robbery at sea being the primary drivers of its creation, the scope of the YCOC covers several additional illicit maritime activities, such as  illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, narcotics and wildlife trafficking, maritime pollution, and maritime terrorism. The YCOC, also known as the Code of Conduct Concerning the Repression of Piracy Armed Robbery against Ships, and Illicit Maritime Activity in West and Central Africa, consists of 21 articles. \c\cThe Governments that have signed the code of conduct are Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The responsibilities and tasks that signatory states have committed to include to share and report relevant information, arrest, investigate, and prosecute persons who have committed piracy or are reasonably suspected of committing piracy, rescuing ships, persons and property subject to piracy, designating a national focal point to facilitate coordinated, cooperating on the development and promotion of training and educational programs for the management of the marine environment.  In addition, two regional information-sharing centers were developed and put into place in order to enable the implementation of the YCOC: The Regional Centre for Maritime Security in Central Africa (CRESMAC) based in Pointe-Noire, Republic of the Congo, which assists the countries of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) as well as The Regional Coordination Centre for Maritime Security in West Africa (CRESMAO), based in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, which serves the countries of the Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS.) The Inter-regional Coordination Centre in Yaoundé, Cameroon is coordinating both information-sharing centers. \c\cHowever, it is worth noticing that the Yaoundé Code of Conduct, as many other international conventions and  other similar code of conduct, is not a legally binding document and does not impose any obligation on signatory states. Therefore, its full and effective implementation is necessarily dependent on the good will, wealth and capacity of such states. \c\cOn June 10, 2021 the Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari launched the Deep Blue Project, officially known as The Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure. The project was initiated by the Federal Ministry of Transportation and Federal Ministry of Defence but is being implemented by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). Before the launch of this ambitious project, Nigeria’s Maritime Security Unit (MSU) has conducted simulation exercises and demonstrated their preparedness of tackling piracy outside the coast of Nigeria. The primary objective of the Deep Blue Project is to secure Nigerian Waters up to the Gulf of Guinea and give Nigeria more leverage to harness the enormous resources of the maritime environment resultantly enabling further economic diversification. Moreover, the project is divided into three platforms focusing on maritime security on land, sea and air. Firstly, the land assets include the Command, Control, Communication, Computer, and Intelligence Centre for intelligence gathering, 16 armoured vehicles for coastal patrol; and 600 specially trained troops for interdiction. Secondly, the sea assets include 2 special Missions Vessels and 17 fast interceptor Boats. Finally, the air assets comprise 2 Special Mission Aircraft for surveillance of the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), as well as 3 Special Mission Helicopters. These ambitious efforts and assets makes the Deep Blue Project the first national integrated maritime security strategy in West and Central Africa. The idea is that this strategic partnership between NIMASA and international organisations will be helpful in the efforts to improve the regional approach to solving maritime security challenges in the Gulf of Guinea. \c\cThe Gulf of Guinea is a valuable global shipping route with numerous international shipping conglomerates passing through the region everyday. With this large flow of the global economy flowing through the Gulf, the issue of piracy has caught the attention of the international actors. Significant capacity building investments have been made by international actors, like the US, China, and some European states, in the Gulf of Guinea to train local militaries and support states in the regions to counter piracy. Capacity building is a central commonality out of all the varying national maritime strategies that international actors and the core of many of these actors’ counter piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. \c\cNevertheless, actions of international actors in the Gulf can have unintended consequences, such as political kidnappings. A localised approach with dialogue focused on regional clans on land can have a greater level of success to counter piracy, rather than efforts that are singularly concentrated on the land or sea. The localised focus on actors in communities is important because it is the local communities that sustain piracy and if international actors want to tackle piracy in the Gulf, they need to hone their counter piracy and capacity building on the root causes of piracy. This requires a concerted capacity building drive to strengthen local governments, reduce corruption and illegal economic opportunities. \c\cThe push by international actors to counter piracy has been relatively successful off the coast of Somalia, as a result, counter piracy in the Western Indian Ocean holds valuable lessons for tackling piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. At present the institutions and efforts of international actors to respond to the prevalent threat of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea have proven to be largely fruitless. The two models of counter piracy by international actors allows for understanding the current counterpiacy situation in the Gulf; the ‘failed state’ model – where international actors have a relatively free rein to counter piracy, which was witnessed in Somalia – and the ‘regional’ model – which requires the international community to cooperate, coordinate and work within the confines of numerous central governments in the region, which is on display in the Gulf of Guinea. As counter piracy efforts in Somalia and the Gulf of Guinea showcase, the ‘failed state’ model is best suited to international actors dealing with piracy. The plethora of robust central governments in the GoG makes the ‘regional’ model less effective for counter piracy by international actors. \c\cThe UN Security Council issued two resolutions, in 2011 and 2012 respectively, initiated by Benin and Togo, which set out the need for promoting the maintenance of peace and stability in general in the Gulf of Guinea region and encourage international partners to enhance the counter-piracy capabilities of regional states and organizations. In the 2011 resolution, the Security Council expressed \c\cConsequently, the organization \c\cIn the 2012 resolution, the Security Council, \c\cThe International Maritime Organization's 2017 strategy for implementing sustainable maritime security measures in West and Central Africa outlines the organization's strategy to enhance maritime security in West and Central Africa, with a view to countering piracy and armed robberies against ships and to support the development of the maritime sector. This strategy consists of several elements, including the effective implementation of IMO conventions, in order to build the necessary legislative infrastructure to criminalize piracy; bilateral assistance and continued follow up engagement, to be carried out in a tailored way so as to match the needs of IMO member states; regional training, which focuses on developing legal frameworks for the prevention and repression of piracy, and on training officials at various level for the investigation of piracy-related crimes; assignment of expertise to accelerate change and facilitating channels of communications among IMO member states. \c\cThe International Maritime Bureau (IMO) reported in January 2020 that piracy in the Gulf of Guinea had increased by 50% in 2019. \c\cThe European Union is one of the main actors in the fight against piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. In 2014 the EU adopted its strategy for the Gulf of Guinea, which is based on the overall goals laid out under the aforementioned Yaoundé Code of Conduct. It has four strategic objectives: building a common understanding of the scale of the threat (reducing so-called "sea-blindness"), helping regional governments to put in place robust multiagency institutions, supporting the development of prosperous economies and strengthening the existing cooperation structures. In addition, the EU is attempting to develop long-term security and stability through the promotion of inclusive growth, generating benefits from wealth and job creation for all people. \c\cThe maritime security of the Gulf is a source of major concern for Denmark. On average, 40 Danish ships sail there daily, representing a commodity value of almost DKK 10 billion per year. From November 2021 and for a period of five months, a Danish navy ship will be engaged in the Gulf with a SeaHawk helicopter and special forces from the naval task force on board. The ship will be tasked with combating piracy, supporting or "escorting" merchant ships, and if necessary to come to their aid or carry out rescues. The proposal from the Danish Ministry of Defence also grants the Danish frigate the mandate to "seize the pirates\' weapons and equipment". \c\cInterpol has also launched a number of initiatives to improve the capabilities of the local police forces to tackle piracy effectively. The action of Interpol has revolved around three main areas: improving the evidence collection capabilities of the local police forces; facilitating a better cooperation between the actors of the different countries involved; making sure that hostages are debriefed and interviewed and all relevant information is gathered. \c\cThe legal framework governing piracy and other maritime offences in the Gulf of Guinea is historically The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In addition, projects have been launched by international organisations and agencies such as the IMO, IMB and regional efforts by continental bodies such as the European Union, African Union and other continents, sub-regional efforts as in the case of the Gulf of Guinea by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). \c\cThe international legal regime pertaining to maritime piracy has developed and grown over the years. These changes were prompted due increased maritime domain awareness and to lacunas in the legal system, which surfaced when the codified laws were implemented.  However, the lack of harmonisation of universal laws and national laws, as well as overlapping and contradicting jurisdictions across states impedes the process of deterring piracy. There are suggestions that in order to facilitate effective prosecution, the Gulf of Guinea states should favour a uniform legislative framework that comprehensively domesticates the relevant key provisions of The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and The Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA). However, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea occurs mostly in the territorial seas and EEZ’s of coastal states. In this sense, the primary responsibility to suppress piracy lies with the national security forces of the countries in the region. Notably, the growth of piracy in the region is due mainly to the inability of the coastal states to defend their territorial seas. Therefore, it is in their strategic interest to develop and implement national laws that are criminalising piracy. So far, the only country that has implemented a law exclusively focusing on the prosecution of Piracy is Nigeria: The Suppression of piracy and other maritime offences act, 2019 (SPOMO Act). Before the enactment of the SPOMO Act, there was no legislation criminalising piracy in the Gulf of Guinea which made prosecution of pirates very challenging as the pirates had to be prosecuted under other illicit maritime offences. \c\cNigerian waters remain hotspots for piratical acts, having the highest number of pirate attacks in the world in 2020.  Furthermore, there has been no prosecution of pirates up until recently, despite the compelling evidence confirming that piracy and armed robbery against ships within the Nigerian maritime domain have remained consistent over the past years. Cases abound where pirates were arrested by the Nigerian Navy and the arrested pirates were later released on bail without further prosecution for piratical activities. The prosecution of pirates is a veritable way to stem the tide of piracy off the coast of Nigeria. While prosecution of suspected criminals has been a challenge historically, the Suppression of Piracy and Other Maritime Offences (SPOMO) Act passed by the 9th National Assembly would now provide a legal backing for prosecution and punishment of offenders. \c\cOne of the key mandates of The SPOMO is to curtail illegal activities of pirates at sea as well as to reduce the incidence of other maritime offences in domestic and international waters. The SPOMO act’s  definition of piracy follows the definition of piracy under Article 101 of UNCLOS. One objective of the SPOMO Act is to domesticate UNCLOS and SUA, and as such harmonise the national framework based on key International legal provisions on piracy. Another aspect that the SPOMO Act is clarifying and defining is the responsibilities of each maritime stakeholder to avert conflicts of roles and overlapping responsibilities. As for the mandate to exercise jurisdiction, the Act gives the Federal High Court (FHC) exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any matter under the Act. \c\cIn August, 202 the Federal High Court in Lagos, Nigeria convicted the first pirates under  the Suppression of Piracy and Other Maritime Offences Act. The three prosecuted individuals include two Nigerians and one foreign national were fined $52,000 each for hijacking a ship in March, 2020 and securing a ransom of $200,000 for the release of its crew. \c\cJanuary 4, 2009: Pirates hijacked the French ship Bourbon Leda with five Nigerians, two Ghanaians, one Cameroonian and one Indonesian on board. It was freed on January 7. \c\cJanuary 21: Gunmen attacked the diesel tanker MT Meredith and kidnapped a Romanian, who was released a day later. \c\cApril 21: Rebels attacked the Turkish ship Ilena Mercan and kidnapped two crewmen. \c\cNovember 24: Pirates hijacked the Liberian-flagged Cancale Star off Benin and killed a Ukrainian officer before robbing the ship. \c\cDecember 1: The Ghanaian Navy intercepted the hijacked oil tanker African Prince a week after it had been taken. The pirates escaped; they had killed the ship's chef. \c\cMarch 13, 2010: A Chinese fishing vessel was hijacked off the Bakassi Peninsula, Cameroon. Seven fishermen were abducted. The kidnappers demanded a ransom and later released the vessel and its passengers on March 18. \c\cSeptember 23: Three Frenchmen were kidnapped from a vessel belonging to the company Bourbon off the Nigerian coast. \c\cAugust 3, 2011: Two Panamanian-flagged tankers were attacked off Benin's coast but the ships were not taken. In the previous week, an Italian diesel tanker and a Swedish tanker were also attacked off Benin. \c\cAugust 19, 2012: A British-owned oil tanker was hijacked in the Port of Togo. Authorities suggest that the same group hijacked a Greek-owned oil tanker in this region. \c\cAugust 28, 2012: A Greek-owned oil tanker was hijacked in the Port of Togo. Authorities suggested that the pirates would siphon off the gas oil from these types of vessel hijackings in the region. \c\cSeptember 4, 2012: A Singaporean-flagged oil tanker, MT Abu Dhabi Star, was hijacked off the coast of Lagos, Nigeria. The pirates broke glass windows to access the bridge of the 183-metre (600 ft) long vessel. The pirates fled as soon as they realized a Nigerian naval ship was approaching. It was suspected that although the pirates fled, they may have attempted to siphon off the gas from the ship. \c\cOctober 15, 2012: A Luxembourgish-flagged anchor handling vessel named  AHT Bourbon Liberty 249, was hijacked while off the coast of Nigeria. \c\cDecember 23, 2012: an Italian-registered ship was hijacked by seven Nigerian pirates, off the coast of the state of Bayelsa. The pirates successively released the ship with most of the crew, but took three Italians and a Ukrainian as hostages, who were freed a couple of weeks later. \c\cJanuary 16, 2013: A Panamanian-flagged vessel, ITRI (owned by the Ivory Coast company, Koda Maritime), was hijacked while transferring 5,000 tons of oil near Abidjan. \c\cFebruary 3, 2013: A Luxembourg-flagged oil tanker, Gascogne (owned by France) was hijacked approximately 130 km (70 nmi) south of the port city of Abidjan. \c\cFebruary 4, 2013: A Marshall Islands-flagged chemical tanker, Pyxis Delta (owned by the UAE), was hijacked off the coast of Nigeria.

Four other pirates were detained and taken aboard by Frogman Corps. The incident took place 5 to 30 nautical miles south of the Nigerian coast.
The 2021 Solomon Islands unrest is a series of ongoing demonstrations and violent riots in the Solomon Islands, which began on 24 November 2021. \c\cThe Solomon Islands had historically been in a state of ethnic conflict until 2003, when Australia deployed a peacekeeping mission. In 2019, the central government under Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare withdrew recognition of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and established relations with the mainland People's Republic of China. Malaita Province, however, continued to be supported by Taiwan and the United States, the latter sending US$25 million of aid to the island in 2020. The premier of Malaita Province, Daniel Suidani, also held an independence referendum in 2020 which the national government has dismissed as illegitimate. \c\cThe protests were initially peaceful, but turned violent on 24 November 2021 after buildings adjoining the Solomon Islands Parliament Building were burnt down. Schools and businesses were closed down as police and government forces clashed with protesters. Violence escalated as Honiara's Chinatown was looted. Police fired upon protesters with tear gas. \c\cMost of the protesters came from Malaita province. \c\cAustralia responded to the unrest by deploying Australian Federal Police and Australian Defence Force personnel following a request from the Sogavare government under the Australia-Solomon Islands Bilateral Security Treaty. The Australian Government stated this deployment was to support the Solomon Islands Police Force to maintain order and protect vital infrastructure and would take no position on the internal issues of the Solomon Islands. Papua New Guinea agreed to send 34 peacekeepers to help staunch the violence. \c\cAs Australian police and soldiers deployed to secure the port, airport and other critical infrastructure, mobs once again torched buildings and looted the smouldering rubble of shops in the usually sleepy Solomons Island seaside capital of Honiara. Thousands of people -- some brandishing axes and knives -- rampaged through the city's Chinatown, Point Cruz and business districts, according to AFP correspondents on the scene. Crowds voiced their anger on Friday 26 November by setting fire to at least one building near Sogavare's home, before police fired warning shots to drive the mob back toward the centre of Honiara, AFP reporters witnessed. \c\cIn Chinatown, a large warehouse was set alight, causing an explosion that sent scores of people fleeing from the scene in panic. A tobacco warehouse was also set alight as smoke from previous days fires cast parts of the devastated city of 80,000 people in an acrid haze. The overrun Royal Solomon Islands Police Force said Friday they had made just two arrests, despite two police stations being among the many buildings burned. \c\cPrime Minister Manasseh Sogavare warned the rioters would "face consequences", and resisted calls to resign, saying that if he would be removed, "it will be on the floor of Parliament". He also accused the protesters of being "politically motivated" and, during an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, blamed "foreign powers" for the unrest. \c\cThe premier of Malaita Province, Daniel Suidani, criticized the Government's choices but also condemned the violence on the part of the protesters. The premier of Guadalcanal also strongly denounced the riots. \c\cMatthew Wale, the Opposition Leader, said Sogavare should step down, blaming him for escalating the violence. \c\cThe government of the People's Republic of China expressed "concern about the attacks" and support for the Solomon Islands Government's attempts to "restore order and stability quickly". Deputy Director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Zhao Lijian has recently stated "Facts have proven that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Solomon Islands is in line with the fundamental and long-term development of the Solomon Islands." And also stating that, "Any attempt to undermine the normal development of China-Solomon Islands relations would be futile."  
The 2021–2022 European windstorm season is the seventh instance of seasonal European windstorm naming in Europe. This is the third season in which the Netherlands will participate, alongside the meteorological agencies of Ireland and the United Kingdom (Western Group). The new season's storm names were released on 1 September 2021. Storms that occur up until 31 August 2022 will be included in this season. The Portuguese, Spanish, French  and Belgian meteorological agencies will again collaborate too, joined by the Luxembourguish meteorological agency (South-western Group). This is the first season when Greece, Israel and Cyprus (Eastern Mediterranean group) name storms which affect their areas. This is also the first season for Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Malta (Central Mediterranean Group). \c\cIn 2015, the Met Office and Met Éireann announced a pilot project to name storm warnings as part of the "Name our Storms" project for wind storms and asked the public for suggestions. The meteorological offices produced a full list of names for 2015–2016 through to 2017–2018, common to both the United Kingdom and Ireland, with the Netherlands taking part from 2019 onwards. Names in the United Kingdom will be based on the National Severe Weather Warning Service, when a storm is assessed to have the potential for an Amber (\'be prepared\') or Red (\'take action (danger to life)\') warning. \c\cThere are two main naming lists: one created by the national meteorological agencies of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands, and another created by the equivalent agencies from France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg. Additionally, former Atlantic hurricanes will retain their names as assigned by the National Hurricane Center of the United States. \c\cAlso, some of these storms may be of tropical origins. For example, ex-Hurricane Lorenzo of 2019 made landfall in Ireland and the United Kingdom. All details on tropical storms and hurricanes can be found on the National Hurricane Centre. \c\cFrom the Autumn of 2021 the names issued by other meteorological services will also be included on the charts of the Berlin Wetterkarte and Free University of Berlin using the prefix "int." under the EUMETNET umbrella. \c\cThe following names were chosen for the 2021–2022 season in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands. \c\cThis will be the fifth year in which the meteorological agencies of France, Spain and Portugal will be naming storms that affect their areas. This naming scheme partially overlaps that used by the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands, as storms named by the other group of agencies will be used reciprocally. \c\cThis will be the first year in which the meteorological agencies of Greece, Israel and Cyprus will be naming storms that affect their areas. This naming scheme partially overlaps that used by the France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg, as storms named by the other group of agencies will be used reciprocally. \c\cThis will be the first year in which the meteorological agencies of Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Malta will be naming storms that affect their areas. Storms named by the other group of agencies will be used reciprocally. \c\cAll storms named by meteorological organisation in Europe from there respected forecasting areas. As well as, Atlantic hurricanes and storms that transitioned into a European windstorm and retained its name as assigned by the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida:\c\cA depression formed on October 4 in the western Mediterranean and was named Christian by the Free University of Berlin. It was named Storm Athina by Hellenic National Meteorological Service on October 6 and intensified when it arrived in southern Italy on October 8. The system then passed into the Ionian Sea before dissipating on the 9th. \c\cIn central Italy, Athina caused record rainfall in Liguria with 496 mm in Savona in just 6 hours, breaking the record of 472 mm of November 2011. The main roads of the island of Corfu turned into rivers, the basements were flooded, power outages occurred, small landslides occurred and firefighter interventions were required with the storm front rains preceding the system. \c\cStorm Ballos has been named by Hellenic National Meteorological Service on 13 October, heavy rain and floods in Athens (Αθήνα) on October 15 and some of the islands have been reported. Heavy rain is predicted for 15. October in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace and a red alert with heavy rain and severe thunderstorms in North Aegean islands (meteoalarm). \c\cA storm, named Hendrik by the Free University of Berlin on October 16, developed over the northern Atlantic Ocean. Another developing low South of Ireland was called Aurore by Meteo France on 20 October. Passing over the South of England the following night, Aurore generated very strong south-westerly winds and heavy rains from Brittany to the Grand Est in France, then central Europe as it merged with Hendrik over western Europe. An orange alert for wind has been issued by meteorological services in western Europe, and even red for parts of southern and eastern Germany. The system reached northern Russia on October 22 and disappeared in northern Siberia the next day. \c\cAurore/Hendrik brought widespread gusts of 100 to 120 km/h (62 to 75 mph; 54 to 65 kn) from northern France to eastern Germany and beyond, reaching speeds of 175 km/h (109 mph; 94 kn; 49 m/s) in Fecamp in Normandy. Fallen trees distrupted train service in several countries. Two tornadoes touched down in the Netherlands, in Brittany (France), 3 possible tornadoes have been reported in Plozévet, Riec-sur-Belon and  Kernascléden. and in Germany, another touched down near Kiel\c\cFour people have been killed in Poland. Each one death were reported in Germany. and the United Kingdom. Around 250,000 clients lost electricity in France and 275,000 in the Czech Republic. \c\cCyclone Apollo was a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone that affected many countries on the Mediterranean coast, especially Italy and Libya. The storm killed at least 5 people and left 2 others missing due to flooding from the cyclone, in the countries of Tunisia, Algeria, Malta, and Italy, where the worst of the effects have been felt, especially on the island of Sicily. \c\cAround 22 October 2021, an area of organized thunderstorms formed near the Balearic Islands, with the disturbance becoming more organized and developing an area of low pressure around 24 October. On the next day, the low started to develop a low-level circulation center, and moved into the Tyrrhenian Sea. On 28 October, the system organized even further and intensified, which prompted forecast offices in Europe to name the low. Italy's "Servizio Meteorologico" named the storm Apollo (which was then adopted by the Free University of Berlin). On 29 October 2021, a ship in the Mediterranean Sea passed through Apollo and measured a peak wind speed of 104 km/h (65 mph; 56 kn)  and a pressure of 999.4 mb (29.51 inHg), indicating that Apollo is still strengthening. After Apollo made its closest approach to Sicily during the overnight hours of October 29, Apollo appeared to have begun to weaken as its convection waned and its low-level circulation became exposed on visible satellite imagery on 30 October 2021, on 31 October 2021, Apollo made landfall near Bayda and stayed inland until emerging over the Mediterranean a few hours later. \c\cThen, on 2 November, it dissipated off the coast of Turkey. \c\cHeavy rain from the cyclone and its precursor caused heavy rainfall and flooding in Tunisia, Algeria, Southern Italy, and Malta, killing 5 people and leaving 2 other people missing. The flooding was especially severe in the provinces of Catania and Siracusa, in Eastern Sicily. \c\cOn November 5, the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) started tracking a low near the Balearic Islands and named it Blas. An orange alert has been issued for these islands, for coastal phenomena and rain. The north of Catalonia was declared an Orange Zone, as strong winds blew inland from the Spanish Navarre and Aragon. Météo-France has also issued a yellow alert for Aude and Pyrénées-Orientales for wind, as well as Corsica for rain. \c\cAs the system stalled between Sardinia and the Balearic Islands on November 8, AEMET predicted a strengthening for the next two days and maintained its alerts. At 00:00 UTC on 11 November, the system was again very close to the Balearic Islands. After striking the islands again, the storm then slowly weakened while drifting back Southeastward. On 14 November, the cyclone turned northward, moving over Sardinia and Corsica, before curving back southwestward on 15 November and moving over Sardinia again, while restrengthening in the process. On 16 November, Blas turned eastward once again, passing just south of Sardinia and moving towards Italy, before dissipating over the Tyrrhenian Sea on 18 November. \c\cOn November 6, gusts of 75 km/h (47 mph; 40 kn) were recorded at Es Mercadal and 95 km/h (59 mph; 51 kn) at the lighthouse of Capdepera in the Balearic Islands where waves of 8 m (26 ft) hit the coast. Menorca was cut off from the world after the closure of the ports of Mahón and Ciutadella. On November 9 and 10, Blas again brought high winds and heavy rain to the Balearic Islands, causing at least 36 incidents, mostly flooding, landslides and blackouts. A crew member had to be rescued after his sailboat's mast broke, leaving the boat adrift 80 km (50 mi) West of Soller. \c\cOn November 6, a waterspout was reported in Melilla, a Spanish enclave on the coast of Morocco. In France, gusts of 140 km/h (87 mph; 76 kn) were noted on November7 at Cap Béar, as well as 111 km/h (69 mph; 60 kn) in Leucate and 100 km/h (62 mph; 54 kn) in Lézignan-Corbières. \c\cThe storm caused severe weather on the Algerian coast with exceptional rainfall. On November 9, a building collapsed in Algiers following torrential rains on the city, causing the deaths of three people. On November 11, the heavy rain continuing on Algiers caused another landslide on houses in the Raïs Hamidou neighborhood, causing the deaths of three other persons. \c\cFrom November 8 to 11, convective bands associated with the storm caused 3 deaths in Sicily. \c\cStorm Arwen was named by the Met Office on 25 November 2021. \c\cRed warnings for wind have been issued for north-eastern parts of the UK, as well as extensive orange and yellow warnings for much of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and most of England. Dangerous waves have also been forecasted, with likely disruption to ferry services. At 5pm GMT on 26 November, Network Rail closed the rail lines north of Berwick-upon-Tweed and LNER stopped running trains north of Newcastle. \c\cOn 23–24 September, a storm named "Tim" by the Free University of Berlin (FUB), caused the death of two people in Germany and Poland. \c\cIn early November 2021, the remnants of Atlantic Tropical Storm Wanda were absorbed into the cold front of a mid-latitude storm, called "Stephane" by the FUB, moving towards the United Kingdom and Ireland. On 9 November, Stephane affected the Northern European Countries and caused heavy snowfall and rainfall. \c\cOn 19 November, a storm called "Volker" by FUB moved across Poland killing one and injuring two. One person remains missing.
The Islamic State insurgency in Iraq is an ongoing low-intensity insurgency that began in December 2017 after the Islamic State (ISIS) lost territorial control in the War in Iraq of 2013 to 2017. ISIS and allied White Flags fought the Iraqi military (largely backed by the United States and other countries conducting airstrikes against ISIS) and allied paramilitary forces (largely backed by Iran). \c\cThe insurgency is a direct continuation of the War in Iraq from 2013 to 2017, with ISIL continuing armed opposition against the Shia-led Iraqi Government. Along with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), other insurgents fighting the government include a group known as the White Flags which is reportedly composed of former ISIL members and Kurdish rebels and is believed by the government of Iraq to be part of Ansar al-Islam and possibly affiliated with al-Qaeda. The group operates mostly in the Kirkuk Governorate and has used an assortment of guerilla tactics against government forces. In September 2017, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIL, called on ISIL supporters around the world to launch attacks on Western news media and continued in his message the ISIL must focus on combating the two-pronged attack on the Muslim Ummah; these statements marked a departure from previous rhetoric which was focused on the state building of ISIL and heralded a shift in ISIL's strategy toward a classical insurgency. \c\cSince ISIL's loss of all territory in Iraq in late 2017 which was declared as Iraq's victory over ISIL and widely seen as an end to the war, and declared as such by Iraq's Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, multiple incidents of violence have occurred being carried out by the conflicting sides, in spite of Iraq's declaration of victory over ISIL the group is widely seen as far from gone and continues to retain a presence throughout Iraq, and still capable of carrying out attacks and skirmishes with pro-government forces. ISIL has been waging a guerrilla war with a strong presence in the governorates of Kirkuk, Diyala, Saladin, and Sulaymaniyah, with local forces largely ill-equipped and inexperienced, ISIL has also taken advantage of the areas\' rough terrain to carry out operations. ISIL has also made a notable presence in the cities of Kirkuk, Hawija and Tuz Khurmato and has carried out attacks at night in rural areas. \c\cISIL fighters also reportedly move through villages during the day without interference from security forces, and locals have been asked by ISIL to give fighters food and give information on the whereabouts of Iraqi personnel, locals have also stated that ISIL fighters will frequently enter into Mosques and ask for Zakat to fund the insurgency. Among ISIL's operations include assassinations, kidnappings, raids and ambushes. \c\cAs of 2021, U.S. officials warned that ISIL "remains capable of waging a prolonged insurgency” but also described ISIL in Iraq as "diminished”. Iraqi intelligence estimated that ISIL has 2,000–3,000 fighters in Iraq. \c\cFollowing ISIL's defeat in December 2017, they have been greatly weakened and violence in Iraq has been sharply reduced. 12 civilians lost their lives from violence-related incidents during October 2021, the lowest figure in 18 years. \c\cBetween January and February 2018, Iraqi security forces and Peshmerga clashed with the White Flags around parts of the Kirkuk and Saladin governorates for control of oil fields which the Iraqi government claims the group's priority is. The Iraqi government said in the clashes the composition of the White Flag's fighters are ISIL members and individuals linked to the Kurdish mafia, the government also alleges that the Kurdistan Region allowed oil theft to occur in the area while it was under their control and enabled ISIL for their own interests. \c\cIn March 2018, in two separate attacks ISIL reportedly killed 10 individuals including a pro-government Sunni tribal Sheikh along with his son and guests at his house in the town of Al-Shirqat south of Mosul, in the other attack ISIL killed 5 individuals from the same family whom were Iraqi Turkmen and Shia at a fake checkpoint set up by the group posing as Iraqi security forces. \c\c22 March 2018 - Six individuals and 15 others were at a checkpoint set up by ISIL the group killed six individuals and injured 15 others from the Iraqi Turkmen minority on their way to Erbil from Baghdad between Tuz Khurmato and Daquq to celebrate Nowruz. The attack was condemned by Turkey and Zowaa claimed one of their MPs was present during the attack but managed to escape unharmed. \c\c2 April 2018 - PMF Major General named Ali Khalifa was killed in an operation around Tuz Khurmato and Kirkuk against ISIL and the White Flags. \c\c8 June 2018 - The Government of Canada announced that it will suspend Canadian support for Peshmerga and work exclusively with the Iraqi government, in a statement a Canadian military official said "We have changed ... partners," a Canadian General told reporters about the shift in support "Training with the Peshmerga was ceased when it was no longer of any value in terms of the battle against Da’esh [IS]."\c\c11 July 2018 - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada would lead a NATO mission to Iraq with European allies to send 250 Canadian soldiers to Baghdad, 50 will be doing the actual training while the other 125 will be doing force protection and another 20 will help run Canadian headquarters in Baghdad. \c\c4 August 2018 - Chairman of the Iraqi Baath Party, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri in a statement broadcast on Facebook in commemoration of the anniversary of the Baath Party called on Iraqis to continue fighting the Iraqi government and allied Iranian backed groups, calling them Safavids. He also called on Saudi Arabia to intervene against Iran's influence in Iraq and praised the country.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cAustralian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March 2020, and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March. Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020, and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks. Social distancing rules were imposed on 21 March, and state governments started to close "non-essential" services. "Non-essential services" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories. The number of new cases initially grew sharply, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22 March, and started falling at the beginning of April to under 20 cases per day by the end of the month. \c\cA second wave of infections emerged in Victoria during May and June 2020, which was attributed to an outbreak at a Melbourne quarantine hotel. The second wave, though largely localised to Melbourne, was much more widespread and deadlier than the first; at its peak, the state had over 7,000 active cases. Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown which eventually lasted almost four months. The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020. Further cluster outbreaks occurred in late 2020 and mid-2021, with several brief "snap lockdowns" announced in certain states to contain their spread, particularly as novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 arrived in Australia. In response to an outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant during June 2021 in New South Wales almost half of Australia's population and most major cities were in lockdown from early July 2021 with the outbreak continuing to worsen to new record daily cases into August. In late August to mid-September 2021 Victoria had its first 9 deaths since late October 2020. \c\cAs of 9 October 2021[update], Australia has reported 127,454 cases, 34,990 recoveries, and 1,432 deaths, with Victoria's second wave accounting for about 80 per cent of fatalities. No deaths from COVID-19 were recorded in Australia from 28 December 2020 until 13 April 2021, when one death occurred in Queensland. There were then none until 10 July in New South Wales (NSW), deaths there continuing into mid-October 2021. As of 9 October 2021[update] at least 431 NSW residents had died since the June outbreak of the Delta variant in Sydney. \c\cThe stated goal of the National Cabinet is "suppression", as opposed to "elimination", meaning continually trying to drive community transmission to zero but expecting that new outbreaks may occur. This is in contrast to the mitigation strategies implemented by most other nations. Compared to other Western countries, notably the United States and European countries, Australia's handling has been commended for its effectiveness, but has been criticized by some for its curbing of civil liberties. Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce; comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the US and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks. Australia's international borders have also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of arrivals strictly controlled, for the duration of the pandemic. Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective, QR code-based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia's businesses. These apps, which are effectively required by State Governments, give government health departments the ability to reconstruct the presence and possible contacts of anyone carrying a mobile telephone handset that was capable of checking-in using a QR code at the time of visiting shops, bars, restaurants or similar venues, generally for 28 days after the visit. Furthermore, venues are required to provide alternative contact registration for anyone unable to use the app. \c\cThe nationwide vaccination program began with the first doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine being administered in Sydney on Sunday 21 February 2021. The country's vaccine rollout, which fell short of its initial targets and was described as slow, has been criticised. \c\cThe pandemic has impacted Australia's economy, causing its first recession in 30 years with the arts sector being particularly hard hit. \c\cA novel coronavirus that caused a respiratory illness was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019, which confirmed its concern on 12 January 2020. WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. \c\cThe case fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower than that of SARS, a related disease which emerged in 2002, but its transmission has been significantly greater, leading to a much greater total death toll. \c\cThe widespread reporting of the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season in major media and social media around the world caused a significant drop in the number of tourists coming to Australia, including those from China. The absence of tourist arrivals during this time could have played a significant role in sparing Australia from the spread of COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. This is in contrast to other major cities in Europe and North America, where the early spread of the virus continued undetected until late February 2020 or early March 2020. \c\cOn 23 January 2020, biosecurity officials began screening arrivals on flights from Wuhan to Sydney. Two days later the first case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported, that of a Chinese citizen who arrived from Guangzhou on 19 January. The patient was tested and received treatment in Melbourne. On the same day, three other patients tested positive in Sydney after returning from Wuhan. \c\cAustralia reported its 100th case on 10 March 2020 roughly corresponding to the start of Australia's first wave. Case numbers and deaths continued to climb during March and April, but by late April the first wave had effectively ended. On 6 June, both New South Wales and Victoria reported no new cases for the previous 24 hours, with only Queensland and Western Australia reporting one new (international) case each, the lowest national total since February. \c\cOn 20 June, the Victorian Government announced the re-tightening of restrictions on household gatherings following a spike in community transmitted cases over the previous week, reported to be mainly caused by family-to-family transmission in large household gatherings, most easing of restrictions that were to take place were postponed. The same day restrictions were re-tightened in Victoria, the Western Australian Government announced the state would move into "Phase 4" from 27 June, permitting some of the most relaxed restrictions in the country. \c\cOn 26 October, the "second wave" ended when Victoria recorded zero new cases and zero deaths statewide for the first time since 9 June. On the same day, Daniel Andrews announced a significant easing of restrictions to take effect over the coming weeks. From 11.59 pm on 27 October, people no longer required a reason to leave home, all retail, restaurants, hotels, cafes and bars were allowed to open with capacity limits, beauty, personal services and tattooing will reopen, outdoor community sport for under 18 and outdoor non-contact sport for adults recommenced, a maximum of 10 people were allowed to attend weddings, a maximum of 20 mourners allowed to attend funerals and faith and religious gatherings allowed to resume, subject to patron limitations. With a length of 112 days, this Victorian COVID-19 lockdown was the longest continuous lockdown world-wide, as of October 2020. \c\cOn 18 June in NSW, a delta variant COVID-19 cluster in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs had grown to 4 cases. On 25 June in NSW, after 22 new cases of the delta variant brought infections linked to the Bondi cluster to 65 total, an initial lockdown was announced for four Sydney local government areas (LGAs). \c\cNew South Wales recorded its "worst day" of its continuing June 2021 outbreak of the COVID-19 Delta variant on 29 August 2021, with six deaths, and a record 1,218 new local confirmed cases. Whilst the daily number of cases continues to increase, at the time this was the highest daily confirmed case total Australia had received on a single day, surpassing Victoria's record in the previous wave. However, the recorded COVID-19 deaths is significantly lower than the 41 daily deaths recorded in Victoria during its peak. \c\cOn 30 August in NSW, the Ministry of Health reported four deaths in the previous 24 hours of people confirmed to have had COVID-19. One of them, a man in his 50s who died at Dubbo Hospital, is believed to be the first Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander COVID-19 related death. He was not vaccinated. The total number of COVID related deaths in NSW reached 149 since the beginning of the pandemic, and 93 during the NSW Delta outbreak. The official national death toll broke 1,000 at 1,002. \c\cOn 31 August in Victoria, the deaths of two women were reported, the first COVID deaths in that state since 30 November 2020 which ended a nine month streak with no fatalities. \c\cOn 8 November, the premier of Queensland announced that as of December 17, all eligible unvaccinated citizens over the age of 16 will be banned from pubs, clubs, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, music festivals and stadiums, government-owned galleries, museums and libraries, and they will not be allowed to visit hospitals, aged care facilities, prisons or disability services, among other restrictions.   The premier described this as “a reward for the fully vaccinated and a precaution for when the borders open”, and stated that restrictions are expected to continue into 2022. \c\cOn 28 November 2021, NSW Health has confirmed two returned travellers have tested positive for the new Omicron COVID-19 variant in Sydney, making them the first known cases of the strain in Australia. \c\cThe following chart represents the daily new confirmed number of cases in the whole of Australia. It is based on reports by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \c\cThe largest cluster in Australia from the start of the pandemic until 5 November 2021, when Australia reached its 80 percent vaccination target and entered the consolidation phase of its COVID-19 transition plan, was the Flemington/North Melbourne public housing cluster with 310 cases. The deadliest cluster in Australia was at St Basil's Homes for the Aged in Victoria, where 45 residents died. \c\cOn 1 February 2020, Australia banned the entry of foreign nationals who had been in mainland China, and ordered its own returning citizens who had been in China to self-quarantine for 14 days. The country also began to assess the relative risk of reflected transmission through third countries, and to ask travelers arriving from higher-risk countries to monitor for symptoms. Australia subsequently imposed bans on Iran (1 March), South Korea (5 March), and Italy (11 March). From 16 March, all travellers arriving in or returning to Australia were required to self-isolate for 14 days. Failure to self-isolate could result in a fine of A$11,000 to A$50,000 and a possible prison sentence, depending on the state. Cruise ships were also barred from docking in the country for 30 days. \c\cOn 20 March, Australia closed its borders to all non-residents and non-Australian citizens. With limited exceptions, a ban was imposed on Australians travelling overseas. \c\cBy late March 2020, 62% of Australia's more than 3,000 coronavirus cases were among people who had returned from overseas. From then, Australians returning from overseas were subject to two weeks compulsory quarantine in hotels. The New South Wales quarantine program was helped by 150 Australian Defence Force personnel, including 30 who were stationed at hotels. In Victoria, three private security operators were contracted to provide the security, while the other states and territories used their police resources. The states and territories carried the costs of hotel quarantine. By 19 June, since the policy came into force 81,000 people had entered Australia. Of those, 63,000 had undergone hotel quarantine, while the rest, including flight crews, international businesspeople and defence members, fell under different rules. Hotel quarantine had cost $118 million as at 19 June. \c\cInterstate border closures began on 19 March, with Tasmania imposing a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all "non-essential" travellers to the state, including returning residents. On 24 March, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory closed their borders, with all interstate arrivals being required to self-isolate for 14 days. On 11 April, Queensland banned interstate arrivals, with only Queensland residents and those granted \'exemption\' being allowed entry. On 8 July, the Victorian and NSW governments, jointly closed their common border, following a large spike in cases in parts of Melbourne. \c\cWith the spike in coronavirus infections in Victoria linked to the hotel quarantine program, a judicial inquiry into the program in Victoria was called on 2 July; and all international arrivals into Melbourne were suspended. On 9 July, other state and territory leaders agreed to reduce flights and arrivals into Australia from 8,000 to 4,000 a week to ease the burden on the hotel quarantine system. States started to charge travellers for hotel quarantine. In mid-September, the states agreed to increased the number of arrivals to 6,000 a week, to help in the repatriation of tens of thousands of Australians stranded overseas. By 15 December 2020, 39,000 Australians were registered with the government as stranded, with more unregistered (as the government advised registration only for those needing assistance to return). After repeated flight cancellations and without access to government-provided health care or welfare benefits, many families reported being forced to overstay visas, and burn down savings and incur debt to pay for accommodations. Having to pay thousands of dollars for return tickets and mandatory hotel quarantine, some chose to send one family member back in order to resume work and earn enough money to pay the way of the rest. Between 13 March and 15 July 2020, more than 357,000 people returned to Australia. As of 15 January 2021[update] over 37,000 Australians were stranded abroad. On 29 January 2021, the ability of Australians stuck overseas to return was further hampered when the UK banned direct flights from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the possible spread of the South African COVID-19 variant. Both Etihad and Emirates airlines are UAE based. \c\cAn overnight curfew was introduced in Victoria on 2 August 2020, extended on 13 September and suspended on 27 September. A Supreme Court judge has ruled the curfew was legal. \c\cOn 25 January 2021, Health Minister Greg Hunt suspended Australia's travel bubble with New Zealand for a period of 72 hours after New Zealand authorities confirmed a community transmission case in the country's Northland Region. On 28 January the suspension of the travel bubble was extended for 3 more days. \c\cOn 5 February 2021, National Cabinet decided to increase the number of international passenger arrivals to Australia as from mid-February. New South Wales will return to a weekly cap of 3,010 people and Queensland to 1,000. South Australia has increased by 40 people a week to 530, and Victoria by almost 200 to 1,310. Western Australia will remain at a reduced arrival cap. The total national weekly cap of 4,100 will increase to approximately 6,300. \c\cOn 11 February 2021, the airline Cathay Pacific decided that, excepting Sydney, from 20 February it would cease all flights to Australia until the end of the month. This was in response to the Hong Kong government's new COVID rules requiring Hong Kong based aircrew to quarantine for 14 days on return to HK. \c\cOn 24 February, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria suspended their travel bubble arrangements with New Zealand in response to a recent community outbreak in South Auckland. As a result, New Zealanders traveling to these states would have to enter quarantine. \c\cOn 2 March 2021, the general closure of Australia's international borders to travel was extended another three months to 17 June 2021. Australia's borders have now already been closed for 12 months. The border could reopen earlier if the closure was "no longer needed." Despite the border closure, between 25 March and 31 December 2020 over 105,000 exemptions were approved for people to leave Australia. \c\cBy April 2021, there were still about 40,000 Australians stranded overseas by the high cost of plane tickets and the cap on the number of people in the quarantine system, which was criticised for special treatment of sportspeople and celebrities. Australia was chastised by the UN Human Rights Committee, which requested a prompt return for the country's citizens; the government has given out A$29 million to about 3,900 stranded people as a last resort, and operated 28 repatriation flights. \c\cOn 23 April, Prime Minister Morrison announced that travellers to Australia from "high risk" countries, in particular India, were to be reduced by 30 per cent. This decision was based on an increase in positive results for COVID-19 among travellers from India at the Howard Springs, Northern Territory quarantine facility. Travel to such countries was also to be limited. \c\cIn general, the border restrictions had had broad public support, though critics suggested safety could be improved by constructing more outdoor quarantine centres rather than relying on urban hotels, which had suffered 16 leaks to the surrounding communities as of April 2021, out of about half a million quarantined. The government does not have a ordered queue of returnees; outside of repatriation flights, the order in which people return is determined by commercial airlines, resulting in Australian citizens making up fewer than half of incoming travellers in February 2021. \c\cOn 27 April, due to the "record-breaking" outbreak of COVID-19 in India, with 323,000 new infections that day after five days with new cases peaking above 350,000, and another 2,771 COVID deaths there, the Federal Government "paused" all incoming flights from India until at least 15 May. The pause includes repatriation flights into the Howard Springs quarantine facility near Darwin with more than 9,000 Australians in India at this date wanting to come to Australia. \c\cLate on 30 April, the Federal Government announced a ban on Australian citizens and permanent residents in India from entering Australia via any route. These measures came into effect on 3 May and would remain in force until 15 May. Breaches would be subject to punishment under the Biosecurity Act 2015, with penalties for breaches including up to five years\' jail, a fine of A$66,600,or both. Foreign Minister Marise Payne reported that 57% of positive cases in quarantine had come from India in April, compared with 10% in March. Unlike the prior travel bans imposed in 2020 on Iran, South Korea and Italy, and the interstate travel bans regularly imposed as outbreaks occur, the move was branded as racist by some critics, and a potential breach of international human rights law. On 3 May 2021 the government announced that it would review this decision earlier than originally intended, possibly within the same week. There were about 9,000 Australian citizens in India, of whom 650 were considered vulnerable. \c\cOn 26 June 2021 at 8:30 pm (AEST), due to multiple outbreaks across Australia of the Delta variant, New Zealand immediately paused trans-Tasman travel with Australia until 10 pm (AEST) on 30 June. \c\cOn 2 July, National Cabinet decided that from 14 July, the number of airline passengers allowed into Australia would be capped at 3,035, half what it was before. The Victorian, Western Australian and Queensland governments, had been advocating a large decrease in incoming passenger numbers because of the highly infectious nature of the Delta COVID strain. More repatriation flights to the Howard Springs quarantine facility were to be organised in response. \c\cThe states will receive passengers thus:\c\cSydney: 1,505\c\cPerth: 265\c\cAdelaide: 265\c\cMelbourne: 500\c\cBrisbane: 500 (additional 150 surge capacity)\c\cOn 13 March 2020, the National Cabinet, a form of national crisis cabinet akin to a war cabinet, was created following a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). This is the first time such a cabinet has been proclaimed since World War II, and the only time in Australian history that a crisis cabinet has included state and territory leaders. The cabinet consists of the premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories and meets weekly during the crisis. At its first meeting on 13 March, the National Cabinet announced that gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled from 15 March. Schools, universities, workplaces, public transport and airports were not included in this recommendation. Prime Minister Morrison also announced that he intended to attend a Rugby League match on 14 March; "I do still plan to go to the football on Saturday" but later decided against attending the match. \c\cOn 29 March, the Cabinet agreed to stricter limits to apply from midnight on 30 March: a limit on both indoor and outdoor gatherings of two people except weddings (5) and funerals (10), and people of the same household or family; strong guidance to all Australians is to stay home unless for necessary shopping, health care, exercise, and work and study that can\'t be done remotely; public playgrounds, skate parks and outside gyms to be closed. It was left to individual states to enforce these guidelines. They also agreed to a moratorium on evictions for six months for both commercial and residential tenancies suffering financial distress. \c\cOn 2 April 2020, the Federal government announced the temporary provision of free childcare so that people could continue working, and to prevent closure of childcare centres. The Government paid half each centre's operating costs. The free childcare ended on 12 July, and the previous Child Care Subsidy was reintroduced. \c\cOn 18 March 2020, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, after a National Security Committee meeting the previous day. The Biosecurity Act 2015 specifies that the Governor-General may declare such an emergency exists if the Health Minister (currently Greg Hunt) is satisfied that "a listed human disease is posing a severe and immediate threat, or is causing harm, to human health on a nationally significant scale". This gives the minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and evacuations. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 was declared by the Governor-General, David Hurley, under Section 475 of the Act. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, made by the Health Minister on the same day, forbids international cruise ships from entering Australian ports. This ban remains in place until 17 December 2021 at the earliest. [needs update]\c\cA social distancing rule of four square metres (43 sq ft) per person in any enclosed space was agreed by National Cabinet on 20 March, to be implemented through State and Territory laws. On 22 March 2020, the State governments of New South Wales and Victoria imposed a mandatory closure of non-essential services, while the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia imposed border closures. \c\cOn 22 March, Morrison announced a closure of places of social gathering, including registered and licensed clubs, licensed premises in hotels and bars, entertainment venues, including but not restricted to cinemas, casinos and nightclubs and places of worship. Cafes and restaurants could remain open, but were limited to only takeaway food. Similarly, enclosed spaces for funerals and things of that nature will have to follow the strict four-square-metre rule. These measures (labelled stage 1 in anticipation of possible future measures) were effective immediately at midday, 23 March. Morrison stated that he would like schools to remain open, but parents could keep children at home if they wished to. \c\cOn 25 March 2020, the Health Minister made a second determination under the Biosecurity Act 2015, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Overseas Travel Ban Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, which "forbids Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australian territory by air or sea as a passenger". On the same day, the Prime Minister announced a further set of restrictions, labelled stage 2 restrictions, effective midnight that night. These involved mainly smaller businesses, such as nail salons and tattoo parlours, while some, such as personal training sessions, were limited to 10 people. At the same time, other gatherings were restricted, such as weddings (5 people) and funerals (10 people). \c\cAt 12:00 am on Tuesday 31 March, restrictions were announced on indoor and outdoor gatherings, which were called stage 3 by the media, although the label "stage 3" was not part of the official announcement. The new rule limited gatherings to two people, although it did not apply to members of the same household. \c\cOn 14 April, the Federal government announced the "COVIDSafe" digital contact tracing app. \c\cOn 25 April 2020, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements—Public Health Contact Information) Determination 2020, made under subsection 477(1) of the Act, was signed into law by the Health Minister. The purpose of the new legislation is "to make contact tracing faster and more effective by encouraging public acceptance and uptake of COVIDSafe", COVIDSafe being the new mobile app created for the purpose. The function of the app is to record contact between any two people who both have the app on their phones when they come within 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) of each other. The encrypted data would remain on the phone for 21 days of not encountering a person logged with confirmed COVID-19. \c\cOn 3 September 2020, the human biosecurity emergency period under the Biosecurity Act 2015 was extended until 17 December. \c\cOn 25 March, the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC) was established by the Prime Minister as a strategic advisory body for the national response to the pandemic. (On 27 July 2020, the Prime Minister renamed the organisation to the "National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board" (NCC).) The NCC's role includes providing advice on public-private partnerships and coordination to mitigate the social and economic impacts of the pandemic. \c\cOn 29 March, Prime Minister Morrison announced in a press conference following a National Cabinet meeting that public gatherings will be limited to two people, while also urging Australians over the age of 70, Australians with chronic illness over the age of 60 and Indigenous Australians over the age of 50 to stay home and self-isolate. Morrison also clarified that there were only four acceptable reasons for Australians to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes. \c\cThe Australian government entered into agreements with Pfizer/BioNTech, University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax, the University of Queensland and COVAX for the supply of vaccines. The University of Queensland vaccine was abandoned in December 2020 after trials revealed that, while it was safe, it triggered false positives on HIV tests. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer vaccine in January 2021. The Australian government ordered 10 million doses, with the first 80,000 to be delivered in February 2021, but production problems and the imposition of export controls by the European Union (EU) onto deliveries to countries outside Europe made meeting the delivery schedule problematic. \c\cDelivery issues also affected deliveries of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which was provisionally approved by the TGA in February, and received final approval in March. Orders were reduced from 3.8 million to 1.2 million doses of this vaccine, which was manufactured in Belgium, and arrival was pushed back to March 2021. CSL Limited began manufacturing 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Melbourne in November 2020. Deliveries were expected to commence in March. The AstraZeneca vaccine could be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures of 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F), whereas the Pfizer vaccine required storage at −70 °C (−94 °F). However, concerns were raised about the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The Australian and New Zealand Society for Immunology called for a pause in its rollout, as the efficacy of the vaccine reported by trials was insufficient to achieve the desired herd immunity effect. CSL management declined an invitation to appear before an Australian Senate inquiry. \c\cAlthough the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, said that Australia would be "at the front of the queue", and the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, claimed that Australia would be among the first countries to receive COVID-19 vaccines, 61 other countries had already commenced vaccinating their citizens by the end of January 2021, while the Australian vaccination rollout was not scheduled to commence for another month. \c\cOn 15 February 2021, 142,000 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Australia. The first doses were due to be administered on 22 February. The world-wide distribution of the vaccine has been described as "... the largest logistics effort in the world since World War" by Dr Roberto Perez-Franco of the Deakin University's Centre for Supply Chain and Logistics. This was followed, on 28 February, by 300,000 doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, which arrived at Sydney airport. It was planned that most Australians would be vaccinated with this vaccine, the majority manufactured in Australia by CSL Limited. On 5 March, Italy and the European Union blocked a shipment of 250,000 doses of the Oxford−AstraZeneca vaccine from Italy to Australia, citing low COVID-19 case numbers in Australia and the limited availability of vaccines in the EU. \c\cLocal manufacturing began in November 2020. On 16 February, the first vials of COVID-19 vaccine produced in Australia came off the production line at the CSL Behring plant in Broadmeadows, Melbourne. This is the active raw vaccine material. The vaccine vials are filled and packaged into doses by Seqirus, a CSL subsidiary in Parkville, Melbourne. Production of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Australia received its final approval from the TGA on 21 March. Some front line health care workers were reported to have preferred the Pfizer vaccine over the AstraZeneca one. \c\cThe Australian government had also signed a deal with Novavax for 51 million doses of its vaccine, with supply originally slated for "mid-2021". As of April 2021, it had yet to be approved by the TGA. It is not manufactured in Australia, so like the other imported vaccines, its availability was uncertain. In trials it was reported to be 95.6 per cent effective against COVID-19, and an 86.3 per cent effective against the variant identified in the UK. Australia's first human trials of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine was Novavax's NVX-CoV2373 which began in Melbourne by 26 May 2020. \c\cIn a February 2021 pre-budget submission, the Australian Academy of Science renewed its call for the government to develop the capability to produce mRNA vaccine technology in Australia. The ability to mass-produce such vaccines onshore would insulate Australia against supply shocks, and cater for future pandemics and potential biosecurity situations. The mRNA coronavirus vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer showed strong results in clinical trials and are expected to be easier to reconfigure to cater for new virus variants than more conventional vaccines. \c\cThe US Moderna company entered an agreement with the Australian Federal government, announced on 13 May 2021, to provide 25 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine \'mRNA-1273\', subject to TGA approval. \c\cThe first public COVID-19 vaccination in Australia, with the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, took place on 21 February 2021 in Sydney. An 84-year-old aged care resident was the first Australian to receive the vaccine following TGA approval. Prime Minister Morrison and Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly also received vaccinations. \c\cThe first Australian to receive the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was a doctor in regional South Australia on 5 March 2021 at Murray Bridge Hospital. \c\cMore than 2 million COVID-19 vaccinations had been administered in Australia by 28 April 2021, but this was 3 million short of original plans. By 6 June, over 5 million vaccinations had been administered. Approximately 4.45 million were first doses, nearly 570,000 were second doses. \c\cOn 5 October 2021, Australia reached 80% of the eligible population (aged 16 and older) having had at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. \c\cAs of 18 July 2021, there have been a total of over 10.125 million vaccine doses administered of which 41,406 adverse events following vaccination have been reported. However, not all reported adverse events are attributable and associated with vaccination. The most common adverse effects following immunisation as reported to the TGA are predictable and have been observed with many other vaccines. They include headache, muscle pain, fever, chills and injection site reactions. The TGA reviews reports of deaths in people who have recently been vaccinated and as of 22 July 2021[update] found six that were linked to immunisation. These deaths were all related to a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine – five had thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) and one had immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) out of 6.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. \c\cThere are calls for a more effective advertising campaign that goes beyond presenting facts that inform, to use of emotion to change people's behaviour to overcome apparent lack of "trust in the government". On 23 May 2021 Health Minister Greg Hunt reiterated that a sufficient supply of Pfizer is expected to begin arriving in October, with AMA president Omar Khorshid adding this promised supply means "everyone who wanted it could have both doses by Christmas" of 2021. Nevertheless, government, AMA and ATAGI advice remains for everyone to vaccinate as soon as possible and not to wait, because the (potentially future) risk of community transmission in Australia remains a possibility, and which until 17 June 2021 over 9 million Australian residents over 50 had to weigh against the \'tiny\' risk of death associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine that (according to best data available at the time) was probable to manifest for approximately 9–14 Australians, or approximately 19 Australians according to EMA data. \c\cHealth Minister Greg Hunt said on 17 June 2021 that the recommended advice from ATAGI was that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine only be administered to people aged 60 years and over. The advise also stated that second doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca are still recommended for those under 60 years of age. Everyone under 60 will be offered the Pfizer vaccine. Hunt stated that about 815,000 Australians between ages 50 and 59 had already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with Pfizer now available to the approximately 2.1 million remaining Australians in that age group. \c\cIn a survey conducted in June 2021, about 15 percent of respondents not yet vaccinated identified wanting a different vaccine "to what was available to them" as a factor holding them back from getting vaccinated. Since only 18–39 and 60+ year-olds are eligible for one vaccine (i.e., AstraZeneca) but not the other (i.e., Pfizer-BioNTech), making Pfizer-BioNTech available to everyone would obviate one factor holding back vaccination uptake. \c\cBefore the crisis, 600,000 Australians were employed in the arts, an industry which added around A$3.2 billion to export revenues. The rate of employment in the sector grew at a faster rate than the rest of the economy. According to government figures, "cultural and creative activity contributed to A$112 billion (6.4% of GDP) to Australia's economy in 2016–17". \c\cBeginning in the second week of March 2020, Australian institutions began announcing reduced services, and then complete closures. One of the first casualties was the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, with organisers announcing on 13 March 2020 that the 2020 festival had been cancelled entirely. Opera Australia announced it would close on 15 March. The national closure of all cultural institutions was mandated on 24 March, with subsequent restrictions on public gatherings. Consequently, many cultural events were also cancelled, including the Sydney Writers\' Festival. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, by the beginning of April, "Arts and Recreation services" was the sector of the national economy with the smallest proportion of its business still in operation—at 47%. A graph in Guardian Australia showing businesses by sector that had ceased trading between June 2019 and 30 March 2020 shows over 50% of arts and recreation services, the hardest hit of any sector (information media and telecommunications is next, at about 34%). Adrian Collette, CEO of the Australia Council for the Arts, the government's arts funding and advisory body, described the impact on the cultural and creative sectors as "catastrophic". \c\cThe Australian film industry has been severely impacted, with at least 60 shoots being halted and about 20,000 people out of work. On Monday 23 March, all productions funded by Screen Australia were postponed. As of 15 April 2020[update], after some improvement in COVID-19 statistics in Australia, Screen Australia continues to fund work and process applications, intending to use all of its 2019/20 budget. Film industry organisations such as Screen Producers Australia (SPA) and the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA) have been lobbying the government for a support package specific to the screen industry, and to expand the JobKeeper requirements so that those in the screen industry are better covered. Many in the film industry are employed by Special Purpose Vehicles—temporary companies that cease trading once production has finished—which cannot easily prove that their turnover has fallen by 30% or more. SPA said that the industry shutdown had cost more than A$500 million, with about A$20 million of lost export revenue. \c\cOne hundred and nineteen films and TV shows have been halted, with only a few shows (such as MasterChef Australia and Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell) continuing production through the pandemic. The TV soap Neighbours was the first English-language TV drama series in the world to announce that resumption of production would begin soon after 20 April 2020. \c\cLike other governments around the world, the Australian government has acknowledged the economic, cultural and social value of the arts industry. The Australia Council has redirected about A$5 million to "new programs designed to provide immediate relief to Australian artists, arts workers and arts organisations to support their livelihoods, practice and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic" (the "Resilience Fund"), and is also hosting weekly meetings to address the concerns of specific sections of the industry, such as Indigenous creatives and organisations, live performance and public gatherings, and various peak bodies. Several state governments have also provided relief packages. \c\cIn early April, the federal government announced a package of A$27 million in specific arts funding: A$7 million for the Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program, A$10 million for Regional Arts Australia's regional arts fund, and A$10 million for Support Act, a charity founded in 1997 that provides financial support and counselling to people in the music industry in Australia. However, the "JobKeeper" scheme specifically excluded "freelancers and casuals on short-term contracts, or who have worked for a series of employers in the last year", thus excluding a large proportion of arts and cultural sector professionals, who rely on short-term contracts. \c\cHowever, most of the arts sector's more than 193,000 workers were still unable to access the JobKeeper payments, despite being defined as sole traders, and an estimated A$330 million worth of paid performances cancelled. The Australia Institute recommended a A$750 million rescue package for the industry, while Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said that arts workers should utilise existing support measures. \c\cOn 4 May 2020, the company operating the Carriageworks multi-arts venue in Sydney declared it would be entering voluntary administration and closing, citing an "irreparable loss of income" due to government bans on events during the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent negative impact on the arts sector. Carriageworks was the first major arts venue in the country to collapse suddenly after the hit to income caused by the strict social distancing rules enforced by state and federal governments, but others feared the same fate, after being forced to shut their doors in late March. \c\cOn 13 May 2020, the Art Gallery of South Australia announced that it would reopen on 8 June. \c\cOn 24 June 2020, the federal government announced a $250 million rescue package for the arts, comprising grants and loans. The package includes $75m for a grants program for new festivals, concerts, tours and events; $90m in loans to help fund new productions; $50m to help film and television producers unable to access insurance due to the pandemic, to enable them to restart production; and $35 million in direct financial assistance for struggling Commonwealth-funded organisations, including theatre, dance, music and circus. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) welcomed the boost, but critics said that it was not nearly enough, especially with so many workers in the industry still ineligible for JobKeeper payments. \c\cOn 3 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia became the first central bank to cut interest rates in response to the outbreak. Official interest rates were cut by 0.25% to a record low of 0.5%. \c\cOn 12 March, the federal government announced a planned A$17.6 billion stimulus package. The package consists of multiple parts: a one-off payment to pensioners, social security recipients, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders, payments of A$2,000–A$25,000 to affected small businesses, an increase to the threshold for the Instant Asset Write-off Program, tax concessions for investments, a small business 50% wage subsidy for 120,000 trainees and apprentices, and A$1 billion in subsidies for heavily affected industries. \c\cOn 17 March, the New South Wales government announced a A$2.3 billion stimulus package, including A$700 million for health services. A$450 million was allocated to waive payroll tax for 3 months, and $250 million was allocated so state-owned buildings and public schools could employ more cleaners. Seven hundred and fifty million dollars was allocated for capital works and public asset maintenance. \c\cOn 18 March, the Northern Territory government announced an economic stimulus package of A$60 million. \c\cOn 19 March, the Reserve Bank again cut interest rates by a further 0.25%, from 0.5% to 0.25%, the lowest in Australian history. \c\cIn March 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) began releasing a number of additional statistical products to assess the economic impacts on the outbreak on the Australian economy. Data on retail trade turnover indicated a 0.4% rise in turnover in February 2020. Negative effects on some areas of the retail sector (particularly tourism-dependent businesses) were offset by a rise in food retail turnover, with supermarkets showing a large rise in sales, mainly arising from panic buying. \c\cOn 22 March, the Federal government announced a second stimulus package of A$66 billion, increasing the amount of total financial package offered to A$89 billion. This included several new measures like an extra A$550 \'Coronavirus Supplement\' payment to those on income support, paid from 27 April to 24 September 2020, and relaxed eligibility criteria for individuals on JobSeeker Payment, granting A$100,000 to small and medium-sized businesses and A$715 million to Australian airports and airlines. It also allowed individuals affected by the outbreak to access up to A$10,000 of their superannuation during 2019–2020 and also being able to take an additional same amount for the next year. \c\cOn 30 March, the Australian Government announced a six-month, A$130 billion JobKeeper payment. The JobKeeper payment provides businesses with up to A$1,500 a fortnight per full-time or part-time employee, or casual employee that has worked for that business for over a year. To be eligible, a business with an annual revenue of under A$1 billion must have lost 30% turnover since 1 March, or 50% for businesses over A$1 billion. The entire payment made to businesses for an employee must then, by law, be paid to that employee in lieu of normal pay. This response came after the enormous job losses seen just a week prior when an estimated 1 million Australians lost their jobs. The program was backdated to 1 March with the aim of re-employing many people who had lost their jobs in the weeks before. In the first hour of the scheme, over 8,000 businesses registered to receive the payments. The program is one of the largest economic packages ever implemented in modern Australian history. JobKeeper ended on 28 March 2021. \c\cOn 11 April, the South Australian state government announced its own A$350 million economic stimulus measures. \c\cIn late April, the Federal government announced A$94.6 million of support was available for zoos, wildlife parks and aquariums forced to close by coronavirus restrictions. This was part of previously announced economic stimulus measures. \c\cThe 2020 Federal Budget, normally delivered in May, was delayed until 6 October because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cOn 22 May 2020, the Treasury and Australian Taxation Office announced there had been a miscalculation of A$60 billion in the planned cost of the JobKeeper program. Blaming 1,000 businesses for making "significant errors" on the application form, the Australian Government revealed it had overbudgeted the program, and that it was forecast to cost A$70 billion, not A$130 billion. The Treasury also announced that its original forecast of 6.5 million recipients was inaccurate, and closer to 3.5 million. Prime Minister Scott Morrison celebrated the saving, while the Opposition announced a parliamentary inquiry in an attempt to compel Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to explain the overestimation. \c\cIn July 2020, Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, in an interview with the US CNBC news channel, vowed that the government's budget deficit was expected to increase to A$85.8 billion Australian dollars in the financial year ended on 30 June and further widen to A$184.5 billion in the new fiscal year. \c\cOn 2 September, the Australian economy went into recession for the first time in nearly thirty years. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) fell 7 per cent in the June quarter. In December, it was announced Australia had pulled out of recession after experiencing a 3.3% growth in GDP in the September quarter. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg stated the effects of the recession had lasting impacts and the recovery was far from over. Australia is set to avoid an economic depression as forecast earlier in 2020, though GDP is likely to have experienced a contraction from 2019 figures. \c\cThe 2020 Australian federal budget, delayed from May, is finally delivered on 6 October. \c\cOn 17 November 2020, the NSW Government announced in the state budget that all NSW residents over 18 years of age would be eligible to receive four A$25 vouchers through Service NSW to help stimulate the economy. Two vouchers are for dining, Monday to Thursday only, excluding public holidays. The other two are to be spent on entertainment, excluding on public holidays. Businesses need to be COVID-safe registered, and sign-up for the scheme. The vouchers cannot be used for gambling, alcohol, cigarettes, retail purchases or accommodation. The program was originally called "Out and About". \c\cResidents will need to have a Service NSW account to receive their vouchers. After trials in Sydney and regional areas, full rollout was scheduled for March. The trials began in Broken Hill, and the Rocks in Sydney on 11 February 2021. \c\cAs early as mid-April 2021, the scheme was said by some regional NSW residents to be "city centric\'. At this time, the vouchers had been used by less than 10% of the 5 million who can use it. There were calls by NSW opposition political parties for the scheme to be extended beyond its initial 30 June 2021 deadline to use the vouchers. On 9 June 2021, the Dine & Discover scheme was extended by a month to 31 July. The scheme was then extended again to 31 August due to the lockdown in NSW, and then eventually to 30 June 2022. In November 2021, two extra vouchers were granted, one for dining and one for entertainment. \c\cOn 22 February 2021, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that the JobSeeker Payment base rate would be increased by A$50 a fortnight from April 2021. The payment will rise to A$614 a fortnight, with an estimated cost over forward estimates of A$9 billion. It is also intended to increase the threshold amount recipients can earn before their payment starts to be reduced. \c\cOn 26 February 2021, the Chief Executive of the Australian Airports Association, James Goodwin, said that Australian airports had been losing A$320 million every month during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said over the past 12 months, job losses amounted to 25 per cent of the airports\' workforce. \c\cOn 10 March 2021, the Federal Government announced steps worth A$1.2 billion to encourage Australians to holiday within Australia to assist ailing tourist destinations. Between April and July, up to 800,000 airfares to 13 regions normally favoured by international tourists will be halved for domestic travellers. \c\cOn 3 June 2021, the Federal Government announced that people who lose work as a result of lockdowns, of at least 7 days\' length, may be eligible for a A$325 or A$500 per week Temporary COVID Disaster Payment. To be eligible:\c\cPerson must be older than 17\c\cLive/ work in a Commonwealth defined hot-spot\c\cHave less than A$10,000 liquid assets\c\cWould have worked except for lockdown, and,\c\cWill lose income due to lockdown\c\cCan\'t access special pandemic or sick leave, or,\c\cHave used it up\c\cThose on other types of income support from the Commonwealth, like JobSeeker, are ineligible. \c\cTo get the full A$500 payment, the lost work must be at least 20 hours. If the lost work is under 20 hours, the payment is $325. \c\cVictoria announced A$30 million of financial support on 7 June 2021 for residents "locked out of work" by COVID lockdowns. The Victorian government also extended it emergency "hardship support payment" to October. This helps those on temporary or provisional visas who are not able get income from the Commonwealth. \c\cThe pandemic had significant negative effect on the Australian labour market. In July 2019, unemployment was 5.1%, by July 2020 it peaked at 7.5%, during the pandemic, by the end of 2020 it had fallen to 6.6%. Figures for February to March 2021, released in April, showed unemployment had reduced to 5.8%, 0.4 points higher than at the start to the pandemic. \c\cIn September 2020, a report from Ernst & Young stated that pandemic related border restrictions could result in a shortfall of 26,000 pickers over Australia's summer harvest season. Such work is typically reliant on seasonal staff from overseas. As a trial in early September 2020, 160 workers from Vanuatu were allowed into the Northern Territory (NT) to pick mangoes. They arrived on a specially chartered aircraft, and had to undergo the usual 14-day quarantine. It was estimated that the Vanuatuan workers saved A$100 million of fruit from the NT mango harvest being left to rot. The mango industry in the NT was valued at more than A$128 million in 2019, and produces more than half of Australia's mangoes. \c\cOn 30 September 2020, PM Scott Morrison announced that: " ... backpackers, Pacific Islanders and seasonal workers will be able to extend their visas to stay in Australia ..." and "... welfare recipients will be offered incentives to pick fruit."\c\cIn late October 2020, some farmers found that they had to plough their produce back into the ground because it could not be harvested, at a loss of A$150,000. \c\cThe "Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job" (RATTUAJ) program, scheduled to run from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021, offers A$6,000 for transport, moving expenses, accommodation and work clothing for welfare recipients willing to relocate to a regional area for a minimum of 6 weeks for short term agricultural jobs. Up to early December 2020, the relocation incentives for unemployed Australians appeared to be failing. After operating for a month, Federal Department of Employment figures showed only 148 people had taken up the offer. \c\cShortage of workers for harvesting can not only mean unpicked produce being left to rot or be ploughed back into fields, and farmers possibly not planting the next year, it creates an economic loss to those farmers, and can also noticeably increase prices for consumers. \c\cIn 2020, due to international travel restrictions, social distancing and lockdowns because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of influenza in Australia, and deaths from it, were at "record lows". In mid-June 2021 the flu was said to be almost non-existent. In May 2019 there were over 30,000 cases, in May 2021, only 71. \c\c2019 in Australia was particularly bad with 800 flu deaths, below 40 in 2020, and no reported deaths as of June 2021. \c\cOn 4 February 2021, World Cancer Day, the government organisation Cancer Australia said that in 2020 between January and September, there were nearly 150,000 less diagnostic tests for cancer performed, compared to the same period in 2019. \c\cIn August 2021, breast cancer screening appointments were being cancelled by BreastScreen NSW due to the lockdown in Sydney that began in late June. \c\cSome nurses were retasked to pandemic response, leading to some screening clinics and mobile clinics being closed. \c\cAboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders have poorer health outcomes and a lower life expectancy than the non-Indigenous Australian population, particularly those living in remote areas, and along with overcrowded housing and many living in very remote communities, makes them one of the communities most vulnerable to the virus. The remote Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY lands) in South Australia, whose population has many comorbidities, high rates of tobacco use, overcrowded housing and overall poor hygiene, introduced restricted access to the lands in early March to protect their people, especially elders, from the virus. The Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said it was a sensible move, and that the federal government would work with them. (A later call to evacuate elders to Adelaide by the APY Art Centre Collective was not put into operation.)\c\cThe federal government set up a national Indigenous advisory group in early March 2020, to create an emergency response plan for Aboriginal communities. The 43-page plan was published in March, and in late March, the Prime Minister that advised that Indigenous Australians over the age of 50 (along with everyone over 70 and those with a chronic illness over 60), should stay at home as much as possible. The Department of Health created a web page dedicated to advice for Indigenous people and remote communities, and the National Indigenous Australians Agency has one dedicated to the government's response to COVID-19. On 18 April the NIAA announced a government package of A$123 million of "targeted measures to support Indigenous businesses and communities to increase their responses to COVID-19", for the coming two financial years. \c\cThe Northern Territory developed a remote health pandemic plan, with NT Health setting up a number of remote clinics across the Territory. All non-essential travel to 76 remote communities was banned, and a 14-day isolation period imposed for those residents wanting to return home from regional centres, and in May 2020, health officials suggested that these controls should stay in place for the foreseeable future. In mid-March 2020 a group of senior NT clinicians called for 16 measures to be implemented as soon as possible to help protect vulnerable communities. Other states and territories have provided advice on their health agency websites. \c\cIn May 2020 a group of Barkindji families set up a tent town on the banks of the Darling River near Wilcannia in New South Wales, to escape the threat of the disease from overcrowded accommodation in the town. \c\cIn late August 2021 a man in his 50s who died at Dubbo Hospital, is believed to be the first Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander COVID-19 related death. He was not vaccinated. By 7 September 2021, there had been 2 more deaths of indigenous Australians, who were also not vaccinated. \c\cThe pandemic has created shortages of some medications since it began, initially related to panic buying. The most commonly used antidepressant in Australia, sertraline, is one of many such as the brand Zoloft, that have been affected by a global shortage. Olmesartan and irbesartan, both blood pressure medications were short in Australia as were hormone replacement therapy (HRT) patches and carbimazole, a thyroid medication. As of February 2021 the contraceptive pill "Norimin" (norethisterone) was hard for pharmacists to acquire, supply had been intermittent for 6–12 months. Shortages of Norimin and Brevinor, both Pfizer products, were reported in August 2020 and first predicted to last until December 2020, the shortage was then expected by the TGA "... to be resolved in March or April 2021". In the case of sertraline a Serious Shortage Substitution Notice (SSSN) was issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). SSSNs were also issued in Australia for Prazosin (blood pressure), Metformin (diabetes), and Estradot (HRT), which in theory allows substitutions like issuing twice the number of 25-milligram (0.39 gr) tablets in place of the prescribed 50-milligram (0.77 gr) tablets, without a new prescription, but with the patients\' consent. Chris Moy, Vice President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) said medicine shortages in Australia were a "pre-existing problem" before COVID-19. \c\cMoy also said "A lot of our medications are made in China and India. Sovereign capability and protecting supply of our medications is something that should be seriously considered."\c\cThe TGA gave short-term approval for the import of some medicines that are "not on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) that are approved for import and supply in Australia because: there is a shortage of a medicine registered in Australia; and the medicine is needed in the interest of public health."\c\cIn 2020, local council elections were  impacted by the pandemic. In Victoria candidates could only campaign online. NSW elections due in September were postponed a year. \c\cIn 2021, NSW local council elections due on 4 September, already postponed from 2020, were postponed again to 4 December due to a wave of delta variant infections that caused numerous lockdowns in the state. \c\cOn 31 January 2021, Federal politicians flying into Canberra from Western Australia had to quarantine for five days when a sudden lockdown was declared in Perth and two adjoining regions. Federal Parliament was scheduled to resume on 2 February. \c\cOn 26 July 2021 it was announced that, from 2 August, Parliament House in Canberra would come under COVID-19 restrictions to "minimise non-essential activity" for the next legislative sitting that day. All public galleries will close and the general public unable to enter the building. Politicians attending, and their staff, will be "substantially reduced" and remote participation technology used. Physical distancing will return. Use of the Check-in CBR app extends to all food and beverage venues open under takeaway only restrictions. The restrictions will last until 3 September. \c\cThroughout 2020 and 2021, several protests against COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were held in several state capitals including Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. In addition, protests were held in February 2021 against the Federal Government's national vaccine programmme. Police have responded to these protests by arresting demonstrators and issuing fines. \c\cThe major sporting leagues (A-League, AFL, AFL Women's, and the National Rugby League) initially stated that their 2020 seasons would not be suspended but would continue behind closed doors, with some games being played under those conditions. However, all the leagues were later suspended. \c\cInitially the 2020 Stawell Gift was postponed until later in the year; however, in May it was cancelled entirely for 2020. \c\cThe 2020 AFL season was initially curtailed to a maximum of 17 games, with clubs expected to take at least a 10% revenue hit from coronavirus related issues. However, on 22 March, just before the end of round 1 of the 2020 season, AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan announced that the AFL season would be suspended until at least 31 May, citing the shutting of state borders as the primary cause for this decision. The AFL season restarted on 11 June, with the Grand Final being played on 24 October at the Gabba in Brisbane, Queensland, the first Grand Final to be held outside Victoria. The 2020 AFL Women's season was cancelled midway through the finals series, with no premiership awarded to any team. \c\cThe 2020 - 2021 playoffs were shortened and the 2021 - 2022 season of the Australian Baseball league was cancelled due to travel restrictions and victoria being in lockdown respectively. \c\cThe 2020 NBL Finals began with game two, although it was stated that the competition would be immediately suspended if any participants were to be diagnosed. The best of five series was subsequently cancelled after the third game was played with the title awarded to Perth Wildcats. \c\cAll second-tier state basketball leagues were either postponed or cancelled. \c\cThe remaining two One Day Internationals between Australia and New Zealand in March 2020 were cancelled, and the first match was played without spectators. Cricket Australia also cancelled the Australian women's cricket team's tour of South Africa due to the virus. \c\cThe first major sporting event in Australia to be affected was the 2020 Australian Grand Prix, which was cancelled on 13 March 2020 after McLaren withdrew when a team member tested positive for COVID-19. This was also enforced on the support races which included the 2020 Melbourne 400, which was the second round of the 2020 Supercars Championship to be cancelled. The 2021 Australian Grand Prix was postponed from its original March date to November to allow for the easing of travel restrictions. On 6 July 2021, it was cancelled for the second consecutive year due to "restrictions and logistical challenges" related to the pandemic. \c\cFollowing the implementation of travel restrictions by New Zealand, the Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) announced that the New Zealand Warriors would be based in Australia for the foreseeable future. The 2020 season was suspended indefinitely on 23 March. Chairman of the ARLC Peter V\'landys requested a government bailout for the National Rugby League, a request that was struck down, and caused a considerable negative reaction. \c\cOn 22 April 2020, the NRL announced that they planned for the season to restart on 28 May, with training beginning on 4 May, and has planned for 18 rounds (giving a 20-round season) and a State of Origin series, with the Grand Final rescheduled for 25 October. \c\cThe NRL season recommenced on 28 May 2020 with a round 3 game played in Brisbane between the Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta Eels. The match was played behind closed doors without any crowd, although the broadcasters (Channel 9 and Fox Sports) used fake crowd noise during the broadcast. The return match rated highly on TV as it was the first TV match of a team sport in Australia for 8 weeks. The Grand Final was played in front of a limited crowd on 25 October at ANZ Stadium. \c\cThe 2020 State of Origin series took place after the NRL season, with Game 3 holding a capacity crowd at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium. \c\cThe 2020 Super Rugby season was suspended following the conclusion of play on 15 March 2020, due to the outbreak and the imposition of mandatory quarantine for international travellers to New Zealand. \c\cIn 2020, the A-League initially announced a continuation of the league with the Wellington Phoenix being based in Australia; however, on 24 March 2020, suspended the remaining matches indefinitely. On 17 July, the season resumed in a NSW-based hub, where the season finished with the Grand Final occurring at Bankwest Stadium on 30 August in front of a limited crowd. \c\cThe 2020 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race was cancelled on 19 December due to an outbreak in the Greater Sydney region. \c\cEconomic modelling in May 2020 by Tourism Research Australia predicted that the domestic tourism industry would drop in value from A$138 billion to $83 billion. \c\cOn 2 October 2020, Prime Minister Morrison announced that the Australian Government had formalised a deal allowing New Zealanders "one-way quarantine-free travel" into New South Wales and the Northern Territory from 16 October as part of initial steps to establish a "travel bubble" between the two countries. However, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ruled out extending reciprocal "quarantine-free travel" for Australians in order to contain the spread of COVID-19 into New Zealand. \c\cOn 17 October 2020, Stuff reported that 17 New Zealanders who had entered New South Wales traveled to Melbourne despite Victoria not being a party to the travel bubble arrangement with New Zealand. The Victorian Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the arrival of the group but stated that it did not have the authority to detain them. In response, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews threatened to close his state's borders unless the Australian Federal Government blocked travellers using the Trans-Tasman bubble from traveling to Victoria. The Federal Government has disagreed with the Victorian Government's stance. In addition, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced that her government would not prevent New Zealand passengers from travelling to Victoria. \c\cOn 11 December 2020, the Premier of Queensland Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that her state would open its borders to travelers from New Zealand from 1:00 am the following day (12 December), exempting them from quarantine restrictions. \c\cOn 14 December 2020, the New Zealand Prime Minister Ardern announced that the New Zealand Government had approved plans to establish a quarantine free travel bubble with Australia in the first quarter of 2021. Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt welcomed the move, describing it as the "first step" in normalising international travel and reiterated the Australian Government's support for measures to establish the travel bubble. \c\cOn 25 January 2021, the Federal government immediately suspended the ability of New Zealanders to travel to Australia that they had since 16 October 2020, without quarantining, for at least 72 hours. This followed the discovery of a NZ resident with the South African COVID-19 variant. The woman was not known to be infectious, having twice tested negative to COVID-19 before leaving quarantine, then visited many places in northern NZ, but she was then found to have the new strain. \c\cOn 19 April 2021, Australians were allowed quarantine-free travel to New Zealand for the first time in more than a year. To fly under the bubble's rules, passengers must have spent 14 days before departure in either Australia or New Zealand; however, they are not required to spend the full 14-day period or more in the other country, i.e. a person has spent at least 14 days in Australia, flies to New Zealand and returns to Australia after 7 days. They must not be awaiting the results of a Covid test, nor have any Covid symptoms, amongst other criteria. \c\cOn 26 October 2020, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews announced the relaxation of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in Melbourne, ending the 112-day lockdown period. From 28 October, all repair stores, restaurants, cafes, and bars were allowed to reopen with a 10-person limit; home visits were allowed; outdoor gatherings including weddings were limited to ten people; and funerals were limited to 20 people. From 11:59 pm on 8 November, the 25-kilometre (16 mi) travel limit in Greater Melbourne, and the border between Melbourne and regional Victoria was lifted; gyms and fitness studios were allowed to reopen; and the patron limit at restaurants, cafes and bars was raised. On 22 November, mandatory mask wearing was dropped from outdoor public spaces where social distancing can be maintained. \c\cIn late August 2021, the state of South Australia launched an app with facial recognition software that Australians subject to mandatory 14-day quarantines can opt to use in lieu of being quarantined at a hotel under police guard. The app randomly prompts users to take a picture of their face and submit geo-location data within 15 minutes of the prompt in order to prove to the South Australian government that the user is in an approved location. Users who refuse to comply or who fail to respond to a prompt within 15 minutes are checked on by local police and may be subject to fines. \c\cOn 19 April 2020, Australia questioned China's handling of the pandemic, questioned the transparency of its disclosures, and demanded an international investigation into the origins of the virus and its spread. The Chinese Ambassador Cheng Jingye, in a rare breach of diplomatic protocol, leaked details of his telephone conversation with Frances Adamson, Secretary of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on the embassy website. He warned that the demand for an inquiry could result in a consumer boycott of students and tourists visiting Australia, and could affect sales of major exports. A trade dispute involving improperly labelled beef and barley dumping ensued, which seriously affected Australian exports. On 26 August 2020, China's deputy ambassador to Australia, Wang Xining, expressed that Australia's co-proposal for an independent investigation into the causes of the pandemic "hurts the feelings of the Chinese people" during his address to the National Press Club of Australia. \c\cNumerous events in 2020 were cancelled, rescheduled, postponed, reduced in size, or changed location. Some went to an online or streaming format. Even into early 2021 some events, such as Skyfire, regional agricultural shows, and music festivals (Byron Bay Bluesfest and Groovin the Moo) were cancelled for the second year. As of 16 January 2021[update] twenty regional town shows scheduled for January or February 2021 had been postponed or cancelled in New South Wales alone. \c\cThe World Surf League cancelled all events in March 2020. \c\cAll Anzac Day marches in 2020 were cancelled. In 2021, as of 15 April 2021[update], most major state marches went ahead, some states as per pre-pandemic, but most with ticketing and/or restrictions on numbers marching and watching. Overseas services will not be held. On 24 April 2021 Perth city and the Peel region entered a sudden 3-day COVID-19 lockdown and Anzac Day services in the affected areas were cancelled. \c\cThe 15 May 2020 school strike for climate rally and march was cancelled. \c\cThe Australian Border Force suspended all deportations to New Zealand between 16 and 30 March 2020. \c\cNational Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) tests for 2020 were cancelled on 20 March. \c\cThe national regional touring music festival Groovin\' the Moo announced on 17 March that the 2020 festival was cancelled whilst confirming dates for 2021. On 4 February 2021 that year's festival was also "postponed". \c\cThe 26th Australian Scout Jamboree, scheduled for January 2022 in Elmore, Victoria, was cancelled.
On November 30, 2021, a gunman opened fire on students at Oxford High School in the Detroit exurb of Oxford Township, Michigan, killing three students and injuring eight others, including one teacher. The suspected shooter is a 15-year-old sophomore student who is in custody. \c\cAccording to students and parents, rumors regarding threats of a mass shooting occurring at Oxford High School were circulating before the incident occurred. Earlier that month, in an act of vandalism, a deer head had been thrown off the school roof, prompting school administrators to publish a note to parents, saying they had been investigating the rumors but found no threat. \c\cThe suspect reportedly used a semiautomatic handgun for the shooting. After the shooting occurred, the school went into lockdown. Some students were evacuated to a nearby Meijer store. \c\cAt 12:55 p.m. EST, police arrived at the school after receiving around 100 911 calls. The shooter was arrested unharmed. At a news conference, Oakland County undersheriff Michael McCabe said the gunman "gave up without any problems."\c\cThree students were killed, and eight other people were injured, including a teacher. \c\cOn the evening of November 30, Undersheriff McCabe said two of the wounded people were in surgery, in unknown condition, while the remaining six were in stable condition. A 9 mm SIG Sauer SP2022 semiautomatic handgun was recovered from the suspect; Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said the suspect's father had purchased the gun four days prior to the shooting. Based on recovered shell casings found in the school, authorities believe around 15 to 20 shots were fired. \c\cPresident Joe Biden and Representative Elissa Slotkin, whose district includes Oxford High School, both expressed their condolences over the shooting. Governor Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that she was "devastated for the students, staff, and families" of the school, calling gun violence a "public health crisis".
The COVID-19 vaccination program in the Philippines is an ongoing mass immunization campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in response to the ongoing pandemic in the country. \c\cThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to 10 COVID-19 vaccines (in chronological order): Pfizer–BioNTech, Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Sputnik V, Janssen, Covaxin, Moderna, Sinopharm BIBP and Sputnik Light. \c\cAs of December 1, 2021, about 89,070,292 total vaccine doses have been administered throughout the country, with 36,869,419 being fully vaccinated, and 389,451 booster dose administered. \c\cThe COVID-19 Immunization Program Management Organizational Structure was formed on October 26, 2020, to facilitate the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines, however this was replaced by a vaccine cluster within the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) by November 6, 2020. Carlito Galvez Jr. was appointed to lead the cluster under the title of vaccine czar. The Philippine National Vaccination Program and Implementation Plan was also approved by November 6, 2020. \c\cThe COVID-19 Immunization Program Management Organizational Structure was formed on October 26 with the intention of it overseeing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines once these became available. However, by November 6, the vaccine body was abolished and replaced with a vaccine cluster within the National Task Force Against COVID-19 of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). The vaccine cluster is distinct from the national task force's COVID-19 response cluster. \c\cThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on their part is the agency tasked to review and approve the use and commercial distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines as well as the issuance of an emergency use authorization for the same. \c\cThe national government planned to rollout its vaccination program around February expecting the delivery of vaccines from Pfizer's vaccines sourced from the COVAX facility and the first batch of Sinovac's vaccines, consisting of 50,000 doses. The delivery of Pfizer's vaccines was delayed due to documentary issues. \c\cThe government plans to start a full rollout or mass vaccination for the general populace around late 2021. \c\cUnder normal circumstances, drugs and vaccines are reviewed for approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a period of six months. President Rodrigo Duterte to fast-track the government's medical response to the pandemic signed an executive order on December 2, 2020, which allowed the FDA to grant emergency-use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. An EUA for a particular vaccine would authorize the government to buy said vaccine and allow to use the same for the vaccination program. An EUA would not authorize the commercial use of such vaccines or consent the use of the vaccine for personal use. \c\cThe EUA approval process by the FDA is covered under FDA Circular No. 2020-036. \c\cA EUA granted for COVID-19 vaccine or drug remains valid if it fulfills three conditions:\c\cBased on the totality of evidence including data from adequate and well-known controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the drug or vaccine may be effective to prevent, diagnose or treat COVID-19. \c\cThe known and potential benefits of the drug or vaccine...outweigh the known and potential risks, if any. \c\cThere is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the drug or vaccine. \c\cThe EUAs validity ends one year from the lifting of the public health emergency status declared in response to the pandemic or one year from the date it was registered if a COVID-19 drug or vaccine gets fully registered with the FDA. \c\cAmong the conditions for a vaccine manufacturer to secure an EUA in the Philippines is to obtain prior EUA in its country of origin or other countries with a "mature" regulator. No manufacturer would be allowed to obtain a EUA in the Philippines first. For the purpose of the FDA's EUA approval process, the following foreign regulators are considered as "mature":\c\cTherapeutic Goods Administration (Australia)\c\cPharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (Japan)\c\cMinistry of Food and Drug Safety (South Korea)\c\cHealth Canada\c\cHealth Sciences Authority (Singapore)\c\cSwiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Switzerland)\c\cMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (United Kingdom)\c\cFood and Drug Administration (United States)\c\cEuropean Medicines Agency (European Union)\c\cThe FDA announced that three vaccine manufacturers namely Pfizer–BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have inquired on the process of obtaining an EUA in the Philippines. \c\cThe Philippines\' vaccination officially began on March 1, 2021, shortly after the arrival of the first batch of vaccines from Sinovac. Prior to the official roll-out, a dry run was conducted to ensure that the vaccines, especially temperature-sensitive ones, would be rolled-out with minimal problems. \c\cIn February 2021, the Food and Drug Association recommended against the usage of Sinovac vaccines for health care workers due to its low efficacy rates in trials on health care workers in other countries. It has recommended its usage instead to the vaccine to the working population and military personnel. \c\cThe National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) on February 26 has approved the use of the Sinovac vaccine to health care workers. Health care workers are still allowed to not take the vaccine and wait for a more effective vaccine. Philippine General Hospital (PGH) employees demanded for a better vaccine and an increase with their hazard pays. \c\cAt a press conference, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque stated that health care workers can refuse the Sinovac vaccine and wait for the vaccines from Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna, and Oxford–AstraZeneca while still being prioritized but other prioritized groups shall only get what is available in their locality. \c\cThe rollout for the Philippines\' national vaccine program began on March 1, 2021, shortly after the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac's vaccine. Philippine General Hospital director and doctor Gerardo Legaspi officially became the first recipient of a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. The initial batch will cover around 50,000 military personnel and 250,000 health workers. As of March 3, 2021, vaccinations has been limited to Metro Manila and to health workers. However, select government officials were vaccinated in a bid to boost confidence on the vaccine. \c\cOn March 6, 2021, Oxford–AstraZeneca, under the COVAX facility, began the rollout. Health workers who refused Sinovac's vaccines were prioritized. \c\cIn May 2021, the rollout of vaccines from two manufacturers began. The rollout of the Sputnik V vaccines began on May 3 with five cities of Metro Manila; namely Makati, Manila, Taguig, Parañaque, and Muntinlupa. The deployment of Pfizer started on May 12, beginning in two cities in Metro Manila (San Juan and Makati). On June 30, 2021, the Moderna vaccine began its rollout in Metro Manila including San Juan. On July 20, 2021, the Janssen vaccine began being rolled out in Tacloban. On August 12, 2021, Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. announced that recipients of the Sputnik V vaccine as their first dose can receive the AstraZeneca vaccine as their second dose provided that the shipment of Sputnik V is delayed due to logistical issues. \c\cVaccination of minors began in mid-October 2021. At that time, emergency use authorizations for the use of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for minors (ages 12-15 for Pfizer; age 12-17 for Moderna) has been granted. \c\cTo hasten the immunization program, the government announced that it was holding "National Vaccination Days" on November 29 until December 1. November 29 and December 1 will be special working days. Initially targeted to immunize 15 million people, it was reduced to 9 million due to logistics issues surrounding the syringes for Pfizer vaccines. \c\cOn July 4, 2021, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) has permitted domestic travel within the Philippines for fully vaccinated individuals that have been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) or have been granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) or a compassionate special permit (CSP) issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The same rules applies for fully vaccinated international travelers from countries and territories deemed as "low-risk" and can receive a reduced quarantine period of seven days. \c\cSince July 2021, the Bureau of Quarantine in the Philippines has begun issuing a new format of the International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV) to fully vaccinated Philippine citizens and residents for international travel provided that the COVID-19 vaccine is listed under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO). \c\cOn October 8, 2021, the IATF introduced revised guidelines that fully vaccinated travelers from "low-risk" (green list) and "moderate-risk" (yellow list) jurisdictions and can receive a reduced facility-based quarantine up to five days upon presentation of a national digital certificate issued by a foreign government with a reciprocal agreement with the Philippines. \c\cOn October 13, 2021, the IATF subsequently permitted the entry of fully vaccinated travelers from "low-risk" (green list) countries and jurisdictions to skip facility-based quarantine provided there is a presentation of negative RT-PCR test result within 72 hours before departure from their country. \c\cThe Philippines presently recognizes the vaccination certificates issued by the following countries: Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Georgia, India, Japan, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Samoa, Singapore, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. \c\cThe Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC), the independent advisory council issued its recommendation for the administering of a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as a booster shot with a priority towards health care workers and other priority groups. \c\cBooster shots were rolled for frontline healthcare workers on November 16, 2021. Similarly, the IATF has approved the administration of booster shots for Overseas Filipino Workers who are set for deployment within four months provided their second dosage was taken six months prior. Senior citizens and immunocompromised persons were rolled out on November 22, 2021. These groups can choose their preferred vaccine brand in comparison to their primary series. \c\cOn December 3, 2021, the Philippine Department of Health announces the expansion of the booster shot program stating all adults aged 18 years and above can receive additional booster shots at least six months from the primary series or three months after receiving the single-dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. \c\cThe Philippine government has been negotiating with various foreign vaccine manufacturers to secure the country's COVID-19 vaccine supply. These manufacturers include Sinovac Biotech (China), Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology (Russia), Moderna (United States), and Pfizer (United States). The private sector, with government sanction, has secured at least 2.6 million vaccine doses from British-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca. The government also has secured 10 million doses from American firm Novavax which would be supplied from the Serum Institute of India. \c\cThe government plans to secure 171 million doses from at least seven firms by the end of 2021. The procurement efforts of the national government have been a subject of various controversies. \c\cThe national government through the Department of Foreign Affairs responding to the request of Germany and the United Kingdom to be exempted from the Philippines\' prevailing cap on the deployment of nurses abroad in exchange for vaccines. The United Kingdom declined the offer refusing to link the vaccines to negotiations on the deployment of Filipino health workers to their country. The proposal was also opposed by labor group Migrante International. \c\cThe Philippine government is negotiating with four pharmaceutical firms for the supply of COVID-19 booster shots. \c\cLocal government units in the Philippines, from individual municipalities and cities and provinces has allocated part of their budgets to procure their own supply of COVID-19 vaccines. \c\cAlong with private companies, local governments had to procure vaccines through cooperation with the national government which led to some members of the Congress questioning urging the national government to allow local governments to procure vaccines unilaterally. However, the government pointed out that only national governments could directly procure vaccines through the World Health Organization's COVAX facility and that third-party private firms and local governments had to sign a tripartite deal with the national government and member vaccine manufacturer. \c\cThe first vaccines acquired by the Philippine national government was from Sinovac. The first batch of Sinovac's vaccines consisting of 600,000 doses were received by the Philippines on February 28, 2021, with the country expected to receive a total of 26 million doses. Vaccines sourced through the COVAX facility is also funded through donations by foreign countries. The IATF-EID approved the Philippines\' participation in COVAX on July 24, 2020. The country is the recipient of vaccines from Pfizer–BioNTech and Oxford–AstraZeneca through the platform. \c\cThe Philippines also engaged in talks with Israel to obtain a possible donation of excess vaccines from the Middle Eastern country. \c\cThe Philippines has received 1,124,100 Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine donations from Japan on July 8. \c\cThe Philippines has received about 3,239,400 Janssen COVID-19 vaccine donations from the United States on July 16–17 through COVAX. \c\cThe Philippines has received 415,040 Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine doses donations from the United Kingdom on August 2. \c\cThe Philippines has received 3,000,060 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine donations from the United States on August 3 through COVAX. \c\cThe Philippines has received 100,000 doses of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine from the United Arab Emirates. \c\cThe Philippines has received a donation of about 1,000,000 doses of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine on August 20–21 from China. \c\cThe Philippines has expressed its intent to get some of Canada's COVID-19 vaccines. \c\cFive local firms are in negotiations with foreign organizations to set up vaccine manufacturing sites in the Philippines as of March 2021. The origin of these foreign organization include China, India, South Korea, Russia, and the United States. South Korean firm EU Biologics has a partnership with Philippine vaccine distributor Glovax Biotech Corp. since 2012. The two companies plan to set-up their own vaccine production hub in Clark. Other interested foreign parties include the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology of Russia and a university research unit based in the United States. \c\cPhilippine company United Laboratories launched a program known as "Vaccine Self Reliant Philippines" which includes plans to set up a vaccine manufacturing plant by 2023. \c\cThe delivery of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines has been subject to delays. Health Secretary Francisco Duque has been alleged to have "dropped the ball" on a Pfizer vaccine deal which could have secured 10 million doses by as early as January 2021. On June 19, the Philippine government has signed an agreement for the procurement of 40 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. \c\cThe first batch of the Pfizer vaccine, consisting of 193,050 doses through the COVAX facility, arrived on May 10. 2,279,160 additional doses arrived in the country from COVAX's facility on June 10. \c\cThe first batch of procured Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, consisting of 562,770 doses, arrived on July 21. \c\cOn January 14, the Philippines has secured 17 million doses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines from British-Swedish pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. \c\cA shipment of 487,200 Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines under COVAX's facility arrived in the country on March 4, 2021. An additional shipment of 38,400 doses arrived in the country on March 7, totalling a number of 525,600 doses from COVAX's facility. 2 million additional doses arrived in the country from COVAX's facility on May 8. \c\cThe first batch of procured Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, consisting of 1,150,800 doses, arrived on July 16. \c\cPlans to secure 36 million doses from China's Sinovac have also been subjected to scrutiny in Congress due to its reported efficacy rate. The efficacy rate of the Sinovac vaccine has varied by country; Turkey has reported an efficacy rate of 91% while Brazil has reported an efficacy rate of 78%. The Department of Health said that Sinovac's vaccine satisfy the World Health Organization standards of at least 50 percent efficacy rate while the FDA pointed out that Sinovac is yet to publish an official and published scientific report on their vaccines efficacy rate and that the clinical trial for the vaccine is conducted in different countries and the efficacy rate per country will vary. \c\cFollowing the approval for emergency use authorization on February 22, the first batch of Sinovac vaccines, consisting of 600,000 doses, from China's donation to the country arrived on February 28. \c\cThe first batch of procured vaccines by the government reached the Philippines on March 29 came from Sinovac with previous received vaccines coming from donations. \c\cOn August 24, the government bought additional 10 million doses from Sinovac. \c\cRussia commits to deliver the first doses of Gamaleya's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine to the Philippines around April 2021. The Philippines and Russia are also negotiating regarding a plan to set up a production facility for Sputnik V vaccines in the Philippines. The first batch of Gamaleya's vaccine, consisting of 15,000 doses, arrived on May 1. \c\cThe first batch of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine under COVAX's facility from US donation, consisting of 1,606,600 doses, arrived on July 16, 2021. An additional shipment of 1,632,800 doses arrived on July 17. \c\cThe procurement of Janssen COVID-19 vaccines are still under negotiations. \c\cIn early March 2021, the Philippine government secured 20 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine through a tripartite agreement with Moderna and the private sector led by businessman Enrique Razon. The first batch of Moderna's vaccine, consisting of 249,600 doses, arrived on June 27. More shipments are expected in July and August 2021. \c\cThe first batch of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine under the brand name Hayat-Vax arrived on August 11, consisting of 100,000 doses, donated by the United Arab Emirates. Another batch of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine arrived on August 20–21, consisting 1,000,000 doses, donated by China. \c\cThe procurement of the Sinopharm vaccines are still under negotiations. \c\cThe first batch of Sputnik Light COVID-19 vaccine arrived on November 19, consisting of 5,000 doses, donated by Russia. \c\cThe procurement of Novavax COVID-19 vaccines are still under negotiations. \c\cThe Philippine government released a priority groups list for the national vaccination program in February 2021 as approved by the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group. The list include three main categorizations, with utmost priority provided for populations under "A" categorization. As of October 2021, people under priority groups A1 to A5, the rest of adult population and some minors (ages 12 to 17 years old) are being allowed to receive vaccination. \c\cMarch 19, 2021 – Local executives (provincial governors, city and municipal mayors, and barangay captains) are reclassified as essential workers or under the A4 category. \c\cMarch 29, 2021 – Specific comorbidities defined for category A3. People with the identify comorbidities are prioritized for vaccination over people with other comorbidities not specified. \c\cApril 5, 2021 – Inclusion of judiciary employees under A4 category. \c\cApril 12, 2021 – 13 Essential workers sub-groups under A4 category defined. This include elevation of Filipino seafarers to A4 category from either B3 (other essential workers) or B5 (overseas Filipino workers) categories. Applies to both seafarers working domestically and those deployed overseas. \c\cMay 21, 2021 – Front line employees in the BPO industry and in the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) added to the A4 category. \c\cMay 22, 2021 – Olympic coaches, athletes, and delegates added to the A4 category. \c\cMay 27, 2021 – Included in A1 Category are outbound Overseas Filipino Workers and included in A4 category are private sector employees, government employees (including GOCCs and LGUs), and informal sector employees and self-employed individuals. \c\cJune 7, 2021 – Workers in the entertainment industry particularly hosts, media practitioners, actors, and production crew were added to the A4 category. \c\cOctober 15, 2021 – Pediatric vaccination under A3 (12 to 17 years old with comorbidities). \c\cNovember 3, 2021 – Expansion of the pediatric vaccination to the general adolescent population under priority group C (12 to 17 years old without comorbidities). \c\cIn January 2021, during the time when only the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine had an emergency use authorization, it was reported that an alleged black market of smuggled vaccines from China has established itself in the Philippines. The demand for the vaccines is particularly high for Chinese nationals in the country, especially those employed by Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs). The doses are reportedly sold at inflated prices, considerably more expensive than the standard price of the same vaccines in China. \c\cIn late March 2021, the FDA released an advisory cautioning the public against fake vaccines and that vaccines which had emergency use authorization are not authorized to be sold commercially. Although as of that date, there are no reports yet of fake vaccines proliferating in the country as per the FDA. \c\cThe DOH reported in March 2021 that a number of individuals had jumped the line to get the vaccine, becoming vaccinated despite being otherwise ineligible to do so. These include several local government officials, prompting the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to issue show cause orders against them to explain why they were vaccinated, and actor Mark Anthony Fernandez, who was vaccinated despite not belonging to a priority group for the vaccine. Fernandez, for his part, claimed that he had underlying health conditions that otherwise made him eligible. \c\cThe issue has raised the concerns of the Commission on Human Rights, and has also led to the WHO warning the Philippine government that it risks losing access to its share of vaccines provided by COVAX if the practice continues. \c\cA number of suggestions were floated to address line jumping, with Senator Franklin Drilon urging the government to ramp up the country's vaccine supply, and Representative Precious Hipolito, who represents the second district of Quezon City, filing a bill that would amend the Philippines\' COVID-19 vaccination law to criminalize the practice. \c\cOn May 3, 2021, President Rodrigo Duterte received his first dose of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine despite the latter not receiving an EUA from FDA. The FDA only issued a one-time compassionate special permit (CSP) for 10,000 doses of the vaccine for the PSG. \c\cBut due to public outrage, President Duterte apologized for taking the vaccine that has not been authorized by the FDA for emergency use and asked the Chinese Embassy to take back its donation. \c\cForeign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. announced the Government of Hong Kong will not honor the proof of vaccination issued by local government units and the Bureau of Quarantine in the Philippines due to a lack of a central registry. This was after several Overseas Filipino Worker (OFWs) bound for the territory were reported to have been refused entry due to non-recognition of their vaccine certificates. \c\cAs an interim solution, the Department of Health confirmed that all outbound travelers would use the International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV) issued by the Bureau of Quarantine as an official proof of vaccination for international travel better known as the "yellow card". \c\cOn August 22, 2021, the Department of Labor and Employment announced that the Government of Hong Kong will permit the entry of fully vaccinated Filipino workers into the territory upon the presentation of the International Certificate of Vaccination issued by the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) beginning on August 30, 2021.
The 2021 Semeru eruption began on 4 December on the Indonesian island of Java in the East Java province. Fourteen people have been killed, at least 102 more are wounded, while 10 are unaccounted for. \c\cSemeru is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia. At 3,676 meters in elevation, it is the highest volcano on the island. The volcano is part of a chain of volcanic mountains stretching from northern Sumatra to the Lesser Sunda Islands. Volcanism in Indonesia is mainly associated with the offshore subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath the Sunda Plate. The oldest record of an eruption was from 1818. Since then, major eruptions have occurred in 1941, 1942, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955 – 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1977, and 1978-1989. A minor eruption occurred in January 2021 with no casualties reported. The December 4 eruption is part of a series of explosive eruptions on the volcano beginning in 2014. Recent eruptions on the volcano have been accompanied by pyroclastic flows, eruption columns, and debris avalanches. \c\cThe eruption began at 14:50 local time, ejecting a cloud of volcanic ash 40,000 feet (12,000 m) into the air. The eruption is thought to have begun when a lava dome at the summit crater collapsed due to intense precipitation. The collapsed dome triggered a pyroclastic flow that traveled down the slopes of the volcano. \c\cIn the Malang Regency, six sub districts were affected by ashfall. Eight villages and two sub districts in the Lumajang Regency were also affected. The destruction of the Gladak Perak Bridge sealed road vehicle access to villages in the area. Power interruptions and blackouts were triggered, affecting at least 30,253 people. In the Pronojiwo District of East Java, at least 30 homes were destroyed by lahars. Many village homes and vehicles in East Java were buried under heavy volcanic ash. An estimated 300 families were evacuated. \c\cOn December 5, volcanic ash fell in the Pronojiwo District of Lumajang, forcing many evacuees, residents and aid officials to flee. It was reported that a smaller eruption had occurred. The small eruption caused panic at nearby villages. Some 28 schools in two districts; six in Candipuro and 22 in Pronojiwo were heavily damaged by ashfall. At least 11 villages in Lumajang were submerged in ash reaching up the roofs of homes. Many vehicles were also submerged. Kampung Renteng, a village in the Candipuro District, heavily affected by ash. At another village, ash had destroyed every home. \c\cInitial reports confirmed three people; a store owner and two miners, missing when the Gladak Perak Bridge in Lumajang collapsed due to a lahar. Later in the evening of December 4, that number was revised to 10 by CNN Indonesia. According to the Indonesian Ministry of Health, one person was killed and 45 people were injured. All of the injured suffered burns caused by pyroclastic flows. Four burn victims were taken to the intensive care unit for their serious injuries. A total of 38 people were treated at the Penanggal Health Center. Another 10 miners at a sand mine in Renteng Village were trapped and an initial attempt to rescue the miners was unsuccessful. A subsequent report indicated differently.  According to the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB), ten miners thought to be missing at a sand mine in Lumajang were rescued. However, some number of sand miners are still unaccounted for. \c\cA second death was confirmed on the morning of December 5 at the Dr. Haryoto Hospital due to severe burns. The total death toll was later revised to 14, with many of the victims dead from burns. Two of the fatalities were from the Supiturang and Sumberwuluh villages respectively. Five other victims were from the Curah Kobokan village. Five bodies are undergoing the identification process at the Bhayangkara Hospital. The number of burn victims was also updated to 89 from the early morning figure of 57. \c\cLocal authorities have urged residents to keep a distance of at least 5 km away from the main summit crater as there are concerns of large pyroclastic flows. Individuals are prohibited from approaching 1 km or closer to the crater. The head of the BNPB had warned of increased volcanic activity and the presence of pyroclastic flows in the volcano. The head also said ashfall were occurring in some villages hence residents have been urged to evacuate. Residents were also told to keep clear from rivers originating from Semeru as they are transporting volcanic debris. \c\cBy Sunday, December 5, at least 5,205 people were affected, with 1,300 residents in Lumajang displaced. The displaced residents and took refuge in multiple locations. In the Pronojiwo District, some 305 people resided in schools and village halls. 409 people were displaced in the Candipuro District, and 188 in Pasirian. Some of the evacuees later moved to other homes or buildings. A rescue operation to locate several miners unaccounted for on the afternoon of the eruption is said to begin once activity on the volcano has decreased. The Deputy Regent of Lumajang said that rescue and recovery efforts could not be carried out the night before due to difficult access to the affected areas. The BNPB provided meals ready-to-eat packs, blankets, mattresses, masks and refugee tents in an effort to assist the displaced residents. Medical supplies, water and instant food were also supplied. It is estimated that 1,14 billion Indonesian rupiah was utilised in providing aid. \c\cOperations at the Yogyakarta International Airport, Adisumarmo International Airport and Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport were unaffected by the eruption as no volcanic ash were observed. \c\cIndonesian President Joko Widodo would visit the Lumajang Regency to lead the BNPB in the post-eruption recovery efforts on December 5. Meanwhile, Khofifah Indar Parawansa, the Governor of East Java, relocated her office to the Lumajang Regency to aid in the evacuation process of residents in the danger zone.
On 4 December 2021, a unit of 21 Para Special Forces, the special forces unit of the Indian Army, killed six civilians near Oting village of Mon district in Nagaland, India. Eight more civilians and a soldier were killed in subsequent violence. According to the Indian army, the killings resulted from a "case of mistaken identity" in a failed ambush. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to probe the incident. \c\cThe incident sparked public outrage across the state in the following days. The killings were widely condemned with many calling to repeal and revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). \c\cOn the evening of 4 December 2021 at around 4:00–5:00 p.m. IST, a unit of the 21 Para Special Forces of Indian Army ambushed a vehicle—carrying civilians from Oting village who were returning from a coal mine at Tiru—and opened fire. Six people died, and two received serious injuries. \c\cIndian Army claims to have been the victim of an intelligence failure; they had suspected the vehicle to contain Naga insurgents. They further allege to have opened fire only when instructions to stop the vehicle were not paid heed to. \c\cUpon hearing gunshots, as neighboring villagers arrived at the spot, a fresh round of violence broke out. Villagers claim that the forces were unwilling to hand over the bodies and trying to take them to their base camp. Three army vehicles were torched and in retaliatory firing, seven civilians were killed alongside a soldier. Another twelve civilians were seriously injured, while eight more sustained minor injuries. \c\cIndian Army claims to have opened fire under compulsion, as multiple infantrymen were injured in the melee. \c\cPublic protests were organised across Nagaland on 5 December 2021. More than two hundred people attacked and vandalised the army camp of Assam Rifles in Mon Town during which one more civilian was killed. \c\cThe following day, the Government of Nagaland imposed Section 144 in Mon District restricting public assembly and movement as well as suspending mobile internet and bulk SMS services. \c\cThe Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO) which represents six tribes withdrew from the ongoing annual Hornbill Festival at Kisama near Kohima. The Nagas hoisted black flags on all its Morungs at the festival while the Konyaks decided to abstain its cultural troupe from participating at the festival which was followed by the rest of the other Naga cultural troupes on 5 December. A two minutes silence was also observed at the venue on the same day. \c\cLater that evening of 5 December, the people of Kohima observed a power blackout for 30 minutes to mourn the death of the civilians. The candlelight marches were organised in Kohima, Dimapur and other towns on the same day. A six-hour shutdown was also called by Naga Students\' Federation. \c\cThe incident sparked public outrage in Nagaland and was widely condemned with many calling to repeal and revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). \c\cOn 7 December, the Government of Nagaland announced that it would suspend all activities at Hornbill Festival and seek for the repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. \c\cOn 6 December, the Nagaland Police had registered a First information report against the 21 Para Special Forces, bringing charges of first degree murder. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) was tasked to complete the investigation in a month. The National Human Rights Commission of India has sent notices to the Central and the State governments.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Romania is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Romania on 26 February 2020, when the first case in Gorj County was confirmed. \c\cAs of 9 December 2021[update], the National Institute of Public Health has reported around 1,700,000 cases, 1,700,000 recoveries, and 57,000 COVID-19-related deaths. More than 10.8 million RT-PCR tests and more than 5.4 million rapid antigen tests have been processed. \c\cAn anti-COVID-19 vaccination campaign, part of a global effort to slow down the spread of the virus, started on 27 December 2020. As of 3 December 2021[update], around 8 million people (or 40% of the country's population) received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This placed Romania second-lowest in vaccination rates among EU countries. \c\cOn 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cUnlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cOn 21 February, following a COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, the Romanian government announced a 14-day quarantine for citizens returning from the affected regions. \c\cOn 22 February, the Romanian government announced several preventive measures including designation of five hospitals as isolation centres for new cases, purchase and placement of thermal scanners in international airports and specially designated lines for passengers coming from areas affected by COVID-19 outbreak. \c\cOn 25 February, new measures were imposed. Upon arrival on the Romanian territory, all asymptomatic travelers from the affected areas, respectively Hubei, the 11 localities in Italy, and any remaining passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship will go directly to the quarantine, for a period for 14 days. The other people coming from the Lombardy and Veneto regions will enter voluntary isolation at home for 14 days, upon arrival in Romania. \c\cOn 26 February, the Minister of Education and Research required schools to spread awareness about coronavirus. \c\cOn 28 February, the Romanian Orthodox Church suggested that followers use their own spoons and avoid the traditional kissing of icons in church. \c\cOn 2 March, more preventive measures were taken by the National Committee for Special Emergency Situations. Thus, citizens arriving from other provinces or cities in mainland China, other localities in the Lombardy, Veneto or Emilia-Romagna regions of Italy, as well as areas and localities in South Korea and Iran not previously specified for institutionalised quarantine, enter 14 days of self-isolation at home immediately upon returning to Romania. \c\cOn 8 March, the Head of the Department for Emergency Situations, Raed Arafat, announced a ban on all indoor or outdoor activities involving the participation of more than 1,000 people (these numbers were subsequently changed, see below). These restrictions are valid until 31 March, when a new assessment would be made. After Northern Italy was put under quarantine on 8 March, low-cost airline Wizz Air suspended all flights to Treviso and Bergamo until 3 April. Likewise, Blue Air cancelled all flights to and from Milan for 8 and 9 March. In the same day, flights from and to Italy have been suspended. In a press conference, Interior Minister Marcel Vela stated that if a school reports even a case, courses will be suspended throughout the school. \c\cOn 9 March, officials announced the cessation of flights to and from Italy, at all airports in the country, until 23 March. On the same day, the National Committee for Special Emergency Situations has decided to close all schools in Romania, from 11 March until 22, with the possibility of extending the measure. All bus rides and rail transport to and from Italy were suspended from 10 to 31 March.

On the same day, the Romanian Ombudsman asked President Klaus Iohannis to declare the state of emergency and the Romanian Parliament to approve it. In a televised statement, the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Health, Nelu Tătaru, said that the current situation does not impose such an extreme measure. The Romanian Football Federation decided to postpone all football matches in Romania until 31 March. Interior Minister Marcel Vela announced that the border crossing points with low traffic have been closed so that employees there to be directed to high traffic posts. Health Minister Victor Costache issued an order prohibiting the export of medicines and medical equipment for six months. \c\cOn 13 March, Vergil Chițac [ro], former admiral, who acts as an independent in the PNL senators\' group, was diagnosed with COVID-19. He isolated himself after finding out that a French parliamentarian, with whom he had been traveling to Brussels, was found with coronavirus. On 9 March, Chițac attended a party meeting with over 100 people. Parliamentary sources claim that he was also present in the Senate on 12 March, when he attended the group and plenary sessions. In these conditions, all members of the National Political Bureau of PNL self-isolated at home. Interim Prime-minister Ludovic Orban announced that all PNL senators have an obligation to isolate themselves and that he will self-isolate at Vila Lac 1. He also announced that all ministers will be tested for coronavirus and self-isolate. \c\cOn 14 March, after over 101 people had been diagnosed with coronavirus, Romania entered the third COVID-19 scenario. The third scenario goes from 101 to 2,000 cases. In the third scenario the doctors will perform epidemiological screening in the tents installed in the hospitals\' yards, and the hospitals of infectious diseases will treat only cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Likewise, the authorities will be able to impose quarantine at home, not just in hospitals, as in many areas the capacities of medical units could be exceeded. At the same time, according to the plan in the third scenario, public gatherings with more than 50 people are banned. Three more liberals have been diagnosed with COVID-19, all contacts of senator Vergil Chițac. Marcel Ciolacu, President of the Chamber of Deputies, announced that the Parliament will suspend its activity for a week. However, the activities will be carried out online. The same day, President Klaus Iohannis announced his decision to decree the state of emergency in Romania starting 16 March. \c\cOn 16 March, Iohannis issued the decree establishing the state of emergency in Romania for a period of 30 days and insisted that the implementation of the measures included in the decree is being made gradually. The schools will be closed during the state of emergency. If necessary, prices may be capped on medicines and medical equipment, on strictly necessary foods and on public utility services (electricity and heat, gas, water supply, sanitation, fuels, etc.). Also, gradual measures can be taken, if the situation gets worse, only after an evaluation of the National Committee for Special Emergency Situations. These include temporary closure of restaurants, hotels, cafes, clubs, gradual closure of borders, or limiting or prohibiting the movement of vehicles or people in/to certain areas. On 19 March, the Parliament convened a joint online session and unanimously adopted the decree issued by Iohannis. \c\cUntil 17 March, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitated the return to the country for 137 Romanians who were abroad, either as tourists, in transit, or in medical emergency situations and who were directly affected by the measures adopted by the states in which they were. Later that same day, the government issued its first Military Ordinance, in response to the ongoing health crisis. Four days later, on 21 March, a second Military Ordinance was issued: no groups larger than 3 people on the streets. Curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. All shopping centres were closed, except for the sale of food, veterinary or pharmaceutical products and cleaning services. It is forbidden for foreign citizens and stateless persons to enter Romanian territory, except through the specially organised transit corridor, further exceptions being made for other categories, such as residents, family members, and others. \c\cOn 22 March, the first three deaths were reported in Romania. All three had preexisting conditions: one was on dialysis, one had terminal lung cancer, and one had diabetes. The next day, on 23 March, Suceava's main hospital, the Saint John the New Emergency County Hospital of Suceava [ro], one of the largest in the country, reported at least seventy medical personnel infected with COVID-19, and 2 patients passing away. Over the following days, their numbers would increase. The hospital director was dismissed, shortly thereafter, for mismanagement. \c\cFollowing a surge in new confirmed cases, on 24 March, the government announced Military Ordinance No.3, instituting a national lockdown and calling in the military to support police and Gendarmerie personnel in enforcing the new restrictions. Movement outside the home or household is prohibited, with some exceptions (work, buying food or medicine etc.). People over 65 were allowed to leave their homes only between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Two days later, on 26 March, the state airline TAROM suspended all internal flights. \c\cA fourth Military Ordinance has been issued on 29 March, further strengthening previously imposed fines and restrictions. Two more would soon follow, issued close to the end of the next day; namely, a fifth, extending the ban on international travel, and a sixth, placing Suceava, along with eight adjacent communes, under total quarantine, the first Romanian city to be placed under complete lockdown since the start of the outbreak in late February, holding over a quarter of all infected cases, and about two-thirds of all infected medical personnel. Some hospital staff have quit, others have signed a petition stating they "are sent to death barehanded". \c\cOn 2 April, Harghita reported its first case, becoming the last county in Romania to report at least one case. \c\cOn 4 April, a seventh Military Ordinance was issued, further extending the national lockdown period, and imposing a second local quarantine on the town of Țăndărei, Ialomița County. On the same date, various counties and localities have started drafting local legislation requiring denizens to wear protection masks, whether professional or improvised. The next day, Raed Arafat posted an article on his official Facebook page, later picked up by the national media and other news outlets, encouraging citizens to wear protective masks, even if homemade. Prime minister Ludovic Orban, on the other hand, expressed doubts concerning not only the safety of homemade improvisations, but also about the necessary logistics for successfully implementing such a large scale operation, inasmuch as the demand would greatly outweigh the extant offer currently available on the market. \c\cOn 7 April, a 53-year-old paramedic from Suceava became the first reported casualty among Romanian medical personnel. As of 18 April, there were over a thousand infected medical staff in the country. \c\cOn 9 April, an eighth Military Ordinance came into effect, reinforcing previously adopted measures, prohibiting the export of certain basic foods, banning the commerce of majority share packages in the National Energetic System, recommending that residential buildings be equipped with sanitary products and that their stairways and elevators be periodically disinfected, and making provisions for various professional categories, such as fishing, apiculture, car service and dealership, the food market, pharmaceuticals, cross-border workers, social services, medical staff etc. A week later, on 16 April, a ninth Military Ordinance was issued. \c\cOn 21 April, over 300 new cases, representing two-thirds of the staff and patients of a local neuropsychiatric hospital, were reported in a village from Cornu Luncii commune in Suceava county, not belonging to those already placed under strict quarantine. On the previous day, Pimen Zainea, the Romanian Orthodox archbishop of Suceava, was flown into the Matei Balș Institute for Infectious Diseases in Bucharest, after testing positive for COVID-19, where he would pass away a month later. Saint John the New Monastery has been placed in lockdown, and an epidemiological investigation was initiated. \c\cOn 22 April, President Iohannis issued a press release, stating the government's intention to adopt, by mid-May, official legislation requiring citizens to wear surgical masks in public. That same day, Timișoara, Romania's third largest city, made the use of both facial masks and protection gloves mandatory in enclosed public spaces, including transportation. This decision came a week after Constanța, a major urban centre and one of the country's main tourist destinations, took similar measures on 15 April. \c\cOn 27 April, the tenth Military Ordinance came into effect. Except for work and medical emergency, people over 65 were only allowed to leave their homes between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. and between 7 p.m and 10 p.m. Two weeks later, on 11 May, an eleventh Military Ordinance lifted the Țăndărei quarantine. Two days later, a further Military Ordinance lifted the Suceava quarantine. On 14 May, a thirty-day state of alert was decreed, starting the following day, thus ending the stricter state of emergency, in force until that date. \c\cThe state of emergency ended on 14 May and was replaced by the state of alert, starting with 15 May, when the hairdressing salons, barbershops, dental offices and museums were reopened. Leaving the city of residence, possible only with a statement and reason and those who return to the country are isolated at home. The malls with an area under 15,000 sq m are reopened. \c\c250 thousand Romanians donated for the construction of the most modern modular coronavirus hospital. The hospital was ready in two weeks. \c\cArchbishop Theodosius of Thomis shared several children using the same teaspoon and the same chalice, defying the rules imposed by the authorities and the Holy Synod. \c\cNew sanctions from 1 July: suspension of the operating license for organizers of activities and events that do not comply with anti-COVID rules. \c\cImages with dozens of people singing and dancing, in Vama Veche, without taking into account the distance rules imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have appeared on social networks. The administrator of a club, fined 2,000 lei. \c\cTwo PSD deputies - Adrian Solomon and Irinel Stativa - refused to wear a mask in a fast food restaurant in sector 3 and quarreled with the police were fined and for not wearing a protective mask, according to the law on alert status . The announcement was made by the Capital Police, which states that in the meantime the images captured by the video cameras in the place were viewed. Parliamentarians were initially fined for causing a scandal. \c\cThe state of alert in Romania extended by 30 days, President Klaus Iohannis announced. He said no new restrictions would be imposed, but there would be no new easing measures. \c\cThe new restrictions that came into force on 1 August: The protective mask will be mandatory in open spaces, at certain time intervals, which will be set by the county authorities, and the premises with terrace will be open only until 23.00. Specifically, "the sale and consumption of food, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages in specially designated areas between 23.00 and 06.00 will be prohibited." The gambling halls will also be closed at the same time. \c\cThe National Committee for Emergency Situations has adopted Decision number 43 which provides for the reopening starting with 1 September 2020 of restaurants and cafes inside buildings, including in the case of accommodation units, the limitation at national level of the operation of terraces between 06.00- 24.00 and increasing the number of people who can participate in private events to 50 in an enclosed space, respectively 100 in an open space. However, the clubs and discos inside will remain closed. \c\cThe Ministry of Health has published the epidemiological analysis by counties and localities which shows the incidence rate of coronavirus infections per thousand inhabitants, essential data for the beginning of the new school year. The epidemiological criterion based on which the educational units / institutions establish one of the 3 scenarios is the cumulative incidence rate, respectively the total number of new cases in the last 14 days compared to 1000 inhabitants: Scenario 1 - green - school starts with the physical presence of all students - Incidence rate less than 1 per thousand inhabitants; Scenario 2 - yellow - hybrid scenario - Only students in grades VIII and XII will participate physically daily in classes, while the rest of the students will return partially (by rotation every 1-2 weeks). Incidence rate between 1 and 3 per thousand inhabitants; Scenario 3 - red - Online school only - Incidence rate higher than 3 per thousand inhabitants. \c\cThe resurgence in new infections, hospitalizations and deaths have resulted in imposing of new restrictions that took effect on 9 November. They included the closure of schools, a curfew between 23:00 and 5:00, the requirement of wearing face masks in both open and closed areas nationwide, and the closure of agri-food markets in closed areas. Remote working was encouraged where possible. Leaving the home or household during the curfew was prohibited, with some exceptions, while only gas stations, pharmacies, and economical operators with home delivery activities were allowed to operate after 21:00. \c\cThe Romanian authorities were criticized for not delaying the 2020 legislative elections past 6 December, as well as for the closure of agri-food markets and the lack of testing compared to other European countries. They\'ve defended their decisions by saying that "democracy cannot be put in parenthesis", that "agri-food markets in closed areas are super-spreaders", and that "there are no requests for testing". President Iohannis announced on 2 December that agri-food markets in closed areas would reopen beginning "the end of the current week (at the time of the issuing of the press release)". \c\cOn 27 December, at the same time as other member states of the European Union, in which Romania was a member of, the vaccination campaign had started, the process being divided into three phases. \c\cOn 28 December, the then-new Minister of Education, Sorin Cîmpeanu, announced the Ministry's intention to reopen schools starting 8 February, when the second semester would begin. This was conditioned by the evolution of the pandemic, if the number of new cases will surge after the Winter holidays or not, as well as by how other countries managed the situation. Until then, schools continued their activity online. \c\cThe first case with the more contagious British COVID-19 strain (Lineage B.1.1.7) was confirmed in Romania on 8 January, on a woman from Giurgiu County. She, however, did not travel outside Romania. It was followed by 16 other cases in an outbreak at the School No. 28 of Bucharest. \c\cOn 15 January, Romania entered the second phase of the process of vaccinating against COVID-19, when President Iohannis was vaccinated against the virus. \c\cOn 18 January, the National Committee for Emergency Situations had decided to exempt the people who have gotten the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at least 10 days prior to their arrival in Romania from countries considered high-risk. If the vaccinated person arrives in the country with their children, they would still have to remain in quarantine with them, because the vaccines that were authorized at the time cannot be administered on children. \c\cThe final decision on schools was made on 2 February. In a press release issued by President Klaus Iohannis on that day, he announced that schools will reopen on 8 February, based on local incidence rates, after a review of the epidemiological situation in Romania and of what other member states of the European Union do. Students would be tested for COVID-19 in school if it presents symptoms of the virus during courses, with the agreement of their parents. Cîmpeanu stated that the usage of transport services for school should not be a factor of transmission. \c\cOn 8 February, schools were reopened for the second time during the pandemic. Unlike in fall 2020, schoolwide restrictions based on the three scenarios were different. Thus, in the yellow scenario, unless the student attends primary education or is in a final year, every student attends courses exclusively online. Only primary school students would attend school physically in the red scenario. \c\cOn 10 February, prime minister Florin Cîțu announced that the incidence rate of COVID-19 cases would begin to include outbreaks in over 14 days from the announcement date, with the state of alert being prolonged with 30 more days. The following day, the first case among students who participate physically since 8 February was detected, on a girl in 2nd grade from Bucharest. Four other cases were detected at noon, which included one teacher, before the number of detected cases of infected students and school personnel began to surge throughout the day. In total, there were 244 students and 329 school personnel that were infected with COVID-19 since 8 February, all of which cases were, according to the Ministry of Education, based on infection in the week before the reopening of schools. In a press release on the same day, president Iohannis said that the situation is good after the reopening of schools. \c\cThe total number of infections in schools exceeded 1,000 by 17 February, when 600 students and 472 school personnel were reported to have been tested positive since the reopening. \c\cOn 18 February, MedLife announced that the Lineage B.1.1.7 strain had become the dominant variant in Romania's major cities and that it would most likely become the most frequent variant in the country in around 3-5 weeks. They\'ve analyzed 90 samples, and 50% of them contained the strain that originated from the United Kingdom. \c\cOn 24 February, the National Institute of Public Health had done an analysis on the evolution of the pandemic in Romania. They estimated a new resurgence in new infections, with the worst scenario being a rise by 4% in new cases, to a medium amount of almost 9,000 new infections per day by 20 March. The incidence rate of cases began including outbreaks from 26 February 2021, as announced earlier. \c\cOn 27 February, the Minister of Education Sorin Cîmpeanu proposed that students in the VIII and XII grades mandatorily go physically to school in localities in the red scenario, as they attend national exams during summer. The next day, the National Council of Students said it disapproves this idea due to the high-risk of infection in these localities and asked the Ministry to adopt a measure in which students/parents have the freedom to choose between physical and digital learning. \c\cThe third wave had become noticeable in statistics by 2 March. Experts say that the third wave would this time affect younger people more than adults. More counties and localities have entered the red scenario, in which several restrictive measures were taken, including closure of schools for students in the 8th and 12th grades, restaurants, cafes, gambling halls, cinemas and cultural institutions. \c\cOn 5 March, the first two cases of the South African variant, the Lineage B.1.351, were confirmed in Romania, in patients from Bucharest and Pitești respectively. The same day, the National Committee for Emergency Situations adopted Decision number 15 which modifies the common agreement between the Ministries of Health and Education on the functioning of schools during the pandemic, so that students in 8th and 12th grades are allowed to participate physically in school no matter what, unless the locality the school is located in is quarantined. A common agreement between the Ministries of Health and Education issued on the next day mentioned that only up to half of students of every class of 8th and 12th grades would physically attend school. In addition, face masks were no longer mandatory for during physical education (if in outdoor) and for preschoolers regardless of age. \c\cOn 8 March, the first two cases of the Brazilian variant were confirmed in Romania, both in Bucharest. \c\cOn 9 March, as the number of new cases in 24 hours was nearing 5,000, President Klaus Iohannis issued a press release, where he announced that the night curfew would begin an hour earlier, at 22:00 (10:00 pm). He also stated that there would never be a nationwide lockdown interfering with the Easter holidays of 2021 as a measure to curb the third wave of cases. \c\cOn 15 March, Romania entered the third phase of the process of vaccination against COVID-19. This is the final phase, in which the general population who meet the minimum eligibility age (16) would be vaccinated. \c\cOn 23 March, the Minister of Education Sorin Cîmpeanu announced the modification of the 2020-2021 school year structure so that students would be on holiday between 2 April and 4 May, to reduce mobility amid the third wave of infections. \c\cOn 25 March, the government announced a series of new restrictions. This included closure of gyms in localities where the incidence rate exceeded 4/1,000 inhabitants, while on Friday and at the weekend, the night curfew would begin at 20:00, with activity of economic operators allowed until 18:00. In localities where the incidence rate was over 7,5/1,000 inhabitants, imposed restrictions on Friday and the weekend would apply every day. The same day, Cîmpeanu announced that the school holiday would be interrupted between 12 and 29 April for students in their final years; all schools remained closed but remote learning would be enforced. In addition, the school holiday was set to end on 9 May for these students. \c\cThe fourth wave has been the most severe of all infection waves in the COVID-19 pandemic. Romania is the European Union member state with the second lowest percentage of fully-vaccinated people, after Bulgaria. Romania has been hitting record highs in the infections and deaths toll, occupying the 3rd place in new deaths and the 4th place in new infections worldwide on 13 October, and 2nd highest per capita COVID-19 death rate in the world as of 19 October 2021[update]. Roughly 13% of the 42,000 overall epidemic-related deaths have occurred in October, with the low vaccination rate exposing entrenched distrust in state institutions, misinformation campaigns, poor rural infrastructure and weak vaccine education. \c\cThe pressure on the Romanian healthcare system that reached its maximum capacity in the fourth wave led to the authorities asking the European Union for help through its Civil Protection Mechanism. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) was also concerned, with the fourth wave in Romania prompting them to have a teleconference with the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) on the matter in 18 October 2021. \c\cDespite the severity of this wave compared to others, the Romanian government had chosen to take a slightly more relaxed approach, unwilling to close the economy even partially in any way, shape or form. To avoid closures and radical restrictive measures, it had chosen to instead impose a digital green certificate requirement for some activities. Schools had been remaining open regardless of epidemiological situation, with Education Minister Sorin Cîmpeanu advocating strictly for the "close last, open first" strategy of school functioning. Schools would only close if at least half of its personnel and students were found infected, or at the directors\' request. The Public Health Directorate (DSP) of Ilfov, one of the most affected counties by the fourth wave with a incidence rate of over 15/1,000 on 13 October 2021, set school closures countywide for at least 14 days starting 18 October, a decision severely criticized by Cîmpeanu, who was accused shortly afterwards by parents of ignoring health authorities. In localities with incidence rate over 6/1,000, face masks have been required in outdoor areas, while a night curfew was imposed. Vaccinated people wouldn\'t be affected this time by the curfew, which would apply between 20:00 and 5:00, and the unvaccinated was required to stay home and not go out for unessential tasks. \c\cRomania received the first 10,000 vaccines against the virus on 26 December 2020 and officially started the vaccination campaign on Sunday, 27 December. The first person who took the vaccine was a nurse from the Matei Bals Institute for Infectious Diseases in Bucharest. She was soon followed by several hundred doctors and nurses from COVID-19 dedicated hospitals throughout the country. Romania has contracted about 10 million vaccines made by BioNTech-Pfizer. Vaccination is free of charge and non-mandatory. By the end of September 2021, Romania had the second lowest vaccination rate in the European Union, 33%. \c\cDuring the second week of March, the Bucharest Stock Exchange recorded losses on all five trading sessions, the main index BET collapsing by 17.6%, the steepest decline since December 2018. \c\cOn 16 March, the National Bank of Romania announced a reference rate of 4.8242 lei/euro, a historical maximum for the single European currency against the leu. The leu continued its depreciation, reaching a maximum of 4.9156 lei/euro on 30 March 2021. \c\cRomania's economy contracted by 4.7% in H1 of 2020, driven by a decline of 10.5% in Q2. On the demand side, exports of goods and services fell by 15.1% in H1 of 2020, as European trading partners were significantly affected by the crisis. Imports contracted less than exports (down 9.4%), leading to a 21% increase in the trade deficit in H1. The weakening of external demand from Europe alongside pandemic-related restrictions caused industry to contract by 14.1% in H1. The sharp decline in output led to deteriorating labor market conditions, with deeper effects noted for younger workers and women: job vacancies fell between Q1 and Q2 2020, while the unemployment rate increased to 5.4% in July from 4.1% in February. Job and household income losses were stemmed by the technical unemployment relief program, which covered 1.3 million beneficiaries during the state of emergency at a cost of approximately 370 million euros (0.2% of GDP). \c\cAccording to the autumn economic forecasts published on 5 November by the European Commission, Romania's economy would record a contraction of 5.2% in 2020, less severe than initially estimated, thanks to investments and construction works. Also, Romania's budget deficit was expected to increase significantly, up to 10.3% of GDP, in the context in which the fiscal effort needed to combat the crisis was added to the past fiscal slippages. Consequently, Romania's debt-to-GDP ratio was forecast to increase from 35.3% in 2019 to 46.7% in 2020. \c\cOn 9 March 2020, interim Prime Minister Ludovic Orban announced the closure of all schools between 11 and 22 March. The measure targeted all kindergartens, primary, secondary and high schools in Romania, both public and private, according to Education Minister Monica Anisie. The decision affected 3.5 million students. Likewise, several universities in the major student centres suspended their courses. These include the University of Bucharest, the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, the Politehnica University of Bucharest, the Babeș-Bolyai University and the West University of Timișoara, among others. Furthermore, Anisie announced that, as a measure of prevention and control of the illnesses with COVID-19 in schools, the Ministry of Education had decided to suspend all county and regional school olympiads, as well as sports competitions. Schools were closed suddenly, without any prior preparation. The Ministry of Education was constantly encouraging teachers to continue the educational process online, but they were not offered any support, on a national level. The Government made available a single resource on the national public television channel TVR, a show called Teleșcoală (Teleschool), in which children could observe mathematics, Romanian, biology, history and geography classes. The program was divided into two sections, between 9 and 10 a.m. courses for the 8th grade and between 3 and 4 p.m. courses for the 12th grade; the courses could be watched both on TV and on TVR's YouTube channel. In the first week of broadcasting, the program was watched by 1.3 million people, being the most watched TVR content between 16 and 21 March. \c\cOn 16 March, Anisie announced that schools would remain closed while the state of emergency was in place, at least until after the Easter holidays. \c\cOn 1 April, in response to a fake news story which had gained traction on social media and was being distributed on WhatsApp, saying that students would have to return to school in less than a week, Anisie and the Ministry of Education issued an official statement condemning the spread of false information and promised to provide in the next few days the date for the reopening of schools, as well as the national examinations. On 6 April, Anisie announced the cancellation of national exam simulations, as well as of all school competitions and olympiads. The Minister of Education said that the Baccalaureate and the National Evaluation would most likely be held in July, all of the examinations excluding the second semester curriculum. \c\cIn May, four months before the start of the new school year, the Government announced the purchase of 250,000 tablets to facilitate distance learning activities. For these tablets, the Government has allocated 150 million lei from the reserve fund, both for devices and internet services. Previously, Anisie stated that approximately 250,000 students do not have access to technology and thus cannot attend online courses. Of the 250,000 tablets, around 82,000 were purchased through the National Office for Centralized Acquisitions. As of November, just over 43,000 were distributed to students. \c\cA study conducted by World Vision Romania between 10 May and 27 June showed that approximately 40% of students in rural areas did not participate in online courses and only 64% of teachers organized such courses. Moreover, according to the same study, 1 in 4 rural schools does not have an internet connection, and 9 out of 10 do not have laptops, PCs or tablets for digital education. \c\cIn a government meeting on 5 November, President Klaus Iohannis announced a series of partial quarantine measures, including the closure of all schools nationwide and the transition to online education for the next 30 days. During this period, only nurseries and after-schools remained open. The president's announcement, later doubled by a government decision, sparked a wave of discontent. The National Council of Students announced in a statement that it disapproves of the measure, as many schools are located in communities where the transmission rate is less than 3 per thousand inhabitants and hundreds of thousands of students in Romania do not have the opportunity to access online courses due to lack of digital infrastructure. According to a survey by the National Federation of Parents\' Associations, about 47.2% of parents considered that the closure of schools was not a good one for the education system, while 45.2% of them considered this decision as a necessary one. \c\cOn 7 November, Anisie announced that students will no longer take their theses in the 2020–2021 school year, which will be replaced by a summative evaluation. \c\cSchools have been reopened nationwide on 8 February. Despite their autonomy in relation to education-related decisions, most universities did not resume regular, face-to-face, courses, mainly due to restrictions imposed to in-door group gatherings. However, as new cases have risen in the country, the structure of the 2020-2021 school year had been modified so the spring break starts in 2 April and ends in 4 May, however doesn\'t apply to students in terminal years, who would instead have to attend online courses between 12 and 29 April, with spring break ending in 9 May. \c\cSchools reopened, once again, on 5 and 10 May respectively (depending on grade), but with two scenarios rather than three. Schools in localities with an incidence rate below 1/1,000 inhabitants would be completely open, while in localities with an incidence rate above 1/1,000 inhabitants only pupils in primary and special education, as well as students in either the 8th, 12th or 13th grades, in terminal years of postliceal and vocational education, and those who attend recovery courses would go physically to school, unless the locality is quarantined. \c\cThe Romanian Football Federation and the Romanian Handball Federation decided to suspend all matches until 31 March. The rugby match between Romania and Belgium, to be held in Botoșani on 14 March, was postponed by Rugby Europe. The IWF Junior World Weightlifting Championships in Bucharest, scheduled for 14–21 March, were cancelled. \c\cThe Romanian tourism industry has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures that have been taken in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. Both hotels and travel agencies have seen massive decreases in bookings and cancellations of events. Since the beginning of March, the occupancy rate of hotels has decreased by 40% in Bucharest and by 50% in resorts. In the first nine months of the year, arrivals in tourist reception facilities decreased by 50.6%, overnight stays by 49.5%, and arrivals of foreign visitors decreased by 59%. \c\cTeleworking has been a necessary practice for many firms and workers during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 crisis. Due to the nature of the activity, only 7% of jobs in hospitality industry can plausibly be performed at home. As of 28 April, the Ministry of Labor reported 114,494 individual employment contracts suspended in the hotels and restaurants sector. \c\cThe government's response to COVID-19 raised human rights concerns including in relation to policing, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to education. \c\cOn 16 March 2020, President Iohannis signed an emergency decree, giving authorities the power to remove, report or close websites spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic, with no opportunity to appeal. On 30 March, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Harlem Désir, expressed his concerns about the provisions of the emergency decree, noting that they "pose a risk of undue restriction to the work of journalists, of self-censorship for media actors trying to inform the public, and could even be counterproductive". Previously, several civil society organizations issued a manifesto to request for greater transparency of data related to the spread of COVID-19 in Romania. \c\cOn 19 March, Romania activated Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which allows signatories to derogate from the convention in times of a "public emergency threatening the life of the nation". \c\cUntil 26 September 2021, the National Institute of Public Health reported 1,199,761 cases of COVID-19. Bucharest accumulates 17.2% of the total number of infections. It is followed by Cluj with 5.3%, Timiș with 5.1%, Ilfov with 4.2% and Constanța with 4%. 1 in 77 reported cases was recorded among medical staff. A study conducted by the Sanitary Solidarity Federation in October 2020 revealed that about 10% of respondents had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2. According to the same study, nurses have the largest share of all infected workers and have the highest percentage of infection among occupational categories. \c\cAs of 26 September 2021, there were 36,450 COVID-19-related deaths, with 9.1% of them reported in Bucharest, 4.5% in Prahova, 3.9% in Bihor, 3.8% in Timiș and 3.8% in Suceava. 85.8% of all deaths were in people over 60, and 57.7% of deaths were in men. 94.5% of the deceased had at least one associated comorbidity. A November 2020 study by the National Institute of Public Health on data from the records of 21,766 patients indicated that the main risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19 in Romania are cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases and cancer. \c\cAs of 14 March 2021, the average age of cases is 48 years. The average age of deaths is significantly higher, at 71 years.
The COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). \c\cOn 5 March 2020, Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize had confirmed the spread of the virus to South Africa, with the first known patient being a male citizen who tested positive upon his return from Italy. On 15 March 2020, the President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, declared a national state of disaster, and announced measures such as immediate travel restrictions and the closure of schools from 18 March. On 17 March, the National Coronavirus Command Council was established, "to lead the nation's plan to contain the spread and mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus". On 23 March, a national lockdown was announced, starting on 27 March 2020. The first local death from the disease was reported on 27 March 2020. On 21 April, a 500 billion rand stimulus was announced in response to the pandemic. Ramaphosa announced that from 1 May 2020, a gradual and phased easing of the lockdown restrictions would begin, lowering the national alert level to 4. From 1 June, the national restrictions were lowered to level 3. The restrictions were lowered to alert level 2 on 17 August 2020. From 21 September 2020, restrictions were lowered to alert level 1. \c\cIn December 2020, the country experienced a second wave of COVID-19 infections. The lockdown was tightened from an adjusted level 1 to an adjusted level 3 starting on 29 December 2020. The lockdown was lowered from an adjusted level 3 to an adjusted level 1 starting on 1 March 2021. On 17 February 2021, the national COVID-19 vaccination program was officially rolled out. \c\cOn 8 May 2021, local cases of variants of concern Delta (first detected in India, which has a higher transmissibility than the dominant strain, Beta) and Alpha were reported. On 31 May 2021 the country was moved from adjusted level 1 to an adjusted alert level 2, due to a third wave of infections. On 15 June 2021 the country was moved to alert level 3. On 28 June 2021, the country was moved to adjusted level 4, with the Delta variant fast becoming the dominant strain in the country. On 9 July 2021, sixteen months into the pandemic, doctors in Johannesburg described the system there as beyond its breaking point, with insufficient beds and barely enough oxygen. On 25 July 2021 the country was lowered to adjusted level 3. On 13 September 2021 an adjusted alert level 2 took effect, and on 1 October 2021 more restrictions were eased by moving to adjusted alert level 1. \c\cOn 26 November 2021 the World Health Organization (WHO) classified the Omicron variant, first identified in Botswana but first reported to WHO by South Africa, as a variant of concern. Several countries announced travel bans from South Africa and its neighboring countries. \c\cAs of 4 December 2021[update] there have been 275976 excess deaths of persons older than 1 years from natural causes since 3 May 2020, with 85–95% of these excess deaths attributable to COVID-19, and the remaining 5–15% probably mainly due to overwhelmed health services. \c\cOn 1 March 2020, the first patient later confirmed with COVID-19 in South Africa, returned with his wife and 8 others from the Milan, Italy, travelling via Dubai, O. R. Tambo International Airport in Kempton Park, Gauteng and King Shaka International Airport in Durban to Hilton. On 3 March, the patient reported with symptoms to a private general practitioner and isolated himself; the doctor isolated herself as well. On 5 March the Minister of Health, Zweli Mkhize, announced the first confirmed case, epidemiologists and clinicians from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) were deployed to KwaZulu-Natal in response and the patient went to Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. \c\cOn 7 March, it was announced that a woman from the same travel group from Italy, returning to Gauteng, also tested positive. \c\cOn 11 March 6 new cases were reported, with 1 case from the same travel group from Italy, while the other 5 cases appear unrelated having travel histories to other European countries. The first case was confirmed in the Western Cape province. 3 new cases were announced on 12 March, including the first case in Mpumalanga province. The first local transmission and first case in the Free State province was also announced, but withdrawn later in the day by the NICD who confirmed that the case's test result was in fact negative. This brought the total cases to 16. \c\cOn 15 March, the first local transmissions, not yet confirmed by government labs, were announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa.}} and the following day, the first confirmed case from Limpopo province was announced. The day thereafter, on 17 March, the first confirmed cases of local transmission were announced by government labs, 4 in Gauteng, 3 in KwaZulu-Natal, and 1 in the Western Cape. On the next day, 18 March, the first confirmed case of local transmission in Mpumalanga was announced by government labs. \c\cOn 19 March, the Health Minister suggested that two-thirds of the South African population could contract the virus, a prediction in line with Europe's estimates on population infection. \c\cOn 20 March, the Free State province recorded seven cases, becoming the sixth of South Africa's nine provinces to be infected. Of the seven cases, five were from abroad (Israel, France and Texas) who had congregated in Bloemfontein for a prayer breakfast attended by 859 people. The Eastern Cape reported its first case one day later. \c\cO. R. Tambo International Airport instituted isolation of foreigners on arrival and returning them to their countries of origin. \c\cFollowing a funeral on 21 March in KwaDwesi attended by 1200 mourners, at least 45 persons (31 women and 14 men) contracted COVID-19 and at least one person died. \c\cOn 23 March, a national 21-day lockdown was announced by President Ramaphosa to begin on 27 March to 16 April. By 24 March all nine provinces had confirmed cases, with the first cases in the Northern Cape and North West announced. The country's first death was announced on 27 March. \c\cThere were 1,353 confirmed cases in March. Five patients died and 31 recovered, while 1,317 remained active cases at the end of the month. \c\cOn 1 April, researchers from the NICD and South African National Bioinformatics Institute at the University of Western Cape released the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 from a South African COVID-19 patient. Pick-up trucks dispensed free hand sanitizer in Alexandra in early April. \c\cFollowing a funeral in Zwide on 4 April, at least nine mourners contracted COVID-19. \c\cOn 9 April, it was announced that South Africa's cabinet members, which include the President, Deputy President, Ministers and Deputy Ministers would donate one-third of their salaries for three months to a solidarity fund. \c\cOn 9 April, the St Augustine's Hospital in Durban was shut down following a localised outbreak of over 60 confirmed cases and four COVID-19 related deaths; by then 1,845 had tested positive for the virus nationally with total 18 deaths. \c\cOn 10 April, Mkhize recommended that the general public use cloth facemasks when going out in public. \c\cOn 13 April, chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on COVID-19 Salim Abdool Karim indicated that the lockdown had been effective in delaying transmissions. He also described the country's 8-stage plan to combat the coronavirus. This included criteria for extending or easing the lockdown. \c\cBy 23 April, when President Ramaphosa again addressed the nation the total number of cases had increased to 3953. Detailed figures released by the NICD showed that in April that the number of cases had taken distinct trajectories in different provinces. In the two weeks from 9 to 23 April, the cases in the coastal provinces had a very high increase – Eastern Cape cases rose 583% from a low base, KwaZulu-Natal rose 108% and Western Cape 148%. North West (67%) and Gauteng (57%) had high increases, while the other provinces had much lower increases from 6% in the Northern Cape to 23% in Limpopo (all with low absolute numbers – 106 in the Free State and under 30 in each of the other provinces). \c\cAs of 27 April 2020 23:59, the median age of laboratory-confirmed cases was 38 years (interquartile range 29–51 years), and children aged <10 years accounted for 3% (156/4996). \c\cOn 30 April 2020, Ramaphosa received a consignment of personal protective equipment (PPE) donated by global internet group Naspers on 30 April. There were 4,294 new cases in April, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 5,647. The death toll rose to 103. The number of recovered patients increased to 2,073, leaving 3,471 active cases at the end of the month. \c\cOn 19 May 2020, scientists advising the government estimated 475 confirmed COVID-19 deaths by the end of that month, and more than forty-thousand deaths by November. They also estimated that there could be insufficient ICU beds by June or July. The scientists stated that these estimates were subject to deviations and were based on simple and pessimistic assumptions. By the end of the month, there had been 683 deaths, with 27,036 new cases and 16,809 recoveries. \c\cTesting of 330 pupils and staff at Makaula Senior Secondary School in KwaBhaca resulted in 204 positive tests. \c\cIn June, there were 118,526 new cases, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 151,209. The death toll rose to 2,657. The number of recovered patients increased by 56,734 to 73,543. At the end of the month there were 75,009 active cases. \c\cAs of 3 July 2020, the median age of those who had died was 61 years and males had a 1.5 times greater death rate compared to females. \c\cOn 12 July, in an address to the nation, President Ramaphosa announced that the anticipated surge in COVID-19 cases had arrived. The state of disaster was extended until 15 August 2020 and the alcohol ban was reintroduced along with a new curfew from 21:00 until 4:00. Resumption of alcohol sale and distribution had led to increased pressure on hospitals from road traffic accidents, trauma and violence which happened mostly at night. \c\cOn 22 July, the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) and the University of Cape Town's Centre for Actuarial Research estimated that 17,090 excess natural deaths had taken place between 6 May and 14 July 2020 in South Africa. These represented, by the second week of July, a 59% increase in natural deaths compared to the same time period in previous years 11,175 (65%) of these excess estimated natural deaths were in those above age 60 years. Excess natural deaths were COVID-19 related either directly or indirectly through delayed diagnosis and treatment of other conditions. Unnatural deaths, from car accidents and murders, were 20% lower than expected. \c\cOn 23 July, President Ramaphosa announced the re-closure of all public schools for four-weeks from 27 July to 24 August 2020 and the extension of the academic year into 2021. \c\cIn July, there were 341,974 new cases, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 493,183.

The number of recovered patients increased to 606,520, leaving 49,655 active cases at the end of the month. \c\cOn 18 October, Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize announced that he had tested positive for the COVID-19. \c\cThe national state of disaster was extended by another month. \c\cFor two consecutive weeks, excess natural deaths were above the normal expected rate. These excess deaths were far below the July excess death peak. \c\cThere were 52,880 new cases in October, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 725,452. The death toll rose to 19,276. The number of recovered patients increased to 654,182, leaving 51,994 active cases at the end of the month. \c\cOn 11 November, President Ramaphosa addressed the nation where he announced extension of the state of disaster by another month until 15 December 2020. Relaxation of international travel, shop trading hours restrictions along with continued COVID unemployment support were announced. There were 64,552 new cases in November, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 790,004. The death toll rose to 21,535. The number of recovered patients increased to 731,242, leaving 37,227 active cases at the end of the month. \c\cOn 3 December, the President addressed the nation. He noted a resurgence of COVID-19 in some districts of the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality was identified as a coronavirus hotspot; restrictions were tightened for this area. The national state of disaster was extended until 15 January 2021. \c\cOn 7 December, the government said that end-of-school parties known as "rage parties" are super spreader events. \c\cOn 9 December, the Minister of Health announced that the country had entered the second wave of infections. The country was now recording over 6000 cases per day from fewer than 1000 cases per day at the end of September. The average proportion of positive COVID-19 tests had risen from 10% to 18%. \c\cOn 14 December, the President announced in an address to the nation, the closure of some beaches, lowering of the number of people that can attend gatherings and the tightening of other measures to curb the second wave. \c\cOn 18 December, Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize said scientists had discovered a new variant of coronavirus, called 501.V2 Variant. \c\cOn 27 December, the number of confirmed cases reached 1 million. \c\cOn 28 December 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation again and announced that the country would go back into a partial lockdown level 3 for 14 days to reduce the speed of the second wave during the festive season. This introduced a curfew from 9 pm to 6 am, the ban on sale and transport of alcohol, closure of public amenities like beaches, lakes and dams and the compulsory wearing of masks in public. \c\cThere were 267,157 new cases in December, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 1,057,161. The death toll rose to 28,469. The number of recovered patients increased to 879,671, leaving 149,021 active cases at the end of the month. \c\cA vaccine rollout strategy was announced on 3 January 2021, with doses for 10% of the population already secured and more on the way. During the first phase, frontline healthcare workers would be vaccinated. \c\cOn 11 January, President Ramaphosa addressed the nation. He announced the continuation of current pandemic alleviation measures, vaccine rollout developments and the extension of the state of disaster\c\cOn 13 January the government said it had arrested 7,000 people since the end of December for not wearing face masks. \c\cIn the week ending 17 January 130,000 new cases and 4,000 deaths cause public and private hospitals to be overrun. The 501.V2 variant has been found in all nine provinces as well as in foreign countries, but experts are unsure if the rise in cases is related to the new variant or to a lack of compliance with health guidelines during the holiday period. Several countries have banned flights from South Africa, and all 20 of the country's land entry points have been closed until February. South Africa lost 2.2 million jobs in the second quarter of 2020, and GDP is expected to show a 6.1% decrease for the year. In total, South Africa has registered more than 1.3 million coronavirus confirmed infections and at least 36,851 related deaths. \c\cOn 27 January the Department of Health announced the emergency use approval of the AstraZeneca Vaccine and that the transportation of one million doses would be delivered from India on 1 February with a further half a million doses in late February. They also announced a full vaccination plan as well as a platform to manage the mass vaccination of the country. \c\cThere were 396,600 new cases in January, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 1,453,761. The death toll rose to 44,164. The number of recovered patients increased to 1,299,620, leaving 109,977 active cases at the end of the month. \c\cOn 1 February, President Ramaphosa announced the arrival at O. R. Tambo International Airport of the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines produced by the Serum Institute of India. Although South Africa would remain at alert level 3, easing of restrictions effective the next day was announced because the peak of the second wave had passed. In his address to the nation, Ramaphosa also mentioned that the South African Cabinet had approved the proposal to nominate the Cuban Medical Brigade for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for its role in sending over 3 700 members around the world to help fight COVID-19. \c\cOn 7 February, it was announced that the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine did not work well in protecting clinical trial participants from mild or moderate illness caused by the 501.V2 variant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known as B.1.351 lineage. The vaccination programme was announced to be put on hold. \c\cOn 17 February, the national COVID vaccination program was officially rolled out, beginning at Khayelitsha District Hospital in the Western Cape Province where healthcare workers, the President and Minister of Health were given shots of the Janssen vaccine. \c\cOn 28 February, The President addressed the nation, announcing relaxation of restrictions with a move from adjusted alert level 3 to adjusted alert level 1. \c\cThere were 59,632 new cases in February, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 1,513,393. The death toll rose to 49,993. The number of recovered patients increased to 1,430,259, leaving 33,141 active cases at the end of the month. \c\cOn 5 March 2021, the number of people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 surpassed 100,000 in the country. \c\cThe South African Medical Research Council estimated more than 150 000 excess deaths during the pandemic by 20 March 2021, with 85–95% of these excess natural deaths attributable to COVID-19, and the remaining 5–15% probably mainly due to overwhelming of the health services. \c\cOn 30 March 2021, President Ramaphosa, addressed the nation ahead of the Easter Holiday. He gave information on COVID-19 vaccination progress, announced temporary restrictions on offsite holiday alcohol sales and the easing of measures around religious gatherings. \c\cThere were 34,764 new cases in March, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 1,548,157. The death toll rose to 52,846. The number of recovered patients increased to 1,474,319, leaving 20,992 active cases at the end of the month. \c\cOn 13 April 2021, Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize announced the suspension of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) use following health concerns raised by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \c\cOn 28 April 2021, the Janssen vaccines suspension was lifted, and given the full approval for use by SAPRAH. \c\cThere were 33,053 new cases in April, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 1,581,210. The death toll rose to 54,350. The number of recovered patients increased to 1,505,620, leaving 21,240 active cases at the end of the month. \c\cBy 1 May there were 157542 excess deaths of persons older than 1 years from natural causes since the start of the pandemic, with 85–95% of these excess deaths attributable to COVID-19, and the remaining 5–15% probably mainly due to overwhelming of the health services. \c\cOn 8 May, The National Institute for Communicable Diseases confirmed that they had sequenced COVID-19 specimens from individuals who had recently travelled to India. This resulted in that four of the specimens tested positive for B.1.617.2 (two cases from Gauteng and two from KwaZulu-Natal). Eleven cases were also detected of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern, which has a higher transmissibility and is more lethal than South Africa's dominant B.1.351. \c\cOn 30 May, President Ramaphosa, due to a surge in COVID-19 infections, addressed the nation announcing the tightening of restrictions from adjusted level lockdown 1 to 2, beginning on 31 May 2021. The third COVID-19 wave had taken hold. \c\cOn 15 June 2021 President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the country was moved to alert level 3 due to the third wave. \c\cOn 27 June 2021, in a national address, the President announced the tightening of restrictions with a move to adjusted level 4 beginning on 28 June 2021. \c\cOn the 11th, the President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation. He announced the continuation of adjusted level 4 restrictions, with some modifications to better tackle the third wave. \c\cOn the 12th, the president announced that because of the 2021 South African unrest some COVID-19 vaccination sites and clinics had been closed in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. \c\cOn the 25th the president announced moving the country to adjusted level 3 restrictions. \c\cThe highly mutated C.1.2 lineage variant, first detected in May, is reported to be of potential interest. \c\cOn 12 September 2021, the President announced the lowering of restrictions to adjusted alert level 2 taking effect on 13 September. \c\cOn 1 October 2021 more restrictions were eased by moving to adjusted alert level 1. \c\cOn 25 November 2021, a new heavily mutated coronavirus variant, B.1.1.529, later called Omicron, was announced. \c\cSeveral countries announced travel bans from South Africa, including:\c\cAustralia,\c\cCanada,\c\cFrance,\c\cGermany,\c\cHungary,\c\cIndonesia,\c\cItaly,\c\cMalaysia,\c\cMauritius,\c\cSingapore,\c\cSouth Korea,\c\cSri Lanka,\c\cThailand,\c\cthe United Kingdom,\c\cand the United States. \c\cCountries that banned entry to all foreign travelers include \c\cIsrael,\c\cJapan, and \c\cMorocco (also banning Moroccan citizens). \c\cOn 28 November 2021, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation. He stated that there would be no immediate change in the country's coronavirus alert level because of the recently discovered Omicron variant. He also asked countries that had imposed travel bans on South Africa and its Sister countries to reverse their decision. \c\cOn 8 December, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) reported nearly 20,000 new COVID-19 cases - a record since the Omicron variant was detected. It was not immediately clear how many of the infections were caused by Omicron. \c\cOn 12 December, President Ramaphosa tested positive for COVID-19. \c\cAfter the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, an emergency operation centre was immediately activated. \c\cThe National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) started testing people in South Africa for SARS-CoV-2 on 28 January 2020, and by 7 February had conducted 42 such tests. \c\cBy mid-March, state hospitals were offering free COVID-19 testing. \c\cOn 30 March 2020, the government announced its intentions of initiating an enhanced screening and testing programme. On 3 April 2020, the NICD made alterations to its testing guidelines to further allow for anyone who presented with relevant COVID-19 symptoms to be tested (previously there were additional requirements such as history of foreign travel or recent contact with a confirmed case). \c\cBy the start of April, 67 mobile testing units had been established and 47000 people had been tested, some in drive-through facilities. \c\cOn 8 April, the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) detailed its testing capacity through the country. The NHLS would be able to perform approximately 36000 tests per day. \c\cMany private clinical pathology laboratories were also conducting tests. The CEO of the NHLS, Dr Kamy Chetty, said that by 9 April 2020 the majority of tests had been done in the private sector as the initial cases had been linked to international travellers who were likely to be on private medical aids. \c\cBy 9 April 2020, South Africa had conducted 68874 tests at 1.2 tests per thousand, considerably lower than for example Turkey (3.3), the United Kingdom (3.6), and South Korea (9.7). However, the ratio of positive tests to total tests conducted was significantly lower than most countries. By 10 April, the number of tests had increased to 73028, making the average number of tests per day in the first 10 days of April roughly 3300. The chair of the board of the NHLS, Eric Buch, stated that it had a capacity of 15000 tests per day and would welcome doing more tests. \c\cOn 14 April, Stavros Nicolaou, head of Business for South Africa's healthcare working group and Aspen Pharmacare executive, said that South Africa had the capacity and kits to do 25000 tests a day. \c\cBy 23 April the total number of tests was 143570. The number of daily tests increased: for the first 14 days of April the daily average number of tests was 3394; for the next 9 days the daily average was 6283. The rate of positive tests versus total tests remained less than 3%. The Minister of Health released figures that showed that of all the tests done up to 23 April 62% had been done in the private sector and 38% in the public sector. However, that ratio was changing as the public sector increased capacity. The public sector performed 63% of the new tests reported on 23 April 2020. \c\cBy 27 April, 185497 tests had been performed on South African residents, with the public sector doing the majority of the tests. Provincial test coverage varied by over a factor of 8. The number of tests per 100000 residents (based on 2019 population estimates) was Northwest 66, Limpopo 69, Mpumalanga 101, Northern Cape 111, Eastern Cape 247, KwaZulu-Natal 270, Free State 284, Gauteng 439, and Western Cape 541 (national average 317). A surveillance programme was started to monitor community transmission (as opposed to tests done on people who displayed symptoms or who had been in contact with COVID-19 patients). In the three arms of the programme 812 tests had been done and two positive cases had been detected. \c\cBy 28 June, the total number of tests was 1567084. The private sector had now overtaken the public sector, in terms of tests completed. The private sector had done 804248 test with the public sector only doing 762836. \c\cBy 11 July, 2108570 had been done with the private sector still doing the most tests. \c\cOn 17 March 2020, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority announced that it would expedite review of treatments, vaccines and clinical trials. \c\cA team from 8 universities and 14 hospitals led by Helen Rees and Jeremy Nel from the University of the Witwatersrand participated in the World Health Organization Solidarity Clinical Trials that investigated medications. \c\cBy mid-March, isolation measures gathered pace, and on 15 March 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster, prohibiting gatherings of more than 100 people. \c\cOn 17 March, Ramaphosa, supported by Deputy President David Mabuza, convened the inaugural meeting of the National Command Council on COVID-19, or as it was subsequently called, the National Coronavirus Command Council, "to lead the nation’s plan to contain the spread and mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus". \c\cOn 18 March, Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma signed a government gazette limiting the number of patrons at pubs, clubs, and restaurants to 50. \c\cParliament suspended all activities as of 18 March. and the African National Congress (ANC) and Democratic Alliance (DA) postponed their elective conferences. \c\cThe Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) cancelled all scheduled cases from 18 March 2020 and prohibited walk-in referrals of new cases – in lieu of electronic referrals. \c\cSchools were closed on 18 March 2020, resuming in early June. Most universities suspended classes around this time as well. \c\cUniversity of Pretoria, University of Cape Town, Stellenbosch University, Rhodes University, University of KwaZulu-Natal and Durban University of Technology graduation ceremonies were cancelled or postponed until further notice. \c\cAfter panic buying, some retailers put limitations on the number of certain items customers could buy. On 19 March, Minister of Trade and Industry Ebrahim Patel signed a government gazette that enforces price controls on essential items and that could see price gougers punished with measures including a R10 million fine, a fine equivalent to 10% of a firm's turnover, or 12 months in prison. \c\cOn 3 June, Minister Dlamini-Zuma extended the state of disaster, which was to lapse on 15 June, three months after its announcement, to 4 July citing "the need to continue augmenting the existing mitigation measures undertaken by organs of state to address the impact of the disaster."\c\cDuring the announcement on the lifting of level 5 lockdown measures on 23 April, Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the sale of tobacco would be permitted again, this statement was contradicted on 29 April by Minister Dlamini-Zuma. The resulting uncertainty over tobacco sales during level 4 lockdown caused British American Tobacco to file an urgent court appeal which was dropped on 6 May and reopened by 29 May. The ban raised concerns by the Human Sciences Research Council and South African Revenue Service that it would encourage the growth of illicit tobacco sales thereby growing the power and influence of organised crime. The ANC Women's League defended Dlamini-Zuma's statement amid accusations that she was receiving financial support from illicit tobacco traders. By 4 May, Ramaphosa confirmed the continuation of the ban during level 4. The Democratic Alliance accused Dlamini-Zuma of lying to the public over the strength of support for the tobacco ban and called for her removal from office. On 11 December The Western Cape High Court ruled that the tobacco sales ban was unconstitutional. \c\cDuring the level 5 lockdown period, the sale of alcohol was banned; so as to reduce pressure from alcohol-related incidents putting additional pressure on hospitals. The ban was controversially reimposed on 12 July amid concerns that the ban was leading to the growth of illicit alcohol sales. \c\cThe uncertainties around the length of the lockdown, its intensity, and concerns over the erosion of civil liberties has drawn criticism from a number of notable individuals and political parties in South Africa. Former finance minister and senior ANC member Trevor Manuel questioned the rationality of the way in which government implemented the lockdown whilst expressing concern that the lockdown endangered the South African Constitution. The DA challenged the use of the military to enforce night curfews, criticised the ban on e-commerce and restrictions on exercise hours, and filed a court challenge over the constitutionality of the lack of parliamentary oversight in the National Disaster Management Act. The Freedom Front Plus filed an application to the Gauteng High Court challenging the constitutional validity of the National Disaster Management Act. The Economic Freedom Fighters criticised the relaxation of some of the May 2020 lockdown regulations as an example of giving into industry pressure by allowing them to reopen. \c\cThe number of passengers ferried per trip in minibus taxis was criticised during the lockdown restrictions, in July 2020. The Colleges of Medicine of South Africa stated that allowing minibus taxis to operate at 100 percent occupancy, for short journeys, was a possible danger to public health and contradicted some lockdown restrictions. Initially in the first stage of the lockdown period minibus taxis were required to operate at 70 percent occupancy, provided passengers wore masks and windows were opened. This 70% occupancy requirement was noted as being flouted by taxi operators. \c\cOn 14 March 2020, 112 South Africans were repatriated from Wuhan, China, and placed under observation and in quarantine at The Ranch Resort near Polokwane. \c\cMedical screening was performed prior to departure, four South Africans who were showing signs of coronavirus were left behind to mitigate risk. Only South Africans who tested negative were repatriated. \c\cTest results cleared all the South Africans, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who, as a precautionary measure, all remained under observation and in quarantine for a 14-day period at The Ranch Resort. \c\cOn 27 April 217 Cuban medical health specialists (mostly doctors) arrived in South Africa to assist with the pandemic response at the invitation of the South African government and were deployed across the country. \c\cTheir arrival and the reported R429 million cost paid to the Cuban government was controversial. The South African Medical Association stated that their deployment was premature as many South African doctors and nurses had not yet been deployed as part of the pandemic response. The South African Internationally Trained Health Professionals Association criticised the government for not instead using unemployed South African medical graduates. The Democratic Alliance stated that government should first prioritise using local healthcare professionals. The Daily Maverick questioned the high cost paid for the doctors. The United States government criticised their deployment and payments made for their services as a form of human trafficking whilst the Cuban embassy rejected allegations of profiting from the deployment of its doctors and stated that criticism was part of a "smear campaign". \c\cSouth Africa received donation of personal protective equipment like medical masks from China and ventilators from the United States. \c\cOn 5 August 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) deployed a "surge team" made up of 43 experts including David Heymann, who headed the international response to the 2003 SARS epidemic, to help the national and provincial responses to minimize the spread and impact of COVID-19. \c\cOn 8 August 2020, the department of health released a COVID-19 contact tracing app. The app aims to reduce infections in the second and third waves of Covid. the app is available on Google Play, the App Store and The Huawei App Galley. \c\cAt the beginning of the national shutdown on 27 March South African economists predicted that the pandemic could cause a 2.5% to 10% contraction of South Africa's total GDP in 2020. The national lockdown and resulting economic slowdown reduced demand for electricity by more than 7500 MW thereby temporarily reducing the impact of the long running South African energy crisis. It is estimated that the government would experience a revenue shortfall for 2020 of between R70 and 100 billion. This resulted in the South African government announcing a R500 billion stimulus package thereby accelerating deficit spending from 6.8% to over 10% of GDP for the 2020 financial year. In late July it was announced that South Africa would be taking out a R70 billion IMF loan increasing the country's total debt to GDP ratio to 83%. Trade unions and the EFF were critical of using the IMF to take out the loan whilst the DA and other opposition political parties voiced concern over corruption when using the borrowed funds. \c\cThe Johannesburg Stock Exchange lost 15% of its value in the week ending 13 March 2020, its worst week in 21 years. On 19 March, the South African Reserve Bank governor, Lesetja Kganyago announced a reduction of the country's repo rate by 100 basis points or 1 percentage point to 5.25%. On 14 April, a further reduction to 4.25% per year was made. On 22 March, Standard Bank announced a 90-day payment holiday for small and medium-sized business and students to try and shield them from the economic impact of the outbreak, starting from 1 April. In May it was estimated that the state will lose R285-billion in tax revenue for the financial year 2020/21 due to the pandemic and resulting lockdown. \c\cWithin the first month of the lockdown three million South Africans had lost their jobs contributing to an increase in food insecurity and poverty. By mid-July wide spread food shortages were reported across the country and in rural Eastern Cape in particular. In December 2020 it was reported by Finfind and the Department of Small Business Development that 42.7% of small businesses in South Africa had closed due to the economic impact of the lockdown. \c\cFinancial services company Transaction Capital predicted that the protracted years-long lockdown that the ANC government implemented in response to the pandemic would cause 34% of households in South Africa to fall out of the middle class. \c\cCorruption has had a significant negative impact on efforts to fight the pandemic by inflating the costs of government procurement whilst eroding public confidence in government institutions. Years of corruption prior to the pandemic has reduced the capacity of the country's health service. Incidents of police corruption also increased during the lockdown period as security officials used their expanded positions of power to extort bribes from members of the public. Concerns were raised that funds from a COVID-19-related R70 billion IMF loan to South Africa would be lost through corruption. On 7 August President Ramaphosa announced that ministerial committee would be set up to investigate COVID-19 corruption in state tenders. \c\cSicuro Safety and Hennox Supplies were fined after admitting to inflating its prices of face masks by 900%. A company supplying the Gauteng government was found to be charging double the price for sanitiser and four times the normal price of surgical face masks. Officials in the Kwazulu-Natal government were suspended for making "massively overpriced" purchases of PPE and blankets. In late July President Ramaphosa announced that measures would be implemented to combat corruption in the delivery of food parcels and the procurement of exorbitantly priced goods. The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) stated that it was investigating a number of suspicious transactions and alleged acts of corruption from the R500 billion COVID-19 Relief Fund. A number of government officials implicated in allegations of COVID-19-related corruption include Ace Magashule, the wife of Bandile Masuku, and the husband of presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko. Magashule, Diko and Masuku have denied any involvement in COVID-19 related procurement corruption allegations. \c\cAn investigation into COVID related fraud at the City of Johannesburg found that over 1,500 employees of the City improperly received COVID-19 related social relief and grants. \c\cMajor sporting codes suspended their activities, including Super Rugby, 2019-20 Pro14 season, Varsity Rugby, Craven Week, Premier Soccer League, Athletics South Africa, Sunshine Tour golf, Wimpy Lifesaving South Africa national championships and Parkrun. The Cape Epic cycle tour, the 2020 Two Oceans Marathon and the 2020 Comrades Marathon were cancelled. The 2020 Cape Town Rugby Sevens, 4–6 December 2020, were cancelled. \c\cLive events cancelled or postponed included the Mangaung African Cultural Festival (MACUFE), Bloem Show, AfrikaBurn, Cape Town International Jazz Festival, Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees, Splashy Fen Festival, Rand Show, National Arts Festival (changing to virtual), SciFest Africa (postponed to 9–15 September), WWE Live South Africa (postponed until September), Comic Con Cape Town, and Matric Rage festivals in\c\cJohannesburg, Jeffreys Bay and Plettenberg Bay. South African tours were postponed by the Lighthouse Family, Boyz II Men and BeBe Winans. \c\cTrade and agricultural shows postponed or cancelled included HuntEx, DecorEx Cape Town & Durban, Tyrexpo (postponed to 4–6 August 2020), Power & Electricity World expo (postponed until 20–21 August), the Pietermaritzburg Royal Show, SA Cheese Festival, Qualité Awards Dinner, and Agri-Expo Western Cape Youth Show. \c\cThe Zion Christian Church cancelled its annual Easter pilgrimage. The Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) suspended Friday prayers, then closed mosques altogether on Sunday 22 March, but the call to prayer will still be given. \c\cChief Rabbi Warren Goldstein suspended Synagogues. \c\cTraditional circumcision schools in the Eastern Cape were suspended. \c\cThe City of Johannesburg closed all public facilities indefinitely including public swimming pools, recreational and civic centres, stadiums, libraries, sporting facilities, and the Johannesburg Zoo. The Ethekhwini Metropolitan Municipality closed all of Durban's public facilities including swimming pools, beaches, libraries, community halls, and museums while restrictions have been put in place for the Durban Art Gallery and cemeteries to only allow 50 people at a time. The City of Cape Town closed all public facilities indefinitely including public swimming pools, recreational and civic centres, stadiums, sporting facilities, and the nature reserves. \c\cThe 2021 Women's FIH Hockey Junior World Cup because of a new COVID-19 variant, the tournament was put on hold on 26 November 2021 and a decision will be made by the FIH in the near future. Ballito Rage 2021 cancelled after 36 test positive for Covid-19, Plett Rage festival cancelled. \c\cOn 5 August, members of the entertainment, restaurant, fitness, and events industries staged a socially distanced national protest by lighting buildings red. The #LightSAred campaign was staged so as to highlight the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 lockdown measures on these industries. \c\cIn April 2020, a number of liquor stores and food stores were targeted by looters in the Cape Town suburbs of Elsies River, Delft South, Samora Machel, Manenberg, Sherwood Park, Nyanga Junction, and Gatesville. On 21 July 2020, a truck carrying COVID-19 specimens was hijacked at a clinic in Motherwell, Eastern Cape and found abandoned 500 metres away. \c\cThe arrival of the COVID-19 virus in South Africa saw an increase in the dissemination of misinformation about the virus on social media and other platforms. These range from messages minimising the virus's harm in the country to the propagation of conspiracy theories about government actions to control the virus. \c\cDeliberately spreading fake news and other misinformation in South Africa about the virus was declared an offence punishable by a fine, six months\' imprisonment, or both. \c\cOne individual was arrested for posting a video showing himself drinking in public with friends following the national lock-down whilst stating that there was "nothing called corona here". In another incident a man claimed that 10000 government officials would be going door-to-door using contaminated test kits to test people for the virus. A conspiracy theory that Bill Gates wished to test a COVID-19 "vaccine" in Africa or South Africa first caused significant controversy on social media following the publication of a now retracted story in News24. \c\cFake news that 5G cellular technology was the true cause of COVID-19 symptoms also spread in the country during this period as it also did in other countries around the world. In the course of it, three telecommunication towers belonging to Vodacom and MTN were burnt by protesters. \c\cOn 23 March 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation and announced a 21-day national lockdown effective from midnight 26 March through to 16 April, with the deployment of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to support the government. On 9 April the President announced a two-week lockdown extension, until the end of April. Exempt from the lockdown are people deemed necessary to the effective response to the pandemic such as:\c\chealth workers, pharmacy and laboratory personnel, emergency personnel;\c\csecurity services (police officers, military personnel, and private security);\c\cpeople regarded as necessary to the basic functioning of the economy (supermarkets, transportation and logistical services, petrol stations, banks, essential financial and payment services); and\c\cthose working in industries that can not be economically shut down (such as mines and steel mills). \c\cDuring the lockdown, all gatherings except for funerals were prohibited. Restaurants, taverns, bottle stores and all other stores not selling essential goods were to close during the lockdown period. Schools, already closed a week before the lockdown period, will not reopen until after the lockdown. Non-exempt people are only allowed to leave their homes during this period to access health services, collect social grants, attend small funerals (no more than 50 people) and shop for essential goods. See the South African Government Gazette 25 March 2020 for a complete list of exemptions and non-exemptions during the lockdown period. South Africans were ordered not to take their dogs for a walk during the lockdown, though they may walk them around their house or apartment building. \c\cPeople may not be evicted from their place of residence during the lockdown. \c\cMovement between provinces, and between metropolitan and district areas are prohibited except for
Israel–United Arab Emirates relations had been cool for several decades, but in the 2010s, the countries\' informal relations improved considerably and they began engaging in extensive unofficial cooperation based on their joint opposition to Iran's nuclear program and regional influence. In 2015, Israel opened an official diplomatic mission in Abu Dhabi to the International Renewable Energy Agency. \c\cIn a significant warming of official Israeli-UAE relations, Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) formally agreed in August 2020 to "normalise" relations in a United States-brokered deal that also requires Israel to halt its plan to annex parts of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley. A joint statement issued by the UAE, Israel and the United States said that the three countries had "agreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates". The signing ceremony was held on 15 September 2020. \c\cTurkey and Iran both criticised the agreement. On 16 August 2020, the UAE for the first time established telephone links to Israel by unblocking direct dialling to Israel's +972 country code. The first direct commercial flight from Israel to the UAE was an El Al flight on 31 August 2020. \c\cOn 24 January 2021, the official Israeli embassy in the UAE was opened with Eitan Na’eh serving as an acting ambassador/Chargé d\'affaires. Mohamed Al Khaja was selected to be the first UAE ambassador to Israel\c\cOn 30 May 2021, the embassy of the United Arab Emirates officially opened in Tel Aviv, with Mohamed Al Khaja serving as ambassador. \c\cThe first president of the UAE after the UAE became an independent country in 1971, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, referred to Israel as "the enemy" of the Arab countries. \c\cAfter the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai on 19 January 2010, the UAE called, via Interpol, for the arrest of Meir Dagan, director of Israel's Mossad. Israel has neither denied nor confirmed any involvement. Dubai's Chief of police, Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, stated that all travelers suspected of being Israeli will not be allowed into the country, even if they arrived on foreign passports. After the incident, the UAE later proposed repairing its covert relationship with Israel through a deal where Israel would provide armed drones to them, but this was rejected by Israel due to concern that it would antagonize the United States. \c\cRelations between the two countries had been improving since then. \c\cAfter the inauguration of US President Barack Obama in 2009, the Israeli and UAE ambassadors to the United States jointly urged the incoming administration's Middle East adviser to adopt a tougher line on Iran. Obama lifted sanctions on Iran after signing the JCPOA. \c\cIn September 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan in New York City. Although they agreed on the threat of Iran, the UAE refused to publicly improve relations without progress in the Israel-Palestine peace process. In 2015, the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, briefed his UAE counterpart Yousef Al Otaiba on Israel's opposition to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and urged the UAE to take a more active role in opposing the deal. \c\cClose to the end of Obama's presidency, U.S. intelligence agencies became aware of a phone communication between the two countries\' officials, including between Netanyahu and a senior UAE leader, and a meeting between Netanyahu and UAE leadership in Cyprus, which was focused on cooperation against Iran. After the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, both Israel and the UAE lobbied for a rapprochement between the United States and Russia to contain Iranian influence in Syria. \c\cIn July 2017, the UAE mediated a meeting between Israeli intelligence and Khalifa Haftar, the head of the Libyan National Army, which is supported by the UAE in the Second Libyan Civil War, to negotiate Israeli military aid to Haftar's forces. \c\cIn March 2018, Netanyahu met with Otaiba and the Bahraini ambassador to the United States at a restaurant in Washington, D.C., where the issue of Iran was discussed. \c\cOn 10 October 2018, Dermer and Otaiba shared a table at the annual dinner of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, where they were seen talking to one another. \c\cOn 16 January 2010, Israel's Minister of National Infrastructure Uzi Landau attended a renewable energy conference in Abu Dhabi. He was the first Israeli minister to visit Abu Dhabi. \c\cIn January 2016, Israel's Energy Minister visited the UAE at the site of International Renewable Energy Agency headquarters in Abu Dhabi. \c\cIn September 2018, the UAE hosted secret talks in Abu Dhabi between Israeli and Turkish officials to discuss restoring relations between those two countries. \c\cIn April 2019, Israel announced that it has been invited to take part at Dubai's Expo 2020 innovation fair. \c\cOn December 13, 2021, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett visited the UAE and met with Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. This marked the first time leaders from both countries met with each other. The meeting which included a shared lunch went two hours than originally expected. Bennet stated that the meeting was about "the region, our economy and technology."\c\cOn 13 August 2020, Israel and the UAE signed an agreement mediated by U.S. President Donald Trump. Under the deal, Israel and the UAE will establish full diplomatic relations, with the UAE becoming the third Arab state, besides Egypt and Jordan, to fully recognize Israel. As part of the deal, Israel agreed to suspend plans for the annexation of the Jordan Valley. Director of the Mossad, Yossi Cohen, secretly visited UAE several times for over a year to broker the Abraham Accord. \c\cThe agreement was made official with a signing ceremony on 15 September 2020 at the White House in Washington, D.C. The UAE's ambassador to the US and close adviser to Mohammed bin Zayed, Yousef Al Otaiba, was one of the main negotiators of the peace deal. Al Otaiba was one of the well-connected and powerful advocates in the US who was in contact with Jared Kushner, who was leading the peace deal negotiations. In August 2020, Al Otaiba released a statement praising the Abraham Accord as "a win for diplomacy and for the region" and stated that it "lowers tensions and creates new energy for positive change.”\c\cThe Abraham Accords revealed the rifts in the relationship between Palestine and Gulf monarchies, specially the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Under a 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, Arab nations declared that Israel would only receive "normal" ties in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and an end to the occupation. However, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot warned that the longstanding policy had been undermined. A senior Palestinian politician, Saeb Erekat condemned the deals as a "tremendous encouragement for the Israeli government to continue their occupation". However, under the deal, Israel agreed to "suspend" annexation, but critics stated that the clause was only added as lip service to the Palestinian issue, while Israeli politicians argued that the annexation plan is still a priority. \c\cThe peace deal between the UAE and Israel was being asserted to cause damage to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Middle East (UNRWA), as the Emirates was considering to gradually eliminate aid to the agency. It was cited as a part of the normalization deal. In 2019, Abu Dhabi granted $51 million to the UN agency responsible for Palestinian refugees. The next year only $1 million were sent by the UAE. \c\cBefore the official recognition of Israel, the UAE did not allow Israeli citizens or those suspected of being Israeli citizens entry into the UAE, including Israeli passport holders, except for transit. However, third party nationals with Israeli stamps or visas in their passports were allowed entry. There were no direct flights between Israel and the UAE, so all flights had to stopover in a third, neutral country (such as Jordan), and no Israeli aircraft was allowed to enter UAE airspace. Such restrictions did not apply in Israel, though the UAE barred its citizens and aircraft from entering Israel. Restrictions were tightened against the entry of Israeli citizens following Mahbouh's assassination in Dubai, which was blamed on Israeli intelligence. In 2012, Qantas teamed up with Emirates, in a deal that involved Qantas flights stopping over in Dubai on Australia-Europe flights. Concerns were raised as to how the UAE travel restrictions would impact Qantas passengers who are nationals of Israel or travelling on an Israeli passport, for example, if such passengers had to stay overnight in Dubai for a connection. Qantas cancelled the deal in 2018. \c\cHowever, there are Jewish expatriates in the UAE, and there are Israelis with dual citizenship who live, visit, and work in the UAE as citizens of other countries. Prior to the normalisation of relations, some Israeli companies conducted business in the UAE indirectly through third parties. \c\cOn 31 August 2020, an El Al Boeing 737-800 (4X-EHD) made a three-hour trip from Tel Aviv to Abu Dhabi over Saudi Arabian airspace to be the first commercial flight between the two countries and the first Israeli flight to be approved to fly over Saudi Arabian airspace. With Saudi Arabia allowing Israeli flights to cross its airspace and significantly reducing operational costs as well as flight times for El Al, the airline will become more competitive on routes to India and other destinations in the Middle East and South Asia. \c\cOn October 20, 2020, Israel and the UAE announced a mutual visa exemption agreement, allowing Israeli citizens and Emirati citizens to go to each other's countries visa-free. \c\cOn November 4, 2020, Emirati carrier FlyDubai announced that it would start direct flights between Tel Aviv and Dubai from November 26, with tickets being offered on sale. This would mark the first commercial flight route between Dubai and Tel Aviv. \c\cIn January 2021, the visa-exemption agreement between the UAE and Israel was postponed, amidst the Covid-19 restrictions. The decision came after Israel mandated it for the Emirati travelers to quarantine as a precaution. The waiver agreement, which was supposed to be implemented on 13 February 2021, was suspended until 1 July. \c\cIn June 2020,  a trading association, known as the  UAE-Israel Business Council (UIBC) was created by Dorian Barak, an Israeli-American investor and entrepreneur who had been working in the Persian Gulf region for the past decade, and Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, the Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem. The association consists of over 3000 businesses, business leaders, professionals and public sector leaders from the United Arab Emirates and Israel with the express purpose to foster trade, innovation and cooperation between the two countries. \c\cThe UAE-Israel Business Council mission is to build mutually beneficial relationships between Emiratis and Israelis, that advance business ties, investment, and cultural understanding. Key areas of cooperation include technology, finance, logistics and transportation, medical and biotech, agriculture, energy and water, professional services. To date there are over 250 UAE companies trading with the Israel, which is expected to rise to over 500 companies by 2021. \c\cThe Gulf-Israel Policy Forum was established in cooperation with the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University and is headed by founding member, Dan Feferman, a member of the Israeli policy research community, and Nir Boms of the Dayan Center. It includes prominent policy professionals, academics and government advisors from Israel, the UAE, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. The policy forum acts as a hub for collaboration between policy makers and researchers in Israel and Arab states of the Persian Gulf. \c\cThe Gulf-Israel Women's Forum was established as a division of the UIBC by Fleur Hassan-Nahoum and Justine Zwerling, with the goal to unite women from the Middle East in sisterhood, culture, friendship and business. On October 9, 2020, founding members Hassan-Nahoum, Daphne Richemond-Barak and Michal Divon met in Dubai with a prominent set of Emirati women for the first of several Women's Forum events. Such events focus on involving women from Israel and the Arab world in technology, finance, healthcare, media, culture and other sectors. \c\cIn August 2016, pilots from both the Israel Air Force and the UAE Air Force participated in a joint Red Flag training exercise with pilots from Pakistan and Spain, in Nevada in the United States. \c\cIn 2017, the Israel Air Force and the UAE Air Force held a joint exercise with the air forces of the U.S., Italy and Greece, in Greece, called Iniohos 2017. Another joint aerial training occurred at Iniohos 2019. \c\cAfter 2011, the UAE and Israel actively participated together on the Egyptian government's side against the Sinai insurgency. \c\cIn late August 2020, reports claimed that Israel and UAE plan to establish spy bases on the Yemeni island of Socotra. \c\cIn August 2020, the UAE and Israel reached a historic Israel–United Arab Emirates peace agreement to lead towards full normalization of relations between the two countries. The agreement formally became part of the Abraham Accords involving the UAE and Israel and was signed on September 15, 2020. Security experts in Israel raised concern that the agreement was paving way for the Trump administration's proposed sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets and other sophisticated weaponry to the UAE. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposed the sale of the fighter jets, stating that Israel's position on Middle Eastern states, acquiring such high-end weapons, did not change. The UAE Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hend al-Otaiba commented on the link between the Abraham Accord and the proposed sale of US-made F-35 fighter jets to the Emirates, by saying: "In terms of the F35s specifically, this request is not something that emerged from the current accord. Our request for the F-35 has been in process for six years now. Given that the UAE intends to be a partner to Israel, and already has a deep strategic partnership with the US, we are hopeful the request will be granted." Later in October 2020, Israel, in an apparent reference to the F-35, said that it will not oppose US sales of weapon systems to the United Arab Emirates. \c\cThe establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries was said to be the result, most recently, of cooperation and talks between the UAE's National Security Adviser Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Yossi Cohen, the head of Israel's Mossad. \c\cIn July 2020, the Israeli Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems signed an agreement with the Emirati Group 42 technology company, to offer "effective solutions" to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, the UAE's Etihad Airways landed at Ben Gurion Airport, carrying a shipment of medical supplies to assist the Palestinians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Later that month, Israel announced a partnership with the UAE to cooperate in managing the COVID-19 pandemic in their respective countries. \c\cIn September 2019, the Abu Dhabi authorities announced that they would open a synagogue as part of an interfaith compound by 2022. \c\cOn 13 September 2020, UAE's Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence and Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate on AI research.[citation needed]\c\cIn January 2021, the Department of Culture and Tourism in Abu Dhabi announced the organization of the first virtual event that brings together Emirati and Israeli filmmakers on the annual "Qattara Cinema" program, under the agreement between the Abu Dhabi Film Committee, the Israeli Film Fund and Sam Spiegel School in Jerusalem, where eight Emirati and Israeli short films will be released. \c\cThe UAE had a history of denying entry to Israelis, including for sport. However, international pressure has led to exceptions being made for athletes in international competitions. In addition, UAE athletes were prohibited from taking part in events in Israel as well as competing against Israeli athletes in any circumstance.[citation needed]\c\cIn February 2010, Israeli tennis player Shahar Pe\'er was denied a visa by the UAE, and thus prevented from playing at the Dubai Tennis Championships. A number of players, among them Venus Williams, condemned the visa rejection, and Women's Tennis Association chief Larry Scott said that he had considered canceling the tournament, but chose not to after consulting Pe\'er. Tournament director Salah Tahlak said that Pe\'er was refused on the grounds that her appearance could incite anger in the Arab country, after she had already faced protests at the ASB Classic over the Gaza War. The WTA said that it would review future tournaments in Dubai. Due to the action, Tennis Channel decided not to televise the event and The Wall Street Journal dropped its sponsorship. The 2008 winner of the men's singles Andy Roddick chose not to defend his title, with prize money of over $2 million, to protest against the UAE's refusal to grant Pe\'er a visa. "I really didn\'t agree with what went on over there. I don\'t know if it's the best thing to mix politics and sports, and that was probably a big part of it", Roddick said. \c\cIn October 2017, when an Israeli judoka Tal Flicker won gold in an international judo championship in the UAE, officials refused to fly the Israeli flag and play the Israeli national anthem, instead playing the official music of the International Judo Federation (IJF) and flying the IJF's logo. The UAE also banned Israeli athletes from wearing their country's symbols on uniforms, having to wear IJF uniforms. Other contestants such as Gili Cohen received similar treatment. In October 2018, the UAE reversed its position allowing the Israeli flag be displayed and anthem played when an Israeli judoka Sagi Muki won a gold medal in the Judo Grand Competition, with the Israeli Minister of Culture and Sport, Miri Regev, attending the events in Abu Dhabi. \c\cThe 2019 AFC Asian Cup held in January 2019 was another turning point. For the first time since the expulsion of Israel from the Asian Football Confederation, the UAE allowed Israeli TV channel, Sport 5, to directly broadcast the tournament held in the country. This was seen as a sign of warming relations between two nations. Sport 5 officially broadcast the opening match between the UAE and Bahrain, and had remained active until the end of the tournament. In March 2019, Israeli athletes participated in the 2019 Special Olympics World Summer Games, held in Abu Dhabi. \c\cOn 9 May 2019, the first team sporting match between Israel and the UAE took place at the Netball Europe Open Challenge at the National Sporting Centre in the Isle of Man. \c\cIn November 2019, 17-year-old Israeli Alon Leviev won the gold medal in the junior category at the Ju-jitsu World Championship, held in Abu Dhabi. In the same competition, Nimrod Ryder won another gold medal, while Ronnie Nessimian, Meshi Rosenfeld and Roy Dagan won other medals. \c\cIn September 2020, Israeli Dia Saba joined Emirati club Al-Nasr, to become the first Israeli to play in the UAE and Gulf States, following the normalization agreement.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus reached the UK in late January 2020. As of 6 December 2021, there had been 10,523,316 confirmed cases, the most in Europe and fourth highest number worldwide,  and 165,721 deaths among people who had recently tested positive. The UK has the world's 7th highest death toll and 28th highest death rate by population. In Europe, the UK has the second-highest death toll after Russia, and the 20th highest death rate. There has been some disparity between the outbreak's severity in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – health-care in the UK is a devolved matter. Each constituent country has its own publicly-funded healthcare system operated by devolved governments. \c\cThe virus was known to have spread to the UK by early 2020. The country's response included a public information campaign and certain expansions to government powers, but was otherwise slow to introduce preventative measures, increase testing or prepare for an outbreak.  From March 2020 onwards, the government introduced restrictions across the UK on aspects of life such as people's freedom of movement, education, and leisure activities. Police were empowered to enforce the measures, and the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave all four governments emergency powers not used since the Second World War. These restrictions were eased and tightened periodically, and there was some variance in restrictions between the four countries of the UK and more localised rules were also introduced. In the early days of the pandemic, the health services worked to raise hospital capacity and set up temporary critical care hospitals, but faced shortages of personal protective equipment. In late 2020, a new more infectious variant of the virus emerged in the UK, causing another wave in infections over the winter that was deadlier than the first. The country's vaccination programme was the first to start in December 2020 and was in early 2021 one of the fastest in the world. The highly transmissible Delta variant arrived in the UK and drove a third wave of infections in mid-2021 that increased into the autumn, although high vaccination rates led to a substantially lower mortality rate than previous waves. In late 2021, the Omicron variant arrived in the UK and drove a further increase in cases. \c\cIn addition to the major strain on the UK's healthcare service and a substantial fall in life expectancy, the pandemic has had a severe impact on the UK's economy, caused major disruptions to education and had far-reaching impacts on society. \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cGenetic sequencing has traced most COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom to imported cases from Italy, France, and Spain, rather than directly from China. \c\cThough later reporting indicated that there may have been some cases dating from late 2019, COVID-19 was confirmed to be spreading in the UK by the end of January 2020 with the first confirmed deaths in March. The country was initially relatively slow in implementing restrictions. Subsequent epidemiological analysis showed that over 1000 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 entered the UK in early 2020 from international travellers, mostly from outbreaks elsewhere in Europe, leading to numerous clusters that overwhelmed contact tracing efforts. A legally enforced Stay at Home Order, or lockdown, was introduced on 23 March. Restrictions were steadily eased across the UK in late spring and early summer that year. The UK's epidemic in early 2020 was at the time one of the largest and deadliest worldwide. \c\cBy the Autumn, COVID-19 cases were again rising. This lead to the creation of new regulations along with the introduction of localised restrictions. Larger lockdowns took place in all of Wales, England and Northern Ireland later that season. A new variant of the virus is thought to have originated in Kent around September 2020. Once restrictions were lifted, the novel variant rapidly spread across the UK. Its increased transmissibility contributed to a continued increase in daily infections. The healthcare system had come under severe strain by late December which led to further restrictions being introduced across all of the UK. \c\cThe first COVID-19 vaccine was approved and began being deployed across the UK in early December, 15 million vaccine doses had been given to predominantly those most vulnerable to the virus by mid-February. 6 months later more than 75% of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Quarantine rules for incoming travellers were introduced in late January. Restrictions began to ease from late February onwards and almost all had ended in Great Britain by August. A third wave of daily infections began in July 2021 due to the arrival and rapid spread of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. However, mass vaccination continued to keep deaths and hospitalisations at much lower levels than in previous waves. Infection rates remained high and hospitalisations and deaths rose into the autumn. The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was confirmed to have arrived and begun spreading in the community in early December, driving a further increase in cases that surpassed previous records. \c\cThe COVID-19 pandemic led to the largest fall in life expectancy in England since records began in 1981. On average, British COVID-19 victims lost around a decade of life; the last time deaths rose so sharply in the UK was during World War II. In 2020, the disease was the leading cause of death among men, and second leading cause among women. Research suggests over 1 million people in the UK have had Long COVID, with the majority reporting substantial impacts on day to day life. The pandemic's major impact on the country's healthcare system, leading to long waiting lists for medical procedures and ambulances, also led to an indirect increase in deaths from other conditions. The lockdown also had a major mental health impact. \c\cIn August 2021, a report from Age UK found that 27% of people over 60 could not walk as far and 25% were living in more physical pain earlier this year compared to the start of the pandemic. 54% of older people felt less confident attending a hospital appointment, and 37% of older people felt less confident going to a GP surgery. \c\cThe pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy of the United Kingdom, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. Some temporary shutdowns became permanent; some people who were furloughed were later made redundant. The economic disruption has had a significant impact on people's mental health—with particular damage to the mental health of foreign-born men whose work hours have been reduced/eliminated. \c\cThe pandemic has had far-reaching consequences in the country that go beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it, including political, cultural, and social implications. \c\cSophie Grégoire Trudeau, the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, tested positive for COVID-19 upon her return from WE Day events in the UK; on 12 March 2020 the Trudeau family entered two weeks of self-isolation. The first patient in Mauritius was a 59-year-old man who returned from the United Kingdom on 7 March 2020. When he arrived in Mauritius, the Mauritian had no symptoms. Other cases of the novel coronavirus resulting from travel to the UK were subsequently reported in India and Nigeria. \c\cOn 16 June 2020, it was widely reported in British media that New Zealand's first COVID-19 cases in 24 days were diagnosed in two British women, both of whom had travelled from the UK and were given special permission to visit a dying parent. The women had entered the country on 7 June, after first flying into Doha and Brisbane. \c\cA 2021 study suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant which was first detected in Kent is thought to have began its spread to many countries internationally from flights originating in London in late 2020. \c\cReports from the Medical Research Council's Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London have been providing mathematically calculated estimates of cases and case fatality rates. In February 2020, the team at Imperial College, led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, estimated about two-thirds of cases in travellers from China were not detected and that some of these may have begun "chains of transmission within the countries they entered". They forecast that the new type of coronavirus could infect up to 60% of the UK's population, in the worst-case scenario. \c\cIn a paper on 16 March, the Imperial College team provided detailed forecasts of the potential impacts of the epidemic in the UK and US. It detailed the potential outcomes of an array of \'non-pharmaceutical interventions\'. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point, government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed. On 16 March, the Prime Minister announced changes to government advice, extending self-isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future. A paper on 30 March by the Imperial College group estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000. This paper and others relied on data from European countries including the UK to estimate that the combined non-pharmaceutical interventions reduced the reproduction number of the virus by 67-87%, enough to stop infections from growing. However, followup work concluded that the effectiveness of interventions was lower in later waves of infections. \c\cIn April 2020, biostatistician Professor Sheila Bird said the delay in the reporting of deaths from the virus meant there was a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend. \c\cIn December 2021 scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that Omicron could cause from 25,000 to 75,000 deaths in England over the five months to April unless there are more stringent restrictions.  Omicron will probably be the dominant  variant by the end December.
The Iran–Israel conflict during the Syrian civil war refers to the Iranian-Israeli standoff in and around Syria during the course of the Syrian conflict. With increasing Iranian involvement in Syria from 2011 onwards, the conflict shifted from a proxy war into a direct confrontation by early 2018. \c\cOn several occasions, between 2013 and 2017, Israel reportedly carried out or supported attacks on Hezbollah and Iranian targets within Syrian territories or Lebanon. One of the first reliably reported incidents of this kind took place on 30 January 2013, when Israeli aircraft struck a Syrian convoy allegedly transporting Iranian weapons to Hezbollah. Habitually, Israel refused to comment on the incident, and allegedly so that the Syrian government would not feel obliged to retaliate. \c\cSyria confirmed some reports regarding Israeli Air Force incidents in May 2013, December 2014, and April 2015, and denied others. Israel systematically refused to comment on the alleged targeting of Hezbollah and Ba\'athist Syrian targets in Syrian territory. In 2015, suspected Hezbollah militants launched a retaliatory attack on Israeli forces in Shebaa farms.

However, Israelis claimed that the airstrikes which targeted air defence positions near Damascus airport and ammunition depots near Sayyida Zainab and al-Kiswah, came after they found three Claymore anti-personnel charges in the Golan Heights. \c\cOn 22 November, 14 pro-Iranian militiamen of Afghan and Iraqi nationalities were killed during the shelling by aircraft, believed to be Israeli, in Al-Bukamal countryside, which targeted positions affiliated with these militias in that area. Two positions and vehicles were also destroyed in the attack. \c\cThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights HAS documented the killing of eight militiamen of pro-Iranian militias and Lebanese Hezbollah of non-Syrian nationalities, as a result of Israeli shelling on Jabal al-Mani in southern Damascus countryside just before midnight. \c\cOn 26 November, airstrikes likely carried out by Israel killed at least 19 pro-Iran militia fighters in war-torn eastern Syria, a war monitor said Thursday. \c\cAccording to unnamed Iraqi sources on 28 or 29 November, an airstrike allegedly killed an IRGC commander along with three other people when their vehicle was carrying weapons across the Iraqi-Syrian border. Iran however denied these reports. "We have not received any report in this regard, and it seems more like media propaganda," Saeed Khatibzadeh, the spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, said, according to Iran’s semi-official Mehr news agency. \c\cOn 25 December, Israeli warplanes targeted pro-Iran weapons facilities in the Masyaf area, after they had flown very low over parts of Lebanon. Israeli airstrikes in Syria overnight killed at least six fighters operating in pro-Iran militias on the western province of Hama, a war monitoring group said Friday. \c\cOn 30 December, one Syrian soldier has been killed and several others wounded in an Israeli attack on a military position in the Damascus countryside near the Zabadani Valley, state news agency SANA says, citing a military source. \c\cOn 7 January, Israeli airstrikes targeted pro-Iranian forces weapons depots in al-Kiswa area, in addition to the radar system battalion to the west of Al-Dour village in Suwayda Governorate.

Nine pro-Iranian militiamen were killed in the airstrikes. The dead were all of non-Syrian and non-Arab nationalities, and it is not known whether they were Afghans, Pakistanis or Iranians, as these militias are substantially deployed in the area near the Lebanese border. \c\cOn 28 February, Iran-related sites were targeted around Damascus in what Hebrew media outlets suggest was a response to an Iranian attack against an Israeli-owned vessel in the Gulf of Oman the previous week. \c\cOn 11 March, The Wall Street Journal reported that Israel had used weaponry including naval mines to target a dozen of Iranian ships carrying oil or weapons to Syria in the past two years. \c\cOn 16 March, a Syrian military source claimed that Israel attacked Iranian weapon shipments near Damascus. \c\cOn April 22, Syria fired an SA-5 surface-to-air missile in response to what it claims was an Israeli airstrike near Damascus.

Typhoon Rai, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Odette, is currently a powerful tropical cyclone impacting the Philippines after passing near the island of Palau. Rai became the first Category 5 super typhoon since Nock-ten to form in the month of December. The twenty-second tropical storm of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season, the system originated from a tropical disturbance near the equator on December 9. However, it dissipated on the next day as another area of convection lingered near the dissipating feature that same day. Conditions around the system were favorable for further development, and it slowly developed into a tropical depression on December 12. On the same day, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the consolidating depression. Further intensification ensued, and Rai was upgraded into a tropical storm on the next day before passing south of Ngulu Atoll. After passing near Palau with unknown impacts, Rai entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) by the night of December 14, whereas the PAGASA named it "Odette". On the next day, both the JMA and JTWC raised the system's intensity to a low-end Category 1 typhoon as an eye continued to appear. While approaching the Philippines, Rai unexpectedly rapidly intensified into a Category 5 super typhoon just before its first landfall across Siargao. It then slowly but steadily weakened as it traversed Visayas, exiting into the Sulu Sea. \c\cTropical cyclone warnings were issued for areas in the Philippines and parts of the Caroline Islands as Rai developed. Early bulletins were issued by the PAGASA for Rai, starting on December 12 due to the persistent track of the system towards the country. As the storm neared the country, land travels were canceled, along with flights and ferry operations. People living near coastal areas and into the track of the storm were urged to evacuate. Fishing vessels were also docked into safety and many provinces in the Visayas started to prepare for the storm's brunt. Storm signals were also raised by the PAGASA, first focusing on parts of Visayas and Mindanao, before further expanding into southern Luzon. Food and non-food packs were also prepared by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) for the evacuees, along with standby funds worth near $15,000. Forced evacuations were conducted as Rai further approaches the country, with some people in the Bicol Region being warned of possible Lahars from the Mayon Volcano. A festival in Antique was also affected, along with vaccination drives across the affected regions. \c\cAs Rai pounded the Philippines, heavy rainfall, strong winds and gusty winds impacted several areas around the storm's path. Many areas across Visayas and Mindanao lost electricity, with three provinces and areas being deprived further of communication services. Downed trees obstructed many roadways and flooding were a major problem across the affected regions, particularly Bohol, where the storm was described as "one of the worst for the province". Rivers also overflowed across Cagayan de Oro, while numerous buildings sustained damages. Surigao City was reported to be 100% damaged, and aid is being appealed. Bohol also pleaded help to the government due to the damages Rai brought to the area. A state of calamity is being requested for the aforementioned province. Eight deaths was confirmed so far; four in Negros Occidental, two in Bukidnon and one each in Iloilo and Surigao City. Damages in Bohol were estimated to be worth ₱5 billion ($100 million), with Siargao's damages being estimated at ₱20 billion ($400 million). \c\cAt 06:00 UTC of December 9, the JTWC started to monitor a low-latitude area of convection in the Pacific Ocean at 4°36′N 142°24′E\ufeff / \ufeff4.6°N 142.4°E\ufeff / 4.6; 142.4, located about 350 nautical miles (650 km; 400 mi) to Palau's east-southeast. A broad circulation was identified by the agency, with flaring convection over it. The circulation had a marginal environment with low to moderate wind shear, fair outflow, and warm sea surface temperatures. Despite its given environment, however, the cyclone failed to intensify and dissipated by 06:00 UTC the next day. Another new area of low pressure formed on December 10. Analysis on the system revealed a degraded and disorganized low-level circulation center. Position fixes by 02:30 UTC of December 11 determined that its center forwarded to the north over a developing surface trough while convective bursts occurred around the system. An ASCAT pass featured below gale-force winds on its northwest quadrant. \c\cThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first upgraded the system to a tropical depression with winds of 30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph) on 00:00 UTC of the next day, followed by the JTWC upgrading the storm's chances of developing to "high" and subsequently issuing a TCFA. By 03:00 UTC of December 13, the JTWC upgraded the system to a weak tropical depression, highly based on Dvorak ratings of T1.5. Nine hours later, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm based on Dvorak ratings and named the storm Rai. It was not until 15:00 UTC that day when the JTWC did the same to Rai, as it began tracking northwestwards. Three hours later, Rai began to pass south of Ngulu State, while continuing to intensify and organize. By December 14 in the early morning, the system was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA. By 09:00 UTC, the JTWC noted that the system's cloud tops became warm; however, it further organized while tracking towards the small island country of Palau. The storm entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility around 11:00 UTC (19:00 PHT), and was named Odette by the PAGASA. Four hours later, Rai began to exhibit an eye which was first seen on microwave images. The JMA further upgraded the system to a typhoon by the next day, followed by the JTWC three hours later as Rai began to take a westward motion under the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north. Steady intensification occurred on Rai while moving near the country, reaching high-end Category 1 typhoon by 15:00 UTC. At this time, the JTWC only forecast a landfall equivalent to a Category 2 storm. \c\cRai unexpectedly underwent rapid intensification on December 15, from 65 knots (120 km/h; 75 mph) to 140 knots (260 km/h; 160 mph) by December 16 whilst nearing landfall. At this time, a small 6 nautical miles (11 km; 6.9 mi) eye was seen along with strong convection. The storm began an eyewall replacement cycle (ERC) shortly after reaching peak intensity. On December 16, the typhoon made landfall over Siargao Island in the province of Surigao del Norte around 1:30 PM local time (05:30 UTC) and a second landfall over Dinagat Islands around 3:10 PM local time (07:10 UTC). A third landfall occurred in Liloan, Southern Leyte at 3:40 PM local time (7:40 UTC). A fourth landfall occurred at Panaon Island, also at Liloan, at around 4:50 PM (8:50 UTC). Padre Burgos, Southern Leyte was the fifth at 5:40 PM (09:40 UTC), followed nearly one-hour later at President Carlos P. Garcia, Bohol and approximately another hour at Bien Unido, still at Bohol. The eight landfall occured at Carcar by 10:00 PM (14:00 UTC) and the ninth over La Libertad, Negros Oriental, two hours later. The JMA estimated a low pressure of 915 millibars (27.0 inHg) by 03:00 UTC earlier, two hours before its landfall. The same situation slightly weakened the system into a Category 4 super typhoon by 09:00 UTC and its intensity continued to degrade, six hours later while crossing Visayas. As Rai entered the Panay Gulf, its eye further weakened and its convective signature becoming disorganized as the JTWC further downgraded it to a Category 3 system six hours later. It continued to lose in strength while tracking towards the Sulu Sea by the next day at 03:00 UTC. \c\cAs of 12:00 UTC December 17, Typhoon Rai (Odette) is located near 10°24′N 118°42′E\ufeff / \ufeff10.4°N 118.7°E\ufeff / 10.4; 118.7\ufeff (Rai) or about 297 nmi (550 km; 342 mi) south-southwest of Manila, Philippines. Maximum 10-minute sustained winds are at 80 knots (150 km/h; 90 mph), with gusts up to 115 knots (215 km/h; 130 mph), while maximum 1-minute sustained winds are at 90 knots (165 km/h; 105 mph). The minimum central barometric pressure is 955 hPa (28.20 inHg), and the system is moving west  at 13 kn (24 km/h; 15 mph). \c\cFor the latest official information, see\c\cJMA's Tropical Cyclone Information for Typhoon 2122 (Rai)\c\cJTWC's Tropical Cyclone Warning on Typhoon 28W (Rai)\c\cPAGASA's Tropical Cyclone Bulletin on Typhoon Rai (Odette)\c\cUpon the system's intensification into a tropical depression, a typhoon watch was issued by the US National Weather Service in Tiyan, Guam in Koror and Kayangel while a tropical storm warning was placed for Ngulu Atoll. The island of Yap was placed also under tropical storm watch. This was further upgraded into a typhoon warning for Palau as Rai further intensifies. The alerts for Ngulu and Yap were first canceled by 09:00 UTC of December 14 and six hours later, the typhoon warning were also canceled for Palau. \c\cThe PAGASA began issuing Tropical Cyclone Advisories as early as December 12 given the forecasted track of the storm. In its first advisory, the PAGASA forecasted the possibility of Signal #4 being raised over the Visayas and Mindanao regions, later lowered to Signal #3. The PAGASA also forecasted winds of up to 155 km/h (96 mph) prior to landfall. On December 14, storm signals were raised in Caraga and Eastern Visayas as the storm entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility. Starting on the night of December 13, land travel on bound to Visayas, Mindanao, the province of Masbate and Catanduanes were canceled according to an approved request of the Office of the Civil Defense in the country. The Land Transportation Office also placed the same travel restrictions in Mindanao and Luzon as a precaution. All types of vessels are also prohibited to leave the country's ports if there is any Storm Signals raised. Fishermen living near coastal areas were also urged by the country's coast guard to leave their homes "as soon as possible". Other Philippine provinces like Bohol and Aklan were also prepared for possible work cancelations and evacuation premises in regards to the storm. Floating cottages in General Santos City, as well as fishing boats were brought to shore and safety. The vaccination operations across the possible affected areas were earlier suspended by December 20–22. Over 23,642 food packs for evacuees were also readied by the country's Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), over 18,665 non-edible items as well as over ₱752,250 (US$14,950) worth of standby funds. The airline carrier Cebu Pacific also suspended three flights in the country. \c\cOver 10,000 individuals in barangays across Mindanao, Visayas and further north into Southern Luzon were also urged by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) to immediately leave their homes. The whole of Bicol Region were also under red alert starting on December 14. The higher authorities there also warned its people of possible landslides and lahar flow from the Mayon Volcano. Cebu were also under a "state of preparedness" due to the storm. Furthermore, many individuals, of which the majority are going into the Bicol Region in the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange (PITX) were also stranded due to ferry suspensions. Capiz already started voluntary evacuations at this time, first focused on people living in coastal areas. Liloan, Cebu also initiated forced evacuations by the afternoon of December 15. Several flights into Visayas and Mindanao from Ninoy Aquino International Airport were also delayed, rescheduled and/or canceled, mainly from the earlier Cebu Pacific, Philippine Airlines and Airasia. Some face to face classes in the affected areas were also halted. Many billboards in Bohol were also removed and the annual Binirayan festival in Antique was canceled due to Rai. The city of Surigao was already soaked by the rains of Odette by the afternoon of December 15, including the whole of Eastern Visayas. Thousands of evacuees rushed into safety shelters in the area whereas in one case, they became full. Sandbags were also placed over some houses in Tacloban City in Leyte and many individuals rushed into a grocery store in Alangalang to stack essential supplies. \c\cFour hours after Rai entered the PAR, the PAGASA started to hoist Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal Number 1 for southeastern Eastern Samar and over Surigao Provinces, including the Dinagat Islands. This was further extended into some provinces in the Central Visayas and further south of Mindanao, until Agusan del Sur. Signal Number 2 were further placed for Surigao provinces and further into some parts of Visayas as Odette further intensified into a typhoon, with number 1 spreading further into the remaining part of the region and Mimaropa and Southern Tagalog provinces. The storm's further intensification led to PAGASA raising the Signal Number 3 warning in some portions of Caraga and as Rai underwent rapid intensification, into eastern Visayas before Signal Number 4 was raised in those areas. \c\cOn December 15, militants of the multi-state-designated communist-terrorist group (CTG) New People's Army attacked troops evacuating residents in Surigao del Sur prior to the storm, killing three civilians. \c\cThe typhoon has caused at least ₱25 billion ($500 million) across the Philippines. \c\cOver 100,000 people were moved to higher ground as flooding occurred. Strong winds and heavy rainfall also impacted Guiuan, Eastern Samar, with rough waves bashing the shores of the province, according to a news correspondent of 24 Oras. The same situation was also felt across the entirety of Western Visayas. As Rai impacted Liloan in Southern Leyte, an area there was described as "cut-off", indicating that there was no electricity or means of communications in the place. A GMA News reporter recalling his experience inside the storm reported that the building where his team was sustained considerable damages, comparing it to Typhoon Haiyan in terms of ferocity. Their vehicles also received damages from the storm. After the storm passed over the area, the whole municipality was reported to be isolated. Many provinces in Mindanao also were severely affected by the typhoon. In Cagayan de Oro, despite rushing water, rescue teams continued to save many people in their houses from the floods. A house was heavily destroyed by Odette's strong winds in Agusan del Norte while a barge of unknown origins was left stranded by the storm's waves on a shore, still in the province. Storm surge also impacted the coast boulevards of Surigao del Norte while Iligan's Mandulog River overflowed. The incident was a horror to many residents there, due to the same effect Tropical Storm Washi in 2011 brought. Further south, it also caused rough waves over Cateel. The Cagayan de Oro River also overflowed, causing several homes to be near-completely inundated. The first fatality from the storm was reported at Iloilo, where a woman was crushed to death in her house by a bamboo tree. \c\cSurigao City was deprived of electricity and communications due to downed power lines while scores of trees left many roads impassable. Many buildings in the area were also devastated and the overall impact of Rai in the area were described as "widespread". Clean water supply became a problem in the city while almost all coastal houses were destroyed by the typhoon's storm surge. The main wet market of the area was also closed, still due to the effects of the system. Authorities are verifying a possible second death due to Rai in the city and a third elsewhere in southern Mindanao. The mayor of Surigao City, Ernesto Matugas also estimated that 100% of the area was devastated due to Odette, also appealing for aid to the government. Aid was also requested by the province of Bohol, where a chief of the area's Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) described Rai as the "one of the worst ever for the province". Many areas in the island were severely inundated, including Loboc, among the worst hit. The whole province also lost power services. The governor of the province, Arthur Yap estimated the damages at ₱5 billion (USD$100 million). A terminal in Siargao Airport was also totally destroyed; the overall island was also wrecked according to the first district representative of Surigao del Norte, Francisco Jose Matugas II. Southern Surigao confirmed a death, while two people lost their lives in Bukidnon. Three individuals were killed due to various reasons across Negros Occidental. Numerous houses there were also destroyed by felled trees, with a triage of the Ignacio Locsin Arroyo Memorial District Hospital being wrecked. Some areas in Kabankalan were also inundated due to a river overflowing there. A gas station elsewhere sustained roof damages. The Philippine National Police (PNP) also listed two people to be unaccounted for from Western Visayas. \c\cOver 30 power lines were downed around the Visayas and Mindanao reigon. Officals said that homes were "destroyed", and that the typhoon caused an "explosion of debris from fallen trees and falling buildings". At least 332,000 people were evacuated from their homes. The storm affected areas that were still rebuilding from storms late last year. Ricardo Jalad, the executive director of the national disaster agency, said in a breifing that "Siargao island is heavily damaged". Nearly every building in the province sustained heaviy damage, including the provincial disaster office. The damage was described by some as a bomb. At least 140,000 people were severely affected, with the United Nations estimating 13 million were affected in some way. \c\cSocial Media Coverage of the typhoon was much less than expected a day after Rai. Possible effects from the newly-emerged COVID-19 Omicron variant were feared to be worsened by the typhoon's effects. The DSWD further elaborated that over ₱900 million ($18 million) worth of standby funds were already prepared for the people affected by Odette. Immediately after the storm, the current Vice President of the Philippines Leni Robredo and former senator Bongbong Marcos set up relief and recovery operations for the victims of the storm, particularly in Samar and Leyte. Two major telecommunication networks in the country, Globe Telecom and PLDT reported communication disruptions. Both companies assured that their respective teams are trying to restore services. The government of Bohol already recommended the placement of the province into a state of calamity due to the wide swath of damages Rai brought into the area.
A by-election for the House of Commons constituency of North Shropshire, in the West Midlands, was held on 16 December 2021. It was triggered by the resignation of the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Owen Paterson on 4 November 2021. In a massive upset, the Liberal Democrats candidate Helen Morgan won the election with a 34.1% swing. The swing was the 7th largest in United Kingdom by-election history, and the constituency had been held by the Conservatives for nearly 200 years. \c\cNorth Shropshire is the third-largest constituency by area in the West Midlands region. It contains five small towns: Wem, Whitchurch, Ellesmere, Oswestry and Market Drayton. Sixty per cent of constituents who turned out voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 EU referendum. \c\cThe last time a by-election was held in the area was the 1904 Oswestry by-election, in which there was a Liberal gain from Conservative. \c\cOn 4 November 2021, Owen Paterson resigned as MP for the constituency. In October, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found that he had breached paid advocacy rules in relation to two companies which employed him as a paid consultant. The Commons Standards Committee considered the commissioners\' findings and recommended that Paterson be suspended from parliament for 30 days. In line with the established process, on 3 November a motion was proposed in the Commons inviting MPs to approve the punishment. If the suspension had been approved, a recall petition would have been triggered in the constituency. \c\cPaterson denied any wrongdoing. An amendment to the motion was put forward by Conservative backbencher Andrea Leadsom to postpone consideration of Paterson's suspension and to set up a new committee to investigate the disciplinary process for MPs. The government of Boris Johnson supported the amendment and issued a three-line whip. The amendment was passed. The outcome caused outrage among opposition MPs, and an angry public reaction to press reports. As a result, on 4 November, the government reversed its position and announced that a vote would still take place on whether Paterson should be suspended. Following that decision, Paterson announced his intention to resign from parliament. \c\cHe was appointed as Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead on 5 November, the process by which an MP's resignation is effected.  The writ of election was moved by Conservative Chief Whip Mark Spencer on 9 November. The by-election took place on 16 December. \c\cThere were 14 candidates in the by-election. \c\cOn 4 November, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party had discussions about possibly standing aside in the by-election and backing a joint independent "anti-sleaze" candidate. This had previously happened in the seat of Tatton at the 1997 general election where independent candidate Martin Bell beat Neil Hamilton. Bell was approached by the Liberal Democrats ahead of the by-election in North Shropshire, but declined to stand. Labour, and subsequently the Liberal Democrats, announced that they would be standing their own candidates. \c\cOn 6 November, Reform UK announced their candidate as Kirsty Walmsley, who was previously a councillor on Shropshire Council for the Conservative Party, which her father Keith Barrow led on the Council. Walmsley said, "I would never had  [sic] stood against Owen Paterson. He is a man of integrity who had worked hard for North Shropshire."\c\cOn 13 November, the Conservatives picked their candidate, Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, from a three-person shortlist. Shastri-Hurst is a barrister, former British Army Medical Officer and honorary NHS consultant. His links to the constituency relate to his time training at Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital near Oswestry and a period stationed at the Tern Hill barracks near Market Drayton. Also on the shortlist were local Shropshire Councillor for Worfield (in Ludlow constituency), Richard Marshall and Birmingham City Councillor Charlotte Hodivala. \c\cThe Shropshire Star reported Labour's shortlist for the candidacy included David Hallam (previously Herefordshire and Shropshire MEP), Kuldip Sahota (former Telford & Wrekin Council leader, who actually did not apply) and Graeme Currie (Labour candidate for North Shropshire at the 2019 general election). On 14 November, the Labour Party announced their candidate to be Ben Wood from Oswestry. Graeme Currie, the Labour candidate in the seat in the 2019 general election, was blocked from the party's shortlist of candidates and said he would resign from the party in response. \c\cThe Shropshire Star reported on 11 November that the Liberal Democrats had approached Martin Bell to stand as their candidate. Bell reportedly declined citing age and the size of the Conservative majority. Former Ludlow MP Matthew Green and Shropshire County Councillor Alex Wagner were also reported as potential candidates. On 16 November, the Liberal Democrats announced that Helen Morgan, who contested the seat in the 2019 general election, had been re-selected. Morgan is a chartered accountant who was born and raised in the rural West Midlands and has lived in North Shropshire since 2014. \c\cThe Green candidate was Duncan Kerr, who stood in the constituency for the party in the 2015 and 2017 general elections, but not in 2019. \c\cYolande Kenward stood on an anti-corruption platform as an independent, although she was shown on the ballot paper with no label. The other independent, Suzie Akers-Smith, is a independent councillor on Cheshire East Council and the local authority's Cycling and Walking Champion. \c\cDrew Galdron, under the name Boris Been-Bunged, a Boris Johnson impersonator, stood for the Rejoin EU Party. \c\cMonaco-based Russell Dean, a consultant for a yacht broker who grew up in Shropshire, stood for The Party Party. \c\cHard eurosceptic minor party candidates were: UKIP's Andrea Allen, a former modern languages teacher and the party's parish councillor and chair of the Whitchurch Town Twinning Association; the Reclaim Party's Martin Daubney who represented the West Midlands in the European Parliament between 2019 and 2020 while a member of the Brexit Party; and Heritage's James Elliot, an electrical contractor.\t\t\t\c\cThe Monster Raving Loony party fielded its party leader Alan "Howling Laud" Hope. \c\cThe anti-lockdown Freedom Alliance fielded Earl Jesse as its candidate. \c\cAn editorial in The Guardian newspaper suggested that tactical voting for the Liberal Democrats be employed by the electorate to try to reduce the Conservative majority in the seat, saying "Labour voters ought to set aside their tribal loyalty and back the Lib Dem candidate". \c\cSarah Biffen, the widow of John Biffen, the former Conservative MP for the area, endorsed the Conservative candidate, Shastri-Hurst, comparing his background in the NHS and the Army with that of her late husband, a former cabinet minister who represented the area now covered by the North Shropshire constituency from 1961 until 1997. \c\cWill Hutton, former editor of The Observer, endorsed the Liberal Democrats and called on Labour and Green Party supporters to "put aside their prime party affiliation and back the Lib Dem candidate". Martin Fletcher, former associate editor and foreign editor of The Times, endorsed the Liberal Democrats, specifically calling on Conservative voters to back Morgan with the aim of ending Boris Johnson's leadership of the Conservative Party. \c\cSeveral[which?] candidates are running on an anti-corruption ticket; others are using it in their campaign material, including Labour's. Several local issues have also featured in the campaign, including local funding. Katy Balls in The Spectator analysed the effect that the variety of problems currently facing the government, and impacting Boris Johnson's popularity (which include tax rises, English Channel migrant crossings and the controversy surrounding the resignation of Paterson, the former MP of the constituency), might have on the election result. She said that a Lib Dem source commented that "Peppa Pig has come up more than sleaze" and that local issues such as the ambulance services, and questions over the Tory candidate being based in Birmingham were being raised by electors. \c\cThe Financial Times reported that Labour strategists regarded North Shropshire inhospitable for their party and not worth spending resources on. One Labour strategist suggests the Liberal Democrats stood a better chance in the seat, saying: "the Lib Dems have focused on Shropshire North and they\'ll probably end up a good second there. They came second in the recent local elections — from their perspective it makes sense for them to concentrate their resources there." Labour finished second in the constituency at the 2019 United Kingdom general election. Ian Dunt, writing in the i, suggested that despite standing a candidate "[Labour] seems to be standing aside for Davey so the Lib Dems can monopolise the anti-government vote" as part of an informal Labour-Lib Dem pact, where one party stands aside to give the other a higher chance of beating the Conservative candidate. The Guardian reported that Labour's Shadow Minister for International Development Yasmin Qureshi "effectively acknowledged the party had deliberately left the field clear for the Lib Dems", after she told Times Radio that "Labour are never going to win North Shropshire. The Lib Dems do have an opportunity to do so."\c\cIn the wake of the Downing Street Christmas party controversy which broke on 7 December, The Guardian reported that opinion in the constituency was divided, and voter apathy had risen. \c\cA poll of postal voters by the Liberal Democrats, reported on 2 December, put them in second place, with both the Conservative and Labour vote shares falling relative to the 2019 general election. A polling analyst has said that these results should be treated "with a pinch of salt" because the polling methodology was not published. The Liberal Democrats\' poll was contradicted by David Hallam, former Labour MEP for Herefordshire and Shropshire, who said an internal polling, reported on 7 December, put Labour in second place behind the Conservatives.[better source needed] On 11 December The Observer reported that an internal memo to Liberal Democrat staff stated that the Conservatives were only one percentage point ahead of the Liberal Democrats. \c\cIn response to comments by the Conservative Home Secretary, Priti Patel, about the expulsion of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, the Liberal Democrat candidate, Helen Morgan, compared Patel with Hitler's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels. Morgan later apologised for the "insensitive tweet which I have taken down". According to the Shropshire Star, Morgan had already apologised a few days earlier for comments from 2020 in which she "appeared to liken Channel migrants to Jews held at Auschwitz". \c\cDuring the campaign, a sitting Conservative Councillor in the constituency, Anthony Allen, announced that he was defecting from the Conservative Party, saying they "were not Conservative enough", and joined the Reclaim Party. A second sitting Conservative councillor defected to Reform UK. \c\cLocal newspaper the Shropshire Star reported on 8 December that bookmakers are divided over whether the Conservative or the Liberal Democrat candidate are the favourite to win the by-election, following controversy over a reported Christmas party at 10 Downing Street that may have broken the Covid-19 lockdown rules in place at the time. The newspaper stated that, other than the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, "No other party has been seen as a likely challenger to the seat". By 11 December The Independent reported that the Liberal Democrats were favourites with every major bookmaker. They also reported that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, and poor weather conditions may affect the turnout. \c\cOn 13 December it was reported that Reform Party candidate Kirsty Walmsley had tested positive for Coronavirus, and would therefore miss out on the last few days of the campaign as well as the vote count.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia is part of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Colombia on 6 March 2020. From 17 March to 1 September 2020, Colombia denied entry to those who were not Colombian citizens, permanent residents or diplomats, and from 30 September 2020 through 2 June 2021, a negative PCR test result issued within 96 hours prior to departure was required to enter the country by air. Sea borders reopened on 1 December 2020. Land and river borders with four neighboring countries reopened on 19 May 2021, while those with Venezuela remained closed. \c\cUp to June 2021, the country has experienced three waves of the pandemic since its onset in March 2020. Infections and deaths first peaked in August 2020, again in January 2021 following the Christmas holidays, and reached new highs beginning in April 2021 and extending to June 2021. Martha Ospina, director of the National Institute of Health (INS), gave several reasons for the April 2021 wave. People had relaxed their personal biosecurity habits and begun to gather again; many people, especially in Bogotá and Medellín, had never been infected and were thus more susceptible to infection; and extra risk was posed by new SARS-CoV-2 variants including B.1.111 (the second most common type in Colombia, which is a more infectious type) and recent detection of the Gamma (P.1) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) variants. \c\c"Confirmed COVID-19" was the primary cause of death in Colombia in 2020, where the virus caused over 50,000 fatalities by the end of the calendar year. An additional 13,000 deaths in Colombia that year were suspected to be caused by COVID-19, making "suspected COVID-19" the third most common cause of death. The "confirmed COVID-19" death toll doubled during the first half of 2021, reaching 100,000 before the end of June (including all deaths from the beginning of the pandemic). \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which had been reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. By early February 2020, the global death toll for COVID-19 had already exceeded that of SARS of 2003. Although the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 was much lower than SARS of 2003, COVID-19 was more contagious; this was known by March 2020. \c\cOn 6 March, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection confirmed Colombia's first case of coronavirus, a 19-year-old female patient who recently travelled to Milan, Italy. \c\cOn 9 March, two more cases were confirmed. \c\cOn 11 March, six more cases were confirmed, three in Medellín, two in Bogotá and one in Cartagena. Later on the same day, three more cases were confirmed, bringing the total to 9. \c\cOn 12 March, four more cases were confirmed, two in Bogotá and two in Neiva. Authorities declared a health emergency, suspending all public events involving more than 500 people, as well as implementing measures intended to keep cruise ships from docking in any national port. \c\cOn 13 March, three new cases were reported, one in Bogotá, one in Palmira and the other in Villavicencio. President Iván Duque announced that as of 16 March, entry to Colombia will be restricted for visitors who have been in Europe or Asia within the past 14 days. Colombian citizens and residents who have been in Europe or Asia can be admitted into the country, but must undergo a 14-day self-quarantine as a precaution. \c\cAdditionally, Duque announced Colombia would shut down all of its border crossings with Venezuela, effective as of 14 March. Associated Press reported that experts are worried that the Venezuelan refugee crisis could boost the spread of the virus. \c\cOn the night of 15 March, the Health Ministry announced 11 new cases, bringing the total up to 45. Of those 11, 6 were in Bogotá, 4 in Neiva and 1 in the town of Facatativá. Additionally, President Iván Duque, along with the Ministries of Health and Education, announced suspension of classes for all public and private schools and universities in the country. \c\cOn the morning of 16 March, nine new cases were reported in Bogotá. Later that same day, three additional cases were also reported in Bogotá, bringing the total to 57. President Iván Duque declared all land and sea borders be closed in conjunction with the governments of Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. Córdoba, Meta and Santander Departments issued curfews to avoid the spread of the virus. \c\cOn the morning of 17 March, Colombia's Health Ministry confirmed 8 more cases. Later the same day, they confirmed another 10 cases, bringing the total to 75. Cartagena's mayor extended the curfew, which previously applied only to the tourist city center from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 am, to the whole city from 6:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. during weekdays, and for 24 hours during weekends. Bogotá mayor Claudia López, announced a mandatory isolation drill for the extended weekend, from 20 to 23 March. The Bogotá drill allowed exceptions for the elderly and disabled and delivery personnel to move around. Pet owners were authorized to take animals outside for 20 minutes and one person per family could leave to purchase supplies. \c\cOn 17 March, at 9:00 pm local time (UTC–5), President Iván Duque spoke to the Colombians and declared the state of emergency, announcing that he would take economic measures that were announced the following day. The first measure taken seeking the protection of the elderly is to decree mandatory isolation from 7:00 am on 20 March to 31 May for all adults over 70 years of age. They must remain in their residences except to stock up on food or access health or financial services. Government entities were instructed to make it easier for them to receive their pensions, medicines, healthcare or food at home. \c\cOn the evening of 20 March, President Iván Duque announced a 19-day nationwide quarantine, starting on 24 March at midnight and ending on 12 April at midnight. \c\cOn 21 March, the Ministry of Health confirmed the first death from coronavirus in Colombia, a 58-year-old man who worked as a taxi driver in Cartagena who died on 16 March and reportedly carried Italian tourists on his taxi on 4 March. According to authorities, the person started presenting symptoms two days later. Initially, COVID-19 had been dismissed as the cause of his death as he had tested negative for coronavirus, however, his sister had tested positive for the disease. After the patient's decease, the National Health Institute (INS) analyzed two tests from him, both of which were negative with one of those being taken improperly, but decided to keep the investigation open owing to his sister's condition. Eventually, the INS concluded that the taxi driver was her only possible source of contagion, therefore attributing his death to the new virus in spite of the laboratory evidence stating otherwise. \c\cOn 22 March, the Ministry of Health confirmed the second death linked to the virus, a 70-year-old woman from Yumbo whose daughter had returned from Cuba on 2 March and reported to have had contact with two people from the United States, one of which had tested positive for coronavirus. In addition to this, 21 new cases were reported, bringing the total up to 231. \c\cOn 26 March, only 21 new positive cases were confirmed, which represented a decrease from previous days when over 90 positive cases were reported. According to the INS, this decrease was due to damage to the machine that prepared the samples for processing and subsequent diagnosis of COVID-19, which affected the speed at which results were being produced. \c\cOn 6 April, President Iván Duque announced in his daily broadcast an extension of the nationwide lockdown until 27 April to curtail further transmission of the coronavirus. During said broadcast Health Minister Fernando Ruíz revealed that infection numbers were lower than initially expected. While the country was expected to have over 5,700 cases by 4 April according to initial estimates, the actual number by that day was just over 1,400. At the same time it was announced that businesses affected by the lockdown would benefit from up to COP 12 trillion (US$2.9 billion) in credits. \c\cOn 9 April, Bogotá mayor Claudia López announced gender-based quarantine measures, known as Pico y género, to reduce circulation of the population. Under this rule, women can go out for essential tasks, like grocery shopping, on even-numbered days, while men can go out on odd-numbered days. The rule explicitly allows for self-designation of gender identity where it mentions the existence of transgender people; nonetheless, the rule has had a harmful impact on the transgender community. Informal workers who rely on daily labor for wages have also been harmed by the quarantine. In other departments and municipalities, transit-restriction measures such as Pico y cédula, which allow people to go out for essential tasks on specific days of the week according to the last digit of their ID (cédula) were implemented. \c\cOn 10 April, INPEC reported the first death of a prisoner by COVID-19: a 63-year-old man who had been held in the Villavicencio prison until 1 April and died six days later at the city's local hospital. The following day, a 78-year-old inmate at the same prison died as well and another one was confirmed to have tested positive for coronavirus, who would die on 17 April. That same day, 13 inmates and seven guards were reported to be active COVID-19 cases. By 23 April, the outbreak at Villavicencio prison was reported to have extended to 109 cases. \c\cOn 20 April, President Iván Duque announced a further extension of the nationwide lockdown until 11 May, but allowed the construction and manufacturing sectors to reopen starting from 27 April, under specific protocols. International and domestic commercial flights would remain suspended until the end of May, as would inter-municipal transport. On the other hand, public transport within cities was required to operate at a maximum of 35% capacity. Individual exercise was also allowed. \c\cOn 5 May, President Iván Duque announced a further extension of the nationwide lockdown for two weeks, until 25 May at midnight. He also announced that more economic sectors would be allowed to re-open under strict protocols starting from 11 May: automobile, furniture, and clothing manufacturing industries, wholesale trade and certain retailers such as laundries, bookstores and stationeries. Children aged 6–17 would be allowed to go outside three times a week for 30 minutes, with those aged 14 and under required to be accompanied by an adult who does not belong to a high-risk group (people over 70 years old or with underlying medical conditions). In addition to that, municipalities without confirmed COVID-19 cases would also be able to start re-opening their economic sectors, in coordination with mayors, governors and the national government. Bars, dine-in restaurants, gyms, and clubs would remain closed, and massive events would remain forbidden. \c\cOn 8 May, Bogotá mayor Claudia López announced new measures regarding the planned reactivation of the economy. All permitted construction works with safety protocols in place could resume by 11 May, working from 10 a.m. to 7 pm. Manufacturing companies with safety protocols in place could request permission to resume operations as early as 18 May, between 10 a.m and 5 a.m. (for this sector, which may have more than one work shift, business hours will depend on the size of the company), while wholesale traders and retailers may resume beginning 25 May, from noon to midnight. As the economic reactivation would make the pico y género measure unworkable, given that more people would need to leave their homes to go to work regardless of gender, this restriction was lifted on 11 May. An "orange alert" was declared for some neighborhoods in Kennedy, the locality with the most COVID-19 cases in the city. Residents of those sectors would be subject to a strict quarantine, only able to go out for essential tasks. Street sales and outside physical activity were prohibited in the area. These zones were to be monitored by health authorities for two weeks. \c\cThat same day, the National Health Institute reported 595 new confirmed cases on its daily report, raising the total of confirmed cases to 10,051. Bogotá was the region with the highest number of new cases, with 225. 21 new deaths were reported, raising the total to 228, and 2,424 people had recovered. Moreover, the institution reported that 4,387 tests were processed that day, and over 123,700 tests had been processed since the start of the outbreak in March. \c\cWith Mother's Day in Colombia being celebrated on the second Sunday of May (10 May in 2020) and given that the holiday is considered a critical one by authorities due to the high consumption of alcohol, gatherings and brawls, several departments and municipalities decreed curfews and prohibition of the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages (ley seca) within their jurisdictions for the weekend between Friday night and Monday morning to prevent further spread of coronavirus as well. \c\cOn 14 May the National Government, through a decree issued by the Ministry of Interior, ordered the governor of the Amazonas Department as well as the mayor of Leticia the closure of every opened economic activity in the municipality and the department except for the ones strictly necessary for health, supply and essential services and declared a lockdown for that specific zone of the country until 30 May. This decision was reached due to the fast spread of coronavirus in the Amazonas Department since the confirmation of the first positive case in the department on 17 April, with 924 confirmed cases and 90 out of every 10,000 inhabitants being diagnosed with COVID-19. According to the reports by the INS, it was the highest rate in the country, ahead of Bogotá with 5.5 infected people per 10,000 inhabitants as of that day. \c\cOn 17 May, a humanitarian flight arrived in Colombia with 366 Colombian nationals. Due to travel restrictions, they had been stranded in other countries on four continents. Upon returning to Colombia, they were required to isolate for 14 days. \c\cOn 19 May, President Iván Duque announced a fourth extension of the national lockdown until 31 May, as well as the extension of the national health emergency until 31 August. Starting from 1 June, the country would enter a new stage in which reactivation of museums, libraries and domestic service activities would be evaluated, schools and universities were confirmed to continue under the modality of virtual education until August, when universities would be allowed to reopen under a model of alternation between classroom and virtual classes. People over 70 would have to remain isolated until 30 June. \c\cOn 23 May, the INS reported a total of 20,177 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,046 new cases on its daily report, being this the first time the country reported over 1,000 infected people in 24 hours since the confirmation of the first case on 6 March. \c\cOn 28 May, a further extension of the national lockdown in place since March until 1 July was announced. At the same time, more businesses such as hairdressers and barbers, as well as malls would be allowed to reopen from 1 June, at the discretion of local mayors, while allowing more freedom of movement in some parts of the country. However, local authorities of cities with high rates of infection such as Bogotá, Cali (where an "orange alert" was declared), Barranquilla and Cartagena had already announced that movement restrictions would remain in place and reopening of economic activities would be delayed for at least two more weeks. \c\cOn 30 May, Bogotá mayor Claudia López announced a total lockdown for the Kennedy locality for two weeks starting from 1 June and extending to 14 June at midnight. The decision was reached given that the zone had over 2,000 positive cases for COVID-19, the highest number of cases in the city. All exemptions to leave the locality were rescinded, except for essential tasks. All economic sectors that had resumed activities in Kennedy were also suspended, as well as every outside physical activity. \c\cOn 2 June Colombia reported 40 new deaths, with which the country exceeded the figure of 1,000 deaths from COVID-19, reaching a total of 1,009. Up to that day, Bogotá reported the highest number of total deaths with 258. On the evening of that day, the Ministry of Education issued guidelines to regional and local education authorities as well as private schools and kindergartens stating that students would remain studying from home until 31 July, and inviting them to arrange for protocols for the gradual return of students to classrooms under a model of alternation starting from 1 August, in coordination with health authorities. This announcement was not well received by parents, who expressed their concerns over the health of their children. On 16 June, associations of private schools stated their intention to not return to classroom classes and finish the school year with virtual education. \c\cIn its daily report for 7 June, the Health Ministry confirmed the first positive case in the Guaviare Department, with which every department of Colombia has reported at least one case of COVID-19. \c\cOn 15 June, Bogotá mayor Claudia López declared an "orange alert" for the city's hospital system, considering that occupation of intensive care units in the city had surpassed 54%. The alert meant that, starting from 16 June, the District through its Regulatory Center for Urgencies and Emergencies (CRUE in Spanish) would officially take over administration and control of all ICU units in both public and private hospitals, and would refer COVID-19 patients requiring a unit to them according to proximity and availability criteria. López also announced the introduction of the Pico y cédula measure to control access to commercial and service establishments, such as banks, supermarkets, and notaries, as well as a two-week total lockdown for zones in the Ciudad Bolívar, Suba, Engativá, and Bosa localities. In Barranquilla, an "orange alert" with similar measures for the city's hospital system was declared by mayor Jaime Pumarejo due to the steady increase of positive cases in the city, which reported 798 new cases on 15 June, over twice the number of new cases recorded in Bogotá that day. \c\cOn 16 June, it became known that a group of twenty-five personalities over the age of 70, led by former Minister of Finance Rudolf Hommes, former Minister of Interior and Vice-President Humberto De la Calle, former Minister for Employment and acting mayor of Bogotá Clara López Obregón and politician Álvaro Leyva, as well as former mayor of Cali Maurice Armitage, nicknamed the Rebelión de las canas ("Gray hair rebellion"), lodged a tutelage action against the National Government as they considered their fundamental rights were being violated by the mobility restrictions set in place for the elderly population during the pandemic. They also argued they were being discriminated by the Government by being singled out as a special group and protecting them against their own will, thus negating their autonomy to make decisions regarding their own protection. In response to that, President Iván Duque stated that they were not being discriminated, and that the measures in place were aimed at taking care of them and protecting their lives. \c\cOn 21 June, the Health Ministry reported 111 deaths in the last 24 hours, being the first time Colombia recorded 100 daily deaths since the start of the pandemic. By that day, over half of the municipalities in the country (575 out of 1,122) had reported cases of COVID-19 compared to only 196 in April, meaning that each day six new municipalities were reporting positive cases. Five municipalities concentrated 65.2% of all positive cases: Bogotá, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Cali, and Soledad in the Atlántico Department, while that department as well as San Andrés had reported cases in all of their municipalities. On the other hand, 129 municipalities were already without active cases, those having either recovered or died. During the previous week, the pandemic had accelerated with the country reporting 10,000 cases in just four days, having taken two months to report that same amount at the start of the pandemic. Moreover, the case fatality rate per million inhabitants increased fourfold from 8 May, going from 9 to 39. \c\cOn 23 June, President Iván Duque announced a sixth extension of the nationwide lockdown until 15 July, with the same restrictions and exceptions that were in place up to that moment. The reopening of economic sectors would still be subject to the discretion of local authorities, while pilot programs to test the reopening of additional sectors such as restaurants and places of religious worship were announced to be held in municipalities with low numbers of coronavirus infections. \c\cOn 1 July the Ministry of Health reported 4,163 new cases out of 18,054 processed samples, with which Colombia exceeded the figure of 100,000 positive cases for COVID-19, reaching a total of 102,009. 136 deaths and 1,334 recoveries were also reported on that day, for a total of 3,470 and 43,407, respectively. \c\cOn 3 July it was revealed that a judge of Bogotá ruled in favour of the tutelage action lodged by the "Rebelión de las canas" group, ordering the Government to allow the elderly population to leave their homes for outdoor physical exercise two hours every day instead of an hour thrice a week as they were being allowed. In response to this ruling, President Iván Duque said that he would comply with the ruling, but exhorted the elderly population to stay at home on account of the evidence of the lethality of the virus in this segment of the population. Based on this, he announced that the Government would lodge an appeal against the ruling. \c\cOn 7 July, a further extension of the nationwide lockdown until 1 August was announced by President Iván Duque, who also confirmed that municipalities with no coronavirus infections or with low infection rates would be allowed to open restaurants, theaters and gyms under strict protocols at the request of mayors. According to the President, as of that day 490 out of the country's 1,122 municipalities had not reported any COVID-19 cases, while 100 had low infection rates and a further 295 had not reported cases in the last three weeks. It was also announced that a pilot for reactivation of domestic flights was authorized to be carried out in the route between Bucaramanga and Cúcuta, with the date for the first flight to be decided by mutual agreement with the authorities of both cities. On 16 July, Duque confirmed that this first pilot would be held on 21 July. \c\cOn 9 July, mayor of Cali Jorge Iván Ospina announced that ivermectin would start being used experimentally to treat patients with COVID-19 in the city who are in the early stages of the disease with the aim of preventing the symptoms from worsening and curtail the viral load, thus reducing the number of severe cases that would require admission to intensive care units. The medication, primarily used to treat parasite infestations, was reported to have been used in Ecuador, Peru, and Cuba with positive results. Despite having pointed out that there was no scientific evidence on the effectiveness of ivermectin to treat patients with COVID-19, the National Institute for Food and Drug Surveillance (Invima) greenlit the conduct of a clinical study in Cali with 400 patients for 28 days to determine its effectiveness as a treatment. After the announcement by mayor Ospina, it was reported that citizens in Cali headed to drugstores to buy ivermectin, leading authorities and health experts to tell citizens to not self-medicate themselves. \c\cOn 10 July, mayor of Bogotá Claudia López announced a series of 14-day sectorized lockdowns to be enforced from 13 July as a measure to cope with the peak of the pandemic, which was expected to occur in the city by early August. Fifteen out of the city's 20 localities were split into three groups, with the first of those comprising the Ciudad Bolívar, San Cristóbal, Rafael Uribe Uribe, Chapinero, Santa Fe, Usme, Los Mártires and Tunjuelito localities being under lockdown from 13 to 26 July. The second group, comprising the Bosa, Kennedy, Puente Aranda and Fontibón localities, would be under lockdown from 27 July to 9 August, while the last group, comprising the Suba, Engativá and Barrios Unidos localities would be under lockdown from 10 to 23 August. \c\cOn 13 July, and due to the steady increase of COVID-19 cases in Medellín and the Antioquia Department, mayor of Medellín Daniel Quintero declared a "state of total care" (Estado de cuidado total) in coordination with department and national governments. The declaration implied that strict lockdowns would be enforced in Medellín and the other municipalities making up the Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley every weekend, with four days of opening and three days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) of closure per week. In case of a holiday falling on Monday, that day would also be included in the periods of closure. Mayor Quintero would confirm on 28 July that he had tested positive for the disease, being asymptomatic. \c\cBy 16 July, and despite the expansion of hospital capacity that had been carried out since the onset of the pandemic to strengthen the country's health system, several cities were already reporting high percentages of ICU occupancy: 91% in Bogotá, 86% in Medellín, 95% in Cali, and 82% in Montería, while Riohacha and Quibdó reported less than 10 units still available in each city. In Barranquilla, where an orange alert was declared in mid-June and had ICU occupancy peak at 90%, occupancy was reported to have lowered to 73%. \c\cOn 28 July, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz stated in an interview with W Radio that Colombia had signed confidentiality agreements with two pharmaceutical companies for the acquisition of a vaccine for COVID-19. The companies with which those agreements had been signed were reported to be Pfizer and AstraZeneca, which at the time was developing a vaccine along with the University of Oxford. According to the minister's estimate, six million people were expected to be vaccinated in a first stage, and in addition to twose two agreements, Ruiz stated that the country would be looking to reach agreements with at least three other companies. That same day, the daily number of new positive cases surpassed 10,000 for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, with 10,284 new cases being reported by the National Health Institute. During his daily broadcast, President Iván Duque announced a further extension of the nationwide lockdown for one month until 30 August, stating that municipalities with none or low COVID-19 infections would continue with the reopening of economic sectors avoiding large gatherings, while areas with high infection rates would continue under more stringent restrictions. \c\cOn 5 August, former President of Colombia Álvaro Uribe was confirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19, being asymptomatic. His two sons Tomás and Jerónimo were also reported to have tested positive. \c\cOn 11 August, it was announced that the Ministries of Health and the Interior greenlit pilot plans for operation of six routes from José María Córdova International Airport in Rionegro, which serves Medellín. The routes authorized to operate, starting from 18 August, were the ones from Rionegro to Bucaramanga, Cúcuta, Pereira, Manizales, Armenia, and San Andrés Island. By 13 August, it was confirmed that 15 airports had been enabled to resume operations with pilot flights: in addition to Bucaramanga, Cúcuta and Rionegro, Palmira (serving Cali), Soledad (serving Barranquilla), Cartagena, Santa Marta, Armenia, Pereira, Manizales, Medellín, Montería, Bogotá, Chachagüí (serving Pasto) and San Andrés were all approved to resume operations upon agreement between local authorities of their respective cities, with Villavicencio also expected to present a proposal for resumption of flights to and from said city. Mayor of Bogotá Claudia López stated that flight operation from Bogotá would be resumed as of 1 September with flights to Cartagena, Leticia and San Andrés, destinations approved by the Ministry of Health considering that by then they would have passed the peak of the pandemic and that, in addition, meet epidemiological criteria. Additionally, it was announced that a negative COVID-19 test would be required to enter San Andrés Island, which travellers would have to take two days before the flight. \c\cOn 12 August the authorities of Caquetá Department and its capital Florencia made a decision to put the entire department under lockdown for 10 days starting on 15 August and ending on 25 August due to the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, which saw the number of total cases in the department go up from 300 to 2,794 in the three most recent weeks. After an analysis by the Caquetá branch of the Colombian Medical College, a strict quarantine was seen as a possible efficient measure to lower both the contagion curve as well as the pressure on the medical services of the department, with ICU occupation surpassing 90% and delays of up to 10 days in the delivery of test results. \c\cOn 13 August, mayor of Bogotá Claudia López announced that over 1.2 million people living in the localities of Usaquén, Chapinero, Santa Fe, La Candelaria, Teusaquillo, Puente Aranda, and Antonio Nariño would be under a two-week lockdown from 16 to 30 August as these zones still had high speed of virus transmission and affectation. While Puente Aranda, Chapinero, Santa Fe, and Antonio Nariño had already experienced the sectorized lockdown model, those zones were once again quarantined since the aforementioned factors had not been lowered. This announcement was met with mixed reactions: while citizens from some of the localities to go under lockdown praised the decision, other citizens, as well as traders and entrepreneurs voiced their disagreement and staged protests against the measure. \c\cOn 20 August, an outbreak at a nursing home in Manizales was discovered with 74 elderly people testing positive for COVID-19 following an index case detected on 17 August, with the ensuing epidemiological fence and quick tests also confirming 11 residents testing negative, 12 positive cases among the place's workers, and nine others pending a result. One of the infected adults had to be taken to an intensive care unit while others had to be isolated in hotels at the city. \c\cOn 24 August, President Iván Duque announced that the lockdown that was in force in the country since March would end on 1 September, and starting from that day and for at least one month, the country would enter into a new stage named "selective isolation", aimed at isolating only specific cases of people infected or suspected to be infected with the virus and their inner circle while also lifting most restrictions on mobility for the remainder of the population. According to the Colombian government, this decision was reached since most of the country's main cities were experiencing a plateau in their contagion curves and some others had already started a downwards trend in their numbers of new cases and deaths, which would allow to accelerate the economic reactivation of the country. Concerts, sporting events, and others that can cause massive crowds of people would remain forbidden, as well as the consumption of alcohol in public places, while local rulers would be able to retain the power to maintain some control measures, mainly in the cities with the greatest impact. However, President Duque pointed out that the health emergency which was also in place in the country would be extended until 30 November. \c\cThat same day, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz confirmed the participation of Colombian volunteers in the Phase III trials of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. The clinical trials were scheduled to take place in September 2020, once the report on the previous stages of the vaccine was available. In this announcement, Ruiz added that a confidentiality agreement to allow the country access to the vaccine had already been signed. \c\cOn 26 August, a new decree in Bogotá specifically prohibited indoor entertainment including bars, dance clubs, gambling casinos, and video game arcades. It remained unclear whether outdoor amusement parks would be legally permitted. The Colombian Association of Attractions and Amusement Parks (Acolap), which has six open-air parks in Bogotá, planned to reopen. \c\cOn 8 September, it was revealed that a 41-year man who had traveled from Bogotá to Cartagena by plane on 2 September on business matters, and had passed all screening and biosafety filters at both airports died of COVID-19. The passenger started showing symptoms in the evening of the same day of the trip, and was admitted to a hospital three days later as his condition worsened, testing positive and passing away shortly afterwards. Following the discovery, health authorities in Cartagena proceeded to track all passengers of the flight as well as all possible close contacts who might have been within 2 metres of the patient to perform an epidemiological fence and further tests if required. \c\cBy that day, there was a sharp drop in the number of confirmed daily infections, despite the fact that the average number of daily tests carried out was maintained (between 20,000 and 25,000 PCR and between 7,000 and 10,000 antigen ones), with the health authority reporting on 7 September 5,327 new infections in the last 24 hours, after 21,856 PCR tests and 8,760 antigen tests were processed, while in the previous three days over 8,000 infections were reported on average, thus signaling a decreasing trend. Daily deaths also dropped, going down to 203 that day and going back to levels reached one or two months prior. \c\cOn 10 September, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz made an analysis of the situation of the pandemic in the country six months after its onset. According to Ruiz, the pandemic had developed in the country in a similar way to that of the rest of the world, and identified four moments according to the degree of affectation of the different cities of the country. A first moment, with a very quick, high and severe impact was experienced in Leticia, with affectation in said city being more similar to the situation in Brazil, and later a second moment in coastal cities such as Barranquilla, Cartagena, Buenaventura and Tumaco, as well as Quibdó. The third wave, which was being experienced at the moment, involved peaks in the main cities such as Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali, while a fourth wave was being expected in middle cities such as Bucaramanga, Cúcuta, Popayán, Pasto and others with a slower growth of cases such as Manizales in which positive cases were already starting to spike. Finally, there would be a last moment involving very dispersed areas of the country as well as small municipalities where the impact had been very low until then. \c\cIn mid-September, it was known that Senator Carlos Fernando Motoa petitioned the National Institute of Health to explain the reasons for the decline on the number of daily tests taken, which were sharply decreasing in the most recent weeks in spite of the fact that the country had the capability to perform 50,000 daily tests. In response to this petition, INS director Martha Ospina explained, in a document sent to the Senate's Seventh Commission, that processing by laboratories was not being delayed as they were reading all samples and releasing results within 30 hours, with some of them within 9 hours, and that the decrease in the number of tests was due to several factors including the decrease in the number of hospitalized and ICU patients due to COVID-19, changes in testing guidelines, decrease in massive screening, non-compliance of some laboratories with the rate defined by decree for tests, and refusal of people to take the test. \c\cOn 21 September, mayor of Bogotá Claudia López announced the lifting of several restrictions that were in place in the city to be able to mobilize or access commercial products and services which were part of the measures implemented to contain the pandemic, such as the pico y cédula, which restricted access to commercial establishments, while also allowing restaurants and other economic sectors to open every day, instead of some days per week as it was being enforced. The only restrictions that were left in place were those regarding entry times by sectors, to prevent thousands of people from converging in the city's public transport system at peak hours. \c\cOn 28 September, President Iván Duque announced the extension of the selective isolation stage in force since 1 September until the end of October, keeping the restrictions that were in place for such stage. \c\cOn 2 October, it was known that three people arriving by humanitarian flights from Madrid, Lima and Mexico City in the evening of 30 September entered the country while being positive for COVID-19. According to Migración Colombia, the passengers were allowed to board the flights despite showing the positive tests and after doing the same upon arrival to Colombia, the biosecurity protocol was activated and the three citizens were isolated. In addition to that, the other passengers of those flights were now compelled to isolate and test themselves. It was also reported that in the evening of 4 October a woman with her baby, both also positive for COVID-19, entered the country from Cancún, Mexico in a flight operated by the airline Wingo. \c\cOn 5 October, in a flight from Medellín to Bogotá operated by Avianca, a group of musicians of the Medellín Philharmonic Orchestra offered a concert to the passengers using wind instruments such as trumpets, which generated widespread criticism against the airline for breaching biosecurity protocols as those instruments have been considered by experts to help spread the virus in closed spaces such as an aircraft cabin. The following day, Migración Colombia director Juan Francisco Espinoza informed that up to that day, 70 passengers had been refused entry into the country for failing to present a negative PCR test result, while the Civil Aeronautics announced the opening of investigations against both Wingo and Avianca in response to the incidents involving both airlines. \c\cOn 7 October, the Phase III clinical trials of the vaccine developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica began, with the application of the first dose to a volunteer in Floridablanca. The trials of this vaccine were being carried out in 10 medical centers throughout the country, however, on 12 October Johnson & Johnson announced it would pause temporarily the trials since one volunteer became ill with "an unexplained disease". \c\cOn 19 October, the Colombian government reported that 242 medical teams were attacked between January and September 2020, a 63 percent increase over 2019. Attacks ranged from threats and discrimination to injuries to health personnel. According to the Health Ministry of Colombia, about 38 per cent of the cases of aggression against health workers occurred in a context related to the pandemic, with nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers, technicians and assistants being accused of medical negligence or discriminated against for being considered a source of contagion. \c\cOn 20 October, the Colombian government announced a ban on public Halloween celebrations on 31 October. According to Health Minister Fernando Ruiz, the decision was reached since there was scientific evidence that parties and gatherings have been the main cause of new COVID-19 infections in Europe, while the high rate of population at risk in the country did not allow to make way for situations in which their lives could be endangered. Moreover, candy-picking tours on streets and shopping malls were deemed to generate supercontagators, spreading the virus as they go from door to door. Lastly, the country was on a downwards yet still fragile trend in the epidemic curve, and celebrations such as Halloween could cause troubles to keep said trend. In addition to this, territorial entities were free to set curfews for the weekend, with several departamental capital cities and intermediate towns such as Bucaramanga, Ibagué, Tunja, Manizales, Armenia, Pereira and Neiva applying the measure. \c\cOn 23 October, Vice-President Marta Lucía Ramírez was confirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19, albeit asymptomatic and in good health. The Colombian government stated she had taken the test on Thursday ahead of a planned conference with local governors, and that she was carrying out the corresponding isolation. President Iván Duque, who had her appear on his nightly television broadcast on Monday, was also tested on Thursday, with the result being negative. \c\cOn 24 October the country reached 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases, becoming the second country in Latin America to report that number in less than a week, after Argentina, as well as the eighth country in the world to have reached that number. On that day, 8,769 new cases, 198 new deaths, and 5,727 new recoveries were reported for a total of 1,007,711 confirmed cases, 30,000 deaths and 907,379 recoveries. \c\cOn 28 October, President Iván Duque announced the extension of the selective isolation stage until 30 November, with the same permissions and restrictions being kept in place through November. \c\cA poll conducted from 9 November to 10 December by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane) found that only half of Colombians wanted to be vaccinated against coronavirus. In Quibdó, 72 percent said they wanted the vaccine, but in Cali, only 43 percent wanted it. Among those who said they did not want the vaccine, most said they feared side effects. \c\cOn 25 November, President Iván Duque extended the state of health emergency for 90 additional days until 28 February 2021. The decision was reached since Tunja and cities in the Coffee Axis such as Manizales and Pereira were still going through their first peak of infection, and prevention measures needed to be reinforced ahead of the start of December. The extension of the health emergency also implied the extension of the selective isolation stage for the same period of time, with its involved restrictions. \c\cOn 28 November, the National Health Institute (INS) released the preliminary findings of its seroprevalence study aimed at determining a more accurate estimate on the percentage of Colombian population that had already had contact with the novel coronavirus, with or without symptoms. The study was being performed in 10 cities through strategies such as mass, random sampling and blood test analysis on over 20,000 people, with the first findings revealing that nearly 60% of screened people in Leticia (59%) and Barranquilla (57%) had developed coronavirus antibodies, which could indicate they could have already been infected, while in Medellín antibodies were found in nearly one in three people (27%). While those results showed that the country has taken steps heading to a potential herd immunity given that the seroprevalence findings were higher than in other countries, it was also evident that the proportion of the population still susceptible to infection was still high and the containment strategies of the virus were not the best. \c\cOn 2 December, former senator Juan José García Romero died of COVID-19 at age 76. \c\cOn 18 December, the Colombian government announced the plan for COVID-19 vaccination to be carried out during 2021, after having secured 40 million doses from Pfizer and AstraZeneca. According to the schedule presented by the government, mass vaccination would begin in February and would be divided into five stages. The first stage will cover all front-line health and support workers, as well as people aged over 80, who are considered the segment of the population at the highest risk. The second stage will cover health workers in the second and third lines of attention, as well as people aged 60 to 79, while the third stage will cover inhabitants aged 16 to 60 with comorbidities as well as the entirety of elementary and high school teachers, to ensure the return of students to face-to-face classes. The first three stages will make up the first phase, in which the objective will be reducing mortality and severe case incidence rates from COVID-19, as well as protecting health workers. The second phase, comprising the last two stages, will be aimed at reducing infection rates to reach herd immunity and will cover institutional caregivers and population involved in risky occupations and situations, as well as the people aged 16 and 60 without comorbidities. To achieve herd immunity, the government expects to vaccinate roughly 70% of the Colombian population, or 35,734,649 people. People who have already suffered the disease, nearly 1.5 million as of that day, will not be included in the vaccination plan, nor will be children under 16 as vaccine tests performed until now have not covered that segment of the population. In all, around 34 million Colombians will be eligible to be vaccinated. \c\cOn 21 December, the National Health Institute (INS) released additional findings of its seroprevalence study in five cities, where about one-third of sampled residents had developed coronavirus antibodies: Bogotá (30%), Bucaramanga (32%), Cúcuta (40%) and Villavicencio (34%). Out of the 10 cities chosen by the INS to carry out this study, the results for Cali, Ipiales, and Guapi were still to be reported. An additional study performed by the University of Córdoba found a 59% seroprevalence in Montería. Considering the seroprevalence reports for these cities, along with the findings for Leticia, Barranquilla, and Medellín that were reported in late November, an estimate of 4.6 million Colombians could have already been infected by coronavirus, half of those in Bogotá and thrice more than the cases found by testing and official records. \c\cWhile there had been 5,539 intensive care beds in Colombia at the beginning of 2019, by the beginning of 2021 hospitals had increased this to 11,905 beds specifically to address the expected needs of COVID-19 patients. In January 2021, three-quarters of these intensive-care beds were occupied. The department of Quindío, with 74% occupancy, was representative of the national average. Bogotá had a higher rate (92% overall occupancy, and 93% occupancy of the beds designated for COVID patients). \c\cOn 20 January, a spokesperson for OPS said that Colombia was in the first group of eligible countries for vaccine distribution through the COVAX strategy as it met the criteria for inclusion due to its preparation and readiness, with distribution likely starting from the first week of February. \c\cOn 21 January, the total number of confirmed deaths in Colombia during the pandemic reached 50,000, with the number of confirmed cases surpassing 2 million two days later. \c\cOn 28 January, Colombia's response to the pandemic was described as the third worst out of a group of 98 countries according to the Lowy Institute, an independent think tank in Australia, only ahead of Brazil and Mexico. \c\cOn 29 January, President Iván Duque announced that the process of mass vaccination in Colombia would begin on 20 February, and also signed the decree for the National Plan of Vaccination which had been announced in December as the country's guideline for mass vaccination. Duque also confirmed the purchase of 10 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 2.5 million doses of the vaccine by Sinovac, which added to 10 million doses from Pfizer–BioNTech, 10 million doses from Oxford–AstraZeneca, 9 million doses from Janssen, and 10 million doses through COVAX would be able to cover the 34 million Colombians eligible for vaccination. \c\cOn 30 January, the National Institute of Health confirmed the detection of the new P.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2 (later to be known under the name "Gamma") which had already been identified in Brazil, in a 24-year-old patient from Tabatinga, Amazonas state of Brazil who crossed the border to seek medical care in Leticia. As a preventive measure to avoid the spread of that new strain into the country, starting from 29 January passenger flights to and from Leticia were suspended for 15 days while flights between Colombia and Brazil were suspended for 30 days. An older adult in Bogotá had already died of COVID-19 caused by P.1 on 28 January, though this was not reported until weeks later. \c\cOn 11 February, Bogotá's District government announced that the temporary policy initiative of "cielo abierto" (open-air operating businesses) would be made permanent. To achieve this, the city will consider adjusting existing restrictions on the use of public space. \c\cTwo hundred international tourists were trapped in Leticia after the highly-contagious Brazilian variant of COVID-19 virus was discovered in the city on 30 January. Two weeks later the Colombian government agreed to fly the tourists out of Alfredo Vásquez Cobo International Airport if the individuals were willing to pay. Regularly scheduled flights to and from the city were due to resume on 2 March. \c\cOn 15 February, the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and BioNTech, containing 50,000 doses, arrived at El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá where it was received by President Iván Duque, Vice President Marta Lucía Ramírez, and Minister of Health Fernando Ruiz. Duque said that this first batch of vaccines will be destined for front-line health and support personnel, while also confirming that the Colombian government expected the arrival of 1,600,000 additional doses within the following 30 days. That same day, Minister Ruiz confirmed that an intensive care nurse from Sincelejo's University Hospital and another nurse from the National Cancerology Institute in Bogotá would be the first two people to be vaccinated in the country, on 17 February. \c\cAs announced by Minister of Health Fernando Ruiz, the Colombian vaccination plan started in the city of Sincelejo on the morning of 17 February with the vaccination of intensive care nurse Verónica Machado, under widespread media coverage. \c\cOn 19 February, the Ministry of Health confirmed that at least 45,000 doses out of the first shipment of 192,000 doses of the vaccine by Sinovac, which were expected to arrive to the country the following day, would be sent to the municipalities of Leticia, Puerto Nariño, Mitú, and Inírida in the departments of Amazonas, Vaupés, and Guainía to immunize the entirety of the population aged over 18. With this decision, the Colombian government intended to build in those three departments, which border Brazil, an epidemiological blockade to contain the Brazilian variant and prevent its arrival in other areas of the country. This exceptional measure did not cover pregnant women nor people with a COVID-19 positive test result earlier than 90 days. \c\cOn 25 February, President Iván Duque announced on his daily broadcast a further extension of the state of health emergency for three months until 31 May 2021. The health emergency was slated to expire on 28 February. \c\cDuring the first two weeks of the vaccination program, 191,480 first doses were administered. Public health expert Luis Jorge Hernández said the distribution was operating under a scarcity mentality given that only 509,724 doses had arrived in Colombia (including the ones already administered), whereas the Health Ministry had expected to have 850,000 by that point. \c\cPresident Duque announced that new curfews would be implemented beginning 26 March. Areas where ICU occupancy was over 50% would have a midnight curfew, and, where the ICU occupancy was over 70%, the curfew would begin two hours earlier. The government was most concerned about the regions of Magdalena, Antioquia, Valle del Cauca, and Atlántico, all of which had occupancy rates of 70–79%. \c\cOn 4 April, the Colombian government issued new measures aimed at curtailing the third wave of the pandemic as well as the increase of new cases in several cities of the country. Starting from 5 April and until 19 April, the government instructed mayors to implement night curfews in cities with ICU occupancy over 50%, with start times varying depending on the occupancy rate of ICUs. Cities with ICU occupancy above 85% should start their curfew at 6:00 pm, cities with occupancy between 80% and 84% should start at 8:00 pm, the ones with occupancy between 70% and 79% should start at 10:00 pm, while the ones with ICU occupancy ranging from 50% to 69% should begin at midnight. For all cases, curfews will end at 5:00 a.m. the following day. The government also suggested the implementation of the pico y cédula measure to restrict individual mobility, with hotels, restaurants, and parks being exempted from the measure. Medellín and Barranquilla, which had ICU occupancy around 90%, additionally planned to implement prohibition. Police in Cali broke up dozens of parties on 10 April, one of which was attended by over 200 people. \c\cBogotá's mayor announced on 13 April that, since the city's ICU occupancy had risen to 75%, quarantine rules would be stricter than originally planned through 19 April and would also be in effect during the weekend of 23–26 April. \c\cOn 16 April, the National Health Institute confirmed the detection of the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2, finding it in two out of the 637 virus genomes sequenced up to that date, which were confirmed to come from samples taken in the Caldas Department. That variant, still of non-predominant circulation in the country, is considered to be more transmissible than the original versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but no more lethal than those. The next day, the Public Health Laboratory of Bogotá and the University of Los Andes confirmed the circulation of that variant as well as the Gamma one in the capital, finding six genomes corresponding to the Alpha variant and five genomes to the Gamma variant. \c\cBy the second week of May, 96% of the ICU beds in Bogotá were full. Mayor Claudia López warned that the hospital system was near collapse due to the occupancy rate. She identified Suba, Engativá, Kennedy, Bosa, and Barrios Unidos as the most contagious areas of the city at that time. On 14 May, López confirmed she had tested positive for COVID-19 and appointed Bogotá's Health Secretary Alejandro Gómez as deputy District Mayor for the duration of her period of isolation. \c\cWith nearly 15,000 confirmed deaths and over 500,000 new COVID-19 cases, May 2021 became the deadliest month of the pandemic in Colombia as the third wave that came from the Holy Week holidays in April was considered to have reached a plateau and extended into May with a daily average of 20,000 new cases and 500 deaths during that month. With ICU occupancy in the main cities around 95%, the Colombian Association of Emergency Specialists (Asociación Colombiana de Especialistas en Urgencias y Emergencias - ACEM) warned about shortages of oxygen, medicines and supplies for the care of critical patients. According to ACEM, emergency rooms were also under heavy pressure, with occupancy over 160%. \c\cThe 2021 Colombian protests, which started on 28 April, were also believed to be a factor that could have influenced the steady increase of new cases in May, with the week between 10–16 May (two weeks after the first demonstrations) presenting 115,668 infections (6% increase from the previous week) and 3,446 deaths (9% increase). In the following two weeks, the number of new cases was 114,000 and 150,823, while deaths remained above 3,400 per week (3,424 and 3,558). According to experts such as PhD in Public Health Luis Jorge Hernández, the pandemic curve did not start going down in the second half of May for several reasons: the impact of crowding at demonstrations during the ongoing social unrest in the country, the circulation of variants of concern, the poor results of the testing and tracing strategy (Prass) and the increase of positivity levels which reached 30–40%, as well as the still low pace of the vaccination process. \c\cOn 2 June, the Ministry of Health issued Resolution 777 by which criteria for the economic reactivation of the country were established. While self-care measures continued being encouraged as a general guideline, municipalities with ICU occupancy below 85% were authorized to open nightclubs and dance venues as well as holding mass events to 25% capacity. Moreover, municipalities with vaccination stage coverage above 70% would be able to increase capacity in events to 50% and could later move up to 75% depending on their epidemiological index scores. It was also announced that students will return to schools and universities once teachers receive their second vaccine dose, which was estimated to happen around 15 July according to the schedule of the national plan of vaccination, as well as the removal of the requirement of a negative PCR test to enter the country and the CoronApp application for domestic flights. \c\cOn the morning of 24 July President Iván Duque confirmed the detection of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, in a patient in the city of Cali who had travelled to the United States and presented symptoms after returning to the country. The patient was confirmed positive for COVID-19 following a PCR test and was reported to be in isolation and in good health condition. \c\cBy 10 August, the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed to have been detected in Bogotá as well as the departments of Valle del Cauca and Santander. Four cases were confirmed in the Colombian capital on 4 August while in Bucaramanga, capital city of the Santander Department, the city's Health Secretary confirmed another one the next day. The Delta variant further extended to Antioquia, with four confirmed cases in Medellín, one in Segovia, and two in Envigado, as well as the Huila Department. 
On 20 December 2021, a cargo ship illegally carrying 130 passengers sank off the northeast coast of Madagascar. It is thought that a hole in the hull caused the engine room to flood, leaving the vessel vulnerable to wave action. At least 85 people died during the accident. \c\cThe Francia, a 12-metre (39 ft) -long wooden vessel, was a cargo ship that had illegally taken on 130 passengers for a journey from Antanambe (which is not registered as an official port) to Soanierana Ivongo, a journey of some 100 kilometres (62 mi).  Including crew, 138 people were onboard. The vessel sank late on 20 December 2021 after its engine was flooded, leaving it exposed to the action of waves.  The flooding was caused by a hole in the ship's hull. \c\cMadagascan police minister Serge Gellé was flown to the site of the shipwreck on 21 December.  His helicopter crashed and he was one of two surviving passengers (the other was Chief Warrant Officer Jimmy Laitsara).  The survivors separately reached land at Mahambo. Gellé used a seat from the helicopter as a flotation device during his twelve-hour overnight swim to safety.  Gellé swam to within 500 metres (1,600 ft) of the shore but the waves prevented him from reaching land.  He was spotted by a fisherman, whose canoe was too small to accommodate them both. The fisherman returned two hours later with a larger canoe and brought Gellé to dry land.  The body of one of the helicopter's occupants, a police colonel, was later recovered; the pilot remains missing. \c\cA separate helicopter carried the prime minister, Christian Ntsay, and minister of national defence, General Léon Richard Rakotonirina, to the site of the shipwreck. \c\cA force of Madagascan gendarmes was sent to the site and an investigation into the sinking started by the Madagascan government.  Three vessels from the Madagascan navy and maritime agency assisted in the search for survivors.  By 22 December, 64 bodies had been recovered, with around 24 people missing and around 50 survivors rescued.  The following day the Madagascan Maritime and Port Agency announced that the confirmed death toll had increased to 85, with three persons missing. \c\cMadagascan president Andry Rajoelina paid tribute to those who died in the shipwreck and helicopter crash.  The graveyard of Soanierana-Ivongo was too small to accommodate all the bodies recovered so some were sent to nearby villages for burial."}
The COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in New South Wales was identified on 19 January 2020 in Sydney where three travellers returning from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cAs of 17 December 2021[update], there have been 94,811 confirmed cases and active cases were at 11,760. 1 death that day brought to  645 the number of deaths from COVID-19 in New South Wales since March 2020. The record high is 15 deaths first set on 28 September 2021, and repeated on 30 September. After rising sharply in mid-December 2021, new daily cases reached a new record high of 2,566 new daily cases, on 18 December 2021, after dropping below 1,000 on 19 September for the first time since 26 August, then rising above 1,000 again the next day. \c\cBy 21 September 2021, 55% of the state's over-16-year-old population had been fully vaccinated, and 60% on 26 September. On 30 September full vaccination reached 65% and over 87% had received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. 70% full vaccination was reached on 6 October and 75% on 11 October, while over 90% had received least one vaccine dose. 80% full vaccination was reached on 16 October, and 85% on 25 October 2021. \c\cFormer premier Gladys Berejiklian formed a "war cabinet" to make decisions in relation to the pandemic. Members include herself, Treasurer Dominic Perrottet, Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard and Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott. \c\cOn 15 March, Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Education, Mark Scott ordered that, effective immediately, New South Wales schools introduce social distancing measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus. The order required schools to cancel all assemblies, excursions, travel, concerts, large inter-school sporting and arts events, and other events that would require students and staff to congregate in large numbers. Schools were to stay open. Four schools in the state have been shut for periods during the crisis due to confirmed cases within their school communities. \c\cOn 16 March, New South Wales Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard announced that he was using his powers, under Section 7 of the \'Public Health Act 2010\', to immediately and indefinitely cancel all public events with more than 500 attendees. The order is enforceable by NSW Police and violations of the order can carry a prison term of six months, an $11,000 fine, or both. \c\cChief Justice Bathurst, Chief Justice of New South Wales, and Chief Judge Price of the District Court of New South Wales ordered that effective 16 March 2020, new jury trials would be suspended to limit the spread of coronavirus. The order did not apply to already empanelled jury trials. Corrective Services New South Wales implemented screening mechanisms, early flu vaccination programs and stricter hygiene requirements for staff, visitors and inmates to slow the spread of the virus. \c\cThe University of Sydney cancelled all graduations, conferences, academic and student organised events. The University of New South Wales announced that it was cancelling all student and academic events until Easter, encourage staff to work from home and, where possible, shift all lectures, tutorials, demonstrations and labs to online learning. \c\cNew South Wales schools were directed by the State Department of Education Secretary, Mark Scott, to cancel all assemblies, excursions, travel, and some events and conferences, including arts and initiative events, as well as whole school sporting events and inter-school sporting events with three or more involved schools. \c\cOn 17 March, the New South Wales government announced a A$2.3 billion stimulus package, including A$700 million for health services. A$450 million was allocated to waive payroll tax for 3 months. $250 million so state-owned buildings and public schools could employ more cleaners. A$750 million was allocated for capital works and public asset maintenance. \c\cEven though there was a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people, huge crowds flocked to the popular Bondi Beach and other beaches across Sydney on Friday 20 March. Health Minister Greg Hunt said that such behaviour was "unacceptable" while the New South Wales Labor's Shadow Treasurer, Walt Secord urged the government to completely close off the beach. New South Wales Police Minister David Elliott later stated in a televised interview that lifeguards were instructed to keep a head count of the people at the beach and if the number exceeded 500, the beach would be closed. On 21 March, crowds built up yet again which led Waverley Council to temporarily close Bondi, and the other beaches of Bronte and Tamarama. \c\cOn 22 March, a public health order was issued that declared Lord Howe Island a public risk area and directed restricted access. As of that date there were no known cases of COVID-19 on Lord Howe Island. \c\cBy 27 March, NSW local council elections due in September 2020 were postponed to September 2021. They were later postponed again to 4 December 2021 due to a wave of delta COVID-19 variant infections that caused numerous lockdowns in the state. \c\cOn 30 March, NSW Parliament passed the "COVID-19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement" law, which limited public gatherings to two people and directed, "that a person must not, without reasonable excuse, leave the person's place of residence." It listed 16 reasonable excuses and took effect from midnight on 31 March. \c\cAs of 15 May, some restrictions on public and private gatherings were eased. Private homes were allowed 5 visitors. Free standing cafes and restaurants, and those inside pubs and clubs, were allowed very limited sit-down dining, after being restricted to take-away only since 23 March. Bars and gaming areas remained closed. A maximum of 10 people were permitted in restaurants and cafes, while social distancing rules still had to be followed. Outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people were permitted. Up to 10 guests were permitted at weddings, and funerals could have up to 20 mourners indoors, 30 outdoors. Up to 10 people were allowed at indoor religious gatherings such as churches. \c\cFrom 13 June, private homes were allowed to have up to 20 guests visit, and groups of 20 were allowed to meet outside. Food courts were allowed to open, so long as the 4-square-metres-per-patron rule was kept, and no more than 50 patrons. Indoor gym classes were allowed 10 participants. Up to 100 persons were allowed inside gyms, so long as area requirements were adhered to. \c\cFrom 1 July, New South Wales eased restrictions further due to the limited community transmission of COVID-19, at that time. No set upper limit on patron numbers at indoor venues, but only one person per 4 square metres. Outdoor venues, with a maximum capacity of 40,000, were allowed up to 25 per cent of normal capacity. Events had to be ticketed, patrons seated and follow guidelines. Restriction on funerals eased, but the four-square-metre rule applied. Other existing restrictions, no more than 20 guests inside homes, 20 outside, remained in force. Restrictions were tightened again on 17 July. (See below)\c\cFrom 5 July, the Federal Government introduced restrictions on the number of passengers arriving at Sydney Airport. A maximum of 50 passengers were allowed per flight, and international arrivals were set at 450 per day. This was by request of the NSW Government to reduce pressure on hotel quarantine capacity. More than 32,000 travellers had quarantined in Sydney hotels by this date. \c\cOn 6 July, the Victorian and NSW State Governments, jointly announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July, following a large spike in cases in certain areas of Melbourne. \c\cAs of 12:01 a.m. on 17 July, after an increase in cases, new rules for pubs were introduced. Measures included, group bookings and persons at a table were limited to 10 (formerly 20), and a maximum of 300 people allowed inside any venue. COVID Safe Hygiene Marshalls to oversee the venues COVID-19 infection prevention were also required, and venue COVID-Safe registration was compulsory. Paper-based sign-ins are allowed, but a digital record of patrons contact details, for contact tracing, must be provided on request. Breaching the rules can result in a A$55,000 fine for the venue, plus another A$27,500 for each day the breach is continued. As of 24 July, the tightened venue restrictions were also applied to bars, cafes, clubs and restaurants. \c\cUntil 18 July, international travellers who had to undergo compulsory quarantine on arrival did not have to pay for their accommodation, at a cost of A$65 million to the NSW Government. Under new rules announced on 11 July, as of 12:01 a.m. on Saturday 18 July 2020, all new arrivals are being charged for their quarantine. The charge includes meals and room costs, for which one adult will pay A$3,000, additional adults A$1,000, children A$500, and no charge for children under 3 years. Those already quarantined will not have to pay, nor will those who purchased flights, and, had a confirmed international arrival date, before 11:59  p.m. on 12 July 2020 AEST. \c\cOn 20 July, the number of daily overseas arrivals allowed at Sydney Airport was reduced to 350 from the 450 limit set on July 5. \c\cOn 5 August, it was announced that as from 7 August all Victorians arriving in NSW would be required to quarantine, at their own expense, in hotels for 14 days. Air arrivals from Victoria were only  allowed at Sydney Airport. \c\cOn 17 November 2020 the NSW Government announced the "Dine and Discover" programme in the state budget. All NSW residents over 18 years-of-age were eligible to receive four A$25 vouchers through Service NSW to help stimulate the economy. Two vouchers are for dining, Monday to Thursday only, excluding public holidays. The other two are to be spent on entertainment, excluding on public holidays. Businesses need to be COVID-safe registered, and sign-up for the scheme. The vouchers cannot be used for gambling, alcohol, cigarettes, retail purchases or accommodation. The program was originally called "Out and About". \c\cAs early as mid-April 2021, the scheme was said by some regional NSW residents to be "city centric\'. At this time, the vouchers had been used by less than 10% of the 5 million who could use it. There were calls by NSW opposition political parties for the scheme to be extended beyond its initial 30 June 2021 deadline to use the vouchers. On 9 June 2021, the Dine & Discover scheme was extended by a month to 31 July, and on 29 June extended again to 31 August.  Use for take-away food purchases was also allowed. The vouchers were eventually extended to 30 June 2022. In November 2021, two extra vouchers were granted, one for dining and one for entertainment. \c\cFrom 23 November, it became mandatory for many businesses to use electronic record systems to collect details of patrons for possible contact tracing. \c\cDuring the second week of December 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 in Avalon began.[citation needed] A stay at home advisory was issued on 17 December. \c\cOn 19 December 2020, a public health order was issued, locking down Sydney's Northern Beaches. Residents of the Northern Beaches LGA were required to stay at home from 5 pm on Saturday 19 December, until 11:59 pm on Wednesday 23 December unless they had a lawful reason to travel, including for: essential shopping; essential travel for work and to or from a school or educational institution; exercise; medical care, carer's responsibilities or compassionate needs. Entry to the area was similarly restricted. Public gatherings were limited to two persons. \c\cBy 20 December, there were 68 cases. This prompted restrictions on admission of Sydney residents or visitors to Sydney, to other states. These ranged from 14-day quarantines (ACT, NT, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria) to no entry without an exemption (Queensland). South Australia barred entry to anyone from the Northern Beaches, while Western Australia barred everyone coming from NSW. Measures to stem the spread of COVID-19 in Sydney were again tightened. No more than 10 people were allowed in homes in Greater Sydney, Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Illawarra-Shoalhaven. \c\cNew Year's Eve celebrations were restricted in Sydney city, around the harbour and suburbs. The midnight fireworks on Sydney Harbour, normally 20 minutes, were cut back to 7 minutes, with no fireworks at 9 pm. The harbour foreshores were closed to prevent crowds congregating. Only residents, guests,  and those with bookings at bars, hotels and restaurants, were allowed in foreshore areas under a pass system. Vantage points in North Sydney were also closed. \c\cFrom 1 January, hospitality venues and hairdressers were required to use the NSW Government QR code system for patron check-in. \c\cOn Saturday, 2 January 2021, it was announced that as of midnight that day, facemasks would become mandatory in many enclosed places in Greater Sydney. All public transport, shops, supermarkets, cinemas, theatres and places of worship were included. Hospitality workers also had to wear masks. Children under 12 years-of-age were exempt. An A$200 on the spot fine could be charged for non-compliance. Fines were applied from 4 January (Monday). \c\cMaximum gym class sizes were reduced from 50 to 30, worship from 300 down to 100, weddings were limited to 100, or one per 4 square metres. Outdoor performances reduced from 1,000 to 500 patrons. Events which were "seated, ticketed and enclosed" were reduced back to 2,000 maximum. Night clubs were "not permitted". \c\cOn 21 February, the first public COVID-19 vaccinations in Australia, with the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, were administered in Sydney. Up to 6:00 pm on 23 February in NSW, 3,200 people were immunised across three state-run hospitals. \c\cAs of 24 February, there was no transmission of COVID-19 in the community in NSW for 38 days. On 17 March restrictions were to be "revisited". Also on 24 February, further restriction easing was announced in NSW. From 12:01 am on 26 February (Friday):\c\cDancing and singing was allowed at gatherings\c\cAt weddings, up to 30 people, including guests, could dance at one time. (previously, only the wedding party, a maximum of 20 people. The 300 person limit for wedding guests remained)\c\cUp to 50 people at their home (up from 30) Visitor number includes adults and children. \c\cUp to 50 people allowed in gym classes (4-square metre rule applies)\c\cUp to 30 singers allowed in choirs and religious congregations. Masks required, place of worship must adhere to the 4-square metre rule. \c\cOn 30 March, a Byron Bay man in his 20s was found to be infected. A number of restrictions were enacted in the Byron area as a result:\c\cMasks mandatory when shopping/using public transport\c\cincluding taxis and ride-sharing services\c\cMasks mandatory for hospitality staff\c\c4 square-metre rule area rule in hospitality venues\c\cpatrons must be seated\c\chome visitors limited to 30 people\c\cIt was determined that a person linked to the Brisbane \'nurse cluster\' visited venues in Byron, including the Byron Beach Hotel on 26 March,  while unknowingly infectious. The local case also attended that hotel. \c\cAs a result, on 31 March the 2021 Byron Bay Bluesfest was cancelled, for the second year, a day before it was to commence. Because of the one case of transmission in the community, a public health order was signed by the Minister for Health Brad Hazzard, banning the event. \c\cOn 5 May in Sydney, a case of COVID-19 in a man in his 50s who worked as driver for flight crew members in Sydney Airport, was detected with no known physical link to travel or border control/quarantine hotels or workers. His wife also tested positive to COVID-19. Genomic testing provided a link to an overseas (US) acquired infection at the Park Royal in Darling Harbour. The new cases are believed to have been infectious while visiting at least 20 locations in Sydney from 30 April to 4 March. Due to these community transmitted infections, COVID related restrictions in Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains and Wollongong were tightened, initially for 3 days, from 5 pm on 6 May (Friday), to 12:01 am on 9 May (Monday). \c\cMask-wearing was again made mandatory at indoor places, including:\c\cPublic transport\c\cSupermarkets\c\cOther indoor events\c\cHospitality staff at front of house had to be masked\c\cPatrons drinking had to be seated. \c\cNo singing or dancing at indoor venues, including,\c\cPlaces of worship and\c\cEntertainment venues. \c\cExemptions included weddings, and dancers or singers performing in shows. \c\cOnly 20 visitors allowed at private homes\c\cMaximum 2 visitors at aged care facilities\c\cOn 9 May, because the "missing link" in the two community transmitted infections that caused the restriction tightening on 5 May had not been located, most of the extra restrictions were extended another seven days until 12:01 am on 17 May. The main change was mask wearing was not required indoors by patrons of shops and hospitality venues, except for gaming areas where masks are still needed. On public transport and other indoor public venues masks remained mandatory. 13,768 COVID tests were undertaken in the 24 hours to 8:00 pm that day, but NSW recorded no locally acquired COVID-19 infections. On 17 May the temporary restrictions from 5 May were lifted. The missing link in the cases of community transmission that led to these restrictions had still not been located. \c\cOn 10 May, a mass vaccination hub opened at Sydney Olympic Park. The same day, registrations began for NSW residents aged 40 to 49-years to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. \c\cOn 1 June, it was found that a later confirmed COVID-19 case from Melbourne had travelled to New South Wales, before Victorias\' fourth lockdown was imposed on 27 May, while possibly infectious. Possible exposure sites included venues in Goulburn, Jervis Bay, Hyams Beach and Vincentia. \c\cFrom 16 June, NSW residents aged over 50 were able to get an AstraZeneca vaccination from selected pharmacies. 1,250 pharmacies were approved by the NSW health department to administer the vaccine under strict regulations. However,  on 17 June the Commonwealth government decided, on the advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), to change their previous advisory of 50 years plus, and only recommend the AstraZeneca vaccine for those over 60 years-of-age. \c\cOn 16 June, the first COVID-19 case in what became known as the Bondi cluster was confirmed. The case was a man in his 60s who worked as a limousine driver, and had been transporting crew off international flights. By 12 August 2021[update], what began in Bondi spread widely and new cases reported in NSW reached 6,874. There had been at least 38 deaths during the Delta variant outbreak, raising the total number of COVID deaths in NSW to 95 since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. Greater Sydney, Wollongong, the Blue Mountains, Central and Northern NSW, the Central Coast, Far North Coast and other regions in NSW were, or had been, in lockdown, and the Delta outbreak had spread interstate causing more lockdowns including the ACT, Victoria, and South East Queensland. \c\cOn 18 June from 4pm in Greater Sydney (not including the Illawarra and Wollongong regions), masks were again made mandatory on public transport for at least the next 5 days. This was after the COVID-19 cluster in Sydneys\' Eastern Suburbs had grown to 4 cases. The same day it was announced that from 1:00am on 19 June, the eastern Sydney local government area of Waverley would be declared a COVID-19 hotspot by the Queensland government. \c\cBy 22 June the cluster in Bondi had increased by 10 to 22 cases, 31 cases by 23 June, 36 by 24 June, 65 by 25 June, and there were 130 cases in Sydney, of which 124 were linked to the Bondi cluster, by 28 June. The cluster reached 160 cases by 30 June, 175 by 1 July, 188 by 2 July, and 207 by 3 July. Known linked cases reached 285 by 9 July, after which NSW Health did not report them separately.

From 5pm on 14 August, all of regional NSW was also put into lockdown until 12:01am on 22 August. \c\cOn 25 June, after 22 new cases of the delta variant brought infections linked to the Bondi cluster to 65 total, a lockdown was announced for four Sydney LGAs. The City of Sydney, Randwick, Waverley and Woollahra were the affected places. From 11:59pm on 25 June those who live there, or had worked there in the previous 14 days, had to isolate at home until at least 11:59pm on 2 July. (Later extended to 11.59pm on 9 July.) The usual \'essential reasons\' for leaving home apply. Up to 1 million people may be affected. Current NSW restrictions like mandatory masks indoors and on public transport were extended to the same time and date. \c\cWeddings were permitted on 26 – 27 June, but then banned until 9 July. \c\cBy 26 June, infections linked to the Bondi cluster rose to 80.

The COVID-19 pandemic in South Australia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). \c\cOn 11 March, the SA state government announced its A$350 million economic stimulus measures. \c\cOn 15 March, a public health emergency was declared in South Australia. \c\cOn 22 March, a "major emergency" was declared, giving the police power to enforce self-isolation rules. \c\cOn 24 March, state borders were closed. People arriving in the state were required to sign a declaration that they would self-isolate for 14 days and provide an address to the police, with penalties for failure to comply. \c\cOn 27 March, a direction was made under the Emergency Management Act 2004 to prohibit gatherings of more than 10 people, and a limit of 1 person per four square metres. \c\cOn 8 November the SA government announced that in the state budget it would double it's coronavirus economic stimulus package to AU$4 billion. \c\cOn 16 November, "a number of significant restrictions" were reintroduced after an outbreak of coronavirus in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. \c\cOn 17 November, a six-day lockdown from midnight that day was announced. Afterwards there was to be another eight days of "significant restrictions" according to Police Commissioner Grant Stevens. On 21 November, Premier Steven Marshall announced that the state's "circuit breaker" restrictions would be ending three days earlier on 21 November after authorities discovered that one of the positive cases at the Woodville Pizza Bar coronavirus hotspot had misled contact tracers by concealing the fact that he worked at the shop. As part of the easing of "circuit breaker restrictions", groups of 50 people were allowed to attend private functions and funerals, ten people to attend private functions, and 100 people allowed to attend restaurants and pubs. \c\cOn 12 February 2021, the World Solar Challenge (SWC) for that year was cancelled by the SA Government. \c\cOn 5 March 2021, the first Australian received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. A doctor in regional South Australia, she was dosed at Murray Bridge Hospital. \c\cOn 30 April, South Australia's first COVID-19 mass vaccination hub opened at Adelaide Showground. \c\cIn mid-June, sniffer dogs were deployed on a trial basis at Adelaide Airport to detect people with COVID-19 infections. \c\cDue to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, on 23 June South Australia "immediately" reinstated a hard border with NSW. No one who had been in NSW in the past 14 days was allowed entry to SA. A border buffer of 100 km was in place. Exemption were available for residents returning to SA, essential travellers, and special cases. \c\cOn 28 June, from midnight, SA pre-emptively re-introduced a number of restrictions for at least 7 days:\c\cmasks mandatory in high-risk settings\c\caged care homes,\c\chospitals and other "personal care settings"\c\cindoor entertainment venues\c\cnot required, but highly recommended on public transport\c\cIn licensed premises:\c\cno "communal consumption"\c\cno buffets\c\crestrictions on sheisha venues\c\cSome restriction on singing. \c\cOn 11 July, a 72-year-old woman with thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) died in Royal Adelaide Hospital. She was vaccinated with AstraZeneca on 24 June, then admitted on 5 July. \c\cOn 19 July, from midnight "level 4" restrictions were introduced after a traveller from overseas (via quarantine and hospital in Sydney) and two close contacts all tested positive. The restrictions were due to be reviewed on 23 July. Restrictions included:\c\cindoor dining banned, only outdoor dining allowed\c\cnon-essential retail closed\c\cgyms and indoor fitness facilities closed\c\ccontact sport cancelled\c\cpersonal care services closed\c\cDensity requirements at indoor venues:\c\cone person per four square metres\c\cprivate gatherings capped at 10\c\cMasks required for:\c\chigh-risk settings\c\cpublic transport\c\cshared indoor spaces\c\cEvents requiring COVID management plans were cancelled. \c\cOn 20 July, from 6pm, South Australia went into lockdown for 7 days. This was after a 5 case cluster of the Delta variant emerged linked to Modbury Hospital. By this date, approximately 3,000 people were in quarantine at home. The only reasons to leave home were:\c\cessential work\c\ccare for someone\c\cpurchase essential goods-food,\c\cexercise\c\conly with people from the same household\c\cwithin 2.5 kilometres of home\c\c90 minutes per day maximum\c\chealthcare (including vaccination and COVID testing)\c\celective surgery on hold\c\cSchools to close from 21 July\c\c24-hour transition period for teachers to arrange at-home learning\c\cconstruction work to be halted. \c\cThe lockdown led to panic buying, and the cancellations of AVCon, the Royal Adelaide Show, the Adelaide Beer and Barbeque Festival, Winter Reds wine festival and the Illuminate Adelaide arts festival. The reopening of the Gawler railway line, originally set for November 2021, was also delayed to early 2022. \c\cThe lockdown ended on 27 July. \c\cOn 23 November, after the state hit 80% vaccination coverage for 16 and older, it opened its borders to the rest of the country, including New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. This signalled a change from an elimination strategy to a suppression strategy in controlling the virus. \c\cOn 1 December, the state recorded its first two cases of community transmission since the borders opened, two men aged in their 50s. The next day on 2 December, it recorded another 18 new cases, 16 linked to a high school reunion in Norwood, Adelaide. The cases included former premier Jay Weatherill. \c\cOn December 10, the Omicron variant was detected in two interstate travellers that came to South Australia. As a result, there were changes to the rules; travellers coming to SA from New South Wales and Victoria were now required to be tested on day 6 as well as on arrival. Several high-risk exposure sites were listed, where anyone who entered had to quarantine for 14 days. These restrictions were eased on December 14 and 15 respectively. \c\cOn December 26, after a week of exponentially rising case numbers, with over 80 percent believed to be caused by the Omicron variant, the government introduced new restrictions. These included home gathering caps reduced from 30 to 10 people, and hospitality venues would have to reduce capacity to 25% indoors and 50% outdoors. Citizens were asked to reduce travel around the state, as health authorities were concerned about the variants ability to overwhelm the health system. \c\cSouth Australian National Football League men's and women's games will not be held in front of a crowd from 14 March 2020. \c\cBasketball South Australia decided jointly with the National Basketball League to postpone NBL1 Central games till at least 18 April 2020. \c\cRowing South Australia cancelled the South Australian portion of Head of the River in March 2020. \c\cThe Royal Adelaide Show for 2020 was announced as cancelled in April 2020.

The Iran–Israel conflict during the Syrian civil war refers to the Iranian-Israeli standoff in and around Syria during the course of the Syrian conflict. With increasing Iranian involvement in Syria from 2011 onwards, the conflict shifted from a proxy war into a direct confrontation by early 2018. \c\cOn several occasions, between 2013 and 2017, Israel reportedly carried out or supported attacks on Hezbollah and Iranian targets within Syrian territories or Lebanon. One of the first reliably reported incidents of this kind took place on 30 January 2013, when Israeli aircraft struck a Syrian convoy allegedly transporting Iranian weapons to Hezbollah. Habitually, Israel refused to comment on the incident, and allegedly so that the Syrian government would not feel obliged to retaliate. \c\cSyria confirmed some reports regarding Israeli Air Force incidents in May 2013, December 2014, and April 2015, and denied others. Israel systematically refused to comment on the alleged targeting of Hezbollah and Ba\'athist Syrian targets in Syrian territory. In 2015, suspected Hezbollah militants launched a retaliatory attack on Israeli forces in Shebaa farms. In March 2017, Syria launched anti-aircraft missiles toward Israeli-controlled parts of the Golan Heights, allegedly targeting Israeli Air Force aircraft, which Syria claimed were on their way to attack targets in Palmyra, Syria. After the incident, the State of Israel stated it was targeting weapons shipments headed toward anti-Israeli forces, specifically Hezbollah, located in Lebanon. Israel denied Syria's claim that one jet fighter was shot down with another one damaged. Israel has not reported any pilots or aircraft missing in Syria, or anywhere else in the Middle East following the incident. According to some sources, the incident was the first time Israeli officials clearly confirmed an Israeli strike on a Hezbollah convoy during the Syrian Civil War. \c\cBy early December 2017, the Israeli Air Force confirmed at least six years of nearly 100 attacks in Syria, all targeting arms convoys of Hezbollah and the Ba\'athists. In September 2018, the Israeli Air Force stated that it had conducted over 200 airstrikes on Iranian targets in 2017–2018 alone. \c\cOn 30 January 2013, Israeli aircraft allegedly struck a Syrian convoy transporting Iranian weapons to Hezbollah. Other sources stated the targeted site was a military research center in Jamraya responsible for developing biological and chemical weapons. \c\cTwo additional air strikes, also attributed to Israel, reportedly took place on 3 and 5 May 2013. Both allegedly targeted long-ranged weapons sent from Iran to Hezbollah. \c\cAccording to anonymous US officials, Israel launched another attack on 5 July. It allegedly targeted Russian-made Yakhont anti-ship missiles near the city of Latakia, and killed several Syrian troops. While initial reports claimed that it was an airstrike, Israeli media later reported that the attack had been carried out with cruise missiles launched from a Dolphin class submarine. \c\cAn unidentified U.S. administration official on 31 October said Israeli warplanes struck a Syrian base near the port of Latakia, targeting missiles that Israel thought might be transferred to its Lebanese militia enemy Hezbollah. \c\cThe relationship between the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Islamic Republic of Iran strengthened as a result of Hamas moving away from Iran due to differing positions on the Syrian Civil War. Iran rewarded the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine's pro-Assad stance with an increase in financial and military assistance. Abu Ahmad Fouad, a PFLP political-bureau member said that the group might retaliate toward Israel if the United States bombs Syria. \c\cOn 15 December 2013 a Lebanese sniper opened fire at an Israeli vehicle traveling near the border area of Rosh Hanikra, killing a soldier inside. Several hours later, the Israeli military said it shot two Lebanese soldiers after spotting "suspicious movement" in the same area. \c\cSyrian opposition sources, as well as Lebanese sources, reported that another strike happened in Latakia on 26 January 2014. Explosions were reported in the city and Israeli planes were reported over Lebanon. The target was allegedly S-300 missiles. \c\cIt was reported that Israeli aircraft carried out two airstrikes against Hezbollah facilities in Lebanon near the border with Syria on 24 February 2014, killing several militants. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed the attack targeted a Hezbollah missile base. \c\cOn 7 December 2014 Israeli jets allegedly bombed areas near Damascus international airport and in the town of Dimas, near the border with Lebanon. According to foreign reports the attack targeted a warehouse of advanced S-300 missiles, which were en route from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Al Arabiya reported that two Hezbollah militants were killed in the strikes, including a senior military official. \c\cOn 18 January 2015, Israeli helicopters allegedly attacked a Hezbollah's convoy in the Syrian-controlled part of Golan Heights, killing six prominent members of Hezbollah and six IRGC commanders, including a General. On 28 January, Hezbollah fired an anti-tank missile at an Israeli military convoy in the Shebaa farms, killing two soldiers and wounding seven. Israel responded with at least 50 artillery shells across the border into southern Lebanon, in which a Spanish UN peacekeeper was killed. \c\cOn 25 April 2015, a series of attacks attributed to the Israeli Air Force were made in the al-Qalamoun region of Syria against Hezbollah camps and weapons convoys in two brigade bases. Al-Nusra Front, however, has also claimed the attacks. \c\cOn 29 July 2015, Israeli airplanes reportedly struck a vehicle located in a Druse village in southwestern Syria, killing Hezbollah men and a pro-Assad militiaman. A second airstrike targeted a military base along the Syrian-Lebanese border belonging to a pro-Syrian Palestinian faction. \c\cOn 20 and 21 August 2015, after four rockets hit the Golan Heights and Upper Galilee, Israel allegedly launched airstrikes in Syria, killing several militants. \c\cAccording to Syrian media, on 31 October 2015, Israeli aircraft attacked numerous Hezbollah targets in southern Syria, close to the border with Lebanon in the Qalamoun Mountains region. Estimated targets included a weapons convoy destined for Hezbollah. It was reported another Israeli airstrike near Damascus airport on 11 November that targeted Hezbollah weapons warehouses. \c\cThe Syrian opposition reported an Israeli airstrike in the Qualamoun area of the Syria–Lebanon border on 23 November 2015. According to these sources, the strike killed 13 Syrian troops and Hezbollah fighters, and left dozens wounded, including four seriously. The Qualamoun region has been a major transit point for Hezbollah fighters and other logistical equipment to and from Syria. According to Syrian sources, Israeli aircraft attacked again Syrian army and Hezbollah targets in the area around Qalamoun on 28 November, causing dead and wounded among Hezbollah fighters. \c\cOn 19 December 2015, eight people, including Samir Kuntar and other Hezbollah commanders were killed by an explosion in the outskirts of Damascus. According to official Syrian sources, Kuntar was killed by a "terrorist rocket attack". On 20 December 2015, Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi described the incident as a terrorist operation "plotted beforehand", noting that Syrian authorities were carrying out an investigation to find out how the operation happened. Hezbollah claimed that the building was destroyed by an air-to-surface missile launched by Israeli Air Force jets. On 21 December, the Free Syrian Army released a video clip claiming responsibility for killing Kuntar. \c\cSources affiliated with the Syrian opposition reported that Israeli aircraft attacked seven positions belonging to Hezbollah in the Qalamoun Mountains area on 26 December 2015. \c\cArab media reported that on 30 November 2016, Israeli jets allegedly struck a Syrian military compound in Damascus and a Hezbollah weapons convoy in the Damascus-Beirut highway. \c\cOn 7 December 2016, Syria and Hezbollah accused Israel of launching surface-to-surface missiles targeting the Mezzeh airbase near Damascus. Unnamed Syrian sources told Lebanese newspaper Elnashra that the strikes targeted the airport's runway and operations command center, while another unnamed source said that the strikes targeted the regime's 4th division operations center at the airport. A Syrian opposition group said the target was a convoy of chemical weapons en route to Hezbollah. \c\cOn 12 January 2017, Israeli warplanes were blamed for striking the Mezzeh Airbase in rural Damascus. According to Al-Masdar field correspondent, the target was an ammunition depot, causing a massive explosion that could be heard from the Syrian capital. \c\cOn 22 February 2017, Israeli jets struck a Hezbollah weapons shipment near Damascus. \c\cThe March 2017 Israel–Syria incident took place on 17 March 2017, when several Syrian S-200 missiles were fired at Israeli Air Force jets, allegedly aiming to attack targets in Syria, near a military installation in Palmyra, and one missile was shot down by an "aerial defense system", likely an Arrow missile. The State of Israel has stated it was targeting weapons shipments headed toward anti-Israeli forces, specifically Hezbollah, located in Lebanon. Israel denied Syria's claim that one jet fighter was shot down and another damaged. Israel has not reported any pilots or aircraft missing in Syria, or anywhere else in the Middle East following the raids. Also, neither Syria nor Hezbollah have shown photos or video of downed Israeli aircraft or personnel. According to some sources, the incident was the first time Israeli officials clearly confirmed an Israeli strike on Syrian territory during the Syrian Civil War, though IDF declined any comment concerning the location of targets. \c\cOn 27 April 2017, Syria's state-run SANA news agency said that there was an explosion felt in Damascus International Airport at 3:42 am. No casualties were reported. The blast was reportedly felt 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) away. \c\cThe Israeli Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz appeared to take responsibility for the explosion, telling Army Radio that "The incident in Syria corresponds completely with Israel's policy to act to prevent Iran's smuggling of advanced weapons via Syria to Hezbollah." Two rebel sources told Reuters that "five strikes hit an ammunition depot used by Iran-backed militias."\c\cOn 7 September 2017, the Guardian reported that the Syrian military said in a statement that Israeli jets carried out airstrikes on the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Centre, a Syrian government military research facility where it was rumoured to contain chemical weapons near the city of Masyaf, Hama Governorate, killing at least two Syrian Army soldiers.[citation needed] The missiles were fired from Lebanese air space; the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and other sources identified the target as the al-Talai facility; and Syrian opposition sources said four Israeli aircraft were involved in the strike. The US claims the research centre developed the sarin gas weapon allegedly used in the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack; Yaakov Amidror a former Israeli national security adviser, said "For many years it has been one of the Syrian centres for research and development for weapons systems including chemical weapons ... and weapons that have been transferred to Hezbollah." The director of the Israeli national security council's counter-terrorism bureau called for the destruction of the centre in 2010, alleging it had provided weapons to Hezbollah and Hamas. \c\cOn 22 September 2017, some sources reported that Israeli jets carried out three separate strikes on targets near the Damascus International Airport, which the SOHR reported to have struck Hezbollah weapons depots. \c\cOn 16 October, Israeli aircraft destroyed a Syrian SA-5 anti-aircraft battery east of Damascus after it fired a missile at Israeli jets that were on a routine aerial reconnaissance flight in Lebanese airspace. On morning 16 October 2017, according to the Israeli military, Israeli jets attacked a Ba\'athist Syrian anti-aircraft missile launcher after it fired on Israeli aircraft flying in Lebanon's air space, close to the Syrian border, for reconnaissance mission; an Israeli military spokesman said it was the first time Israeli aircraft had been targeted by Syrian forces while flying over Lebanon since the Syrian war began. \c\cOn 1 November 2017, Arab media claimed Israeli jets allegedly bombed a weapons depot situated in rural areas around Hisya, south of Homs. Several reports claimed that the Syrians launched a surface-to-air missile against Israeli aircraft but did not hit them. Arab media also reported Israeli strikes and anti-aircraft missile launches from Iranian bases near al-Kiswahon 2 December 2017. \c\cOn early morning 2 December 2017, a military site near Al-Kiswah south of Damascus was attacked by missiles reputedly from the Israeli military; two of the surface-to-surface missiles launched were intercepted by Syrian air defense, according to Syrian media reports. The incident was three days after followed by a report by Syria that claimed that Syrian air defense units had shot down three Israeli missiles that were targeting a military post near Damascus; there was no Israeli comment on the incident. Another attack was reported on 7 December. \c\cOn 7 February 2018, Syrian state media said that Israeli warplanes attacked a military position in the Damascus countryside from Lebanese airspace, with Syrian air defenses destroying most of the missiles. Other reports stated that the target was the Scientific Research Center in Jamraya, west of Damascus, and that the same position had been targeted by Israel twice before. Some activists claim that the position contains arms depots used by Hezbollah. \c\cIsrael conducted further airstrikes in Syria in February 2018 which were believed to target weapon transfers to Hezbollah. Subsequently, an Iranian-made drone was shot down over northern Israel and an IAF F-16 was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft fire in retaliatory strikes. Both aircrew ejected and landed safely before the plane crashed near the Harduf kibbutz and the IAF followed up with further strikes against targets Syrian air defenses and Iranian drone-control facilities. \c\cOn 17 March 2018, the Israeli Air Force struck a target in Syria. In response the Syrian Army fired several S-200 missiles at Israeli jets above Golan Heights. Israel reported that one Syrian missile had been shot down by an Arrow 2 missile, while none of its aircraft had been damaged. Israel stated it was targeting weapon shipments headed toward anti-Israeli forces, specifically Hezbollah, in Lebanon, while the Syrian Army claimed that a military site near Palmyra had been struck. \c\cRussia and Syria accused Israel of carrying out an airstrike on 9 April 2018, against Tiyas air base, also known as the T-4 air base, outside Palmyra in central Syria. The Russian defense ministry said the Israeli aircraft launched eight missiles at the base from Lebanese airspace, five of which were intercepted by Syrian air defense systems. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor, at least 14 people were killed and more were wounded. Among the dead were seven Iranian soldiers. On 16 April, an unnamed Israeli military official confirmed to the New York Times his country conducted the airstrikes. \c\cAt least 26 pro-regime fighters were killed by missile strikes on 29 April in the Hama Province of central Syria. According to Iran's state media, 18 of them were Iranians. The strikes also hit an airbase in the nearby Aleppo Province storing surface-to-surface missiles. "Given the nature of the target, it is likely to have been an Israeli strike", according to SOHR. \c\cArab media reported that on 6 May 2018 eight members of the Syrian Air Force's 150th Air Defense Division were killed in a mysterious explosion in the morning on the Damascus-Suwayda road. Engineers and soldiers from the battalion that was responsible for the operation of the anti-aircraft system S-200 and had carried out the downing of the Israeli F-16 two months prior, took a transport vehicle and suddenly the explosion took place. According to Syrian sources, eight were killed and Israel was blamed for assassinating them. \c\cAccording to Syrian media, on 8 May 2018, Israeli warplanes struck several military bases in Syria where there is significant Iranian presence.

In the past Al-Nayrab has been linked to Iranian forces. On 22 July, Syrian state television reported that an Israeli airstrike hit a military site in the city of Misyaf in the Hama province, causing only material damage. An intelligence source assessed that a military research center for chemical arms production was located near the city. \c\cOn 22 July 2018, SANA claimed that a facility at Masyaf had been struck. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed that an attack had targeted the location and claimed that it was  being used for the assembly of surface-to-surface missiles, under the supervision of Iranian forces. it further claimed that Iranian and Hizbollah units were present in the vicinity. The facility struck is reported to have been under the control of the Scientific Studies And Research Center which has been suspected of being responsible for the production of chemical weapons. The site was allegedly previously struck in September 2017. \c\cOn 24 July, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intercepted a Syrian Sukhoi fighter jet that they said had crossed about one mile into Israeli airspace. The IDF shot the aircraft down using two Patriot missiles. \c\cLarge explosions were reported at a Syrian military air base near Damascus on 2 September 2018 in a strike attributed by some to Israeli warplanes.

During or within 40 minutes after the strikes, an Il-20 ELINT reconnaissance plane, with 15 Russian servicemen on board, which was coming in to land at the Russian Khmeimim Air Base, was shot down in a friendly fire incident by Syrian air defense systems that sought to target the Israeli aircraft. Russia's defence minister Sergey Shoygu blamed Israel's military for the accident because, according to the ministry, the Russian military had only received one minute's warning from Israel about the impending missile strikes and the four Israeli F-16 jets that conducted the strikes deliberately used the Russian plane as cover to allow them to approach their targets on the ground without being hit by Syrian fire. On 20 September in Moscow an Israeli delegation led by commander of the Israeli Air Force Amikam Norkin presented to Russia Air Force command Israel's inquiry on the bombing of an Iranian-Hezbollah advanced weapons transfer site and the related loss of the IL-20. The IDF stated that their planes were already landing in Israel when Syrian antiaircraft missiles shot down the Russian IL-20. \c\cIsraeli missiles reportedly targeted sites belonging to Iranian-backed militias in al-Kiswah on 29 November 2018.

The 202 targets were mostly shipments of advanced weaponry, as well as military bases and infrastructure used by the IRGC and their proxy militias, which the IDF officials said drove Iranian forces to abandon some posts. \c\cThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that on 12 January 2019, Israeli aircraft attacked missile depots belonging to Hezbollah in the al-Kiswah area and Damascus International Airport. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said "Only in the last 36 hours did the air force strike targets in Syria and we have proven that we will stop the settlement of Iran in Syria." The strikes destroyed a building and radar site at the airport as well as a radar site in the Suwayda countryside, and damaged a suspected Iranian target in a Syrian military base next to Jamraya. \c\cLocal Syrian media and Syrian opposition sources reported that on 20 January 2019, Israeli missiles were fired at Damascus International Airport and the town of al-Kiswah. The Syrian military claimed nine missiles were intercepted by its air defenses.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam is part of the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 21 December 2021[update], Vietnam has officially reported 1,571,780 laboratory confirmed cases, 1,160,090 recoveries, and 30,041 deaths, the 4th highest in Southeast Asia after Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia; and the 32th highest in the world. Hồ Chí Minh City is the most-affected locale with 496,818 confirmed cases and 19,190 deaths, but the Vietnam Ministry of Health estimated that the real number of cases may be four to five times higher. \c\cOn 31 December 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus. Early cases were primarily imported until local transmission began to develop in February and March. Clusters of cases were later detected in Vĩnh Phúc, Hải Dương Province and three major cities of the country, with the first death on 31 July 2020. \c\cDuring 2020, the Vietnamese government's efforts at containing the spread of COVID-19 were mostly successful. Vietnam suspended the entry of all foreigners from 22 March 2020 until 17 November 2021 to limit the spread of the virus. The measure did not apply to diplomats, officials, foreign investors, experts, and skilled workers. In January 2021, the government announced a stricter quarantine policy to "protect the country" during 2021 Lunar New Year. Individuals entering Vietnam had to isolate for at least 14 days if unvaccinated, and seven days if fully vaccinated with the procedure carried out at government-funded quarantine facilities. The specially-designated such as diplomats would be exempt. \c\cStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November. This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country's population coming under some form of lockdown by late July. A shortage of the AstraZeneca vaccine on which the country continued to rely on as of August 2021, a degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up. \c\cAlthough the pandemic has heavily disrupted the country's economy, Vietnam's GDP growth rate still remained one of the highest in the Asia-Pacific Region, at 2.91% in 2020. In January 2021, it was projected that it may increase to 3.8% in 2021. \c\cVaccinations commenced on 8 March 2021 with a total of 125,857,027 administered vaccination doses reported by 2 December 2021. The Ministry of Health has approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, Sputnik V, the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, the Janssen vaccine and Abdala. Vietnam also approved Covaxin from Bharat Biotech. As of 26 November 2021, a total of 139,540,295 doses have arrived in Vietnam. \c\cNew infectious diseases such as COVID-19 impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been previously known as major pathogens that caused respiratory illnesses, a new strain of coronaviruses referred to as SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries between 2002 and 2004 which infected 8,098 people and caused 774 deaths. Evidence showed that the virus may have originated from an animal coronavirus, and found its way into the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. \c\cAlthough it is still unknown exactly where the outbreak first started, many early cases of COVID-19 have been attributed to people who have visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, located in Wuhan, Hubei, China. The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster. However, an earlier case of infection could have occurred on 17 November. China publicly reported the cluster on 31 December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first report on the outbreak on 5 January 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, which was reported earlier. On 20 January, the WHO and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), after mounting evidence that the novel coronavirus had spread to 18 countries and completion of investigation in Wuhan. \c\cVietnam has a history of successfully managing pandemics: it was the second country after China to face the 2002–04 SARS epidemic and, after 63 cases and five deaths, it was the first country declared SARS-free by the WHO. In the wake of the SARS epidemic, Vietnam increased investments in its public health infrastructure, developing a national public health emergency operations center and a national public health surveillance system, maintaining robust systems to collect and aggregate public data. Since 2016, hospitals are required to report notifiable diseases within 24 hours to a central database, ensuring that the Ministry of Health can track epidemiological developments across the country. In collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Vietnam implemented an innovative “event-based” surveillance program in 2018, empowering members of the public, including teachers, pharmacists, religious leaders, and even traditional medicine healers, to report public health events, in order to identify clusters of people who have similar symptoms that might suggest an outbreak is emerging. \c\cWith a population of nearly 100 million people, receiving the millions of Chinese visitors each year, having long land border and strong economic ties with China, which is the nation's largest trading partner, Vietnam was initially perceived to be hit hard by the pandemic. When Vietnam recorded its two first confirmed cases on 23 January 2020, it was among the first countries affected by COVID-19. Two weeks later, only 150 cases had been reported outside of mainland China, but ten of these were in Vietnam, placing it in the top ten most affected countries. By early 2021, the situation was very different: instead of having a large scale outbreak, Vietnam was one of the countries with the lowest cases and mortality per million inhabitants. \c\cThe first two confirmed cases in Vietnam, a Chinese man, born in 1954 and his son, were admitted to Cho Ray Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, on 22 January 2020. The son was believed to have contracted the virus from his father, who had earlier flown from Wuhan on 13 January, when they met in Nha Trang on 17 January. The first cluster also appeared in Son Loi Commune, Bình Xuyên District, Vĩnh Phúc after a few workers returned from a training trip in Wuhan and infected other people in close contact with them. The Vietnamese government immediately locked down Bình Xuyên District until 4 March 2020 to prevent the disease from spreading all over the country, the first large-scale lockdown outside China. Having known cases early is one of the main reasons why Vietnam was successful in fighting the virus. For the first 16 cases of the disease, the medical staff had to treat different types of patients, including infants, the elderly and people with underlying conditions. These preliminary cases were like "an exercise" for the Vietnamese medical system in order to prepare for and study the new virus. \c\cWhen the pandemic spread across the globe, the coronavirus cases in the country also surged, and on the evening of 6 March, the Hanoi Department of Health confirmed the first case in the capital, a 26-year-old woman who had travelled to Europe. This is the 17th case in Vietnam. On the afternoon of 20 March, the Ministry of Health announced 2 new COVID-19 patients, the 86th and 87th, who were two female nurses at Bạch Mai Hospital with no history of contact with any COVID-19 patients. In March and April 2020, the number of cases increased rapidly due to the large number of people coming from European countries and the appearance of clusters such as Bạch Mai Hospital, Ha Loi Commune in Hanoi and Buddha Bar in Ho Chi Minh City. \c\cAfter 21 March 2020, Vietnam suspended entry for all foreigners from midnight of 22 March, and introduced concentrated isolation for 14 days in all cases of entry for Vietnamese citizens. From 1 April, Vietnam implemented a 15 days nationwide lockdown. On the same day, former Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc announced the nationwide outbreak of COVID-19. The drastic epidemic control measures had positive results and the country did not confirm any cases of local transmission from mid-April to the end of July. Vietnam began loosening restrictions in May, including resuming domestic travel across the country. \c\cThe country entered its second wave of infection when the Ministry of Health announced the 416th case in Da Nang, which was the first case with an unknown source of infection in 99 days. On 28 July, the Da Nang authorities immediately locked down the city for 15 days. Hundreds of cases across the country with epidemiological factors related to Da Nang were furthermore detected, and the first death was also recorded on 31 July. After two months, by using the same strategies that were used in the first outbreak, Vietnam successfully contained the disease for the second time and resumed almost all economic activities, including international commercial flights. Sporadic community infections continued during November and December, causing public scare and heightened measures. \c\cThe third wave of infection began on 28 January 2021, when Vietnam recorded an additional 84 community transmission cases within a single day in Hải Dương and Quảng Ninh provinces. Most of these are related to a single Hải Dương migrant worker, who was diagnosed with the UK coronavirus variant by Japanese authorities after arriving in Osaka on 17 January. Initially, the government only quarantined the areas directly related to the infected people to limit the economic impact. But after half a month, the number of rising cases showed no sign of stopping. So, on 15 February, the entire province of Hải Dương was locked down for 15 days, while Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City stopped all entertainment activities. This was one of the most serious outbreaks due to the slow tracing process, mismanagement in quarantine facilities, and people beginning to ignore lockdown rules due to the long period of restrictions. On 7 March 2021, the situation in northern provinces appears to have been largely brought under control when the number of new cases fell to single digits. Along with that, Vietnam started its mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign the next day. \c\cFrom 3 September, 2020 to 15 May, 2021, the country recorded no new COVID-19 related deaths. \c\cFrom the end of April 2021, Vietnam experienced "a fast-spreading outbreak" of more than 700,000 cases. Clusters have been found in industrial parks in Bac Giang province and then in at least ten major hospitals in the country. As the epidemic has spread to many provinces in Vietnam, many outbreaks are occurring in many localities at the same time, making it "nearly impossible" to trace and cut the chain of infection. According to WHO, to prepare for the worsening situation, the country has built more than 30 field hospitals with a scale of 1,500 ICU beds and 30,000 non-ICU beds. When total cases reached a few thousands per day, the Central government decided to lock down the entire Southern Region with 35 million people, along with the capital, Hanoi, to contain the spread. On 26 July 2021, for the first time in the country's disease prevention history, Ho Chi Minh City imposed a daily night curfew beginning at 6:00 PM. As a result, no one is permitted to leave the city, and only emergency services are permitted to operate. On 28 July, the National Assembly gave the central government in Hanoi mandate to implement emergency measures for curbing the pandemic locally. On 20 August, Nguyễn Thành Phong was dismissed by the Politburo as chairman of the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City. The government also mobilized 10,000 troops to the city to enforce the lockdown and deliver food supplies. One of the main reasons for this outbreak is a four-day holiday for Reunification Day and International Workers\' Day, which saw many vacation destinations packed with travelers. In addition, gene sequencing results show that the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is the dominant variant in this wave, especially among cases in central and southern localities of Vietnam. \c\cOn 29 August, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh announced that Vietnam may face a protracted battle and cannot rely on indefinite closures and quarantines. He also acknowledged the possibility that Vietnam would have to live with the virus. This marks a major change in the country's approach to COVID-19, forced Vietnam to accelerate its vaccination campaign to control the pandemic, instead of mass quarantine. Starting from mid-September 2021, the number of infections began to decrease to several thousand per day and localities began to ease the restrictions. \c\cThe newly acquired COVID-19 strain that entered Vietnam in the second wave has a mutation which increases the infection rates, leading to a high number of cases in a second wave. Nguyen Thanh Long, Minister of Health, said that this new strain was imported from outside of Vietnam. The epidemic may already have started in early July. Until August, Da Nang has gone through 4 cycles of infection. \c\cThe basic reproduction number (R0) in the second wave was 5 to 6, while in April this was only from 1.8 to 2.2. The rate of positive results of people who had indirect contact with COVID-19 patients are also higher than in the previous wave. Scientists point out that this strain of the virus is aggressive and capable of causing a transition to a serious condition more quickly. The health ministry sent the best experts to Da Nang to help the city contain the spread of the infection and to quickly identify the source of the infection. They also submitted the new strain's data to a world gene bank for comparison. On 4 August, the Ministry of Health confirmed that the strain of coronavirus in Vietnam in the second wave is D614G, also the dominant mutation wreaking havoc across the globe. A study published by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico asserts that patients infected by that mutation actually have more virus in their bodies, making them more likely to spread it to others. \c\cAs of 3 April 2022, Vietnam recorded at least ten coronavirus strains: the original Wuhan variant, Alpha variant, B.1.222, B.1.619, Delta variant, Beta variant, A.23.1 from Rwanda, Epsilon variant, D614G coronavirus mutation and Omicron variant. \c\cMany COVID-19 cases in Vietnam have reported positive tests after they were deemed to have recovered from the disease. This also happened in other countries such as United States, South Korea and China. Oh Myoung-don, head of South Korea Central Clinical Committee for Emerging Disease Control rejected the possibility of "reinfection", assuming that the patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, most likely due to "the testing kit collected RNA from the dead virus fragments, these may remain in the body for months". \c\cVietnam Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long also agreed with the above opinion, saying that maybe the patient has not fully recovered during the treatment process so the virus has not been eliminated and still exists in the body, especially in lung mucous cells. \c\cIn April 2021, the Ministry of Health decided to shorten isolation time at home to 7 days because it did not record community infections from relapse cases. Previously, Vietnam forced concentrated quarantine from immigrants for 14 days in the isolation camp and 14 days at home. In July 2021, after considered of 400 relapse cases, the Ministry of Health has not recorded any cases of community spread. Therefore, they abolished quarantine rules for relapse cases and their neighborhood. \c\cIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world, along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea. This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining. Despite inferior economic and technological capacity, the country's response to the outbreak has received widespread international acclaim for its immediacy, effectiveness and transparency, in contrast to censorship in China and the poor preparation in the United States and in European countries. \c\cOn 11 January 2020, after China reported the first coronavirus death, Vietnam implemented health checks at airports. All visitors had their body temperatures measured, and those with a fever, cough, chest pain or breathing difficulties were isolated for testing. Confirmed cases, fellow passengers and crew and all their contacts were quarantined for 14 days. \c\cOn 16 January, the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation. On 22 January, health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with. \c\cOne of the unique parts of Vietnam's response is its meticulous contact-tracing effort. Due to its inability to conduct mass testing like South Korea, Vietnam has taken a targeted approach to testing, scaling it up in areas with community transmission, implementing a strict 14-day quarantine policy, and keeping track of second, third and fourth levels of contact to infected persons, who then will be placed under different levels of movement and contact restrictions. According to CNN, if authorities had not proactively sought out people with infection risks, the virus could have quietly spread in communities days before being detected. For example, in early April, 45,000 people were ordered to quarantine for only 240 infected people. Whenever a small cluster of infections emerged, the entire village or city was sealed off from the outside world. As of 9 May 2021[update], more than 16 million people have been placed under quarantine. Instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted an widespread of public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force. One-party national mechanism and powerful military-security forces helps the government to make decisions quickly and enact them promptly. Vietnam also has a strong surveillance culture with neighbours who will inform their local police if they suspect any misconduct. "This is not an approach that can be taken in Western societies." Experiences with pandemics have led to the longer-term development not only of institutional preparedness but also of "social memory," which has been shown instrumental in nudging people to adopt protective behaviors and heed official regulations and guidance in other COVID-19 response contexts. \c\cOn 30 January 2020, the Ministry of Science and Technology had a meeting with medical experts to propose solutions to contain and mitigate COVID-19. In the meeting, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Phạm Công Tạc urged virologists to accelerate the development of diagnostic tests. Starting in early February, publicly funded institutions in Vietnam developed at least four locally made COVID-19 tests that were validated by the Ministry of Defense and the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology. Subsequently, private companies including Viet A and Thai Duong offered capacity to manufacture the test kits. Most confirmation laboratories where these tests are analyzed use in-house versions of WHO protocol, allowing tests to be widely administered without long wait times. \c\cEarly February 2020, a research team in Institute of Biotechnology and Food Technology (Hanoi University of Science and Technology) just announced they had successful developed test kits utilizing the RT-LAMP technology with testing time of 70 minutes. On 3 March, leader of the research team – Assoc. Prof. Dong Van Quyen, Deputy Director of the Institute of Biotechnology, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, announced that they had completed the research and development of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit, based on RT-PCR and realtime RT-PCR. \c\cIn August 2020, the Ministry of Health approved the use of GeneXpert, a type of test that has been used by the Vietnam tuberculosis prevention network since 2012, for COVID-19 testing. According to Nguyễn Viết Nhung, director of the National Lung Hospital in Hanoi, the test is similar to RT-PCR, gives accurate results within 35–45 minutes for both COVID-19 and tuberculosis and could work automatically. Plans are underway to further expand the use of GeneXpert using 14,000 GeneXpert COVID-19 cartridges in 42-46 lung hospitals around the country. As of May 2021, Vietnam has 180 laboratories capable of testing for COVID-19 using RT-PCR with the maximum capacity of 238,000 test per day. Health officials are currently preparing to extend testing capacity to more hospital laboratories including provincial and military hospitals, with further training ongoing, for preparedness in case of future widespread transmission. During the outbreak in Hải Dương, instead of mass testing on every person in the infected area, the authorities using different strategies including targeted testing of higher risk groups as well as random testing of households and inpatients. Testing capacity also can be increased with guidance issued on pooling of lower risk specimens, up to 10 specimens at most. \c\cFrom the experiences gained from the SARS outbreak in 2003, Vietnam has been proactive in treating COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, the key method is to create a well-ventilated environment, do not use air conditioning and regularly disinfect. In addition, the treatment of clinical symptoms combined with physiotherapy and appropriate nutrition and psychological stability also greatly contributes. \c\cAccording to the Vietnam Ministry of Health, specific antiretroviral therapy will also be considered when sufficient evidence of effectiveness is available. To leave the hospital, patients need to have two consecutive negative samples of COVID-19 (both pharyngeal and pharyngeal fluid), taken at least 24 hours/test. After leaving the hospital, the patient must continue to isolate at home for another 14 days. The patient should be in a well-ventilated private room wearing mask, washing hand everyday, limiting contact with other family members and not to go out. Monitor body temperature twice per day, check again immediately if fever or other abnormal signs. \c\cDuring the second wave in Da Nang, the treatment regimen used in Vietnam underwent many improvements. Compared to the beginning of 2020, patients mainly treated by their symptoms and medical staffs will try to improve their condition, while in the new regimen, antiviral drugs proved more effective for COVID-19 patients. Specifically, Lopinavir, Ritonavir and Interferon have been used effectively by Vietnam, with patients becoming virus free after 7 days of use. The method of extracting plasma from cured people to treat severe cases is also being considered as an alternative to antiviral drugs. The malaria drugs Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine are no longer used for treatment. \c\cDoctors have been studying plasma therapy for COVID-19 treatment since April 2020 and the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases still continues to select plasma donors. However, no patient in the country has been treated with this method. Nguyen Trung Cap, deputy director of the Hanoi National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, explained that plasma therapy is based on the principle of using antibodies already in cured individuals to supporting the treatment of newly infected patient. Antibodies can help reduce the amount of virus in the body of the sick person, thereby reducing the severity of the disease. Plasma can be very effective in treating many diseases, but with COVID-19 the benefits are still limited. During the first week of illness, the amount of virus in the patient's body is very high but most of them only experiencing mild symptoms. Therefore, it is not appropriate to administer plasma from the cured to the new patient. Severe symptoms usually occurs from the second week of illness due to an excessive immune response. However, in many patients the amount of virus in their body has decreased, the use of plasma is not much value. In addition, shortly after the patient has recovered from COVID-19, the amount of antibodies in the plasma decreases quite rapidly, so the benefit of the blood plasma is reduced in the treatment of the disease. Plasma transfusion also has a mechanism similar to blood transfusion, this therapy may contain similar side effects like fluid overload, acute hemolytic transfusion reaction or allergic transfusion reaction when transfusing the wrong blood type. \c\cIn October 2020, the scientists at the Medical Genetics Institute, the Ho Chi Minh City Center for Disease Control (HCDC) and Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University are planning to sequence the genomes of novel coronavirus to understand how it affects people with different genetic makeups and possibly identify genes sensitive to the virus for better treatment method. In the first stage of the research, twenty recovered patients would have their genes sequenced with the help of HCDC. \c\cWith the appearance of the Delta variant and a rapid increase in the number of cases during the fourth epidemic, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health implemented a new COVID-19 treatment regimen in July 2021. According to the Ministry of Health's assessment, more than 80% of patients only had a mild fever, cough, fatigue, and no pneumonia, and recovered about a week. In some cases, there are no clinical symptoms. Approximately 20% of patients experienced severe symptoms, and the average development time from initial symptoms to severe is 5-8 days. After severe stage 7-10 days, if there are no symptoms of respiratory failure, the patient's clinical signs will gradually return to normal and recover from the disease. Under the new treatment regimen, all persons with no and mild symptoms will be treated in general ward. Severe and life-threatening conditions necessitate treatment in an intensive care unit. Because there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug to cure COVID-19, individualized treatment plan should be provided, particularly in severe case. The Ministry of Health divides hospital discharge requirements into 3 levels with the shortest duration of treatment is 10 days. In particular, if two conditions are met, the patient is discharged on the tenth day after receiving a positive test. First, no clinical symptoms within ten days of testing. Second, two consecutive negative tests (at least 24 hours apart) by RT-PCR or low viral load (Ct ≥ 30). The time from taking the last sample to the time of discharge is no more than 24 hours. If the patient has symptoms, they will be discharged from the hospital on the 14th day or longer, depending on the severity of the ailment until they meet the discharge requirements. \c\cThe Ministry of Health has also altered how patients are monitored after they leave the hospital. Patients must measure their body temperature twice a day at home. If the temperature is higher than 38 degrees in two consecutive measures or if there are any abnormal clinical symptoms, it is necessary to notify the medical facility immediately. \c\cIn August 2021, the Ministry of Health approved the use of antiviral drug Remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment and also considering to accept Favipiravir. \c\cOn 31 July 2020, the Da Nang Party Committee announced that they will use Tien Son Sport Center in Hải Châu District as a temporary field hospital to help the city's hospitals cope with the rising number of COVID-19 patients in the area. The sport center covers a floor space of 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) with a maximum capacity of 2,000 beds. In the meeting, the committee also agreed to use the sports ground of the Da Nang Military Command to store necessities and medical equipment to support the prevention and control of the epidemic. Huynh Duc Tho, Chairman of Da Nang People's Committee, stated that the situation of COVID-19 epidemic in the area was very dangerous and that drastic action and strong measures would be required to control the outbreak. The Party Committee tasked the city with urgently buying necessary medical equipment, including ECMO machines, ventilators, protective suits and medical masks. \c\cIn January 2021, in response to COVID-19 outbreak in Hải Dương, two field hospitals with a combined capacity of 600 beds have been set up in northern Hải Dương province within 24 hours. The first one was built at the medical centre of Chi Linh city, and staffed by 45 doctors and about 70 nurses who can provide treatment for 200 patients. The second one converted from the Hải Dương Medical Technical University with 210 beds. \c\cIn 2021, Viet Nam has around 2,000 ICU doctors and around 16,000 ICU beds. In Ho Chi Minh City: From 16 August 2021, the city established a 3-levels care pathway for people infected with COVID-19 with a plan of 60,000 beds, including 1,700 ICU beds. \c\cLevel 1: Monitoring and care centres (centralized quarantine area and district hospitals) for asymptomatic and mild patients with a stable underlying condition. Level 1 currently has 18,120 asymptomatic and mild cases, being isolated and treated at home, or at 153 isolation facilities with a total of 23,898 beds. \c\cLevel 2: for mild and moderate symptomatic patients. This level has 74 COVID-19 treatment hospitals with a total of 49,392 beds, including: 24 field hospitals (15 city-level hospitals and 8 district-level hospitals), 41 general and specialized hospitals in the city and 9 central hospitals. \c\cLevel 3: for severe and critical cases with a total of 3,883 ICU beds. This level includes 8 hospitals in the city: Hospital of Tropical Diseases, Chợ Rẫy, Military Hospital 175 and five national ICU centers. \c\cOn 5 August, the Deputy Secretary of the City Party Committee reported that their capacity at level 3 is approaching its limit. The city is facing a challenge on ensuring human resource for critical cases treatment. Due to the increase of new cases, on 3 August, HCMC Medical University has established a 70-bed ICU centre. On 7 August, medical staffs mobilized from three country's major hospitals (Bạch Mai, Việt Đức and Central Huế) have established 3 ICU centres with a total of 1,500 ICU beds in the city. In total HCMC assigned 3,270 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients. On 18 August, HCMC established Tân Bình District Field Hospital with the capacity of 1,000 beds, this is the first multi-level field hospital to accept both mild, moderate, and critical patients. The hospital's construction is intended to relieve pressure on major hospitals, which are already overburdened due to the large number of COVID patients, and to reduce the time it takes doctors to transport patients from district-level to central-level hospitals. \c\cBình Dương Province: In August 2021, Bình Dương has 22 treatment facilities with the total number of 15,627 beds and 2,851 medical staffs. The provincial government applied 3-level care pathway, first level has more than 6,000 mild or asymptomatic patients, the second level treats nearly 7,000 patients with moderate symptoms. The third treats 586 severe and critical patients, at Bình Dương General Hospital and Bình Dương COVID-19 Emergency Resuscitation Field Hospital. The province is calling for additional support from Hà Nội Medical University and other private health sectors. \c\cLong An: The province also applied 3-level care pathway, with level 1 and level 2 consist of district hospital and level 3 consists of Long An General Hospital, Long An Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Hospital and Hậu Nghĩa Regional General Hospital. The MOH supported the province to establish a 500-bed ICU centre. \c\cĐồng Nai: For COVID-19 patients, the province had 150 ICU beds and is building a 200-bed facility. The Hanoi-based National Lung Hospital helped Đồng Nai open a new 380-bed ICU centre. Additional human resources from the private health sector are being sought by the provincial government. \c\cOn 7 February 2020, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi announced that it had successfully cultured and isolated the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in the lab, the fourth country to do so. The achievement would allow quicker test results for nCoV, meaning thousands of samples could be tested a day, said the institute. It would also serve as a basis for the development of a vaccine against the virus. Le Quynh Mai, Deputy Director of National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, said the virus causing COVID-19 has evolved into many branches. Three branches have been recorded in the world. Vietnam recorded and isolated two different virus branches, one from patients returning from Wuhan in February and the other from patients returning from Europe in March. \c\cIn May 2020, Vietnam declared that their COVID-19 vaccine was developed after scientists successfully generated the novel coronavirus antigen in the lab. The vaccine has been developed by collaborating scientists at VABIOTECH in Hanoi and the Bristol University, it will be tested further in animals and evaluated for safety and effectiveness before a manufacturing process is embarked on. According to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, it will take at least 12–18 months to develop vaccine that can work safely on human. During the testing phase, researchers experimented by injecting the mice in many ways and administering multiple antigen doses, with some mice injected with one or two doses of 3-10 micrograms each. After 10 days, 50 mice were in good health and being closely monitored for immune responses. After gaining positive results with immune response and antibody production, the trial vaccine would be developed into a complete and stable version qualified to be used on humans. The research team would also develop commercial production procedures for mass-production, including up to tens of millions of units. In October 2020, the Vabiotech COVID-19 vaccine has been tested on 12 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in an island off the northern Quang Ninh province. The macaques are aged 3–5, weighing more than three kilograms each, and not infected with contagious diseases like tuberculosis or the HIV virus. Before being injected with the vaccine, they had their body temperatures, blood and swab samples taken and were kept separately in cages. They will be tested in two periods. In each period, they will be divided into two groups, with one being vaccinated and the other not. After that, they will be monitored daily on separate islands, before their blood samples are taken for further analysis. The testing will follow a similar model that maybe later performed on humans. The animals will be injected two shots of the vaccine, 18 to 21 days apart. A month after the second shot, researchers will assess the monkeys\' immune response to see the difference between the injected group and the non-injected group. The result of these trials will be presented before the health ministry's ethical board within the following four months if experiments show the vaccine does produce effective immunogenicity and provide effective protection against COVID-19. It will be a foundation for the next stage for testing the vaccine on humans. \c\cVietnam currently has four COVID-19 vaccines produced by Nanogen, Vabiotech, Polyvac and the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC) currently under research. The health ministry has assessed the Nanocovax vaccine produced by Nanogen is the most promising, having been successfully produced it on a laboratory scale and provoked immunogenicity during animal testing. IVAC and Vabiotech have completed their laboratory-scale production process and are evaluating the safety and immunity of their vaccines on animals. On 7 December, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology announced the Nanocovax test results on hamsters. The hamsters were vaccinated and then exposed to the novel coronavirus for 14 days. They were not infected and results from lung fluid tests also showed they were negative for the virus. Meanwhile, mice that were not vaccinated tested positive for the novel coronavirus and showed signs of fatigue. On 17 December 2020, Nanogen commenced human trials of Nanocovax vaccine. On 26 February 2021, the pharmaceutical company began second phase trials in two places, Hanoi and southern Long An province. On 25 March, 26 volunteers receiving the first jabs in phase II between 26 February and 10 March were given the second shots of the Nanocovax vaccine. Some volunteers experienced side effects around the injection site, yet did not require medical intervention. Results of the trial will be issued in May 2021 before preparing for the third-stage trial, giving the vaccine to between 10,000 and 30,000 people to test for efficacy and safety. Nanocovax vaccine may be ready to deliver to the general public in the second half of 2021, if efficacy is shown. If the government goes ahead with the emergency decision, it may be rolled out in May, a Nanogen official told Nikkei Asia. On 26 March, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Phạm Công Tạc and Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam received the second dose of the Nanocovax COVID-19 vaccine. \c\cOn 21 January, the second Vietnam-produced COVID-19 vaccine (COVIVAC), developed by the Institute of Vaccine and Medical Biologicals (IVAC), entered a human-clinical trial, nearly two months ahead of schedule. IVAC has made studies on the vaccine since May 2020, and carried out pre-clinical trials in India, the United States and Vietnam, with the results showing safety and efficacy in experiment, fully meeting the conditions for conducting research with humans participants. The vaccine stability evaluation was conducted at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City. On 15 March 2021, six volunteers were injected with the COVIVAC vaccine, at the Hà Nội Medical University. The COVIVAC is a liquid vaccine with or without adjuvants, without preservatives, with the production technology of Newcastle vector vaccine, based on production technology on chicken eggs with embryos. \c\cOn 8 September 2021, Deputy Minister of Health Tran Van Thuan met with France's Xenothera company to discuss collaboration for the third phase of clinical trials of the XAV-19 COVID-19 treatment drug and the transfer of production technology to Vietnam. This drug is used to prevent the virus from developing, as well as to neutralize the virus and reduce inflammation in patients. \c\cFollowing the approval of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on 30 January 2021, vaccinations commenced on 8 March 2021, and will continue throughout the year with the goal of vaccinating 80% of the population by June 2022. Sputnik V was later approved for use on 23 March 2021. The Sinopharm BIBP vaccine was approved for emergency use on 4 June 2021, while the Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen vaccines were approved on 12 June 2021, 29 June 2021, and 15 July 2021, respectively. Vietnam approved Abdala vaccine from Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology on 18 September 2021, and Covaxin from Bharat Biotech on 10 November 2021. \c\cThis is the country's largest-ever immunization campaign with over 150 million doses. Although Vietnam is a success story in disease prevention and has kept outbreaks under control, the country's COVID-19 vaccination program is considered to be slower than most countries in Asia. As of 2 December 2021, Vietnam has administered 125,857,027 vaccine doses across the country. As of 26 November 2021, a total of 139,540,295 doses have arrived in Vietnam. \c\cOn 7 May 2021, Vietnam recorded the first death of a person vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, a female 35-year-old medical staff in An Giang Province. \c\cIn July 2021, the Ministry of Health allowed mixing first and second doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines should there be limited vaccine supply and the vaccinated person agrees. On 8 September 2021, Vietnam allowed those who received a first dose of Moderna's vaccine to get a different shot when they get their second dose due to the lack of vaccine supply. On 14 October 2021, the Ministry of Health authorized the use of COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 12 to 17. \c\cThe report issued by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Mekong Development Research Institute (MDRI), surveyed 1,335 Vietnamese in September 2020 for their opinions and experiences of the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents showed strong support for the government's national social distancing order imposed in April, with 88% praising its appropriate timing. A total 39% said they followed the social distancing order, while 12.2% either somewhat followed or disobeyed it. A total 89% of respondents said they supported the government's stance and measures to save as many lives as possible, even if it means the economy might recover more slowly. The percentage is much higher than the global average of 67% agreeing the government should prioritize saving lives over economic recovery. \c\cA January 2021 survey conducted by Singapore's United Overseas Bank, has found that Vietnamese are the most optimistic in Southeast Asia about their future despite the economic and social challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Around 81% of Vietnamese respondents said they expect life to go back to normal by the end of this year, while 72% believed they would be financially better. "Their optimism could be due to Vietnam’s success in handling the COVID-19 crisis, which has set a strong foundation for the recovery of the economy," Harry Loh, CEO of UOB Vietnam said. Another reason why Vietnamese people are most optimistic in times of crisis may be because most of them grew up during the war and the “Subsidy Economy” period. \c\cNot only with the help of the government, many sponsors have provided food and water to the poor with many positive actions such as "rice ATMs" and free supermarkets. This assistance has contributed greatly to helping the society most vulnerable. \c\cA number of business people and famous people also contributed to the people and the government to support the fight against COVID-19 epidemic. At a meeting with representatives of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee of Ho Chi Minh City on the morning of 20 March, billionaire Johnathan Hanh Nguyen made a pledge to donate 30 billion VND, of which 25 billion VND was used to pay for medical equipment. In addition, he also handed over a 5000m2 supermarket for use as an isolation area. \c\cAccording to Deputy Chairman of the State Committee for Overseas Vietnamese Luong Thanh Nghi, as soon as the epidemic broke out in China and some countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the Vietnamese community was living, studying and working in Eastern Europe have donated and transported nearly 80,000 medical masks, hundreds of sterile water bottles, protective clothes and medical gloves to support Son Loi commune, Vĩnh Phúc province and a number of hospitals in Hanoi to prevent and fight epidemics. In August 2020, Vietnamese largest corporation Vingroup handed 3,200 ventilators and enough chemicals to performing 100,000 RT-PCR tests to the Ministry of Health. \c\cAt the end of May 2021, Vietnam's Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính is ordering government agencies and ministries to establish a COVID-19 vaccine fund to raise contributions from various sources, including cash and vaccine doses from benefactors. The fund will be used for buying COVID-19 vaccines from abroad and for supporting the production of made-in-Vietnam vaccines. The Vietnamese government said it aims to secure 150 million vaccine doses in 2021 to cover 70% of its population at a cost of US$1.1 billion but only US$630 million has been allocated to vaccine procurement in the budget. By 10 June, more than 253,000 businesses, banks and individuals pledged to contribute US$179 million to the campaign. Another US$140 million has been promised by businesses, the Ministry of Finance said. There are reports that in Hanoi, the local government has forced people to pay money to contribute to the fund. \c\cBecause Vietnam is a country with a huge number of people working in labour export market, many Vietnamese families depend on remittances from their abroad relatives. That figure is around $17 billion USD in 2019, but is expected to drop by 7.6% by 2020 - the first drop in an 11-year chain of growth, according to World Bank statistics, which comes from the fact that few workers leave the country than before the pandemic. According to the Overseas Labor Bureau, about 54,300 workers left Vietnam to work abroad in the first eleven months of 2020 - a sharp decline from 148,000 people in 2019. Phung Duc Tung - Director of the Mekong Development Research Institute, which specializes in labor and migration issues in Vietnam and other issues - said that the biggest challenge for overseas workers when they returned is losing their jobs and income in the country they are working in, due to lack of official information about the repatriation date and plan from their government. "This led to psychological problems, depression, pessimism, and there was a suicide case when he returned to Vietnam." Tung said, referring to a Vietnamese driver who ended his life in the quarantine facility. He helped a group of undocumented Chinese citizens to enter for US$260 per passenger and he believed to be facing financial problems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cStrict government measures have left many citizens trapped abroad. To bring them home, since the end of April 2020, Hanoi has organized repatriation flights or charter flights, the flight which passengers have to pay high price for their tickets. According to government data, in the past eight months of 2020, about 65,000 Vietnamese people have been repatriated through 235 such flights. But while the initiative is well-intentioned, it may not be enough to satisfy demand from overseas Vietnamese. This led to many illegal attempts to go home despite facing criminal charges. In some of the cases, illegal entrants tested positive for COVID-19 after living for a long time in the community. The Vietnam Border Guard had detained more than 31,000 illegal entrants in 2020, including 25,000 from China, the rest are from Laos and Cambodia. \c\cAlthough the authorities have put in place mandatory measures to prevent the spread of disease, there are some people still escaping the quarantined area or dishonest reporting about their symptoms, these actions caused serious consequences to the public. In March 2020, the first patient in Hanoi (patient #17) did not provide an accurate travel history, which made it difficult for immigration officers to know she had travelled through and so that she could avoid concentrated quarantine. This lack of responsibility has caused many people to be infected, making hundreds of people in the neighborhood and a hospital placed under quarantine, putting stress on the city health system. \c\cAnger was also reported due to the increasing number of the infected cases coming from the Muslim community returning from Malaysia following their attendance of the Tablighi Jamaat festival in Sri Petaling mosque, and two to three patients did not obey the self-quarantine law in Vietnam and still attended Islamic events in Ho Chi Minh City, leading to fury and demands to imprison the Muslim population, even among Vietnamese celebrities. \c\cA 28-year-old Vietnam Airlines attendant known as patient 1342 breached self-isolation protocols when going outside and studying at a university. He infected his friend, a 32-year-old English teacher, breaking Vietnam's 88-day streak without community transmission. The teacher went on to infect at least two others, his one-year-old nephew and a 28-year-old student. The attendant said he left home in Tân Bình District at noon on 21 November to have dinner in Phú Nhuận District then visited HUTECH University in Bình Thạnh District. The university has since been locked down and its students were requested to stay home. According to the director of Ho Chi Minh City health department, patient 1342 not just violated the rules of self-quarantine at home, but also of the Vietnam Airlines quarantine facility. He had intruded into the space of another flight crew and contracted the virus from another attendant who had been confirmed as patient 1325 on 26 November. Under the health ministry's directions, the Vietnam Airlines quarantine facility was closed. Ho Chi Minh City police has opened a criminal investigation into the Vietnam Airlines flight attendant's breach of COVID-19 quarantine protocols. He has been suspended from his job and faces possible dismissal, while his company will be inspected for compliance with disease prevention regulations, quarantine processes and supervision at quarantine facilities. \c\cOn 24 February 2020, a group of 20 South Korean visitors arrived in Da Nang on a flight from Daegu which was South Korea's COVID-19 epicentre. \c\cWhen being informed about the isolation for monitoring by local authorities, some people in the group refused. They were temporarily kept at the Da Nang Lung Disease Hospital before boarding a flight sponsored by the Vietnamese government back to South Korea the following day. \c\cAfter receiving complaints from few South Korean about the quarantined area, YTN has broadcast a controversial news report that Korean citizens are being "detained" under poor conditions. Accordingly, the people who appeared in the video said that even without any symptoms of coronavirus, they were still "detained" in a locked room, and not provided with adequate meals. Notably, this news also criticised the small isolation room, containing 2-3 people. \c\cImmediately after broadcasting and posting the news video on YouTube, YTN received a backlash from Vietnamese netizens. Some people demanded the news agency to apologise for posting false information. Under pressure from netizens, on 2 March, on their official website, YTN News had to publish an apology about the incident. In the statement, YTN stressed that they would continue to tell the truth and protect South Korean citizens, but at the same time be more careful with broadcasting style to avoid misunderstandings, especially regarding cultural differences. \c\cOn 21 August 2021, under the excuse of the weak disease control by the government, a riot broke out in South Tân Uyên Industrial Park, 250 policemen of the Central Mobile Police Regiment were mobilized to suppress the riot. \c\cOn 6 September 2021, a 28-year-old man was sentenced to five years in prison for breaching COVID-19 restriction rules and spreading the virus. He was also fined £630. \c\cOn 3 March 2020, a warehouse containing nearly 1 million masks of unknown origin were discovered after the inspection by the police in Tân Phú District, Ho Chi Minh City. Many other cases involving masks of unknown origins, illegally produced, stored and traded have been detected, prevented and charged in time, such as in An Giang, Lạng Sơn, Cao Bằng, and Quảng Ninh, many other cases of production fake mask, illegal transportation of medical supplies abroad, also including collection and sale discarded masks or used masks to the public. \c\cOn 17 April 2020, at the meeting of the Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control of Hanoi, Mr. Nguyen Duc Chung, Chairman of Hanoi People's Committee said that the Investigation Police Department on Economic, Corruption Crimes and Smuggling (C03) of the Ministry of Public Security invited some officials of the Hanoi Center for Disease Control (HCDC) to the investigation about the purchase process of the COVID-19 testing machine. On 22 April 2020, investigator determined that Mr. Nguyen Nhat Cam, director of the Hanoi CDC, and his accomplices had raised the purchase price for a COVID-19 test kit package using the real-time PCR system by three times. Accordingly, the Investigation Police Department issued a decision to arrest him and six more people on charges of fraudulently buying COVID-19 testing machines. They were probed on charges of violating bidding regulations causing serious consequences, the mastermind of which has faced 10 years in prison. \c\cThe Asia Times reported that "A number of Vietnamese hotels and guesthouses have reportedly hung signs on their doors saying that Chinese guests are not welcome, while many Vietnamese have gone online to demand the closure of all border crossings with China." Signs suggesting that Chinese customers were not welcome were seen in front of a shop in Phú Quốc and a restaurant in Da Nang. South Korean nationals are also reportedly screened due to the rampant outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea, which has extensive trade relationship with Vietnam. When racism started to get more coverage on social media and in the news, the Vietnamese government made a declaration that people could be fined for refusal of service to foreigners. They also provided a hotline for foreigners to call for assistance and to report the situation. \c\cThe xenophobic attitudes also occurred in the use of Chinese vaccines in the vaccination program. Nguyen Phuong Linh, lead analyst of Control Risks consultancy firm, said China's vaccine diplomacy had failed with Vietnam mainly because of anti-China sentiments. For successfully managing COVID-19, Vietnamese leaders have gained strong support from the public – which they would not want to lose by using Chinese vaccines for the majority of the population. "From the beginning of the pandemic, the virus has been widely reported in Vietnam as originally coming from China. Since then, the anti-China sentiments, which were already strong, have shown no sign of weakening.", she said. But in June 2021, Vietnam approved the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine for emergency use and received a donation of 500,000 doses from China. In late July 2021, Ho Chi Minh City received 5 million Sinopharm vaccine doses as part of a corporate donation, prompting public backlash. However, Le Dong Hai Nguyen, an economist at Georgetown School of Foreign Service, wrote in The Diplomat that the Chinese vaccine debacle might just be a publicity stunt, in which the Vietnamese government leveraged anti-Chinese sentiment to boost public acceptance for the AstraZeneca vaccine. "Just as standing next to a less attractive friend makes you look better, Vietnam’s strategy to briefly include the Chinese vaccines in its vaccine pool might just make the AstraZeneca vaccine look marginally more appealing.", he said. According to him, many Vietnamese are willing to wait for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines instead of taking the AstraZeneca vaccine out of concern for blood clots, which could "seriously derail Vietnam’s already sluggish vaccination campaign" that depends mostly on the AstraZeneca vaccine. \c\cLike most of the world's economy, Vietnam was hit hard by the outbreak because of the slowdown of private and national industries, the downturn of stock exchanges, and the lower number of incoming tourists, making hundreds of thousands people struggling to find jobs and are relying mostly on unemployment benefits to survive. According to government figures, 3,000 businesses have closed in the first two months of 2020. However, Vietnam's economic growth is expected to be higher than the Asia average of 2.2%. Despite the deceleration in economic activity and the downside risks posed by the pandemic, Vietnam's GDP growth rate is still to remain one of the highest in Asia-Pacific Region, according to Asian Development Bank report. In November the IMF assessed that Vietnam was expected to be the only country in South East Asia that was expected to grow in 2020. \c\cVietnam Industry Agency says industry manufacturing processing is in short supply of raw materials and components (mostly imported from Japan, China, South Korea) leads to the risk of stopping many factory operation. According to the survey conducted by the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) and the World Bank with the participation of nearly 10,200 enterprises (nearly 85% from domestic private, the rest are from FDI sector) about the impact of COVID-19. The survey results showed that the biggest difficulties for businesses during the pandemic are accessing customers, cash flow, labor and supply chain. At the announcement of the report on the morning of 12 March 2021, Mr. Dau Anh Tuan, Head of the VCCI Legal Department assessed that the pandemic in general had a very negative impact on Vietnam's businesses. \c\cIn total, 87.2% of enterprises participated in the survey said that they are negatively affected, 11% are not and only 2% recorded positive growth rates. Businesses that have been operating for less than 3 years, small and micro-enterprise are struggle the most. In terms of sectors, private enterprises in some industries have the highest rate of negative impacts are garment (97%), information and communication (96%), and electrical equipment manufacturing (94%). Some industries have lower rates of impact but still fluctuate around 80% such as real estate and mining. For the FDI sector, businesses in real estate, information and communication, agriculture and fishery have a large impact, over 95%. \c\cIn addition, to withstand the pandemic, 35% of private enterprises and 22% of FDI enterprises have had to lay off their employees. In which, 36% of small and micro private enterprises, 26% of medium-sized enterprises and 32% of large-scale enterprises implemented this measure. The Vietnam General Statistics Office said export turnover reached US$99.36 billion, down 1.7% year-on-year. Meanwhile, import value reached US$97.48 billion, down 3%, Vietnam's exports to the EU and ASEAN fell 12% and 13.4%\c\cThe International Monetary Fund is projecting Vietnam's economic growth at 2.4% in 2020 at a time when economies of most countries in the world are shrinking. Vietnam's growth was "among the highest in the world, thanks to its decisive steps to contain the health and economic fallout from COVID-19", IMF mission chief Era Dabla-Norris said. VCCI emphasized that COVID-19, besides the negative effects, it also offers Vietnam an opportunity to develop the economy when major partner countries such as Japan, the US, the EU, Australia, etc., are looking for a place to transfer a part of their supply chain out of China. With a number of new-generation free trade agreements such as CPTPP and EVFTA, those will help the country to diversify its economic and trade relations, also create favorable conditions for Vietnamese businesses and attract investment to the priority industries and sectors. \c\cIn the second half of 2020, the nation's economy was somewhat improved despite strict COVID-19 measures. But the new outbreak which occurred before the 2021 Lunar New Year broke this recovery. \c\cDue to the fear of a COVID-19 outbreak in Hải Dương and Quảng Ninh in January 2021, the VN-Index plummeted 6.67%, or 73.23 points, to 1,023 points Thursday, the worst single-session loss since the September 11 attacks. On the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HoSE), on which the VN-Index is based, 478 of its tickers lost and only 20 gained. Out of these, a record 276 tickers hit their floor prices, the lowest they could go in a trading day. In addition, the VN30-Index for the stock market's 30 largest caps sank 6.73%, with 29 stocks losing and one gaining. A total 28 stocks in this basket sank to their floor prices. \c\cAccording to Vietnam's General Statistics Office, the number of employed workers in the first quarter of 2021 decreased by one million people, down to 49,9 million from 50,9 million in the previous quarter. The country still has 9,1 million workers aged 15 and over that were negatively affected by the pandemic. Of which more than half a million people lose their jobs, 2,8 million people took unpaid leave, 3,1 million workers had their working hours cut, and 6,5 million people reporting reduced incomes. Two-thirds of these people are between the ages of 24 and 54. Severe COVID-19 impacts have seen as many as 40,300 companies shut down in the first quarter, a year-on-year increase of 16%. \c\cHowever, the pandemic has changed working habits, promoting the application of online tools for workers to adapt to new normal conditions. At least 78,000 workers said they have turned to technological solutions in order to keep their jobs. \c\cThe April 2021 outbreak in the southern provinces and subsequent disruption to supply chains is a setback for the country's economy and the global supply chain. Lockdown measures made on-site work impossible, resulting in a drop in production capacity. Two major footwear suppliers for Adidas and Nike, Taiwan's Pouchen and South Korea's Changshin with 41,000 workers both ceased operations on 14 July 2021. Six days later, another Taiwanese sports footwear manufacturer, Feng Tay, which accounting for one-sixth of Nike’s annual sales also closed several of its factories. According to the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association (VITAS), more than a third of the country's garment and textile factories have shuttered and the immunization rate among sector workers was still very low due to the delay in purchasing vaccine by the Vietnamese government. In August 2021, enterprises in the textile industry were still able to maintain good export capacity, but are set to face further declines in growth from the fourth quarter of 2021 onwards. \c\cSamsung, one of Vietnam's largest employers, has had manufacturing issues with its smartphones when its injection molding equipment supplier went out of business. Near Ho Chi Minh City, the tech group's appliance facilities are operating at 50% capacity. The outbreak has disrupted the plan to shift production from China to Vietnam of Apple, Google, Amazon and their main suppliers. Google's Pixel 6 smartphone would still be manufactured in China, although Google had previously planned to move production of this device to northern Vietnam in early 2020. Apple's plan to shift production of MacBook, AirPods and iPad to Vietnam was also postponed. In addition to Apple and Google, the production of smart doorbell, security camera and smart speaker for Amazon also faced delays since May when the virus broke out in some northern localities. According to a Japanese chamber of commerce study, many Japanese businesses wanted to repatriate their staff out of Vietnam while Chico's, a Florida-based women's clothing brand, and Callaway Golf, a golf manufacturer, both announced that some of their production has been shifted to another countries. In August 2021, Nikkei Asia ranked Vietnam last in terms of resilience after the pandemic. The two-month lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City - which contributes to 20% of the total GDP of the country - pushed many businesses to the limit when almost all economic activities froze. Of the 21,000 businesses surveyed by the Private Economic Development Research Board and VnExpress, 70% of those have closed, largely because of supply chain disruptions. \c\cConcerns about the outbreak have caused tens of thousands of people to flee their workplaces, worsening the situation. The prolonged closure could jeopardize Vietnam's standing in the global supply chain. According to the General Statistics Office, the gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter of 2021 decreased to negative 6.17% compared to the same period last year. \c\cAt a forum to discuss economic recovery plans on 5 December 2021, Nguyen Thanh Phong, deputy head of the Central Economic Commission, said that in the past two years, if there were no COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam's economy would have grown by 7%. However, due to the impact of the pandemic, the economic growth rate only increased by 2.91% in 2020 and is expected to increase by 2.5% in 2021. Thus, COVID-19 has caused the Vietnamese economy to lose about 847,000 billion VND, equivalent to $37 billion USD. \c\cAccording to a report published by the General Statistics Office, as of December 2020, 32.1 million people nationwide have been affected by the pandemic. Of which, 69.2% of people suffer a decrease in their income, 39.9% have to reduce their working hours and about 14.0% have been laid off. The labour force in the service sector suffered heaviest losses with 71.6% affected, followed by industry and construction (64.7%) and agriculture, forestry and fishery (26.4%). The Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs said the number of people filing for unemployment in May 2020 surged 44% year-on-year to 157,900. In the first five months 26,000 companies suspended their business. \c\cIn the worst-case scenario, the number of workers affected by the pandemic could rise to 7.2 million in the second quarter, the ministry estimated. Generally, in 2020, Vietnam's workforce decreased by 1.2 million people to 54.6 million. In the 2016–2019 period, the labor force increases by 0.8% per year on average. "If the workforce in 2020 maintained the same growth rate as in 2016–2019 period and not affected by the pandemic, there would be 1.6 million more workers in the economy. In other words, COVID-19 could have taken away the chance of these people participating in the labour market.". \c\cThe pandemic also changes the seasonal trend of the labour forces between quarters of the year. In 2016–2019 period, the number of labour forces in the first quarter was always the lowest, then increased gradually in the following quarters and reached the highest level in the fourth quarter. But in 2020, the number of labour started to decline in the first quarter, then continued to decline sharply and hit the bottom in the second quarter and gradually recovered in the third and fourth quarter. "Although the economy are recovering but the workforce in the fourth quarter has not yet reached its pre-pandemic state. The number of labour in fourth quarter was still lower than the first quarter approximately 200,000 people", the General Statistics Office said. \c\cStores across Vietnam were quickly sold out of surgical masks and hand sanitisers after the initial cases of COVID-19 were reported in January 2020, following a similar trend in many other Asian countries. Interim Health Minister Vũ Đức Đam urged the public to remain calm during the outbreak and avoid excessive emergency shopping. Vietnamese authorities also moved to arrest people who profiteered from the outbreak. \c\cTourism is the most severely affected industry in Vietnam. The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam said the aviation industry is in the worst situation in the 60 years of its existence. Of the 234 Vietnam registered aircraft, more than 200 were grounded while airlines still have to spend hundreds of millions dollars to maintain operations such as: aircraft leasing costs, employee salaries, aircraft maintenance and apron parking fees. Vietnam Airlines estimated that its 2020 revenues could decline by US$2.1 billion. This has seen as many as 10,000 employees of the national flag carrier, over 50% of its staff strength, taking unpaid leave. Duong Tri Thanh, CEO of Vietnam Airlines, stressed that the carrier was going through the hardest time in its history. \c\cAccording to the General Statistics Office, in August 2020 only over 16,300 foreigners came to Vietnam, mostly experts coming to work. Since 25 July when the second wave arose, many localities have to closed tourist attractions and deployed measures to curb the spread of infections within the country. The absence of foreign travellers has dealt a severe blow to the tourism sector. \c\cThe ancient imperial city of Huế – which is popular with foreign visitors – resembled a ghost town during the pandemic, with Thừa Thiên Huế province's tourism department saying that 80% of hotels were closed, while 8,000 people had lost their jobs. In Khánh Hòa Province, where Nha Trang is located, saw the number of tourists fall by over 80% to 1,25 million in 2020. As a result, hundreds of hotels are being sold for cheap in tourism hotspot Nha Trang. Authorities have said that the pandemic has caused major difficulties for more than 1,100 accommodation facilities. Around 100 have suspended operations so far, according to the provincial tourism department. \c\cRevenue from lodging and food & beverage services was US$22.1 billion, down 13%, while revenue from travel agencies\' services was US$776 million, a 59.5% drop. The tourism sector served 3.83 million visitors, against a record 18 million in 2019, with the government closing borders and canceling all international flights. The fall was seen in almost all major markets, such as China, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and France. In a recent report by Ho Chi Minh City Department of Tourism, about 90% of travel related businesses in the city had to suspend operations during the second wave. \c\cIn 2020, 66 million passengers passed through the country's airports, a 43.5% decrease given the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and unfavorable weather conditions. Twenty two airports across Vietnam accommodated 340,000 flights operated by 68 foreign and five Vietnamese carriers, down 31.9% from 2019, they also handled nearly 1.3 million tons of cargo, down 14.7% year-on-year, according to a report released by the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV). National flag carrier Vietnam Airlines and two budget carriers VietJet Air and Bamboo Airways have requested government support and refinancing loans. They estimated that under current conditions, the industry would only fully recover by 2023 at the earliest. \c\cThe fourth wave of COVID-19 epidemic caused the summer tourist season to freeze.  Travel agencies are closed completely, restaurants, hotels, amusement parks can\'t operate for many months. According to statistics from the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism, in the first nine months of 2021, the number of domestic tourists decreased by 16% compared to the same period in 2020 and decreased by 52% compared to 2019. Total revenue from tourism in the first 9 months of 2021 reached nearly 137,000 billion VND, down 41% over the same period in 2020. To restore the tourism industry, from the end of September, a series of localities such as Vinh Phuc, Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, Thanh Hoa, Quang Binh, Lam Dong, and Ho Chi Minh City have reopened intra-provincial tourism. Ho Chi Minh City is one of the leading places with tours to Can Gio and Cu Chi for frontline doctors and a series of commercial tours afterwards. In mid-October, many places began to receive foreign tourists to isolated resorts and tourist areas. On 12 November, Vo Huy Cuong, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam, said that the agency had planned to organize nearly 30 flights to Kien Giang and Khanh Hoa. \c\cAccordingly, the agency has received a flight plan from Vietnam Airlines on 17 November and VietJet Air on 20 November to Phu Quoc island in Kien Giang. After that, there will be about 20 flights to Kien Giang and Khanh Hoa from Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand. On 17 November 2021, the flight bringing 29 international tourists to Hoi An landed at Da Nang International Airport. These are the first international tourists to return to Vietnam under the vaccine passport program since the country suspended international arrivals in March 2020. \c\cOn 6 February, under the lead of Phung Xuan Nha, the Minister of Vietnam Education and Training, the Steering Committee for Disease Prevention and Control met and agreed to let the student's stay at home by an additional week after the Tet holiday. On 14 February, the Ministry of Health reported that schools would remain closed until the end of February, after which schools would close nationwide. The nationwide school closure decision was issued together with a nationwide quarantine order on 31 March, which went into effect 1 April. As a matter of fact, Vietnamese students will not to go to school at first semester on 2020–2021 academic year, so schools are slowly adopting online teaching. On 31 March, the Ministry of Education and Training issued a guide of teaching plans for the second semester of the academic year 2019–2020 for junior high school and high school levels. \c\cThe 2020 National High School Graduation Examination (NHSGE) test is only the recognition of the student finishing the high school's education programme instead of "two in one" purpose which is recognition of student finishing the high school's education programme and using high school exams for university admission like before. The test will divided into two specific phases, first phase take place from 8 to 10 August for the least affected provinces. The second phase take place on 3 and 4 September at 11 exam councils, with the participation of more than 26,000 students, mostly in the coronavirus epicentre in central Vietnam, along with others quarantined for having close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. \c\cSchool closures from February to May impacted an estimated 21.2 million children nationwide and meant the loss of access to key health and protective services as well as subsidized school meals. COVID-19 also triggered school drop-outs as children accompany parents seeking employment opportunities at new locations. Approximately 3% of rural households reported they stopped sending children to school due to reduced incomes. Household registration remains a potential administrative barrier, especially for migrant children, to access the public education system. Most notably, the COVID-19 crisis exacerbated the country's stark digital divide: many learners live in remote regions with limited internet coverage, cannot afford devices required for online learning or do not have teachers confident to facilitate such learning. The provision of online and distance learning programmes did not achieve nationwide coverage. Such learning programmes were available from primary to university levels, however, they primarily focused on grades 9 and 12 in other provinces. Only large cities had programmes from elementary to high school. User fees applied for some video lessons. Online and distance learning focused on few subjects like maths, Vietnamese and English and often not available in ethnic minority languages, while vital extra curriculum programmes such as sex education were often not covered. Half of a survey's interviewed participants reported their children studied less or not at all while schools were closed. Many teachers were not well equipped to facilitate online learning, while ethnic minority children and children with disabilities were disproportionately affected. \c\cContrary to the pre-pandemic positive forecast, total pharmaceutical revenue in 2020 only increase by less than 3%, compared with an average of nearly 12% each year due to social distancing and tight control of hospital visits. According to SSI Research, in the ethical drugs market, infection concerns and strict health examination procedures at many hospitals limit the number of patients who come for periodic check-ups causing the number of nationwide medical examination and treatment to decrease 10% to 15%. While in the over-the-counter drugs market (mainly from drugstores and pharmacies), people switch from buying drugs to hand sanitizers and medical masks, which are not the main product of most pharmaceutical companies in the country, reducing the sales of the whole industry. \c\cHowever, 2020 was a "significant" year for merger and acquisition (M&A) activities in the pharmaceutical industry. The total value of M&A in 2020 is estimated at $72.8 million USD, with the participation of many foreign investors. The biggest deal is SK Group (Korea), which specializes in cancer, nerve and cardiovascular drugs, spent $39.8 million to buy 25% shares of Imexpharm Pharmaceutical Company (IMP). In addition, Stada Arzneimittel (Germany), specializing in the production of generic drugs, has spent more than $17.3 million raising its ownership in Pymepharco Joint Stock Company from 70% to 76%; while ASKA Pharmaceutical (Japan), specializing in gastrointestinal drugs, hormones and obstetrics and gynecology, spent $16 million to own 25% stake in Hataphar – the second largest drug company in Vietnam in 2019. These foreign partners all have experience in high-quality drug portfolio that can assist Vietnamese pharmaceutical companies. \c\cThe pandemic poses a big challenge to the performance of the pharmaceutical industry, especially if the disease spreads in the community. But in general, spending on health care is essential and the demand only decreased for a short time. Furthermore, Vietnam's rapidly aging population and increasing per capita income continue to support the long-term growth of the healthcare market, so "the possibility of the industry recovering in 2021 is very likely" SSI's report assessed. \c\cThe pandemic forced the 2020 V.League 1 to be delayed to 7 March until further notice, which affected the preparations of Vietnam national football team for the upcoming 2022 World Cup qualifications. It also caused the inaugural Vietnamese Grand Prix, scheduled to be part of the 2020 Formula One World Championship, to be postponed and later cancelled in its entirety. \c\cOn 23 May 2020, the 2020 V.League 1 had its match between CLB Dược Nam Hà Nam Định and CLB Hoàng Anh Gia Lai with 10,000 spectators on Thiên Trường Stadium, the first professional football match in the world to allow spectators since the pandemic first broke out. \c\cDue to national travel restrictions, the League of Legends esports teams of Vietnam Championship Series could not participate in the 2020 World Championship and 2021 Mid-Season Invitational. \c\cVietnam's National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health commissioned singers Min and Erik to record the song "Ghen Cô Vy" ("Jealous [of] Coronavirus"), a remake of the 2017 song "Ghen" ("Jealous"), to promote common prevention measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, such as personal hygiene, hand-washing and social distancing. The song has since gone viral, first earning praise from John Oliver in his talk show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and has become increasingly popular among the public and was frequently duplicated by netizens, with the UNICEF also recommending the video as a means of combating COVID-19 fears. \c\cAsian Development Bank: In December 2020, ADB announced it has provided to Vietnam $600,000 USD in material aid. This would facilitate the addition of protective equipment worth US$500,000 at the National Lung Hospital in Hanoi and a US$100,000 gear upgrade at the Public Health Emergency Operation Center (PHEOC) under the Ministry of Health. \c\c Australia: Simon Birmingham, Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment congratulated Vietnam for its achievements in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He thanked Vietnam for resuming the export of rice, helping rice importing countries including small countries in the Oceania-Pacific region to ensure their food demand. The Australian government also pledged to deliver 1.5 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Vietnam by the end of 2021. \c\c Chile: Chilean Ambassador to Vietnam, Jaime Chomali said Vietnam has recorded only few new infections although having high population which showed that its efforts have produced persuasive outcomes. He feels confident in Vietnam's rapid economic recovery than that of other regional countries. \c\c China: In a phone call with his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyễn Phú Trọng, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping said that he "appreciates the results of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam, as well as the cooperation and coordination between the two countries in the fight against the coronavirus". In June 2021, 500,000 doses of Sinopharm's Vero Cell vaccine and more than 500,000 syringes donated by the Chinese government to Vietnam, arrived in Hanoi. \c\c Czech Republic: On 26 July the Czech government announced an aid to Vietnam with 250,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine. The Czech Prime Minister said that although the epidemic situation in the Czech Republic continues to be very complicated, the government of the Czech Republic will continue to cooperate and support Vietnam. Specifically, the Czech Republic is ready to cede 500,000 doses of vaccines and some rapid test kits to Vietnam, as well as call on other European countries to support with vaccines being used by countries in the region such as: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, Sinopharm. \c\c France: On August 2021, French president Emmanuel Macron announced that he will deliver 670,000 doses of vaccine to Vietnam through the COVAX mechanism. \c\c Germany: In a statement published on its Facebook page on 14 April, the Federal Foreign Office showed appreciation and gratitude for the reactions of the Vietnamese government and people of Vietnam in supporting the European country's efforts in combatting COVID-19. As of the end of September 2021, Germany has donated 3.45 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and tens of thousands of medical devices to Vietnam. \c\c Hungary: On 11 August 2021, the Hungarian government decided to donate 100,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine to the Vietnamese and 100,000 rapid antigen test kits to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\c Japan: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that his government decided to hand out a coronavirus stimulus of ¥100,000 per individual, including Vietnamese living and working in Japan and affirmed to continue efforts to ensure safety for Vietnamese citizens.

The 2019–2022 Sudanese protests consist of street protests in Sudan starting from mid-September 2019 during the 2019 Sudanese transition to democracy, on issues that included the nomination of a new Chief Justice of Sudan and Attorney-General, killings of civilians by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the toxic effects of cyanide and mercury from gold mining in Northern state and South Kordofan, protests against a state governor in el-Gadarif and against show trials of Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) coordinators, and for officials of the previous government to be dismissed in Red Sea, White Nile, and South Darfur. These protests followed the sustained street protests and civil disobedience of the Sudanese Revolution and the early September 2019 transfer of executive power to the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, civilian prime minister Abdalla Hamdok and his cabinet of ministers. Hamdok described the 39-month transitional period as being defined by the aims of the revolution. \c\cEight months of street protests and sustained civil disobedience in Sudan, starting on 19 December 2018, led to a Political Agreement and Draft Constitutional Declaration defining a 39-month political transition period that started in September 2019, formally transferring executive power to the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, civilian prime minister Abdalla Hamdok and his cabinet of ministers. Gilbert Achcar described the transition period as the fourth phase of the revolution. \c\cOn 12 September, 2000 protestors in Khartoum and other cities and on 19 September 20,000 protestors in Khartoum, Wad Madani, and Port Sudan called for Abdelgadir Mohamed Ahmed to be appointed as chief justice and Mohamed el-Hafiz as Attorney-General, for the Khartoum massacre investigation commission to be created, and for the senior members of the previous government to be either tried in Sudanese courts or extradited to the International Criminal Court investigation in Darfur. \c\cDisplaced people held mass protests in Mershing in South Darfur on 15–16 September 2019 and in Nyala on 17 September after armed men wearing Rapid Support Forces (RSF) uniforms shot dead University of Zalingei student Munir Hamid as well as Adam Mohamed, Hashim Karameldin and Radwan Abdelrahman. The protestors considered the transitional government to be responsible for the deaths and called for "the militias" to be disarmed. \c\cOn 17 September, residents of Simit and other villages in Northern state protested against the construction of a new mine by Hamid Mining Company on the grounds of the risks of pollution from mercury and cyanide used during the extraction procedures. On the same day, people from South Kordofan protested in Khartoum to call for mining to be suspended, as ordered by the governor of South Kordofan but disobeyed by some mining companies. The protestors showed photographs of victims of the cyanide used in the mining process and called for local companies, including El Sunut, al-Junaid (also Juneid), Abarsi and international mining companies to stop mining. \c\cOn 18 and 19 September, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), the Sudanese resistance committees, government employees, and other el-Gadarif residents organised protests in el-Gadarif calling for the removal of the state governor on the grounds of government-controlled radio and television not reporting on activities of the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) and the situation of people affected by flooding, and against the governor's "anti-revolutionary position". On the same two days, the SPA protested in front of courts in Geneina against the trials of eight SPA coordinators, which they considered to be show trials punishing the SPA members for having organised protests and a strike. \c\cTeachers and other public servants in Red Sea protested on 18 September calling for senior officials associated with the previous government to be dismissed. \c\cEngineers and other workers of the White Nile Sugar Workers Union in White Nile protested on 17 September calling for officials of the previous government to be dismissed. Employers of the protestors dismissed three of the engineers and started investigations into others, which the protestors\' committee, the Temporal Committee for the Restoration of the White Nile Sugar Workers Union, considered to be retaliation for having participated in the protest. \c\cOn 22 September, Sudanese police used tear gas against students protesting in Nyala in South Darfur against bread shortages and transport failures and calling for the state governor to be dismissed. The FFC condemned the "use of tear gas and live bullets against peaceful protestors", called for civilian governors to be appointed, and called for an immediate investigation into the actions of the police. \c\cOn 26 September, 2,000 people protested in support of Waleed Abdelrahman Hassan (or Walid, Abdulrahman), a Sudanese student arrested in Cairo for alleged participation in the 21 September street protests in Egypt. The solidarity protest took place in Khartoum in front of the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Egyptian Embassy. The SPA called for Abdelrahman Hassan to be able to contact his family, choose a lawyer, and not be tortured or coerced. Abdelrahman Hassan's friends and relatives stated that an apparent confession by him broadcast by MBC Masr on 26 September, in which he stated support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, was a forced confession, given Abdelrahman Hassan's long-term opposition to Islamists in Sudan under the Omar al-Bashir government, for which he was arrested in 2013 and 2018, and during the Sudanese Revolution. Abdelrahman Hassan's friend Mohammed Saleh described the idea of Hassan supporting the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood as "unbelievable". The SPA stated that the video broadcast was "shameful" and that, "We stress here that the era when Sudanese citizens were humiliated inside or outside their country has gone and will never return." Abedelrahman Hassan was freed on 2 October. \c\cOn 13 October protestors in el-Hilaliya in Gezira started a sit-in calling for the administrative head of el-Hilaliya to be dismissed, for the security committee to be dissolved, and for improvements to be made in education, health care, electricity and the environment.

The families of the victims also protested outside the Emirati embassy in Khartoum on the same day. \c\cAbout 50 young men returned to Libya the same day, following the protests outside the UAE embassy. \c\cOn 31 January, a day after the Sudanese Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Badawi announced a plan to gradually cut fuel subsidies over 18 months, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) called for a "million man march" in Khartoum, which they described as an "expression of national unity" in protest against government policies. \c\cSeveral Sudanese demonstrated outside the government headquarters in Khartoum on 4 February in protest against the 3 February secret meeting between the Chairman of the Sovereignty Council and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The Sudanese government claimed that it had not been notified of the plan to hold the meeting. Politician and religious figure Abdullahi Yousif claimed that Burhan did not have permission to meet with the Israeli prime minister without authorisation from other government members, and described the meeting as a betrayal for Allah. High-ranking military officers met at army headquarters in Khartoum and expressed support for the Burhan–Netanyahu meeting. Al-Burhan stated that his meeting with Netanyahu had been intended to "protect national security". The Sovereignty Council stated that the Sudanese position in relation to Palestine and in support of the rights of Palestinians had not changed. Al-Burhan also stated that relations between Sudan and Israel remained "the responsibility of the designated institutions, in accordance with the Constitutional Document".[citation needed]\c\cOn 12 February, Human Rights Watch stated that former President of Sudan Omar al-Bashir is set to finally answer for his crimes in Darfur, as the Sudanese leaders plan on collaborating with the International Criminal Court. However, the backing of Sudan's military in the handing over of the former president to the ICC, lies with great uncertainty. The decision was reached, when rebel groups and the transitional authorities of Sudan held peace talks in the capital of South Sudan in Juba on Tuesday, according to Al Jazeera. The BBC added that three more people are expected to be handed over to the ICC alongside Omar al-Bashir. Also, a senior official of the Sudanese government disclosed that they are figuring out a way that al-Bashir and the three others can be presented to the ICC without being extradited to the Hague. \c\cThe Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), called for a protest against the government on 20 February, following the dismissal of officers who actively aided the revolution that led to the removal of Omar al-Bashir last year in April. As the protesters gathered in hundreds to demand for the reinstatement of officers and soldiers who were dismissed last week, security forces fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd. At least 17 people were reported to have been injured in the crackdown, according to Reuters. All the victims who were wounded have been urged by the Sudanese Doctors Central Committee to visit the Federal Hospital in order to receive appropriate treatment. \c\cHowever, in Abu Jubeiha in South Kordofan, hundreds of protesters rallied through the streets on 24 February, to protest against the state government's decision to permit the resumption of mining activities by two companies in the town which has left the area highly polluted. The European Union on 29 February, pledged its support for the transitional government of Sudan with €100 million, considering the deteriorating economic situation of the country.

The deputy head of the committee disclosed that 109 ambassadors, diplomats, and administrators were sacked from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, alongside those who were hired via political and social support. It was also reported that last month, assets of the former ruling party were confiscated by the committee, according to Reuters. The committee was created in November last year in accordance with a law, purposely for taking apart the government established by Al Bashir. \c\cOn 5 March, the Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) organisation, disclosed the results of an investigation into the use of violence by armed security forces against pro-democracy protesters in the Khartoum sit-in June 2019, which showed that up to 240 people were killed and more than a hundred others wounded. According to the rights group, the report was founded based on statements of several eyewitnesses, interviews with health practitioners, as well thousands of online video footage and pictures of the attacks. However, doctors associated with the protest movement claimed that at least 128 people were killed, while the authorities argued that the number was 87 and also falsified the allegations that they had given the go-ahead for the deadly 3 June attack. The PHR in the report, further accused the security forces of Sudan for carrying out excessive use of force against pro-democracy protesters. They have also urged member states of the UN to ensure that the perpetrators have been held accountable for their injustice. \c\cOn 9 March, an investigation by Amnesty International, based on fresh evidence, exposed the involvement of all branches of Sudan's security forces in the violence carried out against protesters in 2018 and 2019, which showed how protesters were killed. The group has called on the authorities in Sudan to bring all those responsible for the death of protesters to justice through a just trial, that does not result in punishment by death. \c\cOn 3 June, several Sudanese protesters gathered in the streets of Khartoum, to seek out justice for the dozens of protesters that were killed in the 3 June 2019 crackdown. The protesters held up signs, images of members of the Rapid Support forces that they held responsible for the killings and burnt tires as they rallied through the streets. They also shut down roads in the capital Khartoum, as protests reportedly took place in other towns and cities across the country as well. However, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, while marking the anniversary of the horrific event in a televised statement, assured the Sudanese that the perpetrators of the crackdown will be brought to justice. \c\cOn 9 June, The bank account of former leader Omar al-Bashir was seized, a Sudanese anti-corruption committee disclosed on Tuesday.

Several protesters waved the Sudanese flag, including banners indicating their objection to the foreign domination of Sudan, Anadolu Agency reported. In an attempt to break up the crowd which gathered near the army headquarters, security forces reportedly fired tear gas at the protesters. \c\cOn 29 June, protesters in Nierteti in Central Darfur took to the streets in thousands, calling on security forces to put a stop to the deadly attacks carried out by gunmen on a daily basis in the area. The protesters further demanded increased protection, punishment to the gunmen responsible for the attacks, as well as ensuring they have laid down arms. A day before the sit-in started, unknown gunmen reportedly killed a woman and a soldier of the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) near a camp in Nierteti. \c\cOn 30 June, thousands of Sudanese protesters gathered in the streets of Khartoum, Omdurman, as well as Khartoum North, calling for rapid reform and larger civilian leadership in the country. Several demonstrators expressed their backing of Abdalla Hamdok's cause while urging his government to ensure their demands have been met. During the massive peaceful rally, one person was reportedly killed, with many others wounded. The reported casualty was believed to have died as a result of a bullet to the chest, with 44 others also wounded by either bullet or tear gas, the Sudan Doctors Central Committee disclosed. Similar protests were also held in eastern Sudan's Kassala, and across the country, with some protesters shutting down roads, burning tires and chanting slogans of the anti-Bashir movement. \c\cOn 3 July, protesters in Nertiti in Central Darfur returned to the sit-in outside a government office for the fourth consecutive day, threatening to continue with the demonstrations until their calls were answered, according to the Urdu Point. Following the protests, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok stated on Friday, that a delegation would be sent by the government to the area, in order to meet their demands. According to Dabanga, the protesters had already rejected a delegation from the security committee of Central Darfur, who visited the state capital Zalingei on Thursday. The protesters believe that filing several complaints regarding the insecurity in the area, the state officials haven\'t put in enough effort to bring an end to the attacks. \c\cOn 5 July, the transition government of Sudan disclosed that the Chief of Police, as well as his deputy, were dismissed, as the Sudanese protesters continue to demand justice against officials associated with the former government of Omar al-Bashir, according to Reuters. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok stated on his Twitter account that Ezz Eldin Sheikh Ali had replaced the director-general of Sudan's Police Force, Adel Mohamed Bashaer. The Sudanese parliament, however, did not provide any reason that led to the dismissal of the top officials. According to Reuters, both police officials who were dismissed are accused by several pro-democracy groups and protesters of having ties with the government of ousted ruler President Omar al-Bashir. \c\cOn 13 July, during a peaceful protest in the Fataborno village of Sudan's Northern Darfur, where several people gathered to demand better security in the area, armed men reportedly opened fire at them killing at least 10 people and 17 others injured, according to VOA News. Separately, a police station and cars were said to have been set ablaze by an unknown group of protesters in Kutum town in North Darfur state. On Sunday, demonstrators called for the establishment of a civilian government and improved security, considering that military officers are still occupying the positions of the state governor, even though al-Bashir's administration had already been ousted since April last year. Following the attacks, a state of emergency was declared by the provincial government in the region, adding that more troops would be sent to the affected areas, as well as nearby towns. The United Nations and African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) also stated that it had sent a delegation to Northern Darfur's Kutum town, amidst the ongoing violence in the area. \c\cHowever, the acting governor of North Darfur, Maj Gen Malik Khojali assured the UNAMID and other humanitarian organisations that peace had been restored in both Kutum and Fata Borno, while urging relief organisations to come to the aid of victims of the violence. \c\cOn 17 July, several Sudanese in Khartoum came out to criticise the new government reforms which they considered to be anti-Islamic. Also, protesters in the east and north of Khartoum joined the demonstrations which began after Muslims\' Friday prayers, as they chanted slogans against secularism and the replacement of laws made by God. In anticipation of the protests, bridges connecting to Khartoum were shut down by security forces from 6:00 p.m on Thursday, to the end of Friday, according to the Khartoum State's Security Committee.[citation needed] Some of these reforms included permitting non-Muslims to consume alcohol, as well as decriminalising the conversion from Islam to other religions. Different mosques across Sudan during the Friday prayers, blamed the government for defecting from Islamic laws and encouraged the people to see to the end of Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok's present administration. \c\cOn 21 July, Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir was taken to a courtroom in the capital Khartoum to face trial for partaking in the 1989 coup that brought him into power. Despite being already sentenced on the charges of corruption, there's a possibility that al-Bashir might be given the death penalty if convicted for the 1989 coup, the BBC added. Al-Bashir is also wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on the allegations of crimes against humanity, genocide and other war crimes in Darfur. Prior to statements/evidence being presented, the court decided to adjourn the trial to 11 August, in order to resume in a much larger court that would accommodate more lawyers and family relatives of the defendants. \c\cOn 26 July, UN officials disclosed that a new wave of violence erupted in West Darfur, which led to the death of over 60 people and 60 others injured, the Jakarta Post reported. On Saturday afternoon, about 500 gunmen were said to have attacked Masteri Town, north of Beida, in Darfur, setting houses and part of the local market on fire, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) of the UN revealed in a statement. In light of the attack, about 500 locals were said to have organised a protest calling for increased security, refusing to bury the dead until immediate actions are taken by the authorities. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok assured the delegation of women he met with from the region Sunday, that security forces would be dispatched in order to ensure that the citizens are protected, as well as the agricultural season. He added that a joint security force comprising both the army and police would be deployed in the five states of the Darfur region for increased protection. \c\cOn 17 August, as the civilian-military power-sharing deal marked one year, several Sudanese protesters took to the streets in Khartoum to demand faster reforms, including the election of a legislative body. Near the Council of Ministers, several protesters were sighted waving the Sudanese flags and chanting for quicker reforms. Some protesters, including security forces were said to have been injured when security forces used tear gas in order to break up the gathering of thousands of protesters marking the anniversary.[citation needed] Demonstrators in Omdurman and many other cities were also said to have joined the protests, with the majority of the protesters gathering outside the cabinet headquarters in the capital Khartoum. \c\cSince Condoleezza Rice's visit to Sudan in 2005, Mike Pompeo has now become the first US secretary of state to visit Sudan on Tuesday, 25 August. During Pompeo's visit, he met with the Sudanese Sovereign Council Chair General Abdel Fattah el-Burhan in Khartoum, and also planned to meet with the Prime Minister of Sudan Abdalla Hamdok. The US State Department revealed that the meeting aims to address US backing of the transitional government in Sudan, as well as strengthen relations between Sudan and Israel. However, the Sudanese PM has told Pompeo that he is not yet authorised to normalise ties with Israel, pending the establishment of interim bodies which would deliberate on the issue. \c\cOn 28 August, protests reportedly broke out in eastern Sudan's Kassala town, where demonstrators urged Sudan's leader to remove the governor of Kassala state Saleh Ammar, maintaining that he is incompetent to occupy the position.[citation needed] The protests later turned violent when supporters of Governor Saleh were accused of shooting protesters which resulted in the death of four people and six others wounded, according to VOA News. Several people were said to have stormed the Kassala Grand Market with knives and sticks, setting many shops ablaze. Following the clashes, the Sudanese government has declared a state of emergency in Kassala and sent security reinforcements to avoid further spread of the crisis. \c\cOn 31 August, the Sudanese government signed a groundbreaking peace deal with Sudan's five top rebel groups. The deal was signed in the capital of South Sudan, Juba, in an attempt to resolve the long-standing conflict that has ravaged the country. It also aims to address important issues regarding land ownership, security, power-sharing, as well as allowing the insurgents to join the army. Despite the union of rebel groups from the western region of Darfur and the southern states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, including the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) have signed the peace deal, two other groups have reportedly abstained from participating in the peace process. \c\cOn 3 October, the transitional government of Sudan sealed a peace deal with many rebel groups in an attempt to resolve conflicts that have destabilized the country for years. The deal was signed during a ceremony in South Sudan's capital Juba, between the Sudanese government, Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), and a coalition of rebel groups. According to France 24, two other powerful rebel groups refused to participate in signing the peace deal.

In addition to the three main groups that signed a preliminary deal in August, Abdelaziz al-Hilu's powerful rebel group, Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North, also assented to engaging in peace talks presented by South Sudan last month. \c\cOn 4 October, protesters responded to the recent signing of a peace deal between the Sudanese government and rebel groups which took place on Saturday, by closing the Southern Port of Sudan. The road linking the eastern city and the capital was shut down by the protesters, including Port Sudan's container terminal. The protests were said to have been largely conducted by the members of the Port Sudan Workers Union, as they criticized the failure of the deal to cater for the demands of eastern Sudanese appropriately. Aboud el-Sherbiny, head of the Port Sudan Workers Union disclosed that workers in both the southern port and Suakin port had embarked on a strike, following the peace deal. The workers are calling for the termination of the peace deal, as well as the eastern track, El-Sherbiny added.

Ammar's dismissal came three months after his appointment, which was immediately followed by deadly protests that led to the death of at least five with several others injured. The governor subsequently accused supporters of former leader al-Bashir of being responsible for the protests, although he couldn\'t provide proof to back his claim, Associated Press added. After his appointment in July, Ammar had to stay in Khartoum, due to being prohibited by demonstrators from entering Kassala, who rejected his appointment on the basis of tribe. \c\cLater in the evening, in response to the dismissal of the Kassala state governor, demonstrators were said to have shut down roads and burnt tires in Kassala town, according to Dabanga Sudan. No injuries were reported during the protests, according to Arab News.

Spokesman of Turkey's foreign ministry Hami Aksoy in a statement, also praised the decision, maintaining that Turkey had long awaited for this moment. \c\cOn 19 December, thousands of Sudanese protesters took to the streets to mark the two year anniversary of the protest movement which resulted in the overthrow of former ruler Omar al-Bashir. The major demand of the protesters was that the transitional government must bring about faster reforms, as they want to see a rapid change in the current economic situation in the country. Some protesters, on the other hand, demanded the dissolution of the entire ruling coalition, including the sovereign council and the cabinet. In anticipation of the protests, major roads and streets linking to the government and military headquarters were all shut down by the Sudanese security forces, according to The Washington Post. \c\cDespite thousands of protesters marching in the capital Khartoum, reports have shown that protests also took place in Khartoum's twin city Omdurman, and across other cities in Sudan as well. Protesters who marched towards the presidential palace demanding a sit-in until a parliament is formed, were said to have been met with security forces who fired tear gas and sound grenades at the large crowd. No immediate casualties have been reported yet so far, the ABC News added. \c\cOn 21 December, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) revealed that the Sudanese security forces killed seven protesters while leaving at least 25 other people wounded during unrest in Eastern Sudan's Kassala on October 15, 2020. A 16-year-old boy was said to have been one of the people killed during the protests in which the security forces used live rounds to break up the gathering of protesters, Dabanga added. The HRW has called on the transitional government of Sudan to make sure that those behind the atrocities are brought to justice . They also blamed the police and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for firing at demonstrators, as most of the victims died from bullet wounds. \c\cOn 26 December, tribal clashes erupted in South Darfur's Gireida, between the Masalit farmers and Fallata herders which left at least 15 people dead and dozens wounded. In West Darfur's El Geneina however, a student was reportedly shot dead. Following the heavy clashes, a large number of military forces were deployed to the region to seize weapons and capture those responsible for the violence, the governor of South Darfur state, Musa Mahdi announced. \c\cOn 29 December, dozens of Sudanese protesters took to the streets of Omdurman to demonstrate against the killing of a pro-democracy activist, Bahaa Eddine Nouri. Reports have shown that Bahaa was grabbed earlier on December 16, from a cafe in Khartoum by unidentified men, in a vehicle that had no license plates, the Washington Post revealed. Subsequently, his body was discovered days later at a hospital morgue in Omdurman, which led to the massive protests. According to medical reports given to Sudan's attorney general, the victim was tortured to death in a paramilitary facility which is run by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). \c\cHowever, the head of the RSF's intelligence unit, including other officers who were part of Nouri's torture and capture, have either been apprehended or suspended, while an inquiry is being made into his death, according to the RSF spokesman, Brig. Gen. Gamal Goma. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), in response to the killing of Bahaa Eddine Nouri, has urged for renewed protests, provided the Sudanese government and the RSF are unable to take measures within a period of 15 days. \c\cOn 31 December, the UNAMID ended its peacekeeping mission in Darfur after 13 years. The Sudanese government is now liable for the security of citizens in the area, the mission added. However, after UNAMID's departure, the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS), which is a UN political mission, is expected to be put in place in order to assist the Sudanese government in terms of disbursing aid and strengthening peace as well. Also, the withdrawal of the peacekeepers which commences in January, will be concluded within a period of six months, according to the UN. \c\cOn 24 January, several Sudanese protesters took to the streets of Khartoum to protest against the worsening economic situation in the country. Protesters were said to have burnt tires, set up barricades, and shut down streets across the capital Khartoum, including its twin city Omdurman, in an attempt to express their frustrations over the government's failure in tackling the numerous problems they\'ve been facing. In an effort to break up the large gathering of angry protesters, the Sudanese police reportedly fired tear gas. Omar El Degeir, the President of the Sudanese Congress Party urged the Sudanese transitional to stop turning a blind eye on the increasing protests, they should rather try to tackle the economic situation and speak to the protesters as well. \c\cOn 7 February, the Sudanese Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok announced the dissolution of his cabinet. However, a new cabinet is expected to be revealed on Monday, according to the Sudan's Transitional Sovereignty Council's media office. \c\cOn 8 February, a new cabinet of 20 ministers was announced by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. The leader of Darfur rebel group Gibril Ibrahim was said to have been named as the new finance minister, according to Al Jazeera. The position of foreign minister was handed to the leader of the famous Umma Party, Mariam al-Mahdi, Reuters added. \c\cHamdok explained that despite all obstacles, the reshuffling of the cabinet is geared towards reviving the country and that he is confident they will succeed. Turkish Foreign Ministry in a statement, expressed that Turkey is delighted with the attempt made by the Sudanese transitional government to reshuffle its cabinet and believes that it will strengthen the peace in Sudan. \c\cOn 9 February, despite the creation of a new cabinet by the Sudanese government, protests reportedly erupted across several cities in Sudan, due to worsening living conditions. Security forces used tear gas in an attempt to disperse protesters who destroyed government buildings, as well as burnt tyres on the main streets. Several markets in different cities were also said to have been looted. \c\cOn 10 February, the new cabinet created by the Sudanese transitional government was sworn in at the presidential palace in Khartoum by the head of the ruling Sovereign Council, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. \c\cOn 21 February, in an attempt to tackle the deepening economic crisis in Sudan, the Central Bank of Sudan revealed the devaluation of the Sudanese currency. The move which was delayed for months, was carried out in line with the major demand made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other foreign donors. However, reforms of Sudan's customs exchange rate is still in progress, as it was not made a part of the devaluation, the Sudanese Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim maintained. \c\cOn 28 March, in an attempt to reach a lasting peace deal that will allow for the separation of religion and the state, the Sudanese government and a major rebel group from its southern Nuba Mountains signed a peace agreement. The agreement was signed in the capital of South Sudan Juba, by the chairman of the ruling Sovereign Council, Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, and Sudan Liberation Movement-North Sector (SPLM-N) leader, Abdul Aziz Alhilu, and is expected to enable the commencement of the final peace agreement. Following the signing of the peace agreement on Sunday, the major security challenge to the Sudanese transitional government is only one rebel group, which is a faction of the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA). \c\cOn 31 March, the United States revealed that it had received a $335 million settlement from Sudan, as compensation for the victims of terror attacks. The move made by Sudan was part of a deal that was agreed to last year, which is supposed to facilitate the removal of Sudan from the United States terrorism list. \c\cOn 8 April, hundreds of Sudanese women were said to have taken to the streets in Khartoum, to protest against gender-based discrimination and better reforms. During the demonstration, one protester was reportedly wounded after being run over by a vehicle driver. Later, reports suggested that the driver had been apprehended by security forces. One of the key demands made by the demonstrators during the protest was that perpetrators of rape and women abuse domestically and outside should be held accountable by facing proper punishment. \c\cOn 11 May, hundreds of Sudanese protesters reportedly gathered outside the army headquarters in Khartoum to rally over the 2019 protest killings. In an attempt by the Sudanese protesters to break of the gathering of protesters, two people were said to have been killed, the Sudanese army revealed. According to testimonies from eyewitnesses, several others were wounded and many orders were detained, following the use of live ammunition by the Sudanese security forces. The protesters were sighted carrying banners and pictures of the victims of those killed two years ago, shedding tears as they demanded justice for them. The two people who were killed, were identified as Othman Badr al-Din and Mudathir Mukhtar, according to Altaghyeer Newspaper. \c\cOn 16 May, following the death of two protesters during an anniversary protest, some soldiers of the Sudanese army who are currently under investigation for the death of the two protesters, have been handed over to civilian prosecution. The chairman of the Sovereign Transitional Council, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhane transferred over the findings of an investigation conducted by the armed forces, to the Attorney General, Tagelsir al-Hebr. Although the actual number of soldiers who were detained was not revealed, the chief prosecutor’s office maintained that seven soldiers were charged by the military for the direct involvement in the use of live ammunition. \c\cOn 19 May, the Human Rights Watch (HRW), confirmed that the Sudanese armed forces had applied unlawful and excessive force against protesters who gathered in front of the military headquarters in Khartoum, on May 11, 2020. The organization also added that Sudan’s Ministry of Health stated that two people were killed, while thirty-seven others were wounded. \c\cOn 9 June, the outgoing chief of the International Criminal Court (ICC) Fatou Bensouda, called on the Sudanese transitional government to hand over the three suspects alleged of war crimes, including former president Omar al-Bashir to the ICC. According to the chief, victims\' messages from Sudan’s Zalingei, El Fasher, and Nyala, have all insisted that the suspects must be transferred to the ICC, by upholding outstanding warrants. Former interior minister and governor Ahmad Harun, should be immediately transferred, in order to be tried alongside Sudanese militia leader Ali Kushayb, Bensouda added. \c\cOn 10 June, several protesters took to the streets in Khartoum, to protest over the government’s removal of subsidies on petrol and diesel. The protesters were said to have set tyres ablaze and also shut down roads in the capital.According to the finance minister Jibril Ibrahim, the hike in prices is due to the import costs. Other cities across Sudan are also anticipated to be joining the protest and make it nationwide. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) has also threatened to organize street protests in rejection of the decision. However, the Sudanese government maintained that it would ensure that the gangs behind the road blockades are dealt with by the police and prosecutors. \c\cOn 15 June, the Sudanese PM Abdalla Hamdok expressed concerns over loyalists of the previous government inciting violence and civil war. He stated that the government will not accommodate those trying to sabotage the country, and that action would be taken according to the constitution. \c\cOn 5 August, six paramilitary officers were handed the death sentence by a Sudanese court, for the killing of six protesters in 2019. Out of the six protesters who were killed in the city of Al-Obeid in North Kordofan in 2019, four of them were believed to be schoolchildren.  Apart from the six members of the paramilitary force who were sentenced to death, two more defendants were acquitted, and one other below the age of 18 was transferred to a juvenile court.  However, there was no immediate confirmation on whether the six members would appeal against the death sentence. \c\cOn 16 October, pro-military protesters held a protest in Khartoum demanding a military coup. They were allowed to reach the gates of the presidential palace with a negligible police presence. They called for General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, chairman of the Sovereignty Council, to seize control and take over the country. The pro-military protesters continued their sit-in outside the presidential palace in Khartoum through to 21 October. \c\cOn 21 October, hundreds of thousands of pro-civilian protestors in cities around Sudan including Khartoum, Omdurman, Port Sudan and Atbara took to the streets in support of the civilian government. \c\cOn 24 October, pro-military protesters blocked major roads and bridges in Khartoum. Security forces used tear gas to disperse the crowds. \c\cAfter the October 2021 Sudanese coup d\'état, the Sudanese Professionals Association and the FFC, called for mass civil disobedience and refusal to cooperate with the coup. The National Umma Party similarly denounced the arrests of the government ministers and called on the public to protest in the streets. The Sudanese Communist Party advocated for a workers\' strike and mass civil disobedience. Following the arrests, demonstrators started gathering in the streets of Khartoum, lighting car tires and setting up roadblocks. Chants by the protestors included "the people are stronger", "retreat [to military rule] is impossible", "We are revolutionaries. We are free. We will complete the journey." Most schools, banks and businesses were closed. \c\cAccording to the Information Ministry, the army used live rounds to disperse the protesters in the 25 October protests. Military forces tried to remove protestors\' barricades and attacked civilians. Seven civilians were killed and over 140 injured during the protests. Security forces conducted house-to-house arrests of protest organizers. The Socialist Doctors\' Association stated that the Royal Care hospital near army headquarters was in "urgent need of blood". Three hundred protestors were arrested. Protest locations outside of Khartoum included Gezira and Red Sea State. \c\cPlans for continued protests called the "Revolutionary Escalation Schedule" were published by the Joint Chamber of the Marches of the Millions for Civilian rule and Democratic Transition. The plans included vigils on highways and in front of government buildings and embassies, nightly marches starting on 29 October and mass protests on 30 October throughout Sudan, calling for a full transfer of power to civilians. \c\cProtests continued on 26 October, with protestors chanting slogans, blocking roads and burning tyres. There was "complete civil disobedience", with schools, shops and petrol stations closed in Geneina. Protests outside of the capital took place in Atbara, Dongola, El-Obeid and Port Sudan. \c\cProtests continued on 27 October in Khartoum and Atbara. Most government and educational institutions were in "complete paralysis" and travel between Khartoum and the states of Sudan had mostly stopped. Security forces used live fire while trying to remove protestors\' road blocks in Khartoum. Demonstrations became large in Khartoum in the evening. \c\cProtesters continued rallying in Atbara, Khartoum, Omdurman, El Gezira, Port Sudan and other cities and towns across Sudan on October 28. In the night, more people joined protests in Khartoum and youths elsewhere protested in the night. In the morning of 29 October, one demonstrator was killed by security forces during deadly clashes early morning. Security forces tore down barricades in Khartoum and more forces were deployed across the city. \c\cActivists gear up for a “Million Man March” on 29 October for 30 October, distributing fliers to people and passer-by on the streets of Khartoum. Protesters continued civil disobedience after Friday Prayers\c\cThousands of Sudanese marched into the streets, chanting “revolution, revolution” to the sound of whistles and drums, to protest against the coup that is threatening to derail the country’s fitful transition to democracy. Two shot dead during large demonstrations in Khartoum. Many routes were blocked by checkpoints set up by the military so protesters had to go different routes on 30 October. Three dead amid deadly clashes in Khartoum. \c\cOn Sunday morning, militia forces forced some protesters to disperse from forming barricades in Khartoum. Protesters continued demonstrating on Sunday, after Saturday’s crackdown. \c\cOn 21 November 2021, all political prisoners were freed and Abdalla Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister as part of an agreement with the civilian political parties. \c\cOn 31 December 2021, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD) claimed that at least 4 protesters were killed and 200 injured on the previous day (30 December), when security forces opened fire on protestors in Omdurman. \c\cOn 1 January 2022, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD) said the death toll amongst those demonstrating on 30 December 2021, had risen to six. The CCSD also claimed that since the Sudanese military's overthrow of Abdalla Hamdok's transitional government and declared state of emergency on 25 October 2021, a total of 54 protestors had been killed. \c\cOn 2 January 2022, two more protesters were killed - one in Khartoum and one in Omdurman. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD) said the death toll amongst protesters since the 25 October 2021 coup, was 56. It later went up to 57. Amid those protests, Abdalla Hamdok announced his resignation as Prime Minister.
Cyberwarfare is a part of Iran's "soft war" military strategy. Being both a victim and wager of cyberwarfare, Iran is considered an emerging military power in the field. \c\cSince November 2010, an organization called "The Cyber Defense Command" (Persian: قرارگاه دفاع سایبری; Gharargah-e Defa-e Saiberi) has been operating in Iran under the supervision of the country's "Passive Civil Defense Organization" (Persian: سازمان پدافند غیرعامل; Sazeman-e Padafand-e Gheyr-e Amel) which is itself a subdivision of the Joint Staff of Iranian Armed Forces. \c\cAccording to a 2014 report by Institute for National Security Studies, Iran is "one of the most active players in the international cyber arena". In 2013, a Revolutionary Guards general stated that Iran has "the 4th biggest cyber power among the world's cyber armies."\c\cAccording to a 2021 report by a cyber-security company, "Iran is running two surveillance operations in cyber-space, targeting more than 1,000 dissidents". \c\cIranian cyber defense system - digital fortress part of national information network (national internet) - is developed for thwarting and attacks and  engage attackers. \c\cIn June 2010, Iran was the victim of a cyber-attack when its nuclear facility in Natanz was infiltrated by the cyber-worm \'Stuxnet\'. Reportedly a combined effort by the United States and Israel, Stuxnet destroyed perhaps over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges and, according to a Business Insider article, "[set] Tehran's atomic programme back by at least two years." The worm spread beyond the plant to allegedly infect over 60,000 computers, but the government of Iran indicates it caused no significant damage. Iran crowdsourced solutions to the worm and is purportedly now better positioned in terms of cyber warfare technology. No government has claimed responsibility for the worm. The cyber-worm was also used against North Korea.[citation needed]\c\cIn October 2013, media reported Mojtaba Ahmadi, who served as commander of the "Cyber War Headquarters" was found dead wounded by bullets in Karaj. \c\c November 2018: The Iranian telecommunication minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi accuses Israel of a failed cyberattack on its telecommunications infrastructure, and vows to respond with legal action. \c\cIranian fuel 2021 cyberstrike\c\cThe Iranian government has been accused by western analysts of its own cyber-attacks against the United States, Israel and Persian Gulf Arab countries, but deny this, including specific allegations of 2012 involvement in hacking into American banks. The conflict between Iran and the United States has been called "history's first known cyber-war" by Michael Joseph Gross mid-2013. \c\c August 2014: An IDF official told press in that Iran has launched numerous significant attacks against Israel's Internet infrastructure. \c\c 31 March 2015: There was a massive power outage for 12 hours in 44 of 81 provinces of Turkey, holding 40 million people. Istanbul and Ankara were among the places suffering blackout. According to Observer.com, Iranian hackers, possibly Iranian Cyber Army, were behind the power outage. \c\c June 2017: The Daily Telegraph reported that intelligence officials concluded that Iran was responsible for a cyberattack on the British Parliament lasting 12 hours that compromised around 90 email accounts of MPs. The motive for the attack is unknown but experts suggested that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps could be using cyberwarfare to undermine the Iran nuclear deal. \c\c January 2022: The website of Israel's Jerusalem Post newspaper is hacked by suspected Iranian hackers. The website's content was replaced with a threat to target the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center, and an apparent reference to Qasem Soleimani who was assassinated exactly two years earlier in Baghdad, Iraq. \c\cOn May 5, 2020, Reuters reported, quoting a monthly Facebook report, that Iranian state-run media had targeted hundreds of fake social media accounts to covertly spread pro-Iranian messaging, online since at least 2011, for secretly broadcasting online promotional messages in favor of Iran in order targeting voters in countries including Britain and the United States. Accounts suspended for coordinated inauthentic behavior, which removed eight networks in recent weeks, including one with links to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting.
The COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China was the first country to experience an outbreak of the disease, the first to impose drastic measures in response (including lockdowns and face mask mandates), and one of the first countries to bring the outbreak under control. \c\cThe outbreak was first manifested as a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases, mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Market, in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. It was first reported to the local government on 27 December 2019 and published on 31 December. On 8 January 2020, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of the pneumonia by Chinese scientists. \c\cDuring the pandemic, the Chinese government has shown a pattern of secrecy and top-down control. It censored discussions about the outbreak since the beginning of its spread, from as early as 1 January,  worked to censor and counter reporting and criticism about the crisis – which included the detention of several citizen journalists –  and portray the official response to the outbreak in a positive light, and restricted and facilitated investigations probing the origins of COVID-19. A 2021 academic study found that the total number of excess pneumonia deaths in China during the outbreak was less than 5,000. \c\cThe local governments of Wuhan and Hubei were widely criticized for their delayed responses to the virus and their censorship of the related information during the initial outbreak, especially during the local parliamentary sessions. This allowed early spread of the virus, as a large number of Chinese people returned home for the Chinese New Year vacation from and through Wuhan, a major transportation hub. However, stringent measures such as lockdown of Wuhan and the wider Hubei province and face mask mandates were introduced around 23 January, which significantly lowered and delayed the epidemic peak according to epidemiology modelling. Yet, by 29 January, the virus was found to have spread to all provinces of mainland China. By the same date, all provinces had launched high-level public health emergency responses. Many inter-province bus services and railway services were suspended. \c\cOn 31 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A severe shortage of face masks and other protective gear led several countries to send international aid, including medical supplies, to China. \c\cBy late February, the pandemic had been brought under control in most Chinese provinces. On 25 February, the reported number of newly confirmed cases outside mainland China exceeded those reported from within for the first time; the WHO estimated that the measures taken in the country averted a significant number of cases. By 6 March the reported number of new cases had dropped to fewer than 100 nationally per day, down from thousands per day at the height of the crisis. On 13 March, the reported number of newly imported cases passed that of domestically transmitted new cases for the first time. \c\cBy the Summer of 2020, widespread community transmission in China had been ended, and restrictions were significantly eased. Sporadic local outbreaks caused by imported cases have happened since then, which authorities responded to with testing and restrictions. \c\cDifferent neighbourhoods or townships were classified into high-, medium- or low-risk based on the number of confirmed cases and whether there were cluster cases,\c\cwhich formed the basis for the gradual easing of lockdown measures since March. Lockdown in hard-hit Wuhan was officially lifted on 8 April. \c\cChina is one of a small number of countries that have pursued a zero-COVID strategy, which aims to completely eliminate transmission of the virus within the country and allow resumption of normal economic and social activity. \c\cDespite concerns about automated social control, health codes generated by software have been used for contact tracing: only people with green code can move freely, while those with red or yellow code need to be reported to the government. With domestic tourism first reopened among the pandemic-hit industries, China's economy continued to broaden recovery from the recession during the pandemic, with stable job creation and record international trade growth, although retail consumption was still slower than predicted. China was the only major economy to report economic growth in 2020. \c\cIn July 2020, the government granted an emergency use authorization for two COVID-19 vaccines. It has also pledged or provided humanitarian assistance to other countries dealing with the virus. By June 2021, a billion doses of domestically produced vaccine had been administered in China, giving a dose rate similar to many European countries. A further billion doses had been administered by late August of the same year. \c\cNew infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. \c\cSince the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in China have been worried about the potential return of the deadly virus which motivated the Chinese government to reform its public health system to handle the next public health crisis. As part of the reform, China expanded the laboratory networks to handle the pathogens of the infectious diseases which included a newly built BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan and a national key laboratory to investigate into pneumonia with unclear causes. Zeng Guang, the Chief Scientist at China CDC believed that a quicker publication of the epidemic information was a lesson that China learned from the SARS outbreak as the lack of information release worsened the outbreak. \c\cWith the improved public health system, China managed to handle several public health emergencies. In coping with the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak starting from Mexico, China developed and distributed vaccines to 100 million people within months as an active prevention. During the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in East China, the country's health system identified the pathogen 5 days after the outbreak. Test kits for diagnosis were designed and distributed to all mainland provinces 3 days after the identification. Within months, effective vaccines were developed. Besides, Chinese academic Li Lanjuan and her group was the first to reveal the virus's transmission methods, molecular mechanisms and effective treatment. \c\cHowever, Southern Metropolis Daily stated that although people paid more attention to public health, the government's funding to the health system was far from enough as CDCs in smaller municipalities had to reduce their staff. 10 years after the SARS outbreak, few people wore a face mask when they had respiratory symptoms and the hospitals were cutting the fever clinics off. Despite confidence in winning the next battle against SARS, Zhong Nanshan who earned fame in fighting the SARS outbreak in 2003 still held a conservative attitude to whether the Chinese officials would lie to the people about a disease outbreak. \c\cEarly cases surrounding the animal market suggested potential animal-to-human transmission while later the virus was found to be able to transmit from ill people to others. There have been cases where asymptomatic patients transmitted the virus to others. According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. The typical symptoms of the viral infection included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia which are usually developed after an incubation time lasting as long as 2 weeks. The existence of mild but infectious cases complicated the epidemic control efforts. It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period. \c\cBased on retrospective analysis published in The Lancet in late January, the first confirmed patient started experiencing symptoms on 1 December 2019, though the South China Morning Post later reported that a retrospective analysis showed the first case may have been a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province as early as 17 November. On 27 March 2020, news outlets citing a government document reported a 57-year-old woman, who started having symptoms on 10 December 2019 and subsequently tested positive for the COVID-19 disease may have been the index case in the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the first confirmed patient did not have any exposure to Huanan Seafood Market, an outbreak of the virus began among the people who had been exposed to the market nine days later. \c\cThe outbreak went unnoticed until 26 December 2019, when Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hubei Xinhua Hospital, noticed a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin, several of whom had connections to the Huanan Seafood Market. She subsequently alerted the hospital, as well as municipal and provincial health authorities, which issued an alert on 30 December. Results from patient samples obtained on 29–30 December indicated the presence of a novel coronavirus, related to SARS. On 1 January 2020, Jianghan District's Health Agency and Administration for Market Regulation closed down the seafood market and collected samples for testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first report on the outbreak on 5 January 2020. Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University completed sequencing of the novel virus on the same day, and published the results to the online database GenBank on 11 January. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted:\c\cOn 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted. \c\cSemi-log graph of 3-day rolling average of new cases and deaths in China during COVID-19 epidemic showing the lockdown on 23 January and partial lifting on 19 March. \c\cOn January 25, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping warned that China was facing a \'grave situation\'. He held a Party Politburo meeting which promised resources and experts for treatment and supplies to Hubei as more and more cases of the viral infection, mostly exported from Wuhan were confirmed in other cities in Hubei and multiple parts in mainland China. On 29 January, Tibet announced its first confirmed case, a male who traveled from Wuhan to Lhasa by rail on 22–24 January which marked that the virus spread to all parts of mainland China. \c\cThe 25 January Chinese New Year celebrations were canceled in many cities. Public transportation passengers were checked for their temperatures to see whether they had a fever. Henan, Wuxi, Hefei, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia suspended trade of living poultry on 21 January. \c\cFinancial Times described the outbreak as China's Chernobyl moment, increasing the pressure on its leader, Xi Jinping. A trade war with the US, Hong Kong protests, and an African swine fever outbreak that led to a pork shortage already placed pressure on the current government. \c\cAt the end of December 2019, Henan announced the suspension of passenger trains to and from Wuhan. In early January 2020, the local government of Henan Province with its complete disinfection measures, effective and intensive publicity, a strong awareness of epidemic prevention and quarantine among the people, the setting up of return spots at the village entrance and even the use of garbage trucks, the digging of trenches to block roads connecting Hubei and the hanging of slogans such as "return home with sickness is to dishonor your parents." #抄河南的作业 (lit. \'copy Henan's homework\') became a trending Weibo topic hashtag. \c\cHowever, cutting the roads off without authorization is illegal in mainland China as Xinhua and the Public Security Ministry pointed out. The Ministry of Transport asked the local governments to take the principle of "block one, not three (Chinese: 一断三不断)", that is, to block the virus from spreading, but not to block roads, traffic and Internet access, the transportation of emergency supplies and the transportation of essential goods. \c\cBy 21 January, government officials warned against hiding the disease. \c\cOn 22 January, Hubei launched a Class 2 Response to Public Health Emergency. Ahead of the Hubei authorities, a Class 1 Response to Public Health Emergency, the highest response level was announced by the mainland province of Zhejiang on 23. Guangdong and Hunan followed suit later on the day. On the following day, Hubei and other 13 mainland provinces also launched a Class 1 Response. By 29, all parts of mainland initiated a Class 1 Response after Tibet upgraded its response level on that day. \c\cThe highest response level authorizes a provincial government to requisition resources under the administration to control the epidemic. The government was allowed to organize and coordinate treatment for the patients, make investigations into the epidemic area, declare certain areas in the province as an epidemic control area, issue compulsory orders, manage human movement, publish information and reports, sustain social stability and to do other work related to epidemic control. \c\cOn 11 June, officials confirmed another outbreak of the infection in Fengtai, a south-western district in Beijing.

In the province of Shandong, officials issued guidance forbidding online preaching, a vital way for churches to reach congregants amid both persecution and the spread of the virus.[unreliable source?]\c\cThe outbreak made an impact on the National People's Congress (NPC), China's national parliament and many local parliaments. On 27 January, the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee (PPCSC) of Yunnan announced to postpone local Lianghui sessions scheduled for early February which was followed by the PPCSC of Sichuan on 28 January. The local parliament sessions of cities including Hohhot, Chengdu, Jinan, Qingdao, Binzhou, Zhengzhou, Pingdingshan, Anyang, Hefei, Changzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Zhoushan, Ganzhou, Shangluo, and Jiangjin were also put off. \c\cThe NPC's Standing Committee will discuss on 24 February to decide whether to delay its March session or not. The 10-day session in March is an annual gathering of about 3,000 delegates from all parts of China where the major laws are passed and key economic targets are unveiled. The potential delay will be the first time since 1995 when the NPC first adopted the schedule for the March session. Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong believed that the sessions may not only increase the risk of infections but also "post hostile and embarrassing questions to the top officials about the outbreak." He also believed that canceling the meetings would be possible although this never happened after the Cultural Revolution. \c\cIn late January, economists predicted a V-shaped recovery. By March, it was much more uncertain. Millions of workers were stranded far from their jobs while the workplaces were short-handed. The data for February 2020—the first full month after the virus became a major factor in January—saw official indicators of economic activity fall to record lows. The Caixin manufacturing index (PMI) fell to 35.7 in February from 50 in January, showing a deep contraction. The nation's non-manufacturing index sank even further to a record low of 29.6 in February from 54.1 in January 2020. According to The Wall Street Journal, "The factory index indicated contraction for most of 2019, hit by a trade war between the United States and China. It didn\'t cross back into expansion until late [2019] when trade tensions between the two sides eased."\c\cChina's economic growth is expected to slow by up to 1.1 percentage in the first half of 2020 as economic activity is negatively affected by the new COVID-19 outbreak, according to a Morgan Stanley study cited by Reuters. But, on 1 February 2020, the People's Bank of China said that the impact of the epidemic on China's economy was temporary and the fundamentals of China's long-term positive and high-quality growth remained unchanged. \c\cDue to the outbreak, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced that with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Spring Festival holiday was extended to 2 February and trading will resume on 3 February. Before that, on 23 January, the last trading day of shares before the Spring Festival, all three major stock indexes opened lower, creating a drop of about 3% and the Shanghai index fell below 3000. On 2 February, the first trading day after the holiday, the three major indexes even set a record low opening of about 8%. By the end of the day, the decline narrowed to about 7%, the Shenzhen index fell below 10,000 points, and a total of 3,177 stocks in the two markets fell. \c\cThe People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange announced that the inter-bank RMB foreign exchange market, the foreign-currency-to-market and the foreign-currency market will extend their holiday closed until 2 February 2020. When the market opened on 3 February, the Renminbi declined against major foreign currencies. The central parity rate of the Renminbi against the US dollar opened at 6.9249, a drop of 373 basis points from the previous trading day. It fell below the 7.00 than an hour after the opening, and closed at 7.0257. \c\cThe sale of new cars in China was affected by the outbreak. There was a 92% reduction on the volume of cars sold during the first two weeks of February 2020. According to the sources of Automative News, Chinese policymakers had discussed the extension of subsidies for electric-vehicle purchases beyond this year to revive sales, while also discussing reducing requirements for zero-emission vehicle shares of production. \c\cBy 13 March, most business outside of Hubei was active again. The Caixin PMI increased to 50 at the end of March. \c\cDuring Q1 2020, China's GDP dropped by 6.8 percent, the first contraction since 1992. \c\cIn May 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that, for the first time in history, the central government wouldn\'t set an economic growth target for 2020, with the economy having contracted by 6.8% compared to 2019 and China facing an "unpredictable" time. However, the government also stated an intention to create 9 million new urban jobs until the end of 2020. \c\cBy late 2020, the economic recovery was accelerating amid increasing demand for Chinese manufactured goods. The UK-based Centre for Economics and Business Research projected that China's "skilful management of the pandemic" would allow the Chinese economy to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy by nominal GDP in 2028, five years sooner than previously expected. However, a government report cautioned that the recovery was "not yet solid". \c\cIn January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs. Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. \c\cBy the end of March, as many as 80 million workers may have been unemployed, according to an estimate by economist Zhang Bin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; this estimate included migrant workers and people in rural areas, whom the official statistics from Beijing do not take into account. \c\cIn China, face masks have been used widely by the general public during the pandemic, and have been required in many locations. As the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market saw a shortage of face masks due to the increased need from the public. It was reported that Shanghai customers had to queue for nearly an hour to buy a pack of face masks which was sold out in another half an hour. Some stores are hoarding, driving the prices up and other acts so the market regulator said that it will crack down on such acts. The shortage will not be relieved until late February when most workers return from the New Year vacation according to Lei Limin, an expert in the industry.[needs update]\c\cOn 22 January 2020, Taobao, China's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group said that all face masks on Taobao and Tmall would not be allowed to increase in price. The special subsidies would be provided to the retailers. Also, Alibaba Health's "urgent drug delivery" service would not be closed during the Spring Festival. JD, another leading Chinese e-commerce platform said, "We are actively working to ensure supply and price stability from sources, storage and distribution, platform control and so on" and "while fully ensuring price stability for JD's own commodities, JD.com also exercised strict control over the commodities on JD's platform. Third-party vendors selling face masks are prohibited from raising prices. Once it is confirmed that the prices of third-party vendors have increased abnormally, JD will immediately remove the offending commodities from shelves and deal with the offending vendors accordingly." The other major e-commerce platforms including Sunning.com and Pinduoduo also promised to keep the prices of health products stable. \c\cFigures from China Customs show that some 2.46 billion pieces of epidemic prevention and control materials had been imported between 24 January and 29 February, including 2.02 billion masks and 25.38 million items of protective clothing valued at 8.2 billion yuan ($1 billion). Press reported that the China Poly Group, together with other Chinese companies and state-owned enterprises, had an important role in scouring markets abroad to procure essential medical supplies and equipment for China. Risland (formerly Country Garden) sourced 82 tonnes of supplies, which were subsequently airlifted to Wuhan. \c\cBy March, China has been producing 100 million masks per day to meet the demand of medical staff and general public. \c\cThe slowdown in manufacturing, construction, transportation and overall economic activity created a temporary reduction by about a quarter in China's greenhouse gas emissions. \c\cEver since Hubei's lockdown, areas bordering Hubei including Yueyang in Hunan and Xinyang in Henan set up checkpoints on roads connecting to Hubei to monitor cars and people coming from Hubei. Between 24 and 25 January, the local governments of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hainan and other areas announced to quarantine passengers from "key areas" of Hubei for 14 days. Chongqing also announced mandatory screening of every person who arrived from Wuhan since 1 January, and set up 3 treatment centers. \c\cSince 1 February, a curfew law that resembles that of Huanggang, Hubei, was put in place by the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang, which is the second largest center after Hubei. Each local family can appoint one family member who may leave their house to purchase essential goods every two days. Since 4 February Zhejiang's capital, Hangzhou, announced the closure of all of its villages, residential communities and work units to guests. Those who enter and exit these places must show valid identification papers. Non-residents and cars will be checked strictly.[needs update] On the same day, Yueqing, Ningbo, Zhengzhou, Linyi, Harbin, Nanjing, Xuzhou and Fuzhou began to take the same approach. Zhumadian, Henan, announced that each family were only allowed to have one member leave the house to purchase essential goods every 5 days. \c\cFactories were closed or reduced production for a few weeks. When they opened again, measures were implemented to reduce risk. \c\cMany local governments implemented restrictions to control the outbreak, including keeping schools closed, cutting off villages, and restricting travel. A smartphone-based health-tracking system was introduced in much of the country. \c\cThe media were issued directives instructing them not to use certain terms:\c\cOn 2 April 2020, the government ordered a Hubei-like lockdown in Jia County, Henan, after a woman tested positive for the COVID-19. It is suspected that she may have been infected when she visited a hospital where three doctors tested positive for the virus, despite showing no symptoms. In early May, restrictions were tightened in Harbin. \c\cIn July 2020, Xinjiang province and its capital Ürümqi were locked down in the wake of the discovery of new cases in the city. \c\cIn January 2021, many cities and districts in the province of Hebei, Jilin and Heilongjiang were put into lockdown to contain a new outbreak in the region. \c\cIn October 2021, the city of Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province, was put into lockdown after six new cases were detected. \c\cFrom 23 December 2021, the city of Xi\'an with 13 million people was put into strict lockdown after local authorities reported more than 250 cases, traced to the Delta variant by authorities.

The US CDC reported that the infections were initially spread through a shared elevator used at different times, and led to at least 71 cases by 22 April. On 10 April, the state-operated Tianshannet reported that there had been no newly confirmed cases of coronavirus in Xinjiang for the preceding 53 days and that there were no coronavirus patients in Xinjiang. \c\cAs factories and other businesses reopened, extensive measures were put in place to avoid infection, including temperature checks, handwashing, disinfection, mask wearing, a mobile phone health app, avoiding public transportation, staggered lunches, physical distancing, contact tracing, and opening windows for ventilation. Rules vary by location, with different local governments enforcing different measures. \c\cIn June 2020, an outbreak with 45 people testing positive at Xinfadi Market in Beijing caused some alarm. Authorities closed the market and nearby schools; eleven neighborhoods in the Fengtai District started requiring temperature checks and were closed to visitors. By this time, public health technology included special leaf blower backpacks designed to vent hot air onto outdoor surfaces. By the evening of 23 June, Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan declared that the situation has been basically brought under control while China's traffic authorities vowed to strictly guard traffic out of Beijing: those with abnormal health QR codes or without recently-taken negative nucleic acid test proof will not be allowed to take public transportation or drive out of the capital; and started a new regulation to that effect, while 13 new cases were detected on that morning.[citation needed]\c\cOn 26 July, China saw its highest number of daily cases since March, mostly from outbreaks in Xinjiang and Liaoning. with 61 new cases, up from 46 cases a day earlier, This increased to 127 daily COVID cases on July 30. The daily reported cases subsequently went down, to 16 on August 23. \c\cOn October 11, officials in Qingdao urged to carry out contact tracing and mass testing after 12 new cases were found connected to the Qingdao Chest Hospital. On October 12, it was announced that Qingdao would test all 9 million of its residents. \c\cIn October, 137 asymptomatic cases were detected in Kashgar, Xinjiang and were linked to a garment factory. \c\cOn December 18, a local case was reported in Beijing. It was the first local infection in 152 days in Beijing. As of 27 December, thirteen more cases have been detected. \c\cAnother outbreak linked to a traveler from South Korea was reported in Liaoning late December. On January 7, 2021, Dalian authorities reported 51 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 31 asymptomatic carriers. \c\cOn January 6, 2021, after reporting 63 new cases in the northern province of Hebei, of which 20 were infections and 43 asymptomatic cases locally transmitted, the local Government decided to lockdown the provincial capital city of Shijiazhuang, as most of the cases were detected there. On January 9, the cities of Shijiazhuang and Xingtai with total population of 19 million, were placed under lockdown measures, with passenger trains suspended, as well as flights and coach service to Beijing at 300 km distance in north east direction. \c\cOn January 14, Wangkui County of Suihua City, Heilongjiang Province moved into lockdown after reporting 40 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The virus sample taken from the cases in Suihua is reported to be similar to the strain identified in Dalian. \c\cAlso on January 14, China reported the first death from the virus after eight months, a patient from Hebei. A team of experts from the WHO visited Wuhan to conduct investigations into the origin of the pandemic. They were also supposed to quarantine for two weeks prior to starting their inquiry. On January 15, the city of Langfang of Hebei was put into lockdown. \c\cBy January 18, 11 regions in China were under de facto lockdown, including five districts in Heilongjiang and the cities of Gongzhuling and Tonghua in Jilin province.

This followed a previous outbreak in Ruili in September 2020. Unauthorized border crossings from Myanmar remain a concern, and the local government has started vaccinating Ruili residents to work towards herd immunity. \c\cOn May 30, authorities shut down Liwen district in Guangzhou and Yantian port in Shenzhen due to an outbreak in Guangdong province. Foshan's Shadi Airport has cancelled all flights and suspended operations from June 12. \c\cOn June 6, Ruili was again put into lockdown after three local infections associated with the Delta variant. \c\cIt was reported on 10 July 2021 that the new outbreak has spread to 13 cities in five provinces including the capital Beijing. The cases were linked to cleaners who worked on a flight from Russia that arrived in Nanjing on 10 July 2021 who did not follow strict hygiene measures. Officials added that the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus was behind these new infections and there are worries about whether the Chinese vaccines would work against the Delta variant. \c\cOn July 21, another local cluster was identified in Nanjing after 17 airport workers have tested positive during a routine check up. By August 2, the outbreak, caused by fast-spreading Delta variant, has reached more than 20 cities. Zhuzhou, Zhangjiajie and Yangzhou were forced into lockdowns.   Some flights, trains and buses to Beijing have been cancelled to guard the capital against the new surge. \c\cOn September 11, another cluster of infections was found in Xianyou county of Putian, Fujian province.

In response, on November 8 local authorities ordered all businesses handling imported chilled and frozen foods to suspend operations. \c\cIn mid-December 2021, the outbreak in the cities of Ningbo, Shaoxing and Hangzhou was developing at a "relatively rapid" speed, forcing closure of flights and venues.  The outbreak began to subside from mid December, with Hangzhou resuming low-risk status as of 21 December. \c\cChina's scientists have been praised for rapidly sharing information on the virus to the international community, and leading some of the world's research on the disease.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on 21 January that the Chinese authorities would share information of the epidemic "with the WHO, relevant nations and China's Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions in a timely manner including the genome sequence of the new coronavirus." During the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn praised China for its improved transparency since 2003. US officials and WHO also praised China for sharing data about the epidemic and keeping transparent. The US experts had been invited by China's NHC.  On 23 January, the WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom and the WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, Takeshi Kasai, arrived in Beijing to discuss the new coronavirus outbreak with the Chinese authorities and health experts. China agreed on 28 January that the WHO would send international experts to China. \c\cJohn Mackenzie, a member of the World Health Organization's emergency committee criticized China for being too slow to share all of the infected cases, especially during major political meetings in Wuhan after Tedros Adhanom praised China for helping "prevent the spread of coronavirus to the other countries." US President Donald Trump said that China was "very secretive and that's unfortunate" regarding the information on the pandemic. Yanzhong Huang, a health expert at Seton Hall University, said that China could have been more forceful and "when there was a cover-up and there was inaction". \c\cA number of other countries\' governments have called for an international examination of the virus's origin and spread. \c\cAfter an initial block, the Chinese government granted permission for a WHO team to visit China and investigate COVID-19's origins. In January 2021, Tedros Adhanom expressed his dismay as China blocked the team's entry. The Chinese government had previously agreed to allow the team's entry. A few days later, permission was granted for the team to arrive. A WHO-affiliated health expert said expectations that the team would reach a conclusion from their trip should be "very low". \c\cMultiple countries evacuated or are trying to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan including South Korea, Japan, the US, the UK, Kazakhstan, Germany, Spain, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, France, Switzerland and Thailand. Korean media Channel A said that China asked the evacuation flights to arrive in the evening and leave Wuhan in the next morning so the evacuation would not be seen by the public. According to BBC, any Chinese national, even with a UK citizenship is not allowed to be evacuated by the UK. \c\cAfter initially refusing to allow Taiwanese citizens to evacuate due to the One-China policy, the Chinese government eventually allowed Taiwan to evacuate its nationals from Wuhan with the assistance of the local Taiwan Affairs Office. There were around 500 Taiwanese trapped in Wuhan. The first flight to help them leave left Wuhan on 3 February. All of them would be quarantined for two weeks after they enter Taiwan. \c\cThe evacuation halted after the first flight was found to carry an infected case. The Taiwanese government said that the person was not in the evacuation list and the most vulnerable were not included in the first flight. It also said that it was not prepared to take these people with a high risk of viral infections home. Tsai Ing-wen criticized China's attempt to rule Taiwan out in WHO and said, "The information obtained by the WHO was obviously inaccurate ... and could cause the WHO to make mistakes in dealing with the global epidemic." Premier Su Tseng-chang called for a government-to-government negotiation for the following arrangement of chapter flights despite the fact that the cross-strait communication mechanism between governments had been suspended since 2016 when Tsai was elected president. \c\cThe State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office urged the Taiwanese government to stop impeding the evacuation. The office said that before the flight, all of the passengers signed a personal declaration claiming that they have no contact with any confirmed or suspected cases and promising to comply with quarantine measures after returning to the island. All of the passengers are checked for their temperature three times before the flight and showed no abnormality. The office said critically that the Taiwanese government first expressed appreciation before the flight, but changed its attitude after the flight. Wuhan's Taiwan Affairs Office asked Taiwan for more details about the infected case as the basic descriptions of the patient including age and gender were not given as previously 17 cases in Taiwan. The office also said that the patient's close relatives were not at all informed of the viral infection. \c\cThe State Administration of Immigration promised that the border inspection agencies at all ports of entry and exit in China would continue to provide necessary facilities and services for Chinese citizens returning home. On 25 January, the General Administration of Customs reactivated the health declaration system where people entering or exiting mainland China are asked to write a health declaration. Border control staff shall also cooperate in health and quarantine work such as body temperature monitoring, medical inspection, and medical check-up. On 31 January, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was arranging charter flights to take the Chinese citizens from Hubei and Wuhan back to Wuhan 124, given the practical difficulties that they faced overseas. \c\cHubei suspended the processing of applications from mainland Chinese residents for entry and exit of mainland China. For those with a valid visa to enter Hong Kong and Macao, but fail to enter the areas due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese Immigration Administration will issue a new visa for free on request of the visa holder after the outbreak is lifted. Some of automated border clearance systems will be shut down according to the needs of the epidemic prevention. After Wuhan declared lockdown on 23 January, the Tianhe Airport and Hankou River ports have been without passengers for several days. \c\cSince 25 January, Taiwan's government banned anyone from mainland China entering the country with the ban extended to mainland Chinese overseas. Although the global health officials advised not to apply travel restrictions on China, the US and Australia restricted all Chinese citizens from China from entering their borders. Travel restrictions were announced by Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Italy and other countries despite China's criticism of border control. \c\cSince 28 January, the Hong Kong government began to cut traffic down connecting mainland China. On the same day, China's National Immigration Administration announced that with immediate effect, the application of mainland residents\' visa to Hong Kong and Macau would be suspended. On 3 February, Hong Kong closed most of its border to mainland China. However, Hong Kong nurses still held a strike, demanding a complete closure. \c\cChina received funds and equipment in donations from a number of other countries to help fight the pandemic. The United Front Work Department (UFWD) also coordinated diplomatic channels, state-owned businesses and Chinese diaspora community associations in urging overseas Chinese to buy masks and send them to China. Jorge Guajardo, Mexico's former ambassador to China, suggested that "China was evidently hiding the extent of a pandemic...while covertly securing PPE at low prices", according to Global News. Guajardo called it a "surreptitious" operation that left "the world naked with no supply of PPE."\c\cChina has also sent tests, equipment, experts, and vaccines to other countries to help fight the pandemic. European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič expressed gratitude and praised collaboration between the EU and China. Chinese aid has also been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. Chinese-Americans also marshalled networks in China to obtain medical supplies. \c\cOn 13 March, China sent medical supplies, including masks and respirators to Italy, together with a team of Chinese medical staff. While the head of the Italian Red Cross, Francesco Rocca said these medical supplies were donated by the Chinese Red Cross, there were other sources that said that these were paid products and services. Chinese billionaire and Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma also donated 500,000 masks and other medical supplies, which landed at Liege Airport in Belgium on 13 March and then sent to Italy. Italian Prime Minister Conte thanked China for its support and assistance.  A former Mexican ambassador Jorge Guajardo said that masks sent to China in January and February were being sold back to Mexico at 20 to 30 times the price. \c\cA U.S. congressional report released in April concluded that "the Chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery, with designated countries selected, according to political calculations."\c\cOn 18 May 2020, the Chinese government pledged US$2 billion to help other countries fight COVID-19 and to aid economic and social development "especially [in] developing countries". \c\cChina has also provided vaccines to other countries. In November 2021, the Chinese government pledged to provide 1 billion vaccine doses to African countries, including 600 million donated doses and 400 million other doses, in addition to the 200 million doses it had already provided. In the same announcement, Xi pledged additional investment in Africa and promised to send 1,500 public health experts. \c\cFrom March through December 2020, China exported pandemic control equipment worth ¥438.5 billion (US$67.82 billion), including 224.1 billion masks, 2.31 billion other pieces of PPE clothing, 1.08 billion test kits, and 271,000 ventilators. A customs spokesperson said the mask exports were equivalent to "nearly 40 masks for everyone in the world outside China". \c\cOfficials in Spain, Turkey, and the Netherlands have rejected Chinese-made equipment for being defective. The Dutch Ministry of Health announced it had recalled 600,000 face masks which were made in China. The Spanish government said they bought thousands of test kits to combat the virus, but later revealed that almost 60,000 did not produce accurate results. The Chinese embassy in Spain said that the company that made the kits was unlicensed, and that these kits were separate from the ones donated by the Chinese government. The government of the United Kingdom paid two companies in China at least $20 million for test kits later found to be faulty. \c\cFear, regional discrimination in China, and racial discrimination within and beyond China increased with the growing number of reported cases of infections despite calls for stopping the discrimination by many governments. Some rumors circulated across Chinese social media, along with endorsements and counter-rumor efforts by media and governments. The Chinese government has worked to censor and counter reporting and criticism about the crisis – which included the prosecution of several citizen journalists – and portray the official response to the outbreak in a positive light. They have also provided humanitarian assistance to other countries dealing with the virus. News outlets have reported concerns that the Chinese government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths. \c\cAlthough there has been support from Chinese online towards those in virus-stricken areas, instances of regional discrimination have also arisen. According to World Journal, there have been instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels, having their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying "people from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not welcomed here." Numerous hotels, and guest houses refused entry to residents of Wuhan or kicked out residents of Hubei. Multiple hotels purportedly refused a Wuhan tour guide to check in after she returned to Hangzhou from Singapore with one of them calling the police to give her a health check and asking the police to quarantine her. Amidst these incidents, various cities and prefectures outside of Hubei adopted resettlement measures for Hubei people in their region such as designated hotel accommodation for visitors from the province. In Zhengding, Jingxing and Luquan of Shijiazhuang City, the local governments rewarded anyone who reported those who had been to Wuhan, but not recorded in official documents at least 1,000 yuan RMB. In Meizhou, residents reporting people entering from Hunan were awarded with 30 face masks. \c\cIt was reported that on a scheduled 27 January China Southern Airlines flight from Nagoya to Shanghai, some Shanghainese travellers refused to board with 16 others from Wuhan. Two of the Wuhan travellers were unable to board due to a fever while the Shanghainese on the spot alleged that the others had taken medicine to bypass the temperature check. One of the Wuhan tourists protested on Weibo, "are they really my countrymen?", to which a Shanghai tourist who was purportedly at the scene replied that they did it to protect Shanghai from the virus. Many netizens criticized the Wuhan tourists for travelling with a fever, although some also called for understanding and for Shanghainese not to regionally discriminate. \c\cMainland Chinese overseas have experienced discrimination and anti-Chinese sentiment during the COVID-19 outbreak. In Hong Kong, a Japanese noodle restaurant said it would refuse mainland Chinese customers and said on Facebook, "We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us." In Japan, a sweet shop in Hakone and a ramen restaurant in Sapporo posted "no Chinese" signs outside. Similar events were reported in South Korea. The French newspaper Courrier Picard published two articles titled "Yellow Alert" and "New Yellow Peril?" which may allude to historical racist tropes about the Chinese. \c\cBeyond only Chinese, Asians in general are affected by anti-Chinese sentiment. Disinformation about Asian food and Asian communities have circulated, and videos showing Asian people eating bats have gone viral along with dehumanizing comments and implications of the cause of the virus outbreak. \c\cGuangzhou has a sizeable community of black Africans including migrants, who were allegedly singled out by local authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Chinese state media, five Nigerian men who had tested positive for COVID-19 broke quarantine and infected others, which triggered suspicion and anti-foreigner sentiment. In April 2020, Africans were forced to undergo coronavirus testing and quarantine, regardless of their travel history, symptoms, or contact with known patients. Some restaurants – including a branch of McDonald's – reportedly refused to service Africans, while landlords and hotels targeted Africans for eviction resulting in some becoming homeless. Xinhua reported 111 Africans tested positive for the COVID-19 in Guangzhou out of a total of 4,553 tested, also saying that 19 of the cases were imported from unspecified countries. \c\cIt has been noted that public sensitivity in China to racism, particularly to Africans, has been low with little education against racism or use of political correctness, while government censors appear to tolerate racism online. In the preceding few years, many Chinese believed that foreigners have been given extra benefits, leading to concerns about unfairness and inequality. Many Chinese internet users soon posted racist comments, including calls for all Africans to be deported, while a cartoon depicting foreigners as different types of trash to be sorted through went viral on social media. \c\cLocal media in African countries were the first to report on the issue, while Beijing initially attempted to deny such reports, calling them “rumors” or “misunderstandings” while framing it as a “wedge driving attempt” by Western media. As further incidents of Africans being targeted were shared on social media, the United States Consulate General in Guangzhou warned African Americans to avoid travel to Guangzhou. The governments of Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda, in addition to the African Union, placed diplomatic pressure on Beijing over the incidents, and a group of African ambassadors in Beijing wrote a letter of complaint to the Chinese government about the stigmatisation and discrimination being faced by Africans. The Nigerian Speaker of the House Femi Gbajabiamila showed one of the social media videos to the Chinese ambassador while the Ghanaian Minister for Foreign Affairs Shirley Ayorkor Botchway described the incidents as inhumane treatment. A U.S. State Department spokesman said, "The abuse and mistreatment of Africans living and working in China is a sad reminder of how hollow the PRC-Africa partnership really is". \c\cIn response to the diplomatic pressure and media coverage, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an official statement on 12 April 2020, saying that the Chinese government attached great importance to the life and health of foreign nationals in China, has zero tolerance for discrimination, and treats all foreigners equally. In a regular press conference on the following day, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian added that a series of new measures were adopted in Guangzhou to address the concerns of some African citizens and avoid racist and discrimination problems, while saying the United States was "making unwarranted allegations in an attempt to sow discords and stoke troubles". China's state media later described the incidents as "small rifts", while officials made PR visits to quarantined Africans with flowers and food accompanied by television cameras, and Chinese envoys have continued to reassure their African counterparts that they would correct the misunderstandings and establish an effective communication mechanism with African Consulates-General in Guangzhou. Chinese officials expressed remorse to African politicians but did not explicitly apologize, suggesting that it was largely due to “poor communication”. \c\cThere were conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being the CIA's creation to keep China down on China's Internet, according to London-based The Economist. \c\cMultiple conspiracy articles in Chinese from the SARS era resurfaced during the outbreak with altered details, claiming that SARS is biological warfare conducted by the US against China. Some of these articles claim that BGI Group from China sold genetic information of the Chinese people to the US, with the US then being able to deploy the virus specifically targeting the genome of Chinese individuals. \c\cIn late January 2020, Chinese military news site Xilu published an article claiming that the virus had been artificially combined by the US to target Chinese people from the Han ethnicity, to which the large majority of Chinese belongs. The article claimed that the poor performance of US military athletes participating in the Wuhan 2019 Military World Games, which lasted until the end of October 2019, was evidence that they had in fact been "biowarfare operatives" tasked with spreading the virus. The claim was later repeated on other popular sites in China. \c\cIn March 2020, this conspiracy theory was endorsed on Twitter by Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China. On 13 March, the US government summoned Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai to Washington DC over this conspiracy theory; Cui had called this theory "crazy" on Face the Nation on 9 February, and re-affirmed this belief after Zhao's tweets. \c\cIn the United States, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others also pushed conspiracy theories repeatedly asserting that the virus had originated from a laboratory leak in Wuhan, despite widespread rejection from the scientific community and by allied intelligence.
On February 23, 2020, Ahmaud Marquez Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was murdered in Satilla Shores, a neighborhood near Brunswick in Glynn County, Georgia, United States. Three White residents of the neighborhood—Gregory McMichael, his son Travis McMichael, and William "Roddie" Bryan—were convicted of the murder on November 24, 2021, and sentenced to life in prison on January 7 of the following year. \c\cThe McMichaels and Bryan chased down Arbery while he was jogging in the neighborhood, trapping him between their pickup trucks before fatally shooting him with a shotgun. Police interview transcripts indicate that Gregory began the chase after seeing Arbery running past his house, suspecting that Arbery had committed burglary or theft in Satilla Shores; no evidence has emerged of Arbery doing so. Gregory and Travis McMichael pursued Arbery in a pickup truck. According to police testimony, Bryan told police that he saw the chase and joined in independently, but was not sure if Arbery had done anything wrong. After Travis exited his truck with a shotgun, Travis and Arbery engaged in a physical confrontation, during which Travis shot Arbery. Bryan recorded the pursuit and shooting on his cell phone. \c\cArbery had entered an under-construction house with no doors five times in five months, including once shortly before the shooting. Security camera video from inside the house showed no evidence of theft. \c\cThe Glynn County Police Department (GCPD) said the Brunswick District Attorney's Office advised them on February 23 to make no arrests, but the Attorney's Office denied that its top officeholders gave such advice. Waycross District Attorney George Barnhill twice advised the GCPD to make no arrests, once on February 24, before he was assigned to the case on February 27, and a second time on April 2 while announcing his intention to recuse himself from the case due to connections between his son and Gregory McMichael. Barnhill requested recusal on April 7, and the case was sent to the Atlantic District Attorney's Office on April 13. At the behest of Gregory McMichael, a local attorney provided a copy of the video of the shooting to local radio station WGIG, who posted it to their website on May 5. The video went viral, having also been posted on YouTube and Twitter. Within hours, Atlantic District Attorney Tom Durden said a grand jury would decide whether charges would be brought, and accepted an offer from Governor Brian Kemp to have the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) investigate the case. \c\cThe GBI arrested the McMichaels on May 7 and Bryan on May 21, charging them with felony murder and other crimes. Meanwhile, the case was ultimately transferred to the Cobb County District Attorney's Office. Additional evidence was presented by the prosecutor to support the murder charges, including a statement to the GBI by Bryan that Travis said "fucking nigger" as Arbery lay dying. On June 24, 2020, a grand jury indicted each of the three men on charges of malice murder, felony murder, and other crimes. The three men later went on trial in November 2021 in the Glynn County Superior Court, where they were convicted on November 24, 2021. On the charge of malice murder, the jury only convicted Travis McMichael. For the other charges, the jury convicted all three men of felony murder, aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. All three convicted now face a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, with the judge expected to decide on the possibility of parole on January 7, 2022. \c\cThe local authorities\' handling of the case, whereby the McMichaels were not arrested until 74 days after the murder, after the video went viral, sparked nation-wide criticism and debates on racial profiling in the United States. Numerous religious leaders, politicians, athletes, and other celebrities condemned the incident. Georgia Attorney General Christopher M. Carr formally requested the intervention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the case on May 10, 2020, which was granted the following day. In April 2021, a federal grand jury indicted the three men, charging all with a hate crime and attempted kidnapping, while the McMichaels were also charged with using firearms during a crime of violence.  Separately, former Brunswick District Attorney Jackie Johnson was indicted in September 2021 for "showing favor and affection" to Gregory (her former subordinate) during the investigation, and for obstructing law enforcement by directing that Travis not be arrested. In the aftermath of the murder, Georgia enacted hate crimes legislation in June 2020, then repealed and replaced its citizen's arrest law in May 2021. \c\cAhmaud Marquez Arbery, nicknamed "Maud" or "Quez", was a 25-year-old lifelong resident of Brunswick, Georgia. He graduated from Brunswick High School in 2012, where he was a football star. As a linebacker, he was known for his speed and agility. Among his teachers and friends, he was known for his sense of humor and big heart. He frequently ran for exercise, including regularly in the neighborhood of Satilla Shores. He attended South Georgia Technical College during fall 2012 and spring 2013 to train for a career as an electrician. He paused his studies to save money by working in his father's car wash and landscaping business, and had plans to re-enroll. At the time of his murder, he was near the end of a probation period due to carrying a gun to a high school football game in 2013 and attempted shoplifting in 2017. \c\cGregory McMichael, then 64, previously worked as a GCPD officer from 1982 to 1989, and as an investigator for the Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney's Office from 1995 to his retirement in May 2019. In 2018, McMichael had helped an investigation in the DA's office about Arbery's shoplifting charge, which led to a subsequent revocation and extension of Arbery's probation. It is unknown whether McMichael remembered this when he encountered Arbery on the day of the shooting; there was no mention of McMichael's previous affiliation with Arbery in the Glynn County Police report on that day. The prosecution later said Arbery's charges had nothing to do with his murder. \c\cTravis McMichael, then 34, Gregory McMichael's son, former U.S. Coast Guard mechanic between 2007 and 2016, with some training in law enforcement. \c\cWilliam "Roddie" Bryan, then 50, was a neighbor of the McMichaels. \c\cA video of the incident was recorded by Bryan using his cellphone from his vehicle as he followed Arbery jogging down the neighborhood road. The video showed Arbery jogging on the left side of the road when he encountered a white pickup truck that had stopped in the right lane. Gregory McMichael is standing in the truck bed, while Travis McMichael initially stands beside the driver's door with a shotgun. Bryan's vehicle comes to a stop behind Arbery and the pickup truck. \c\cAs Arbery approaches the pickup truck, shouting can be heard. Arbery then crosses from the left side of the road to the right side and runs around the passenger's side of the truck. After passing the truck's front, Arbery turns left. Meanwhile, Travis McMichael, holding his shotgun, approaches Arbery at the truck's front. The camera's view of the confrontation between Arbery and Travis is momentarily blocked. \c\cSeveral media accounts of the video report that the audio of the first gunshot seems to be heard before Arbery and Travis struggle with each other. Some media accounts first report a struggle, and then mention the gunshot(s). Other media accounts describe that it was "not possible" to see from the video what was happening when the first gunshot was fired, or report that the truck "blocks the view of how the men first engage each other" with regard to when the gunshot is heard. \c\cTravis and Arbery are seen to grapple over the shotgun. While struggling, both men disappear off camera view on the left side of the frame, after which the audio of a second gunshot is heard. When they reappear, Arbery throws punches and tries to grab the shotgun. A third gunshot is heard being fired by Travis at point-blank range as Arbery appears to throw a right-handed punch at his head. Arbery recoils, stumbles, and collapses face down in the middle of the road while Travis walks away. Gregory McMichael, who has taken out a handgun but has not fired, runs towards his son and Arbery. \c\cIn December 2019 and January 2020, residents of Satilla Shores reported three break-ins or thefts. On December 8, 2019, a Satilla Shores resident reported rifles stolen from the resident's unlocked car. Police recorded a theft on December 28, 2019. On January 1, 2020, Travis McMichael filed a report of a firearm stolen from his unlocked truck. \c\cOn February 11, 2020, Travis called 9-1-1 to report a slender six-foot-tall (1.83 m) Black man with short hair, wearing red shorts and a white shirt, who was trespassing on the site of a house under construction. Travis said, "I\'ve never seen this guy before in the neighborhood." The dispatcher asked whether Travis was OK, and he said, "Yeah, it just startled me. When I turned around and saw him and backed up, he reached into his pocket and ran into the house. So I don\'t know if he's armed or not. But he looked like he was acting like he was." "We\'ve been having a lot of burglaries and break-ins around here lately", Travis said on the call. He told the dispatcher that he was out in his truck, and that as many as four neighbors were out looking for the man. His father Gregory was one of the people out searching that night, and Gregory and at least one other neighbor were armed. Police responded and searched the house along with a neighbor, but found no one. However, surveillance video from that evening showed a man who reportedly looked like Arbery, briefly walking in and out of the house under construction. He did not take anything. The under-construction house did not have doors or windows. \c\cNo evidence has emerged of Arbery committing burglaries or thefts in Satilla Shores. \c\cOn February 23, in the minutes before the shooting, a security camera installed on a residence across the street from the house under construction, recorded a man identified by his family as Arbery walking down the road and into the house.  A second security camera installed within the house recorded a man, identified as Arbery by his family, looking at the interior of the house. Approximately five minutes later, he left and began jogging down the street. After the man left the house, the first camera on the residence across the street showed a white pickup heading in the man's direction, followed a few minutes later by two police cars. \c\cTwo calls to the Glynn-Brunswick 911 dispatcher were made just before the shooting. In the first, a then-unidentified male caller said another man was in a house that was "under construction". The 9-1-1 dispatcher asked if the man was "breaking into it right now?" The caller replied: "No ... it's all open." After the caller said the man was now "running down the street", the dispatcher said police would respond. The dispatcher asked at 1:08 p.m., "I just need to know what he was doing wrong. Was he just on the premises and not supposed to be?" The caller responded, with some parts garbled, saying: "And he's been caught on camera a bunch at night. It's kind of an ongoing thing." The caller identified the man as a "Black guy, white T-shirt". The first caller was later identified in court as neighbor Matthew Albenze. \c\cIn the second call, beginning at 1:14 p.m., a male caller said: "I\'m out here at Satilla Shores ...There's a Black male running down the street." The 9-1-1 dispatcher asked, "Where at Satilla Shores?" The caller replied: "I don\'t know what street we\'re on." The caller shouted, "Stop! ... Watch that. Stop, damn it! Stop!" The dispatcher tried to speak to the caller but did not receive a reply for several minutes. The caller later hung up. The second caller was later identified in court as Gregory McMichael. \c\cThe GCPD reached the scene immediately after the fatal shooting. The responding officer's report relied almost entirely on an interview with Gregory McMichael, who was described as a witness. \c\cGregory said he was in his yard when he saw an unidentified man running by. He said he recognized the man from a prior incident "the other night", when he said he saw the man reach into his pants as if for a weapon. He called to his son Travis and said, "The guy is running down the street; let's go". Gregory brought a .357 Magnum revolver, while Travis brought a shotgun in their pickup truck. The McMichaels said they pursued the man because he resembled a suspect in a string of local burglaries. But the police said there had been only one recent theft from an unlocked car in the neighborhood. \c\cTravis attempted to cut off the man with his truck. The man turned and began "running back in the direction from which he came". The report states a third person, who was identified as "Roddy [sic]", also tried to cut off the man, but failed. Gregory said he saw the unidentified man and yelled: "Stop, stop, we want to talk to you", and that they pulled up to the man, with Travis exiting the truck with the shotgun in hand. Gregory claimed the man "began to violently attack Travis" before two shots were fired. The man died at the scene after "bleeding out", the report concluded. Authorities later identified the man as Arbery. \c\cThe autopsy report released by the GBI ruled Arbery's death was a homicide and that it was caused by three gunshot wounds he sustained "during a struggle for the shotgun" that fired those shots.  One gunshot wounded the upper left chest, one gunshot wounded the lower middle chest, and one gunshot caused a "deep, gaping" graze wound to the right wrist. There were no alcohol or drugs in Arbery's body, other than a "tiny amount" of THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis. \c\cThe case started under the jurisdiction of Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Jackie Johnson. Because Gregory McMichael had previously worked as an investigator in her office, she recused herself from further involvement in the case.  On February 27, 2020, the case was transferred by the Georgia Attorney General's Office to the Waycross Judicial Circuit District Attorney's office. The Waycross Judicial Circuit is south of Brunswick Judicial Circuit. \c\cOn March 8, two Glynn County commissioners, citing discussions with Glynn County police, accused Johnson, or her office, of preventing the McMichaels\' immediate arrest. Commissioner Allen Booker said: "The police at the scene went to her, saying they were ready to arrest both of them. These were the police at the scene who had done the investigation. She shut them down to protect her friend [Gregory] McMichael." Commissioner Peter Murphy said that officers who responded at the scene had concluded that there was probable cause to make an arrest, but when they contacted Johnson's office, they "were told not to make the arrest."\c\cJohnson's office said that Johnson did not "have any conversation with any GCPD officer about this case" on February 23, and that "no Assistant District Attorney in the office directed any Glynn County police officer not to make an arrest". Johnson's office also blamed the GCPD for being "unable to make a probable cause determination on its own" and argued that it was the local police's responsibility, not the District Attorney's responsibility, to make arrests. It is common for police to consult with the district attorney's office in the aftermath of homicides or other complex cases. \c\cOn May 9, the GCPD said that on February 23 the Brunswick District Attorney's Office "became involved in the investigation ... The McMichaels were deemed not to be flight risks and officers were advised by the [Brunswick District Attorney's Office] that no arrests were necessary at the time."\c\cThe GCPD said that on February 24, Waycross Judicial Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill told them that the murder of Arbery "was justifiable homicide." According to a memorandum written by Barnhill to the GCPD on April 2, Barnhill gave the GCPD "an initial opinion the day after the shooting" on February 24. In the April 2 memorandum, Barnhill wrote: "The autopsy supports the initial opinion we gave you on February 24, at the briefing room in the Glynn County Police Department after reviewing the evidence you had at that time. We do not see grounds for an arrest of any of the three parties." But, according to the Office of the Georgia Attorney General on May 10, Barnhill had not yet been appointed to handle Arbery's case on February 24, and he had not put in a request to handle the case. \c\cThe Georgia Attorney General's Office on May 10 identified the following events as having happened on February 27: the Georgia Attorney General's Office received the request from Johnson's office to transfer Arbery's case to another prosecutor. On the same day, the Georgia Attorney General's Office appointed Barnhill as the presiding prosecutor. Neither Johnson nor Barnhill informed the Georgia Attorney General's Office that Barnhill had already actively participated in the case by reviewing evidence and giving his opinion on whether arrests should occur. \c\cOn April 1, Arbery's autopsy report was given to Barnhill. On April 2, Barnhill wrote a memorandum to Glynn County police, recommending that no arrests be made. Barnhill wrote that the McMichaels were within their rights to chase "a burglary suspect, with solid firsthand probable cause"; that "Arbery initiated the fight"; and that Travis McMichael "was allowed to use deadly force to protect himself" when "Arbery grabbed the shotgun". \c\cBarnhill cited Georgia's citizen arrest law, dating to the Civil War era, as justifying the murder of Arbery (the Georgia law says that either a crime must be committed within the citizen's "immediate knowledge", or there must be "reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion" for a felony crime).  Barnhill alleged that videos of Arbery entering the home under construction on the day of the shooting showed Arbery "burglarizing a home immediately preceding the chase and confrontation."\c\cThe attorneys representing the Arbery family responded: "This video is consistent with the evidence already known to us. Ahmaud Arbery was out for a jog. He stopped by a property under construction where he engaged in no illegal activity and remained for only a brief period. Ahmaud did not take anything from the construction site. He did not cause any damage to the property. He remained for a brief period of time and was not instructed by anyone to leave but rather left on his own accord to continue his jog. Ahmaud's actions at this empty home under construction were in no way a felony under Georgia law. This video confirms Mr. Arbery's murder was not justified, meaning the actions of the men who pursued him and ambushed him were unjustified."\c\cThe owner of the unfinished home, who was 90 miles (140 kilometers) away at the time of the shooting, later said, "I\'ve never had a police report [on my property], or anything stolen from my property, or any kind of robbery." Barnhill wrote that "Arbery's mental health and prior convictions help explain his apparent aggressive nature and his possible thought pattern to attack an armed man." Lastly, Barnhill informed the Glynn County police that he was going to recuse from the case due to connections between his son and Gregory McMichael. \c\cOn April 7, Barnhill wrote to Georgia's Attorney General, Christopher M. Carr, saying Arbery's "family are not strangers to the local criminal justice system", noting that Arbery's brother and cousins had encounters with the law. Barnhill told Carr that there was "video of Arbery burglarizing a home immediately preceding the chase and confrontation". \c\cThe Georgia Attorney General's Office on May 10 said the following events happened on April 7: it received a request from Barnhill's office to transfer Arbery's case to another prosecutor, and Barnhill revealed that he had learned "about 3–4 weeks ago" that Arbery had previously been prosecuted by his son, a prosecutor for the Brunswick Circuit District Attorney's Office, in an earlier case. He also said that one of the defendants had served as an investigator on the same prosecution (this is a reference to Gregory McMichael, who was employed by the Brunswick D.A.'s Office). The request did not explain why Barnhill had delayed in recusing his office from the case, did not mention that Barnhill had advised Glynn County police on April 2 to make no arrests, and omitted Barnhill's involvement on February 24, instead recounting only his involvement "upon taking the case". \c\cOn April 13, after Barnhill's recusal, the Georgia Attorney General's Office appointed Atlantic Judicial Circuit District Attorney Tom Durden to take over the handling of the case. The Atlantic Judicial Circuit is the immediately adjacent circuit to the north of Brunswick Judicial Circuit. \c\cA video of the shooting was uploaded on May 5 on the website of local radio station, WGIG; it was received from Gregory McMichael. After two hours, WGIG removed the video for being too graphic. \c\cThe video was uploaded to YouTube that day. The Arbery family's attorney posted a 28-second segment of the video on Twitter. The video of the shooting went viral. Glynn County police requested the Georgia Bureau of Investigation look into how the video was publicized. The Guardian published an edited version of the video on May 6. TMZ published a longer version of the video on May 5. \c\cOn May 7, Alan David Tucker, a local criminal defense attorney, said that he had sent the cell phone video to WGIG, and that it had been recorded by William "Roddie" Bryan, who was in the second truck following Arbery. WGIG confirmed that Tucker had provided the video to the radio station. Tucker had informally consulted with the suspects in the case, but said he had not been retained to represent anyone involved. Tucker said that he released the video to provide "absolute transparency" due to "erroneous accusations and assumptions", and that "my purpose was not to exonerate them or convict them."\c\cWithin hours of the video becoming public, Tom Durden, the district attorney for Georgia's Atlantic Judicial Circuit, said that he would present the case to "the next available grand jury in Glynn County" to decide if charges should be filed. The convening of grand juries had been postponed until after June 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Durden accepted Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's offer to bring in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) to investigate. \c\cThe GBI found probable cause to charge Gregory and Travis McMichael within 36 hours of taking over jurisdiction of the case, and, on May 7, arrested and charged them with felony murder. The McMichaels were booked into the Glynn County Jail. At an appearance before a judge the following day, the McMichaels were both denied bond. \c\cGiven the "size and magnitude" of the investigation, Durden requested that the case be reassigned to another prosecutor with a larger staff. Pursuant to Durden's request, the Georgia Attorney General's office reassigned the case on May 11 to the Cobb County District Attorney's Office, led by Joyette M. Holmes. She was the fourth D.A. to take on the case. Arbery's family welcomed the transfer of the case from a southeast Georgia district attorney to one in the metro Atlanta area 300 miles (480 km) away. \c\cThe Cobb County District Attorney's Office, led by Joyette M. Holmes, brought charges against the defendants. On May 21, 2020, William "Roddie" Bryan was charged with felony murder and attempt to commit false imprisonment. According to the arrest warrant, Bryan tried "to confine and detain" Arbery without legal authority by "utilizing his vehicle on multiple occasions" before Arbery was shot. The GBI said their investigators found "a number of pieces of video" that linked Bryan to the case. Bryan was alleged to have attempted to block Arbery, which was unsuccessful, and struck Arbery with his pickup truck while chasing him. Arbery's palm print was found on the rear door of Bryan's truck, cotton fibers near the truck bed were attributed to contact with Mr. Arbery, and a dent was found below the location of the cotton fibers. \c\cAt the June 4, 2020 preliminary hearing, a Glynn County Magistrate Court judge ruled that there was probable cause for the murder charges against all three men. The prosecution presented additional evidence to the court to support the murder charges, including hours of testimony from the lead GBI investigator. At the hearing, the prosecutor said that the three men "chased, hunted down and ultimately executed" Arbery. The investigator testified that none of the three had called 9-1-1 prior to the chase; he said:\c\cThe prosecution also introduced a statement to the GBI by William Bryan that Travis McMichael used a racist slur, "fucking nigger",  while standing over Arbery's body, and testimony that Travis McMichael had previously used the same slur on previous occasions in social media postings and in text messages. During the Glynn County trial, the allegation of Travis stating "fucking nigger" was not brought forth to the jury since the only witness, William Bryan, chose not to testify during the trial; meanwhile, by the time legal arguments had concluded, the judge did not make a ruling on whether the social media posts and text messages could be used, so they were not introduced either. \c\cThe alleged use of these racist slurs could affect a federal hate crime trial in 2022. Although there may be some overlap in witnesses between the two cases, the federal trial is independent of the state trial and not affected by the state trial's outcome. Other evidence eventually not shown in the state trial by prosecutors, which can be considered in the federal trial, includes imagery of the Confederate flag on the McMichaels\' truck. \c\cOn June 24, 2020, a Glynn County grand jury indictment was released against all three defendants, each on nine counts: malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. \c\cAt a hearing on July 2020, the three defendants waived arraignment and pleaded not guilty. During the hearing the lead prosecutor disclosed that Arbery's palm print had been found on the side of Bryan's truck and texts taken from Bryan's cellphone were "replete with racist remarks." At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge denied bond to Bryan. \c\cIn August 2020, attorneys for the McMichaels and Bryan filed motions seeking release on bond and dismissal of the charges. In November 2020, the court denied the McMichaels\' request for bond. In January 2021, the court denied Bryan's second request for bond. \c\cThe trial took place in the Glynn County Superior Court in Brunswick. \c\cAfter every Brunswick Judicial Circuit judge recused themselves from the case, Chatham County Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley became the trial judge. \c\cJudge Walmsley made the following pre-trial rulings in 2021:\c\cHe denied a prosecution motion to bar testimony that the neighborhood was "on edge" at the time of the murder. \c\cHe ruled that the defense could not introduce evidence of Arbery's prior "bad acts", noting that the McMichaels were unaware of Arbery's past at the time of the murder. He justified his ruling by stating that the "character of the victim is neither relevant nor admissible in a murder trial", and that such evidence might also mislead the jury into thinking that Arbery's murder was "somehow justified" on potential "future dangerousness". \c\cHe ruled that the defense could not introduce Arbery's mental health records as evidence, citing Arbery's medical privacy. Walmsley also stated that a nurse's 2018 diagnosis of Arbery having mental illness was "highly questionable" and may unfairly prejudice the jury. \c\cHe ruled that the prosecution could let the jury listen to recorded phone calls made by the jailed McMichaels, and issued a limited gag order on trial lawyers not to comment on inadmissible evidence, including evidence they "should reasonably know" would be ruled inadmissible at trial. \c\cHe excluded evidence of "minute" amounts of THC detected in Arbery's body after his autopsy, excluded testimony of two use of force experts which the defense wanted to use regarding Travis McMichael's Coast Guard training, and excluded the introduction of graphic footage of a dying Arbery. \c\cHe excluded evidence that Arbery was on probation when he was murdered, and allowed the introduction into evidence of photos and videos of a Confederate flag symbol on the truck that Travis McMichael used to pursue Arbery. \c\cThe trial of the McMichaels and Bryan in the Superior Court before Judge Walmsley began October 18, 2021, with jury selection. The jury selection process was lengthy and proceeded slowly, with the 600 potential jurors (members of the venire) questioned on what they had heard about the case and whether they had formed a belief about the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and many prospective jurors were dismissed. Judge Walmsley denied a defense motion to limit demonstrations near the courthouse, citing the demonstrators\' First Amendment rights; the judge, however, expressed concern about social media posts that were "identifying jurors" or attempting "to influence the public". \c\cOn November 3, 2021, jury selection was completed. Twelve jurors and four alternates were selected. Of the 16 members, one was a Black man, three were white men, and 12 were white women. The defense struck 11 of 12 prospective Black jurors, the defense leaving the one Black man from the qualified panel, while the prosecution used all 12 of its allotted strikes on white potential jurors. Judge Walmsley rejected a prosecution motion alleging that the defense had used its strikes in a racially discriminatory way. Only one Black person ended up serving on the jury, despite Glynn County's nearly 27% Black population. \c\cOpening statements for the state and the McMichaels were made on November 5, 2021. Opening statements for William "Roddie" Bryan were delivered on November 18, 2021, after the prosecution rested its case. \c\cProsecutor Linda Dunikoski said the murder of Arbery arose from the defendants\' "assumptions and driveway decisions ... Not on facts, not on evidence". She stated that the defendants did not have "immediate knowledge" of Arbery committing a crime that day, referencing Gregory McMichael's police statement where he said he did not know if Arbery had committed a break-in. She also highlighted that twelve days before the murder, Glynn County police officer Robert Rash had relayed to the McMichaels a statement from the under-construction house's owner that Arbery "has never stolen or taken anything from his property". Dunikoski described that Arbery was "under attack" by the defendants during the chase on the day of his murder, alleging that William "Roddie" Bryan had attempted to hit Arbery with his truck four times, that Gregory McMichael told Arbery "Stop or I\'ll blow your fucking head off", that Gregory later described Arbery as "trapped like a rat" as a result of the chase, and that Travis McMichael had "stepped around that open door and moved toward" Arbery during the final confrontation. \c\cBob Rubin, the lawyer for Travis McMichael, stated that although there was "no crime committed" in the presence of the McMichaels, "there was probable cause to believe a felony had been committed" by Arbery and that he "was attempting to escape". Rubin described the Satilla Shores neighbourhood as "on edge" due to property crimes, arguing that Travis had a "duty and responsibility to protect himself and his neighborhood". Rubin stated that Travis killed Arbery "in self-defense", because if Arbery took Travis\' gun, either Travis or Gregory would be dead. \c\cFrank Hogue, the lawyer for Gregory McMichael, stated that Gregory correctly recognized Arbery from prior videos of Arbery entering the under-construction house, and that "Greg had sound reasons to believe theft had occurred – burglary". \c\cKevin Gough, the lawyer for William "Roddie" Bryan, stated that Bryan "had no intent to strike or injure" Arbery, while noting that Bryan had not taken his rifle along for the chase. Gough argued that there was "scant evidence" that Bryan attempted to "conceal or minimize his involvement" in the incident, because Bryan did not dispose of the cellphone video of the chase and shooting; Bryan instead passed the video to the police. \c\cThe prosecution presented evidence from November 5 to November 16, 2021. \c\cRobert Rash, a Glynn County police officer, testified that (1) after speaking to Larry English, the owner of the under-construction house, Rash had been searching for Arbery to warn him against trespassing; (2) having known Gregory McMichael professionally, Rash in December 2020 discussed the "unidentified Black male" with Greg. At Gregory's suggestion, Rash shared Gregory's cellphone with English, because Rash wanted Gregory to be "an expert witness to be on the phone with 911" to help identify Arbery; (3) Rash never deputized Gregory or gave him any authority; (4) Rash later shared security camera videos of Arbery with the McMichaels 12 days before the murder, while telling the McMichaels that English "hasn\'t seen him actually take anything"; (5) also at that time, Rash told the McMichaels about a gun theft incident "down the road" that did not involve Arbery: "we got on video the car that people come in and stole them, they were from another neighborhood."\c\cRicky Minshew, who was a Glynn County police officer at the time of the murder, testified he was seconds away from the scene at the time of the shots, having responded to a non-emergency report about a "suspicious Black male" leaving a home under construction. Minshew said he arrived at the scene seeing Arbery in a pool of blood and heard a "death rattle" from Arbery, but did not render medical attention as he did not have "adequate medical training" to handle such a serious injury, and also because there were no "police units to watch my back" when he arrived. Minshew testified that he questioned William "Roddie" Bryan at the scene, where Bryan said the following: (1) that he was not familiar with Arbery or the McMichaels when Bryan joined the chase; (2) that he was not sure if Arbery did anything wrong; (3) that he did not know if he should have chased Arbery at all; (4) that he tried to "corner" Arbery with his vehicle five times; (5) that Arbery "had to stop and catch his breath", and seemed "tired of running"; (6) that he heard one of the McMichaels shouting at Arbery: "What\'d you steal? What\'d you do?" during the chase. \c\cWilliam Duggan, a Glynn County police officer, testified that he came to the scene after hearing a "shots fired" report on his radio. The jury was shown Duggan's body camera and dashboard camera footage, which included graphic video of Arbery's body. Duggan said he attended to Arbery, intending to stop the bleeding from a large chest wound, but then realized that Arbery was already dead. Duggan said he saw Travis McMichael covered in blood and asked if Travis was OK, to which Travis replied: "No I\'m not OK ... I just effing killed somebody.” Duggan described Travis as very upset and cooperative. \c\cJeff Brandeberry, a Glynn County police officer, testified that he interviewed Gregory McMichael at the scene, who was "pretty amped up" and seemed "a little upset". Brandeberry recounted Gregory saying the following: (1) that he had seen Arbery "hauling ass down the street" past his house in a "dead run"; (2) that Arbery had been "breaking in all these houses out here ... he makes frequent trips to the neighborhood and gets caught on video cameras every third or fourth night breaking into places and no one's been able to catch him"; (3) that "a driving force in my mind is my son had a missing pistol and this guy I don’t know for a fact this guy has been going over doing this crap over and over ... I saw him if I could’ve gotten a shot, I would have shot him myself"; (4) that the blood on Gregory's hand came from checking if Arbery had a gun; and (5) that Arbery was "an asshole. He was hooked up when he came around the corner."\c\cParker Marcy, a Glynn County police detective, who had interviewed Gregory McMichael at the police station later in the day of the murder, testified that Gregory told him: (1) that he had seen Arbery on surveillance videos shared by a neighbor and "had heard a description of him", but was unsure if he had seen Arbery in person before ("never" or "maybe"); (2) that he saw "two or three videos" showing "this guy breaking into or being or wandering around into this [under-construction] house ... I don’t think the guy has stolen anything out of there, and if he did it was early on in this process, but he keeps going back in that house over and over again"; (3) that he considered Arbery a "prime suspect" in "numerous" forcible entries into buildings and vehicles ("Logic tells you that this guy may be the one that's doing it"); (4) he told Arbery during the chase words akin to "Stop ... I\'ll blow your fucking head off", because "I was trying to convey to this guy we were not playing"; (5) that Gregory had once pointed his gun at Arbery; and (6) that the chase resulted in Arbery being "cornered ... like a rat". Marcy further stated that surveillance video did not show Arbery taking anything from the under-construction house that day. \c\cRoderic Nohilly, a Glynn County police detective who had previously known Gregory McMichael professionally, interviewed Gregory at the police station later in the day of the murder. Nohilly testified that Gregory told him: (1) "I don\'t know. [...] He might have", in response to Nohilly's question on whether Arbery broke into a house that day; (2) that he saw Arbery "hauling ass" past his house, "getting the hell out of there", prompting him to take his handgun and call for Travis; (3) that they "chased [Arbery] around the neighborhood for a bit, but he wasn’t winded at all"; (4) that Arbery was "trapped like a rat" in the chase, "wanting to flee", but "realized ... he was not going to get away"; (5) that Arbery wanted to "grab [Travis\'] gun and probably shoot Travis ... If he\'d had gotten that shotgun, and there was no separation between Travis and him, I was going to cap his ass". \c\cStephan Lowrey, formerly a Glynn County police investigator who worked on the case, had interviewed Bryan at the police station later in the day of the murder. Lowrey testified that Bryan told him: \c\c(1) that he had seen Arbery "running down the road" with a truck "following", so Bryan entered his own vehicle to "assist"; (2) that he had not seen Arbery before and did not know if Arbery was involved with "any past instances", (3) that during the chase, he tried to cut off Arbery multiple times, "angled" Arbery "off the side of the road", but "didn\'t hit him"; and (4) that Arbery was trying to open Bryan's truck door during the chase. Lowrey further testified that Arbery's fingerprints were found on Bryan's truck door, next to a dent in the truck's body. Regarding the status of the Glynn County investigation before the Georgia Bureau of Investigation takeover, Lowrey said that it could be described as "inactive". \c\cJason Seacrist, a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent, who interviewed Bryan in May 2020, testified that (1) Bryan said he "didn\'t know for sure" if Arbery did something wrong, but "instinct" indicated Arbery did, and Bryan ultimately "figured he stole something"; (2) compared to his earlier interviews, Bryan played down his involvement in the chase in the later interview, stating that he wanted to slow Arbery down and take a picture of Arbery to identify him to the police. \c\cRichard Dial, a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent, led the organization's investigation into Arbery's murder. Dial testified that (1) Bryan's behavior was not that of a "witness", as he was "pursuing" Arbery and "trying to box him in between two different vehicles"; (2) during the chase, Bryan had to reverse his vehicle to continue his pursuit of Arbery after Arbery turned into another street and Bryan overshot the turn. Maps compiled by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation showed that the McMichaels\' vehicle looped around to the other end of the street Arbery was on, such that Arbery was between Bryan and the McMichaels, with no way to leave the street without meeting one of their vehicles. \c\cOther Georgia Bureau of Investigation members who testified were (1) Lawrence Kelly, who analyzed phone records and concluded that Bryan did not communicate with the McMichaels on the day of the shooting or before; (2) Jesse Worley, who said that Arbery's fingerprints were found on Bryan's truck; (3) Anne Kisler-Rao, who said that fibers from the side of Bryan's truck were consistent with those of Arbery's shirt, (4) Brian Leppard, who said that Travis\' shotgun was fired very close to Arbery's armpit, close enough to touch Arbery's shirt and close enough for Arbery to possibly grab. \c\cDuring testimony by Cara Richardson, director of the Glynn-Brunswick 911 call center, several calls were played for the jury to hear. In July 2019, Gregory McMichael reported "a lot of break-ins in this area, automobile break-ins. And my son and I just discovered" a male suspect, "he may be living under Bluff Creek bridge ... We just made contact with him". Other calls made by Travis McMichael in January 2020 and mid-February 2020 were also played, as well as a call by Gregory McMichael at the time of the incident. \c\cSecurity camera videos showed the jury that Arbery had visited Larry English's under-construction house five times between October 2019 to February 2020. The videos showed that Arbery had no bag, and he did not touch or take any items from the house. The jury also saw more security camera footage from the house, displaying other incidents of two white boys taking plywood from the property's garage, and separately, a white man and woman entering the house at night with a small bag. English made multiple 911 calls regarding the white couple, once saying: "I know that first time they went in and stole", from the boat at his property. English also called 911 over Arbery in 2019, describing him as a "trespasser". Citing ill health, English did not testify live in court, but instead a September 2021 video deposition of his was shown to the jury. English testified in his deposition that (1) people frequently explored his under-construction house; (2) he called 911 on Arbery in 2019 wanting police to tell Arbery "not to be there anymore"; (3) he barely knew the McMichaels and had never met William Bryan; (4) as to whether he told the McMichaels about incidents at his house – "probably", but "not sure"; (5) he had not authorized the McMichaels to confront anyone on his property; and (6) he did authorize a different neighbour (not Bryan) to check his property. \c\cKellie Parr, whose parents are residents of Satilla Shores, testified that in either December 2019 or January 2020, she saw a man at the under-construction house, whom she now believes to be Arbery. Parr said that the man was "just standing in the door frame and we just kind of looked at each other as I drove by", and that the man "didn\'t like hide or anything". \c\cMatthew Albenze, a Satilla Shores resident, testified that (1) he saw Arbery "just looking around" inside the under-construction house on the day of the murder; (2) in reaction to that, he put a handgun in his pocket, and called the police non-emergency number from across the street; (3) he chose not to call 911 because he "did not see an emergency"; (4) that Arbery ran off during Albenze's call, to which Albenze said: "I don’t know why he took off running. I don’t know if he saw me or not". Albenze's call was played to the jury. \c\cDr. Edmund Donoghue, the state medical examiner who conducted Arbery's autopsy, testified that both the first and third shotgun blasts resulted in fatal injuries in Arbery, such that police or paramedics would not have been able to save Arbery's life. The first blast cut through Arbery's right wrist artery and pierced Arbery's chest, breaking ribs and causing massive internal bleeding; the second blast missed; and the third blast cut through a major artery and vein close to Arbery's left armpit, fracturing bones. \c\cThe defense presented testimony on November 17 and 18, 2021. Travis McMichael was the only defendant to testify; Gregory McMichael and William "Roddie" Bryan did not testify. \c\cOn the first day of his testimony, Travis testified that (1) crime had increased in the neighborhood in the months before the shooting, but he did not have complete information on who committed the crimes; (2) he was aware that items were stolen from the boat at his neighbor's under-construction property, and that he knew that "several people" had entered the property, any of whom could have stolen the items; (3) twelve days before the shooting, he saw Arbery "creeping" outside the under-construction house and he confronted Arbery, who reached towards his waistband, leading Travis to leave and call 911, because he was "not going to chase or investigate somebody who might be armed"; (4) on the day of the shooting, Gregory McMichael, in nearly a "frantic state", told Travis to "grab your gun" because "the guy who has been breaking in down the road" had run past their house; and (5) Travis suspected that Arbery had been caught "breaking in" or been involved in an "altercation". \c\cTravis McMichael also testified that (6) when he and his father chased Arbery in Travis\' vehicle, he caught up with Arbery and recognized him as the person he saw twelve days earlier; (7) he mistakenly thought his father indicated that the police had been called by him; (8) he chased Arbery to ask questions, with Travis asking: "Hey, what are you doing? What's going on?" However, Arbery did not reply; (9) he continued chasing and attempted to "de-escalate" by asking Arbery to "stop", but Arbery looked "very angry", turned around and ran in the opposite direction; (10) he caught up with Arbery again, saying that "police are on the way", causing Arbery to run faster, hence Travis became more suspicious; and (11) Travis also chased Arbery because he wanted to "let the police know where [Arbery was] at and watch what's going on, to see where he's going". \c\cTravis McMichael further testified that (12) he circled the neighborhood to track Arbery, eventually seeing Arbery running beside a black truck, which Arbery was "hitting" and "grabbing ... looked like he was trying to get in"; (13) Travis had not asked Bryan to join the chase and "didn\'t know where [Bryan's black] truck came from"; (14) Travis stopped his vehicle and got out, then again asked his father if he had called police, to which his father indicated he had no phone; (15) he then saw Arbery running towards him alone, viewed Arbery as "dangerous", shouted at Arbery to "stop", and reached for his shotgun from his vehicle, to which Arbery turned around and ran away. \c\cRegarding the final confrontation captured on video by Bryan, Travis McMichael testified that (16) he saw Arbery once again running towards him, this time followed by the black truck, so Travis passed his cellphone to his father; (17) thinking that Arbery was "going to attack", Travis pointed his shotgun at Arbery "to deter him to do not come at me"; (18) after that, Arbery ran around Travis\' vehicle from the passenger's side to the front, while Travis moved from the driver's side to the front of the vehicle to ensure that he could still see Arbery, thinking that Arbery "might be armed" and was a threat to Greg; then (19) Arbery engaged Travis at the vehicle's front, grabbing Travis\' gun and hitting Travis, so Travis shot Arbery to stop Arbery from taking Travis\' gun. \c\cOn the second day of his testimony, Travis McMichael testified that (20) he never told Arbery that Arbery was under arrest for any crime, because "I didn’t have time. I was still trying to get him to stop"; (21) that later when making a statement to the police, Travis did not say that he and Gregory were trying to arrest Arbery; (22) that until the time Travis aimed his shotgun at Arbery, Arbery had not verbally threatened Travis or displayed any weapon, but Travis thought Arbery "could be a threat" because Arbery was running at him; (23) that Travis told police that day that he "cannot remember" if Arbery had grabbed Travis\' gun when Travis shot him, but this account was inaccurate due to Travis suffering the "most traumatic event" of his life. \c\cRegarding Facebook posts Travis McMichael made before the shooting, he testified that (24) in January 2019 he agreed with a neighbour who wrote that thieves should be made an example of: "That's right – hope y\'all catch the vermin", then when that neighbour indicated concern over how her father may interact with thieves because he did not care about being jailed, he responded: "That's what this world needs more of ... My old man is the same way ... Hell, I\'m getting that way"; and (25) in July 2019 he wrote "Arm up" in response to a post on local crime. \c\cSix residents of Satilla Shores testified on behalf of the defense, relaying their perception of crime in Satilla Shores, as well as a Facebook page on Satilla Shores in which crime was discussed. \c\cClosing arguments were made on November 22 and 23, 2021. \c\cProsecutor Linda Dunikoski argued that the defendants could not legally make a citizen's arrest of Arbery because they assumed he had committed a crime that day, whereas a citizen's arrest required "immediate knowledge" of a crime. She stated that the alternate requirement for a citizen's arrest, suspicion of fleeing after committing a felony, was not satisfied because at most, Arbery had trespassed, which was a misdemeanor and not a felony. Dunikoski further pointed out that Arbery had never brought "a bag, or any means to steal anything" to the under-construction house. She rejected the notion that the defendants were acting in self-defense "because they were the initial, unjustified aggressors", while noting that Travis McMichael had pointed his shotgun at Arbery. In contrast, she said Arbery had: "No weapon. No threats. No way to call for help. Didn\'t even have a cell phone on him. Ran away from them for five minutes."\c\cJason Sheffield, the lawyer for Travis McMichael, argued that under Georgia law, the felony of burglary included entering "with the intent to steal something", thus when Travis saw Arbery at the under-construction house twelve days before the shooting, he had probable cause to believe Arbery committed burglary and could justifiably arrest Arbery. While describing the incident as "tragic", Sheffield argued: "You are allowed to defend yourself. You are allowed to use force that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury if you believe it's necessary". \c\cLaura Hogue, a lawyer for Gregory McMichael, argued that "Arbery was not an innocent victim", describing him as "a recurring nighttime intruder ... frightening, and unsettling", who arrived in Satilla Shores "with no socks to cover his long dirty toenails". She said Arbery was "acting erratically when approached and making terrible, unexpected, illogical choices", failed to "stop" or "wait, to tell the police what he was doing", and ultimately died because he "chose to fight", "without any sense of reason to run at a man wielding a shotgun". \c\cKevin Gough, the lawyer for Bryan, argued that Bryan could not have known that the McMichaels had guns and would shoot Arbery, and that "by the time [Bryan] knew there was nothing he could do". Gough also questioned why Arbery never asked for someone to call 911, suggesting that "Arbery doesn\'t want help". Gough argued that if the McMichaels "were vigilantes and harbored some ill will toward" Arbery, "then what difference does it make whether Roddie Bryan was there or not?" Gough concluded by stating that Bryan's "presence is absolutely superfluous and irrelevant". \c\cProsecutor Linda Dunikoski delivered the final rebuttal to defense arguments. She disputed the defense arguments that the McMichaels were afraid of crime in their neighborhood, stating that their five-minute chase of Arbery proved that they were not afraid. Dunikoski described Gregory's description of Arbery "trapped like a rat" as an acknowledgment of false imprisonment, and Gregory's description of Arbery as an "asshole" just after the shooting to be evidence of malice. She concluded that all three men were responsible because they all committed felonies leading up to the murder. \c\cOn November 24, 2021, the jury reached a verdict after 12 hours of deliberation spanning over two days. \c\cTravis McMichael was found guilty of malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault (with a firearm and with a pickup truck), false imprisonment, and criminal attempt to commit a felony (false imprisonment). \c\cGregory McMichael was found guilty of four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault (with a firearm and with a pickup truck), false imprisonment, and criminal attempt to commit a felony (false imprisonment). He was found not guilty of malice murder. \c\cWilliam "Roddie" Bryan was found guilty of three counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated assault (with a pickup truck), false imprisonment, and criminal attempt to commit a felony (false imprisonment).  He was found not guilty of malice murder, not guilty of one count of felony murder, and not guilty of one count of aggravated assault (with a firearm). \c\cA crowd outside the Glynn County courthouse cheered at the guilty verdict by the jury. \c\cBoth the McMichaels and Bryan face mandatory sentences of life imprisonment. The prosecution did not seek the death penalty in this case. Superior Court Judge Walmsley did not immediately schedule a sentencing date, in order to give both sides time to prepare. How much of the defendants\' life sentences they serve is up to the judge, depending on whether their sentences come with or without parole. Even if the possibility of parole is granted, persons convicted of murder must serve at least 30 years before becoming eligible. Sentencing is scheduled for January 7, 2022. \c\cAttorneys for the defendants intend to appeal. \c\cIn April 2021, all three men were indicted by a federal grand jury with one count each of interference with rights, and with one count each of attempted kidnapping.  Travis McMichael and Gregory McMichael were also indicted with separate counts of using firearms during a crime of violence. The "interference with rights" charge is a hate crime, specifically claiming "that the defendants used force and threats of force to intimidate and interfere with Arbery's right to use a public street because of his race". The range of sentencing includes the death penalty, life in prison, another prison sentence length, and a fine. All three men pleaded not guilty. \c\cJury selection for the hate crime trial in federal court will begin on February 7, 2022. The federal trial is independent of the Glynn County trial's outcome. \c\cIn May 2020, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said that his office would review how the investigation into Arbery's murder "was handled from the outset". At Carr's request, the GBI investigated whether District Attorney Jackie Johnson or District Attorney George Barnhill's actions in connection with the appointment of a conflict prosecutor to investigate the murder of Arbery constituted a crime. In November 2020, Jackie Johnson lost her bid for re-election as Brunswick District Attorney. \c\cOn September 2, 2021, Carr announced that a Glynn County grand jury had indicted ex-District Attorney Jackie Johnson on one felony count of violating the oath of a public officer "by showing favor and affection to Greg McMichael during the investigation" (Gregory was formerly her subordinate), and for being unfair to Arbery by having "recommended Barnhill to the Attorney General's Office for appointment as the case prosecutor without disclosing that she had previously sought Barnhill's assistance on the case". Simultaneously announced was that the grand jury had indicted Johnson on one misdemeanor count of obstruction and hindering law enforcement, in this case the Glynn County police, "by directing that Travis McMichael should not be placed under arrest." On September 8, Johnson turned herself in for arrest, and then was released from detention without needing to pay her $10,000 bond. \c\cGeorgia Attorney General Carr called for a federal investigation into how local investigators and authorities handled the case, including "investigation of the communications and discussions by and between the Office of the District Attorney of the Brunswick Judicial Circuit and the Office of the District Attorney of the Waycross Judicial Circuit related to this case."\c\cThe next day on May 11, the U.S. Department of Justice responded that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia "have been supporting and will continue fully to support and participate in the state investigation. We are assessing all of the evidence to determine whether federal hate crimes charges are appropriate." In April 2021, all three men were indicted for federal crimes – one count each of interference with rights (a hate crime), one count each of attempted kidnapping, and one count for each McMichael of using a firearm during a crime of violence. \c\cThe involvement of the GCPD as the primary investigator in a case involving its former officer Gregory McMichael was controversial. Following Arbery's murder, media investigated the history of the GCPD. The New York Times noted that in preceding years, the department had "been accused of covering up allegations of misconduct, tampering with a crime scene, interfering in an investigation of a police shooting and retaliating against fellow officers who cooperated with outside investigators."\c\cDays after Arbery was fatally shot, the chief of police  –  who had been brought in to clean up a police force described by the county manager in 2019 as poorly trained and characterized by a "culture of cronyism"  –  was indicted on charges arising from an alleged cover-up of a sexual relationship between an officer and an informant. In response to a grand jury report issued in November 2019, which had condemned the GCPD over "alleged officer misconduct and poor coordination with the local sheriff's office", State Senator William Ligon of Brunswick in early 2020 introduced legislation to allow voters to abolish the Glynn County Police Department. Although the legislation initially stalled in the General Assembly, after the legislature returned following the COVID-19 recess, the House passed the legislation 152–3. The Senate then passed the legislation as Senate Bill 509, which Governor Kemp signed. The legislation allowed a November 3, 2020 binding referendum such that the police department would be abolished if a majority of Glynn County voters agreed.  Nevertheless, the referendum was ruled unconstitutional by a superior court judge on September 11, 2020, so it did not appear on the November 3 ballot. \c\cArbery's murder also prompted re-examinations of the way prosecutions of shootings were handled by the Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney's Office. In 2010, two police officers fatally shot an unarmed white woman through her car windshield. Four former prosecutors, who had worked under Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Jackie Johnson, alleged that Johnson shielded the officers from criminal prosecution. A 2015 investigation by WSB-TV revealed that Johnson had agreed to withhold a draft murder indictment from the grand jury and had "allowed the officers\' department to present a factually inaccurate animation they created showing the car escaping through a gap and running over the officers."\c\cIn late June 2020, Georgia enacted new bipartisan hate crimes legislation (House Bill 426). Previous versions of the legislation had passed the state House but failed to pass the state Senate. Arbery's murder was a catalyst for passage of the bill; at the time Georgia was one of just four states without any hate-crimes legislation, as Georgia Supreme Court struck down a previous hate crimes law in 2004. The law requires a higher sentence for defendants convicted of targeting a victim due to "actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability."\c\cOn February 16, 2021, exactly a week before the first anniversary of Arbery's murder, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced he would introduce legislation that would significantly amend the state's citizen's arrest law. Georgia's citizen's arrest law had been textually very broad in scope, dating back to the Civil War era. The legal defense argued by the defendants accused of murdering Arbery was that they were only attempting to perform a lawful citizen's arrest. Kemp criticized the law for being outdated and vague. According to Kemp, the changes would close numerous loopholes under the existing law while still protecting the rights of law abiding citizens. On March 4, 2021 the proposed changes were passed out of legislative committee in the Georgia House of Representatives by a unanimous vote. The bill – House Bill 479 – received widespread and bipartisan support. The bill to repeal the citizen's arrest law passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Kemp on May 10, 2021. \c\cIn repealing the citizen's arrest law, it was replaced with new legislation that allowed for certain private persons such as licensed private detectives, security guards, shopkeepers and restaurant employees to conduct arrest under specific circumstances. \c\cArbery's mother Wanda Cooper-Jones said her son was jogging when he was murdered and called for arrests to be made. The Arbery family retained Benjamin Crump, S. Lee Merritt, and Chris Stewart as attorneys. Meritt described the McMichaels as "vigilantes" and "a posse" who "performed a modern lynching in the middle of the day." Arbery's family attorney charged that videos of earlier police encounters show a pattern of unfair treatment of Arbery based on his skin color. \c\cOn May 1, Gregory McMichael told The Daily Beast he "never would have gone after someone for their color". He also said he had no direct evidence Arbery had stolen anything in the neighborhood. However, McMichael argued Arbery was on property "without permission". \c\cA lawyer for William Bryan Jr., the man who recorded the shooting using cell phone video, said his client had done nothing wrong, had fully cooperated in the investigation, and "is not now, and never has been, a \'vigilante\'." The attorney also described Bryan as "a mechanic with a high-school education" who was simply a witness to the shooting. \c\cAttorneys for Arbery's family called for Bryan's arrest. They said that because Bryan had participated in chasing Arbery and had "corralled" him, Bryan participated in the murder. \c\cAfter the video went public, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said, "I expect justice to be carried out as swiftly as possible." Governor Brian Kemp said on May 7 that "Georgians deserve answers" about the incident. Two Glynn County Commissioners, Peter Murphy and Allen Booker, called for a federal probe. After viewing the video, Georgia U.S. Representative Doug Collins and U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler said it was "disturbing" and called for a full investigation and answers. \c\cSpeaking to reporters, President Donald Trump commented, "My heart goes out to the parents and to the loved ones of the young gentleman. It's a very sad thing." Then-presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, said that "the video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood." Biden offered condolences and called for "a swift, full, and transparent investigation into his murder." Biden also described the shooting as a lynching. \c\cAfter the video was released, demonstrators gathered outside the Glynn County Courthouse to demand an arrest in the case, and called for the resignation of District Attorney Jackie Johnson. The local Brunswick NAACP chapter also called for the resignation of the Glynn County police chief. The Southern Poverty Law Center called for a federal investigation into the incident, citing their belief Arbery's murder was racially motivated. \c\cPolitical commentator and former attorney David A. French wrote that, under Georgia's stand-your-ground law, because the McMichaels initiated the confrontation,\c\cOn May 8, 2020, which would have been Arbery's 26th birthday, thousands of supporters of Arbery's family took part in a run of 2.23 miles (3.59 km), the date of his murder; they documented it to social media with the hashtag #IRunWithMaud. \c\cMany clergy and celebrities have voiced support for review of the case, and concern about the violence. Russell D. Moore, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said, "under any Christian vision of justice, there is no situation in which the mob murder of a person can be morally right, nor grounds for a person to be chased down and shot by private citizens." LeBron James expressed outrage on Twitter, and offered "prayers and blessings".  Some posted tributes to Arbery, including Lecrae, David A. French, Scott Sauls, Christine Caine, Jack Graham, J. D. Greear, Viola Davis, Wanda Sykes, Padma Lakshmi, Gabrielle Union, and Andy Lassner. \c\cOn social media, far-right and neo-Nazi groups spread falsehoods about Arbery; their white-nationalist supporters attacked President Trump for his sympathetic comments regarding Arbery.  According to an analyst from the Middle East Media Research Institute, such groups claimed Arbery was wielding a hammer and wearing Timberland boots when he was shot dead; Arbery was wearing running shoes.  They also spread racist remarks about Arbery, and claimed that the McMichaels were victims.  Far-right groups said the McMichaels\' arrests reflected a bias against whites. \c\cCivil rights leaders and politicians reacted overwhelmingly to the verdict with hopeful yet cautionary statements, and Arbery's family thanked those who showed support. 
In the morning of January 9, 2022, a fire tore through an apartment building in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx. Dozens of people were injured, including 32 with critical, life-threatening injuries. Officials are expecting it to be one of the New York City's worst fires in modern times. 
The 2021–22 Russo-Ukrainian crisis is an ongoing military confrontation and international crisis between Russia and Ukraine that started in late October 2021. The crisis has caused international tension, also involving the United States, NATO, the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States. \c\cThe aggravation of Russian-Ukrainian relations occurred in late October – early November and was provoked by the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations. The message about the use of UAVs appeared almost simultaneously with the news about the occupation of the village of Staromarievka on the contact line of the parties, in which 37 Russian citizens who received passports under the simplified program live. \c\cSpeaking at a defence-related meeting on 2 November, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia was closely monitoring the use of UAVs "near the borders of Russia" and should carefully analyze the situation in this regard. According to OSCE observers, the ceasefire regime began to be violated twice as often as in 2020 (during the period from the evening of 29 October to the evening of 31 October, the ceasefire regime in the Donetsk region was violated 988 times, and in Luhansk — 471). OSCE SMM observers reported on the movement of military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as repeated attempts to muffle the signal of its UAVs, which are used to monitor the terrain. At the same time, publications appeared in the Western media that Russia was again pulling troops to the Ukrainian border. Satellite photos of Russian armoured vehicles were cited as evidence. \c\cOn 2–3 November, the head of the CIA, William Burns, came to Moscow and met with senior Russian intelligence officials there. According to CNN, the purpose of the trip was to convey to the Kremlin Joe Biden's concern about the situation on the border with Ukraine. Sources of the TV channel reported that after the trip, Burns spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to ease tensions between Moscow and Kyiv. For the same purpose, a high-ranking official of the US State Department was sent to Ukraine on 4 November. \c\cThe military aggravation was accompanied by aggravation in the Ukrainian political field. On 2 November, Dmytro Yarosh, the former leader of the Right Sector organization, was appointed adviser to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny. On 4 November, a new defence minister was approved — former Deputy Prime Minister – Minister for the Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Oleksii Reznikov, who participated in the meetings of the Trilateral Contact Group on behalf of Ukraine. \c\cIn November 2021, the Russian Defense Ministry described the deployment of the U.S. warships to the Black Sea as a "threat to regional security and strategic stability." The ministry said in a statement, "The real goal behind the U.S. activities in the Black Sea region is exploring the theatre of operations in case Kyiv attempts to settle the conflict in the southeast by force."\c\cOn 13 November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Russia has again amassed 100,000 troops in the border area. In early November, reports of Russian military buildups prompted U.S. officials to warn the EU that Russia could be planning a potential invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied allegations that Russia is preparing for a possible invasion of Ukraine. He accused Ukraine of "planning aggressive actions against Donbass." Peskov urged NATO to stop "concentrating a military fist" near Russia's borders and to stop arming Ukraine with modern weapons. \c\cOn 16 November, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on the West to send Russia "a clear signal calling for reducing tension, avoiding any escalation in and around Ukraine." Stoltenberg added that the alliance records an "unusual concentration" of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border. On 15 November, Acting German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian expressed concern in a joint communique about "the movements of Russian forces and military equipment near Ukraine," calling on both sides to "show restraint." At the same time, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby confirmed that the United States continues to observe "unusual military activity" of the Russian Federation near the borders of Ukraine, and the head of the State Department Antony Blinken discussed reports of "Russian military activity" in the area with Jean-Yves Le Drian. It was reported that the United States is discussing sanctions with European allies in case of further Russian invasion\c\cBack in early November, Ukrainian intelligence stated that information about the transfer of additional Russian troops to the Ukrainian borders was nothing more than "an element of psychological pressure." However, a week later, the Office of the President of Ukraine recognized that the Russian Federation was strengthening "specific groups of troops" near the border. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Paris and Berlin to prepare for a possible military scenario of Russia's actions in the Ukrainian direction. \c\cAgainst this background, Ukraine has sharply intensified diplomatic efforts. On 15 November, Volodymyr Zelensky and the head of the European Council Charles Michel discussed "the security situation along the borders of Ukraine." On the same day, Dmytro Kuleba held talks on the same issues in Brussels. The new head of the Defense Ministry, Oleksii Rezikov, went to Washington, where on 18 November he met with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. On 16 November, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace visited Kyiv. According to the tabloid Daily Mirror, a consolidated rapid response unit of about 600 fighters has been formed in the UK for transfer to Ukraine. \c\cOn 28 December, U.S. and Russia announced bilateral talks would take place in Geneva on 10 January 2022, to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and to confront rising tensions over Ukraine. The talks would be led by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Wendy Sherman. \c\cIn addition to the Geneva talks, it was announced that Russia would hold talks with NATO in Brussels on 12 January 2022. On 13 January 2022, a broader meeting involving the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would take place in Vienna. \c\cOn 21 November, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, reported that Russia allegedly concentrated more than 92,000 troops and Iskander short-range ballistic missile systems near the Ukrainian borders. Budanov said that Russia is behind the protests against vaccination against COVID-19 in Kyiv and other protest rallies in Ukraine – this is a preparation for a large-scale military invasion. According to Budanov, Russia needs the protests so that the Ukrainian population does not resist it during the military operation, believing that the Ukrainian authorities have betrayed it: "They want to organize rallies and protests to show that people are against the government," he said in an interview with Military Times."They are trying to prove that our government is betraying the people." According to the head of Ukrainian intelligence, Russia is trying to get the Ukrainians to change power themselves, and if it doesn\'t work out, "the army will step in." According to Budanov, active actions should be expected in late January – early February 2022. \c\cMoscow, in turn, accuses Ukraine of aggressive actions. The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said on 25 November that the Ukrainian authorities are escalating tensions in the Donbas and are conducting offensive actions there in some areas: "The hotheads of the Kiev regime, apparently feeling complete impunity, advocate a forceful solution to the internal Ukrainian crisis. The situation in the conflict zone is escalating. Information continues to be received about the use of weapons prohibited by the Minsk Package of Measures, which are supplied to Ukraine by NATO countries." She believes that by doing so, the Ukrainian leadership is trying to "divert attention from the degradation of the socio-economic and political situation in the country ... and switch this attention to some temporary threats from outside."\c\cHarsh statements from Kyiv and Moscow sound against the background of a deadlock on all existing negotiating platforms. There are no contacts within the Normandy Format and are not expected at any level: there will be no summit, the foreign ministers have not yet been able to coordinate a meeting, and political advisers have not communicated since September. In the Trilateral Contact Group, negotiations are reduced to discussing whether Russia is a party to the conflict. On 15 November, Vladimir Putin signed a decree on providing humanitarian support to the population of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. \c\cOn 1 December, Russia accused Ukraine of deploying half its army – about 125,000 troops – in Donbas to confront pro-Russian separatists. On 3 December, President Putin criticized Ukraine for using a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone against pro-Russian separatists in Donbas, saying the move violated the Minsk peace agreements. On 3 December, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Olexii Reznikov, speaking to the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada, said: "There is a possibility of a large-scale escalation on the part of Russia. The most likely time to achieve readiness for escalation will be the end of January." In December, Janes analysis concluded that major elements of the Russian 41st Army (headquartered at Novosibirsk in central Russia) and the 1st Guards Tank Army (normally deployed around Moscow) had been repositioned to the west, reinforcing the Russian 20th Guards and 8th Guards armies already positioned closer to the Ukrainian border. Additional Russian forces were reported to have moved into Crimea reinforcing Russian naval and ground units already deployed there. \c\cOn 9 December, Russia accused Ukraine of moving heavy artillery towards the front line where separatists are fighting with Ukrainian forces. Chief of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, stated that [NATO's] "Deliveries of helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and aeroplanes to Ukraine are pushing the Ukrainian authorities to take sharp and dangerous steps. Any provocations of the Ukrainian authorities by way of a forced settlement of the problems of Donbass will be suppressed." On 31 December 2021, after a phone call between US President Biden and Russian president Putin, Putin declared that if the US sanctioned them it would be "a fatal mistake."\c\cOn 10 January 2022, the Ukrainian government announced that it had arrested an alleged Russian military intelligence agent who was attempting to recruit others to conduct attacks in the Ukrainian city of Odessa.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in the Philippines was identified on January 30, 2020, and involved a 38-year-old Chinese woman who was confined at San Lazaro Hospital in Metro Manila. On February 1, a posthumous test result from a 44-year-old Chinese man turned out positive for the virus, making the Philippines the first country outside China to record a confirmed death from the disease. \c\cAfter over a month without recording any cases, the Philippines confirmed its first local transmission on March 7, 2020. Since then, the virus has spread to the country's 81 provinces. National and local governments have been imposing community quarantines since March 15, 2020, as a measure to limit the spread of the virus. These include the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) that was implemented in March–May 2020. On March 24, President Rodrigo Duterte signed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, a law that granted him additional powers to handle the pandemic. This was repealed by a follow-up law, the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act, which he signed on September 11. \c\cAs of April 2, 2022, 3,678,598 cases have been reported, resulting in 59,298 reported deaths, the second-highest in Southeast Asia, behind Indonesia. The largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases was reported on January 13, 2022, when the Department of Health (DOH) announced 34,021 new cases. \c\cThe Philippines had a slightly lower testing capacity than its neighbors in Southeast Asia during the first months of the pandemic in the country. COVID-19 tests had to be taken in Australia, as the Philippines lacked testing kits. By the end of January 2020, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila began its testing operations and became the country's first testing laboratory. The DOH has since then accredited 279 laboratories that are capable of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As of September 10, 2021, 277 of these have conducted 19,742,325 tests from more than 18,551,810 unique individuals. \c\cThe Philippines reported its first suspected case of COVID-19 in January 2020. It involved a 5-year-old boy in Cebu, who arrived in the country on January 12 with his mother. At that time, the Philippines had no capability to conduct COVID-19 tests. The boy tested positive for "non-specific pancoronavirus assay" in the RITM. Samples from the boy were also sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia to determine the specific coronavirus strain. The boy tested negative for COVID-19 but several suspected cases were already reported in various parts of the country. \c\cThe RITM developed capability to conduct confirmatory tests for COVID-19 in response to the emergence of suspected COVID-19 cases. It started conducting confirmatory tests on January 30. \c\cThe first case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was confirmed on the same day. The diagnosed patient was a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, who had arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on January 21. She was admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25 after she sought a consultation due to a mild cough. At the time of the confirmation announcement, the Chinese woman was already asymptomatic. \c\cThe second case was confirmed on February 2, a 44-year-old Chinese male who was the companion of the first case. His death on February 1 was the first recorded outside China. He suffered from coinfection with influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae. \c\cOn February 5, the DOH confirmed a third case in a 60-year-old Chinese woman who flew into Cebu City from Hong Kong on January 20 before she traveled to Bohol where she consulted a doctor at a private hospital on January 22, due to fever and rhinitis. Samples taken from the patient on January 24 returned a negative result, but the DOH was notified on February 3 that samples taken from the patient on January 23 tested positive for the virus. The patient upon recovery on January 31 was allowed to go home to China. \c\cAfter a month of reporting no new cases, on March 6, the DOH announced two cases consisting of two Filipinos. One is a 48-year-old man with a travel history to Japan, returning on February 25 and reported symptoms on March 3. The other is a 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes who experienced symptoms on February 25 and was admitted to a hospital on March 1 when he experienced pneumonia. He had last visited a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan. The DOH confirmed that the fifth case had no travel history outside the Philippines and is, therefore, the first case of local transmission. A sixth case was later confirmed, that of a 59-year-old woman who is the wife of the fifth case. Since then, the Department of Health recorded a continuous increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the country. \c\cCases abroad involving foreigners with travel history in the Philippines were reported in early March 2020. The first three recorded cases involving an Australian, a Japanese, and a Taiwanese national had a history of visiting the Philippines in February 2020. Though it was unconfirmed whether or not they had contracted the virus while in the Philippines, speculations arose on undetected local transmissions in the country due to prior confirmation of the Philippines\' first case of local transmission. \c\cRetrospective studies have been made to determine the strain of virus responsible for causing the community outbreak of COVID-19 in the Philippines since March 2020. In May 2020, Edsel Salvaña, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and member of the IATF-EID, said that the strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak in the country that started in March 2020 is closely related to the strain affecting India at the time. The virus strain's family tree is said by Salvaña to have appeared in China and Australia. In a July 2020 webinar led by Cynthia Saloma, executive director of the UP Philippine Genome Center two hypotheses was presented regarding the source of the March 2020 outbreak in the Philippines. Genetic sequence analysis of samples collected from Philippine General Hospital patients from March 22–28 suggest that there are at least two sources of viral transmission in the Philippines; China, mainly from Shanghai and from Japan specifically through repatriated Filipino seafarers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship. \c\cSeveral measures were imposed to mitigate the spread of the disease in the country, including bans on travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and South Korea. On March 7, 2020, the Department of Health (DOH) raised its "Code Red Sub-Level 1," with a recommendation to the President of the Philippines to impose a "public health emergency" authorizing the DOH to mobilize resources for the procurement of safety gear and the imposition of preventive quarantine measures. On March 9, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Proclamation No. 922, declaring the country under a state of public health emergency. \c\cOn March 12, President Duterte declared "Code Red Sub-Level 2," issuing a partial lockdown on Metro Manila to prevent a nationwide spread of COVID-19. The lockdowns were expanded on March 16, placing the entirety of Luzon under an "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ). Other local governments outside Luzon followed in implementing similar lockdowns. On March 17, President Duterte issued Proclamation No. 929, declaring the Philippines under a state of calamity for a tentative period of six months. \c\cAdditional facilities started to conduct confirmatory testing. On March 20, four facilities, namely the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Benguet, and the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila (where the first case was admitted to), began conducting tests as well augmenting the RITM. Other facilities began operations as well in the following days. \c\cOn March 25, the President signed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, which gave him additional powers to handle the outbreak. \c\cBy April, COVID-19 had spread to all 17 regions of the Philippines, with the confirmation of a case in April 6 of a patient confined at a hospital in Surigao City who had been in the Caraga region since March 12 after traveling from Manila. \c\cPresident Duterte on April 7 accepted the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) to extend the ECQ in Luzon until April 30. \c\cOn April 17, it was reported that the country had been able to bring down the viral disease\' reproduction number to 0.65 from 1.5, which meant that the average number of people a person could infect decreased from more than one to less than one. Recent data at the time suggested that the country was doing better in "flattening the curve", but was warned of a "resurgence" and must ramp up mass testing in order to isolate cases and avoid further transmission of COVID-19. \c\cSometime in late April, local government units (LGUs) were no longer authorized to impose quarantine measures without the consent of the IATF-EID. Prior to that period, LGUs could impose such measures in coordination with the Department of the Interior and Local Government. \c\cThe ECQ in Luzon was extended until May 15 in some areas. This included Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Central Luzon (except Aurora), Pangasinan, and Benguet. ECQ measures were also extended in the provinces of Iloilo and Cebu as well as in Davao City. Other areas were downgraded or placed under general community quarantine (GCQ). \c\cOn May 14, Typhoon Vongfong (local name: Ambo) landed on Samar Island. In the Philippines, tens of thousands of people who were locked out due to lockdowns were faced with the dual threat of typhoons and viruses, forcing complex and dangerous evacuation. At each shelter in the central part of the Philippines, in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection, only half of the capacity was accepted, and a mask was required when evacuating. Typhoon Vongfong killed five people in the Philippines. By the time Vongfong landed, the number of confirmed infections was 11,618 and the number of deaths (due to infectious diseases) was 772 in the Philippines. Vongfong also approached Manila, but due to severe restrictions on going out of Manila, most people, including low-income people living in simple houses, could not go to shelters and were forced to wait at home. \c\cAfter May 15, the Philippine government revised its quarantine classifications in correspondence to an earlier announcement that "Science and Economics will be considered for any changes of the lockdown measures." A modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was applied to Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu City, while a GCQ was raised to 41 provinces and 10 cities with moderate risk. Meanwhile, 40 provinces and 11 cities that were considered "low-risk areas" were supposed to be released from community quarantine measures, but were eventually upgraded to a "modified general community quarantine" (MGCQ) after a reportedly "honest mistake" from the national government and requests from respective LGUs. \c\cOnce again, the Philippine government revised its announcements and declared the entire country under GCQ, while Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu City continued to implement an MECQ. This was temporary until guidelines of MGCQ for low-risk areas were finalized. The IATF-EID also reportedly considered the reclassification of provinces and cities in Central Luzon as "high-risk areas" under MECQ. \c\cAfter receiving petitions from LGUs, the IATF-EID revised its quarantine policies yet again. Cebu City and Mandaue were placed under ECQ, while Metro Manila, Laguna, and Central Luzon (except for Aurora and Tarlac) were all under MECQ. The remaining parts of the country were placed under GCQ. \c\cQuarantine measures raised throughout the country started to loosen up on June 1, with areas formerly under ECQ transitioning to a less strict quarantine. This led to a significant rise in the number of confirmed cases, as more areas implemented a GCQ.[citation needed]\c\cThe official start of classes in the elementary and secondary schools which customarily begin on June was postponed. \c\cThe Bayanihan to Heal as One Act expired within this month. According to the national government, the law expired on June 25, due to its sunset provision although there were interpretations that the law expired as early as June 5. Senator Sonny Angara argued that per the Constitution "emergency powers cease upon the next adjournment of Congress" and that he considers the Bayanihan Act as an emergency measure. The national government maintains that the law was to expire on June 25. Upon expiration of the law, the national government is not anymore obliged to hand out cash subsidies to families affected by community quarantine measures. \c\cThe DOH reported an overwhelmingly high number of recoveries on July 30, as the department began its "Oplan Recovery" to clear out its discrepancies with LGU counts. Under the data reconciliation of the DOH, starting from July 15, mild cases and asymptomatic cases will be recorded as recovered after 14 days from swab collection for testing. The first set of "mass recovery" was recorded on July 30 with 37,180 recoveries. From July 30, recovery reconciliations will be reported every 15 days. \c\cOn August 2, the Philippines surpassed the 100,000 cases mark as the country continues to report around 2,000–3,000 cases a day. The country eventually had the most COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia when it finally breached Indonesia's total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. \c\cA modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was placed in Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal from August 4 to 18 as a response to the petition of medical front liners requesting an ECQ in Metro Manila. \c\cIn early August, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) became involved in a corruption scandal, and its executives were alleged to have used the pandemic as a cover-up to steal billions of pesos. \c\cThe Philippine Genome Center (PGC) had detected a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus originating in the Philippines. The new variant is said to be globally dominant variant than other variants of the virus at the time of detection and has been associated with the sudden increase of new cases in July. \c\cBy August 18, the DOH has identified 1,302 COVID-19 clusters throughout the country with the majority being located in Metro Manila. \c\cOn September 11, President Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act into law. President Duterte then extended the period of the state of calamity until September 2021, through his Proclamation No. 1021 filed on September 18. \c\cThe IATF-EID also announced on September 18 that all cemeteries, columbariums, and memorial parks nationwide will be closed from October 29 to November 4 to prevent social gatherings traditionally conducted as part of the All Saints\' Day observance. This is similar to the proposal made by Metro Manila mayors few days prior. \c\cCOVID-19 has spread to all provinces in the Philippines by September 28, when Batanes recorded its first case. \c\cIn mid-December, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 known as Lineage B.1.1.7 was identified in the United Kingdom and is reportedly more contagious than earlier variants of the virus. This has led to several countries to restrict or ban travel from the United Kingdom, including the Philippines. The Philippines also banned travel from 19 other nations which has reported cases of more-infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2. \c\cThe DOH announced in a briefing held in January 2021 that the U.K. variant is already in the Philippines as early as December 2020. One of the samples collected by the health department on December 10 tested positive for the variant on January 21, 2021. \c\cBy January 2021, the DOH is already monitoring at least two other noted mutations aside from the U.K. variant, namely the 501.V2 variant which originated from South Africa and another variant from Malaysia. \c\cOn January 5, 2021, Hong Kong reported that they detected the U.K. variant from a 30-year-old woman who arrived in the city from the Philippines on December 22, 2020, raising concerns that the strain may already be in the Philippines. The following day, a joint DOH–PGC study said that it has not detected the U.K. variant among 305 samples collected from November to December hospital admissions involving inbound travellers who have tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in the country. \c\cEpidemiologist John Wong, who is part of DOH's technical advisory working group, said in a press briefing on January 6 that if Lineage B.1.1.7 establishes itself in the Philippines, the total number of cases could rise about fifteen-fold. Wong provided two scenarios which assumed there are 20,000 cases at the beginning of the month. In the first scenario, COVID-19 has a r rate of 1.1 and the U.K. variant does not reach the Philippines which project an increase of cases to 32,000 by the end of the month. In the second scenario where Lineage B.1.1.7 does indeed establish itself in the country, the projected rise of cases could go as high as 300,000 in the same time period. \c\cOn January 13, the DOH announced that the U.K. variant has been detected in the country when a 29-year-old man from Quezon City, who arrived in the country from the United Arab Emirates on January 7, tested positive for COVID-19. 13 individuals who came in contact with the man also tested positive for COVID-19 days later. On January 22, 16 new cases associated with the U.K. variant has been confirmed in several places in country including Benguet, Laguna, and Mountain Province. A case each in Benguet and Laguna had no known contact with a confirmed case or a travel history outside the country. \c\cThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to the Pfizer–BioNTech and the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines on January 14 and 28, respectively. \c\cOn February 18, the DOH in Central Visayas announced that two mutations of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Cebu. The mutations were classified as "mutations under investigation" and were tagged as E484K and N501Y. \c\cThe DOH announced the detection of the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Pasay on March 2. On March 12, Lineage P.1, commonly known as the Brazilian variant, was detected in the country, along with a "unique" variant originating from the Philippines which was designated as the P.3 variant, which in turn related to the aforementioned variant. Japan also detected the P.3 variant on a man who traveled from the Philippines. \c\cAs a response to the recent spike in cases, the Greater Manila Area, which the government called "NCR Plus", was placed under general community quarantine (GCQ) on March 22 and was originally set to expire on April 4. It was further intensified to the stricter enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) from March 29 to April 11, when the positivity rate of the area remained high. \c\cOn March 17, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that there have been at least 27,967 deaths caused by, or associated with, COVID-19 by the end of 2020. 19,758 of these were tagged "COVID-19 virus not identified", while 8,209 were tagged "COVID-19 virus identified". The discrepancy between the tallies of the DOH and the PSA is due to the inclusion of probable and suspect cases in the PSA's tally. On April 26, the country surpassed 1 million cases. \c\cOn May 11, the country detected its first two cases of Delta variant from India. The variant had been confirmed in two Filipino seafarers who returned in April. While the infections on Metro Manila is slowing down, COVID-19 infections is surging on other regions. Mindanao accounted for a quarter of new cases, higher than Metro Manila, showing that the pandemic has shifted to the regions far outside of the metropolitan areas. A former mayor and his brother from a nearby town were also admitted at a government hospital in the same city, as dozens of people were being treated for coronavirus outside in makeshift tents, or hooked up to oxygen tanks while sitting in their vehicles, due to the lack of hospital beds. \c\cAs COVID-19 surges in Indonesia, the Philippines banned travels from Indonesia amid Delta variant threat. Roque said travelers from Indonesia will be barred from entering the country from July 16 to July 31. \c\cOn July 16, the country detected 16 new cases of the highly-transmissible COVID-19 Delta variant, which has become the dominant variant in several countries. Of these, 11 are local cases. In a press briefing, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that 15 of the new detected cases had recovered while another died. Of these, 10 are females aged 14 to 79. Due to rising cases and local transmission of the Delta variant, Metro Manila, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Davao de Oro, and Davao del Norte were placed under general community quarantine with heightened restrictions starting on July 23. \c\cOn July 29, the Department of Health (DOH) detected 97 new cases of Delta variant bringing the total number of Delta variant cases to 216. Of the newly reported cases, 88 were local cases, six are returning overseas Filipinos, while three other cases are still under verification. \c\cOn July 30, the government placed Metro Manila under Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) starting August 6 until August 20 due to rising cases of Delta variant. \c\cOn August 5, the DOH detected 116 new cases of Delta variant bringing the total number of cases to 331. Of the additional Delta variant cases, 95 were local cases, one is a Returning Overseas Filipino (ROF) while the remaining 20 cases are being verified if they are local or ROF cses. The DOH said that among the 216 Delta variant cases reported last July 29, one case was verified to have been tested in two different laboratories so the DOH amended the previous total Delta variant cases from 216 to 215. \c\cOn the same day, President Rodrigo Duterte approved the recommendation of the IATF to place some provinces under ECQ and MECQ. Laguna, Cagayan de Oro, and Iloilo City will be under ECQ from August 6 to 15, while Lucena and the provinces of Cavite, Rizal, and Iloilo will be placed under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ). Batangas and Quezon, on the other hand, will be under general community quarantine (GCQ) with heightened restrictions from August 6 to 15. \c\cOn August 15, the DOH detected the country's first case of the Lambda variant. The patient is a 35-year-old female and is currently being validated as to whether she is a local or returning overseas Filipino case. The DOH said the patient was asymptomatic and tagged as recovered after undergoing the 10-day isolation period. Meanwhile, the DOH also detected 182 new cases of the Delta variant, as well as 41 new cases of the Alpha variant, 66 new cases of the Beta variant and 40 new cases of the Theta variant. Of the newly reported cases of the Delta variant, 112 cases are local, 36 are returning overseas Filipinos, and 34 are still undergoing verification. Among the 41 new Alpha cases, 38 are local, one is an ROF, and two are still being verified. Out of the 66 additional Beta cases, 56 are local and 10 cases are still undergoing verification. Among the 40 new Theta variant cases, 37 are local cases and three cases are still being verified. \c\cOn August 19, the IATF-EID approved to place Metro Manila and the province of Laguna under MECQ from August 21 to 31. \c\cThe World Health Organization released a statement on August 28, that the Delta variant is already the dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the Philippines. \c\cOn September 1, the COVID-19 cases in the country surpassed 2 million. \c\cOn September 3, the Philippines Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the emergency use of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for minors aged 12 to 17. \c\cThe alert level system (ALS) was introduced by the government with pilot implementation of the system in Metro Manila beginning on September 16, 2021. The IATF intends to phase out the old quarantine system, which still remains in use outside Metro Manila pending the nationwide adoption of the ALS. The coverage of the ALS was expanded to include LGUs in Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and Davao regions on October 20, 2021. \c\cOn October 25, the DOH confirmed the presence of the B.1.1.318 variant in the country with one case reported. Along with the detection of the B.1.1.318 variant, the DOH also detected 380 more cases of the Delta variant, as well as 104 cases of Alpha variant, and 166 cases of Beta variant. \c\cThe vaccination of minors under the Philippine national vaccination also began within the month. \c\cOn November 8, the country detected its first ever case of the B.1.617.1 variant, formerly called Kappa variant. The patient is a 32-year-old male from Floridablanca, Pampanga who experienced a mild case and has since recovered. The alert level system's nationwide adoption was completely realized on November 22. \c\cThe DOH has issued a reminder, that Level 2 and 3 hospitals cannot deny admittance of people suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and refusal of admission is a "violation of the signed Performance Commitment and shall be dealt with by the PhilHealth accordingly". The department said that Level 2 and 3 hospitals can accommodate individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms while individuals in a serious or critical condition may be transferred to one of the DOH's three main referral hospitals, which was increased over time to 75 designated hospitals as of April 13 with a combined bed capacity of 3,194. \c\cOn March 16, 2020, the DOH announced a revision on their protocol on hospital admission for COVID-19 positive patients. A week prior, the DOH began sending both asymptomatic patients and individuals with mild symptoms back to their homes for quarantine and continued health monitoring until they have been deemed recovered. Priority was given to high-risk patients or those with severe symptoms for hospital admission. \c\cIn mid-2021, the city of Makati initiated a program to aim to treat mild cases at home, to reduce pressure on hospitals. \c\cThe Philippines, with at least 45 other countries, joined the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Solidarity trial to study the effectivity of certain drugs in treating COVID-19 patients. Dr. Marissa Alejandria of the Philippine Society of Microbiology and Infectious Disease is the Philippines\' representative in the study with Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire as the official liaison of the DOH in the multinational study. \c\cThe Department of Science and Technology (DOST) announced that it is seeking bilateral collaboration with other countries such as China, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom on endeavors related to the vaccine development for COVID-19. President Rodrigo Duterte declared a bounty for anyone who could produce a vaccine against COVID-19, an amount later increased to ₱50 million (around $1 million). \c\cThe Philippine Council on Health Research and Development at the DOST plans to distribute an undisclosed "functional food," while Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque also revealed that the DOST, Philippine General Hospital, and the Ateneo de Manila University, are collaborating with the Duke–NUS Medical School in Singapore to evaluate the feasibility of lauric acid from virgin coconut oil, Vitex negundo (known locally as Lagundi), and Euphorbia hirta (known locally as Tawa-tawa) as a "dietary regimen supplement" to help COVID-19 patients combat the disease. A "functional food" or "dietary regimen supplement" is described as similar to how tawa-tawa is also used as a remedy against dengue by incorporating it to the diet of diagnosed patients. \c\cThe Philippine government has been negotiating with various foreign vaccine manufacturers to secure the country's COVID-19 vaccine supply. These manufacturers include Sinovac Biotech (China), Gamaleya Research Institute (Russia), Moderna (United States), and Pfizer (United States). The private sector, with government sanction, has secured at least 2.6 million vaccine doses from British-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca. Negotiations are also ongoing with American firm Novavax which would supply at least 10 million doses from the Serum Institute of India. The country is projected to at least 164 million doses from various manufacturers in 2021. \c\cThe procurement efforts of the national government has been a subject of various controversies. Health Secretary Francisco Duque has been alleged to "dropped the ball" in a deal with Pfizer vaccine deal which could have secured 10 million doses by as early as January 2021. Plans to secure 26 million doses from China's Sinovac has also been put into scrutiny in the Congress due to its reported efficacy rate. Late stage trials of Sinovac's vaccine  in Brazil reported an efficacy rate of only 50 percent. There were concerns within the Senate that the reported 50-percent efficacy rate of Sinovac's vaccine would not garner public trust and would be a waste of government funds. The Department of Health said that Sinovac's vaccine satisfy the World Health Organization standards of at least 50 percent efficacy rate while the FDA pointed out that Sinovac is yet to publish an official and published scientific report on their vaccines efficacy rate and that the clinical trial for the vaccine is conducted in different countries and the efficacy rate per country will vary; as low as 50 percent in Brazil and as high as above 90 percent in Turkey. \c\cOn December 2, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed an executive order allowing the Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency-use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Under certain conditions, vaccines and drugs could be approved within a month instead of undergoing the usual six-month review process. Among the conditions is for a vaccine manufacturer to obtain prior EUA in its country of origin or other countries with a "mature" regulator. The FDA announced that three vaccine manufactures namely Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have inquired on the process of obtaining an EUA in the Philippines. On December 23, Pfizer has applied for an EUA for its vaccine. \c\cDuterte also said in December 2020 that some members of the military already received COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese manufacturer, Sinopharm despite the vaccine not yet officially approved by the country's health authorities. A few days later, it was reported that some members of the Presidential Security Group had also received vaccine from unknown manufacturer. \c\cEarly COVID-19 testing in the Philippines was limited to persons with a history of travel to countries with cases of local transmission and those with exposure to individuals confirmed to have COVID-19. The testing protocols were revised sometime in mid-March 2020 to give priority to the testing of any individual with severe symptoms as well as to the elderly, pregnant and immunocompromised persons with at least mild symptoms. On March 30, symptomatic healthcare workers were also considered priority for testing. \c\cDuring his press briefing on May 19, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said that the government's "expanded targeted testing" would target the following: "(1) all symptomatic cases, (2) all of those coming from abroad, (3) all close contacts of confirmed cases that were found through contact tracing, and (4) all of those who tested positive on rapid antibody tests." The government is also opting to test through benchmarks, by testing 1–2% of the Philippines\' entire population and 10–12% of the worst affected region in the country, which is Metro Manila. \c\cIn late March 2020, some politicians and their relatives were reportedly tested for the disease despite not showing any symptoms, causing public backlash amidst a shortage of testing kits since it was against DOH guidelines to test asymptomatic individuals. The DOH responded to the public criticism by clarifying that, while there is "no policy for VIP treatment" with regard to testing for COVID-19 and that "all specimens are being processed on a first-in, first-out basis," it "extends courtesy" to front line government officials, specifically those involved in national security and public health. Some senators who were tested claim that they used rapid antibody tests not accredited by the DOH at that time. \c\cOn January 24, 2021, after receiving a go-signal from the national government, the Philippine Red Cross announced that they will start conducting COVID-19 tests using saliva samples on January 25. \c\cIn July 2020, there were currently 85 testing laboratories nationwide with 25,000 tests conducted daily. The country has conducted over 3 million tests as of September 2020. \c\cOn March 9, 2020, a total of 2,000 tests has been conducted at a rate of 200 to 250 people accommodated by tests per day. The testing capacity of the Philippine government has been expanded by late March 2020. As of March 23, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa alone can test 600 people per day, other laboratories except for the facility of San Lazaro Hospital, Manila, can do 100 tests, while the said hospital can do 50 tests per day. By March 27, the release of test results conducted at the RITM takes five to seven days due to backlog, but the institute is committed to reducing the turnaround to two to three days. The DOH announced that the country will conduct targeted mass testing on April 14, which will be administered strictly for susceptible, probable, and high-risk patients, such as health workers, expectant mothers, and patients with other medical conditions. The country's testing continuously increased, except when RITM temporarily scaled down its operations from April 20–24 after 43 of its staffs tested positive for the virus. \c\cThe Philippines has the capability to conduct mass testing, either through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or rapid antibody testing, given the increased number and improving capacity of the country's accredited laboratories and the procurement of more testing kits. The first localized targeted mass testing began in Valenzuela, Metro Manila on April 11. Other local government units followed suit shortly after the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) adopted a resolution that commences \'a national government-enabled, local government unit-led, and people-centered response\' to COVID-19. \c\cThe Food and Drug Administration has approved the usage of 75 PCR test kits (including one locally developed kit), 79 rapid antibody testing kits, 53 immunoassay testing kits, and 7 other testing kits as of July 30. \c\cA locally developed PCR testing kit has been made by the National Institutes of Health at the University of the Philippines Manila. It is reportedly six times cheaper than its foreign counterparts. It was first approved for commercial use in April 2020 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but some kits were recalled in May by its manufacturer, after it was found out that testing using the kits yields indeterminate results 30 percent at the time. A month later, the testing kit were re-approved after its defects were fixed. \c\cBefore January 30, there were no medical facilities in the country that can confirm cases of the virus. Before that date, the RITM conducted preliminary tests on suspected cases to determine if they are infected with a coronavirus but could not detect the new strain on patients. Samples from suspected cases with confirmed coronavirus infection had to be sent abroad to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, for confirmatory testing specifically for SARS-CoV-2. \c\cThe National Task Force for COVID-19 created the Task Force T3 (Test, Trace, and Treat) to establish public-private partnerships that would conduct mass testings. The task force cited the San Miguel Corporation as a pioneer in the move to open its COVID-19 testing laboratory to initially test all of its 70,000 employees. As of August 24, the country has 110 subnational laboratories capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2. \c\cFrom May 29 to June 17, 2020, the DOH had included testing backlogs on their daily case bulletin. These backlogs were referred to as "late cases" and were validated by the DOH's Epidemiology Bureau after more than four days of the release of test results. Late cases were reported alongside new cases or "fresh cases", which corresponded to the cases that were validated three days within the release of test results. This change was implemented by the health department to clarify the sudden increase of cases in the country. The then-largest single-day increase on the number of confirmed cases in the country has been accounted to the backlog in late June 2020, when 2,434 new cases were announced. 1,147 out of these cases were fresh cases and the remaining 1,287 were late cases. It surpassed the backlog in late May 2020, where 1,000 out of 1,046 cases were reported to be late cases. \c\cThe national government declared a state of calamity over all of the Philippines on March 16, 2020, by virtue of Proclamation No. 929 signed by President Rodrigo Duterte. The declaration brings into effect for six months the following:\c\cprice control of basic needs and commodities,\c\cgranting interest-free loans,\c\cdistribution of calamity funds,\c\cauthorization of importation and receipt of donations, and\c\chazard allowance for public health workers and government personnel in the fields of science and technology. \c\cFollowing the sharp increase of confirmed cases, President Duterte called on Congress to hold special sessions on March 23 to enact the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act upon his request, which would authorize Duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a budget of almost ₱275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the estimated ₱438 billion ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic. \c\cIn the House of Representatives, the bill was introduced as House Bill No. 6616 with House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of Pateros–Taguig as its principal sponsor and was defended on the floor by Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte of Camarines Sur's 2nd district. In the Senate of the Philippines, the bill was introduced as Senate Bill No. 1418 with Senate President Tito Sotto and Senator Pia Cayetano as its principal sponsors. \c\cThe House version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in a 284–9 vote without abstentions, while its Senate version unanimously passed the Senate. President Duterte signed the bill into law on March 25. The law was effective for three months until June 25, owing to its sunset provision. \c\cA legislation was proposed to replace the Bayanihan Act, dubbed as the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act or Bayanihan 2. On August 20, the bicameral committee approved a reconciled version of the bill. It was signed into law by Duterte on September 11. \c\cThe government has implemented varying levels of lockdown and/or stay-at-home orders across all the country's local government units (LGUs) characterized as "community quarantines". The strictest of these measures is designated as enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). Restrictions were imposed on various aspects of society such as mass public transportation, mass gathering, and operation of businesses.[citation needed]\c\cIn September 2021 the alert level system (ALS) was introduced by the government with pilot implementation of the system in Metro Manila beginning on September 16, 2021. The ALS is intended to replace the old quarantine system, which still remains in use outside Metro Manila pending the nationwide adoption of the ALS. Measures in a certain area will depend on the prevailing alert level. The ALS has five tiers with alert level 1 being the most lenient and alert level 5 being the most stringent. The coverage of the ALS was expanded to include LGUs in Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and Davao regions on October 20, 2021. By November 22, the ALS was already adopted for all LGUs. \c\cTravel of foreign nationals to the Philippines is banned with few exceptions since March 2020. The issuance of visas to all foreign national on March 19 was stopped and all visas already issued are voided except to those issued to families of Filipino nationals would remain valid. Three days later a travel ban was imposed on all foreign nationals, except spouses of Filipino citizens (and their children), and workers for international organizations and non-governmental organizations accredited in the country. \c\cThe government of China and the United States has pledged support to the Philippine government response against COVID-19. China announced that it would be donating medical supplies including 100,000 testing kits, 100,000 surgical masks, 10,000 N95 masks, and 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment. The United States Agency for International Development also pledged $2.7 million worth of aid to help the Philippines develop adequate testing capabilities, and ensure the availability of medical supplies through the agency's "on-the-ground partners". China's aid was received on March 21, 2020. \c\cOn March 22, 2020, the DFA said that the Philippines would be receiving a donation from Singapore consisting of 3,000 testing kits and a polymerase chain reaction machine. In early April 2020, the DFA announced it received 20 units of testing kits, capable of 1,000 tests, from Brunei. The United Arab Emirates also donated medical supplies in May 2020. \c\cOn March 28, 2020, it was disclosed that some of the test kits made in China were only 40% accurate in testing for signs of the COVID-19 on an individual suspected to be infected with the disease. The test kits were donated by a private foundation. \c\cOn July 20, 2021, it was reported that the United States delivered a total of 3,240,850 one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccines to the Philippines as part of its worldwide effort to help end COVID-19. This is the first time the Philippines has received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine – a safe, trusted and easy-to-store shot widely used in the US. Prior to the US delivery of the Johnson & Johnson vaccines, the Philippines has received more than seven million vaccine doses through the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, a global initiative run by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to support equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. To date, total US government COVID-19 assistance to the Philippines amounts to over P1.38 billion ($27.5 million). \c\cThe National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) revised its economic growth outlook for the Philippines in 2020 from a 6.5% to 7.5% gross domestic product (GDP) growth registered in late 2019 to a 5.5% to 6.5% GDP growth, following the pandemic. The NEDA cited the decline in service exports, especially tourism. Moody's Analytics also reduced their GDP growth outlook for the country, from 5.9% in 2019 to 4.9% following the pandemic. Meanwhile, Nomura gave a bitter prediction of 1.6%, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave an almost flat growth of 0.6% for this year before rebounding to 7.6% in 2021. \c\cBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno and then-NEDA Director-General Ernesto Pernia forecast that the Philippine economy would likely enter a recession in 2020 due to the effect of the pandemic. Diokno stated that, although the first quarter is likely to grow by 3% since the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine only took effect near the end of the quarter, the second and third quarters would likely experience contractions in economic growth. \c\cThe Philippines\' real GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020, the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 1998, a year after the Asian financial crisis. The Philippines entered a technical recession, after the country's GDP contracted in by 16.5 percent in the second quarter. The country's GDP continued to contract in the following quarter periods. \c\cThe Philippines\' GDP saw its worst contraction since World War II posting a growth of −9.5% for 2020 according to the Philippine Statistics Authority records from 1947. The last full-year contraction was in 1998 amidst the Asian financial crisis where the GDP grew by −0.5%. The 2020 contraction was also worse than the – 7% contraction in 1984. \c\cThe Philippine economy exited recesssion in the second quarter of 2021, posting a GDP growth of 11.8%. \c\cIn terms of the amount of economic loss that the Philippines is projected to suffer, NEDA gave a value of up to ₱2.0 trillion, or equivalent to about 9.4% of 2020 nominal GDP, while the Philippine Institute for Development Studies estimates at a maximum of ₱2.5 trillion. International organizations also gave their predictions, with the Friedrich Naumann Foundation envisioning a ₱273-billion loss and the Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières envisioning a combined loss of more than ₱1 trillion just in the month of April. \c\cThe pandemic also affected the goal of the Philippines to be among the countries with upper-middle-income country status by nominal GNI per capita. Before his resignation, Pernia said that the country will still achieve this goal by 2020, while his replacement, acting NEDA Director-General Karl Kendrick Chua, said in May 2020 that this goal will be achieved in 2022. Daniel Ross of Bloomberg also stated that the Philippines, which is "an economic star poised to outpace long-time regional winners such as China, Indonesia and India," will face hindrances amid the COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cOn the other hand, the BSP recorded an inflation rate of 2.2% in April and 2.5% in March 2020 from 2.6% in February and 2.9% in January. The average rate of 2.6% for the period of January to April 2020 is also 1% lower compared to the inflation rate from the same period in the previous year. The event was primarily and hugely caused by lower oil prices and transportation costs, even if the prices of food supplies and alcoholic beverages and tobacco slightly rose. \c\cOn March 9, 2020, the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) index lost 457.77 points or 6.76%, its steepest decline since the financial crisis of 2007–08. The following day, shares plunged by 6.23% to ₱5,957.35 (US$117.54), settling below the 6,000 level benchmark and entering the bear market territory. The mining and oil industries were the most affected with a 9.05% drop, followed by holding companies with a 6.93% drop. The PSE's circuit breaker mechanism was invoked for the second time since the measure's introduction in 2008 halting trade for 15 minutes. \c\cEconomist Bernardo Villegas noted that pandemic has created a situation where the Philippine government "is getting overborrowed," and that the Philippines needs more foreign direct investments in order to fund capital-intensive industries, including telecommunications and media. \c\cIn terms of unemployment rate, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) records an estimated unemployment rate of 5.3% in January 2020, which is the same with January 2019. Moody's Analytics puts its estimate at 5.3% for the first quarter of 2020, while Nomura expects 7.5% for Q1 and a 13-year high of 8% in Q2 of this year. Meanwhile, the IMF stated that the unemployment rate in the country would be 6.2% for this year compared to 5.1% in 2019. A higher rate of 6.8% for this year was also predicted by S&P Global Ratings. \c\cThe Trade Union Congress of the Philippines estimated that around 7,000 people may lose jobs within the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic. Economists from the Ateneo de Manila University estimated that 57% of the country's workforce may be displaced within the end of the first quarter of 2020. It comprises around 15 million workers in Luzon that were laid off due to the enhanced community quarantine, around four million of whom are based in Metro Manila, as well as an estimated 4.3 million workers in Visayas and another 4.3 million in Mindanao that were laid off due to quarantine restrictions. \c\cIn March, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) stated that 1.05 million workers were displaced due to the pandemic, even after they released guidelines for employers in handling the impact of COVID-19. \c\cPhilippine aviation services were heavily affected after travel, both locally and internationally, was restricted to contain the spread of the virus. \c\cSome German businesses that are based in the country also reported to reduce investments in the country, but will continue to maintain their employees. \c\cIn early 2021, there were reports that some employers are requiring its workers to get vaccinated before allowing them to physically report for work, with some workers threatened to be placed on floating status if they are not able to comply. DOLE released a statement that such practice is illegal and workers should be only vaccinated on a voluntary basis. \c\cThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted female employment, but the Philippines\' past efforts to reduce gender inequalities mitigated the negative impact of female employment and educational opportunities. \c\cFollowing directives from the Philippine government, several fast food and restaurant chains suspended dine-in services and restricted operations to take-out and delivery. Online food ordering services such as GrabFood and Foodpanda temporarily halted during the enhanced community quarantine but eventually resumed operations in Luzon during the quarantine period. \c\cSeveral restaurants and coffee shops across the country offered free food and beverages to front line professionals involved in the pandemic, especially health care workers. \c\cFood production and distribution slowed down during the pandemic, especially in Luzon, primarily due to the lack of financial assistance and inaccessibility of transportation resulting from community quarantine measures being implemented across numerous local governments. The delivery of fresh vegetables from the province of Benguet, which supplies the country with over 80 percent of the country's highland vegetable requirements, was halted due to the implementation of an "extreme enhanced" community quarantine in La Trinidad. Local government officials advised local rice farmers to sell their harvests to them, assuring them that they would help distribute it to their respective communities amid the border restrictions. \c\cOn March 27, Vietnam announced that it would reduce its production and exportation of rice due to food security amid the pandemic. The Philippines, the largest importer of rice in the world, imports 25% of its rice from Vietnam. Agriculture Secretary William Dar assured that there would be "no shortage of the staple during the duration of the enhanced community quarantine and beyond" as "harvest [is] already coming in." Dar also stated the Department of Agriculture's plans to initiate early planting in the Cagayan Valley and Central Luzon, two of the largest rice producers in the country, ahead of the third quarter of 2020. \c\cProduction of canned fish in the country was adversely affected with Zamboanga City, which accounts for 85% of the country's canned fish industry, announcing it would reduce the production of canned fish in the Philippines by 50–60% due to difficulties encountered following the implementation of a city-wide lockdown. \c\cThe Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) ordered the suspension of all gaming operations in the country, including the land-based casinos in Entertainment City and Newport City, on March 15. The gaming regulator also announced that they were limiting the operations of Philippine offshore gaming operations in the region. \c\cIllegal gambling activities conducted online, including online cockfighting or e-sabong, through social media has proliferated amidst the pandemic. PAGCOR has aimed to regulate online cockfighting, as part of efforts to expand the source of funds for the government. \c\cA shortage of medical masks was reported in various parts of the country due to concerns over the pandemic. RITM director Celia Carlos urged the public against hoarding masks to ensure ample supply for medical workers directly dealing with patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), in cooperation with the Philippine National Police, are acting against reports of traders hoarding face masks and selling said item at an overpriced rate. The DTI has also directed its Philippine International Trading Corp. to import 5 million masks from overseas. Medtecs International Corp. Ltd., the sole manufacturer of medical mask in the country, has committed to supply the government through the DTI. However, due of the Philippine procurement law, local manufacturers are having difficulty competing with foreign suppliers that have a lower cost but may have substandard quality. \c\cDoctors in the Philippines have deplored the shortages in personal protective equipment amid the pandemic, and was even cited as the cause of high infection rate and death rate of healthcare workers in the country. To address this issue, the Philippine government continues to procure and stockpile such equipment, as the pandemic is expected to last until 2021. \c\cAccording to Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire, the country also issued requests for ventilators and respirators that will be used for severe or critical COVID-19 patients, as there are reported shortages of these equipment. \c\cAccording to the Philippine Retailers Association, the "total retail environment" saw a decline of 30–50%. SM Investments, the country's largest retailer, saw a decline of 10–20% in domestic sales. Despite the decline, most retail stores that provide essential services, including supermarkets, convenience stores, hardware stores, and pharmacies, remained open across the country to sustain consumers while other establishments at malls closed down. Such retail stores, however, imposed strict social distancing measures with some supermarkets only allowing 50 customers inside at a time and placing stickers on the floor to indicate that customers must stand one meter apart from each other. Stores were also regularly disinfected and customers were required to undergo a temperature check before entering. In the Greater Manila Area, several online grocers continued to operate, but with limited delivery slots. After most industries in the country being closed for two months, many stores in the retail sector are already allowed to open under revised guidelines of eased community quarantines. \c\cPanic buying and hoarding became rampant across the country, especially with essential goods such as food and sanitation products. The Philippine Amalgamated Supermarkets Association reported that the purchases of masks, alcohol, and other personal hygiene products in supermarkets across the country had already surged, urging the public against panic buying. \c\cEconomic think-tank Fitch Solutions forecasts that the consumer and retail sector, especially non-essential businesses, would be one of the hardest-hit sectors in the Philippines as it loses sales revenue for an entire month due to the Luzon enhanced community quarantine (Luzon accounts for 73% of the country's GDP). Fitch Solutions forecasts the household final consumption expenditure for the country in 2020 to expand by 6.7% year-over-year, which was adjusted from a "pre-coronavirus projection" for 2020 of 7% growth year-over-year. \c\cMall operators across the country, such as Ayala, Megaworld, SM, Robinsons, and Vista, initially shortened the operating hours of its malls to comply with government quarantine measures. While doing so, malls were asked to implement social distancing measures; for example, several malls implemented a "single-seat gap" policy in cinemas, in which moviegoers were required to sit one seat apart from each other. However, most malls in the country have since limited its operations to establishments providing essential services, particularly groceries, banks, and hardware stores. \c\cLocal airlines AirAsia, Philippine Airlines, and Cebu Pacific suspended flights in response to the imposition of travel bans by the Philippine government and some foreign governments. The airlines have suspended flights as early as February 2, 2020, covering routes involving destinations in China, Hong Kong, and Macau. At least Philippine Airlines has suspended all of its flights by March 2020, although the airline has announced plans to resume selected flights by June 1, 2020. \c\cThe 2020 census of population and housing in the Philippines was originally scheduled in May but was postponed indefinitely due to the increasing number of cases in the country. As the quarantine measures began to ease, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) started to conduct the census in September, despite the risk of spreading the virus. \c\cSuspension of classes began as early as March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 16, the Department of Education (DepEd) issued guidelines prohibiting public schools in areas with suspended classes from administering the final examinations of students and instead compute the students\' final grades for the 2019–20 academic year based on "their current academic standing." and directed schools in other areas to administer final examinations within that week on a "staggered basis" and for teachers and students to observe social distancing measures. \c\cSome universities resorted to implementing online learning alternatives. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) also advised institutions of higher education to implement distance education methods of learning for its classes, such as the use of educational technology, to maximize the academic term despite the suspensions; However, following the announcement of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and other areas, colleges and universities suspended mandatory online classes in consideration of the welfare of its students, faculty, and staff. Academic administration offices continued to operate with a skeleton crew, while other offices in colleges and universities operated through telecommuting arrangements. Some schools, however, continued to hold online classes, and in response, several student groups appealed to CHED to suspend mandatory online classes in consideration of the logistical limitations and well-being of a majority of students. \c\cLive classes in all levels across the country were eventually suspended due to the pandemic. Graduation rites in Philippine schools were also either canceled, postponed, or held virtually. \c\cThe procedure for automatic class suspensions in connection to the typhoon warning signals by PAGASA remained in effect even as classes were held in distance learning setup. \c\cThe official start of classes for the 2020–21 school year could only be legally set as late as the last day of August. However, Republic Act No. 11480 was signed into law to allow the start of classes to be set beyond August. The Department of Education has moved the opening of classes to October 5, 2020. Earlier in June, officials reported that schools will not open until a vaccine is available, though remote learning should resume at the end of August. A group of UP experts has proposed the start of classes to be pushed back to December in order to limit the spread of the disease. \c\cCHED left the decision of starting semesters to college administrators, although urged them to shift into the new semestral calendar and start \'flexible classes\' in August and face-to-face classes in September as well. Certain measures have been proposed to be implemented during the opening of classes, such as the airing of lectures on television and radio, a "mandatory face mask policy," maintaining physical distancing, and limiting class sizes. \c\cAccording to the UNICEF, the Philippines is among the last countries to re-allow the conduct of face-to-face classes with the only other country to yet allow live classes being Venezuela as of September 2021. On November 5, 2021, CHED allowed colleges to conduct face-to-face classes at 50 percent capacity in campuses in localities under alert level 2 under certain conditions, such as a high vaccination rate among students and faculty and classrooms retrofitted. The DepEd will also be conducting a pilot run of face-to-face classes in 100 public schools starting November 15, 2021. Also the DepEd will be conducting a pilot run of face-to-face classes in 20 private schools starting November 22, 2021. \c\cThe NEDA reported that the coronavirus pandemic would incur a ₱22.7 billion ($448 million) monthly loss of tourism revenue for the Philippines and the impact of the pandemic could last around five to six months based from past experiences from the SARS, H1N1, and the MERS outbreaks. Over 5,200 flights covering two months, which was to be serviced by member airlines of the Air-Carriers Association of the Philippines, were canceled. Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank predicts a ₱111 billion ($2.2 billion) loss in the tourism sector, while the Tourism Congress of the Philippines estimates the figures at around ₱20 billion ($395 million), considering that 12.7% of the Philippines\' GDP is generated through tourism. Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières also reported potential damage in Philippine tourism. \c\cThe National Museum of the Philippines temporarily closed its complex in Manila and all branch museums throughout the country. \c\cThe Philippine Shopping Festival, a nationwide mall sale event backed by the Department of Tourism originally scheduled on March 1–31, 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several local festivals across the country were also either canceled or postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cThe impact of COVID-19 in prisons in the Philippines is projected to be "dangerous," since its jails have the highest occupancy rate in the world that stands at 534%. The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology has temporarily suspended the acceptance of visitors in prisons it manages as early as March 2020, encouraging would-be visitors to avail the e-dalaw service which would allow inmates to communicate with relatives online. \c\cCertain human rights groups raised their concerns on the issue. Human Rights Watch flagged the cases of dying inmates in prison cells and called for the freedom of minor offenders, the elderly, and the ill. Karapatan and KAPATID both called for the release of political prisoners that belongs to vulnerable sector as a way to decongest Philippine jails amidst COVID-19 pandemic. \c\cA group of 22 high-risk prisoners (either of old age, immunocompromised, or pregnant) also asked for temporary liberty due to \'humanitarian grounds\' since "hellish prison conditions in the Philippines make the detainees vulnerable to COVID-19." All of the 22 prisoners, five of which are consultants of New Peoples\' Army (NPA), are asking to be allowed to post bail or to be released under personal recognizance. They are represented by Public Interest Law Center (PILC) and the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL). Similarly, one of the suspects in the death of Horacio "Atio" Castillo III pleaded for freedom under the guise of the COVID-19's threat. \c\cIn mid-April, the Supreme Court (SC) reiterated its 2014 circular, which allows the temporary freedom of "persons deprived of liberty" who were able to serve their minimum penalty during an ongoing trial or those whose trial are paused due to lack of witnesses. Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta and Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra also signed resolutions that relaxes bail prices for indigent inmates and requirements to avail parole and executive clemency. On May 2, Associate Justice Mario Victor Leonen announced that there were 9,731 detainees released temporarily by the SC from March 17 to April 29 as a way to alleviate the country's overcrowding prisons. \c\cThe DOH issued an advisory for the cancellation of large public events and mass gatherings, such as concerts, until further notice to minimize the risk of spreading the disease. This prompted several local and international artists to either cancel or postpone their scheduled concerts and fan meets. \c\cLocal television networks temporarily stopped admitting live audiences for their television shows, including variety shows Eat Bulaga! on GMA Network as well as It's Showtime and ASAP on ABS-CBN. On March 13, both ABS-CBN and GMA announced that they would suspend productions on their drama shows as well as other entertainment programs by March 15, replacing affected programs with reruns of previous series or extended newscast runs. \c\cBroadcast radio companies are also curtailing their operations during the quarantine period, either by shortening their broadcast hours and/or suspending regular programming in favor of "special broadcasts". \c\cThe Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines issued preventive guidelines against the pandemic through the Catholic Bishops\' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). In January 2020, the CBCP issued a liturgical guideline which urges Mass attendees to "practice ordinarily" the receiving of communion by hand, and avoid holding hands while praying the Lord's Prayer during Mass. As a spiritual measure against the spread of the disease, the CBCP also composed an oratio imperata (obligatory prayer) which is to be recited during Mass. In February 2020, the CBCP issued a second liturgical guideline in anticipation of the Lenten season. The bishops suggested that during Ash Wednesday, ashes would be sprinkled on the faithfuls\' head instead of the customary marking of the forehead with a cross to minimize body contact. The CBCP also urged people to refrain from kissing or touching the cross for veneration during Good Friday, particularly the celebration of the Passion of Jesus. They suggested genuflection or bowing as an alternative to the practice. Dioceses across the country have suspended the public celebration of Masses. On April 8, Holy Wednesday, the CBCP organized an interfaith prayer service against the spread of the coronavirus, which was televised nationwide. \c\cOther Christian denominations and organizations, such as the Iglesia ni Cristo and the Jehovah's Witnesses, have suspended live worship services and resorted to organizing worship services through online platforms. The Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches, an organization composed of Evangelical and Protestant church member organizations in the country, also adopted similar measures. \c\cThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints directed missionaries assigned in the Philippines who are not native to the country to move out for temporary reassignment to another country. They were ordered to self-quarantine in their new homes for 14 days. \c\cThe Islamic community in the Philippines has also adopted measures against COVID-19. The Regional Darul Ifta\' of Bangsamoro suspended all congregational prayers in the Bangsamoro region from March 19 to April 10. \c\cSeveral ongoing or scheduled seasons of sports leagues in the Philippines, such as the ASEAN Basketball League, Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League, Philippine Basketball Association, National Basketball League, Philippines Football League, and Philippine Super Liga, were suspended. Upcoming sporting competitions hosted by the country, specifically the Badminton Asia Championships (initially scheduled to be hosted in Wuhan but was moved to Manila) and the AFF Women's Championship, were postponed. Regional qualification games involving Philippine national teams were likewise postponed. \c\cOn April 29, 2020, the Philippine Sports Commission have announced that they will cancel all of their sporting events until December 2020 to comply with government directives that prohibit mass gathering events. This meant that the Palarong Pambansa in Marikina, the Philippine National Games, and the ASEAN Para Games were all cancelled. \c\cThe Commission on Elections has suspended the nationwide voter registration on March 10 until the end of the month due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The registration period began on January 20, 2020, and is scheduled to run until September 30, 2021. The suspension was later extended to last until the end of April. The issuance of voter's certification is also suspended until further notice. The next national elections scheduled in the Philippines are in May 2022. The plebiscite to ratify legislation that proposes the partition of Palawan into three smaller provinces scheduled for May 2020 was also delayed due to the pandemic. \c\cAfter the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged online regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and various other aspects of the disease. \c\cThe DOH has advised against spreading misinformation and unverified claims concerning the pandemic. The Philippine National Police on their part has taken action against the spread of misinformation related to the pandemic and has warned the public that misinformation purveyors could be charged for violating Presidential Decree no. 90 for "declaring local rumor, mongering and spreading false information". In the case of misinformation circulated online, violators could be charged for violating the Cybercrime Prevention Act which has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act also punishes fake news peddlers of two months jail time or fine of up to ₱1 million. \c\cThe DOH publishes official numbers through its daily case bulletins at 4:00 pm (PhST). \c\cIn the table below, the general lethality of COVID-19 in the Philippines is presently given around 1.6%, implying around 2 deaths and 98 potential survivors per 100 cases. To compare the three well-known coronavirus diseases, the case fatality rate of the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak was higher at 11%, while that of the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak was much higher at 36%.
Operation Barkhane is an ongoing anti-insurgent operation that started on August 1, 2014, and is led by the French military against Islamist groups in Africa's Sahel region. It consists of a roughly 5,000-strong French force, which is permanently headquartered in N’Djamena, the capital of Chad. The operation is led in co-operation with five countries, all of which are former French colonies that span the Sahel: Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. The countries are collectively referred to as the "G5 Sahel". \c\cThe operation is named after a crescent-shaped dune in the Sahara desert. \c\cThe French military initially intervened in Mali in early 2013 as part of Operation Serval, which successfully regained the northern half of the country from Islamist groups. Operation Barkhane is intended to follow up to that success and has expanded the French military's operations over a vast area of the Sahel region. The operation has the stated aim of helping the countries\' governments to maintain control of their territory and preventing the region from becoming a safe haven for Islamist terrorist groups that plan to attack France and Europe. \c\cFrench President Emmanuel Macron announced in June 2021 that the operation would soon end and French forces will pull-out in a phased manner, due to France's inability to work with the national governments in the Sahel region. He however added that French forces would remain in the region as part of a larger international mission. The operation was later scheduled to end by the first quarter of 2022. \c\cAs part of the fallout from the Libyan Civil War, instability in northern Mali caused by a Tuareg rebellion against the central Malian government was exploited by Islamist groups who gained control over the northern half of the country. In response, France launched a military operation in January 2013 to stop the Islamist offensive from toppling the Malian government and to re-capture northern Mali. The operation, codenamed Operation Serval, ended in the complete re-capture of all Islamist held territory by the operation's conclusion on the 15 July 2014. \c\cFollowing the end of Operation Serval, France recognised the need to provide stability in the wider Sahel region by helping the region's various governments combat terrorism. The former French Defense Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said that France recognised that “there still is a major risk that jihadists develop in the area that runs from the Horn of Africa to Guinea-Bissau.” Therefore, Operation Barkhane was launched in order to assure the Sahel nations\' security, and in effect France's security. The operation is the successor of Operation Serval, the French military mission in Mali, and Operation Epervier, the mission in Chad. \c\cThe operation aims "to become the French pillar of counterterrorism in the Sahel region."  According to French Defence Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, the main objective of Operation Barkhane is counter-terrorism: "The aim is to prevent what I call the highway of all forms of traffics to become a place of permanent passage, where jihadist groups between Libya and the Atlantic Ocean can rebuild themselves, which would lead to serious consequences for our security." The concept of \'partnership\' has been emphasised to explain the deployment of the French troops. The main objective of the French military intervention is the direct support of the G5 Sahel forces, through training and the introduction of new technologies and resources. \c\cFormer French President, François Hollande, has said the Barkhane force will allow for a "rapid and efficient intervention in the event of a crisis" in the region. \c\cThe operation will target Islamist extremists in Mali, Chad, and Niger, and will have a mandate to operate across borders. \c\cThe French force was initially a 3,000-strong counter-terrorism force, with 1,000 soldiers deployed indefinitely in Mali. These soldiers were to be focused on counter-terrorism operations in northern Mali, with another 1,200 soldiers stationed in Chad, and the remaining soldiers split between a surveillance base in Niger, a bigger permanent base in Ivory Coast, and some special forces in Burkina Faso. \c\cAccording to original plans, the French forces were supplied with 20 helicopters, 200 armored vehicles, 10 transport aircraft, 6 fighter planes, and 3 drones. French Army Aviation currently have two Aérospatiale SA 330 Pumas in Chad. \c\cThe division of labor between France and the G5 Sahel has been established by four permanent military bases: (1) headquarters and an air force base in the Chadian capital of N\'Djamena (under the leadership of French Général Palasset); (2) a regional base in Gao, north Mali, with at least 1,000 men; (3) a special-forces base in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou; (4) an intelligence base in Niger's capital, Niamey, with over 300 men. \c\cThe Niamey airbase is strategically important because it hosts drones in charge of gathering intelligence across the entire Sahel-Saharan region. From Niamey, France's troops are supported by two German Transall C-160s. In 2020, France stated that it will deploy 600 soldiers in addition to the existing force to fight the Islamist militants in Africa's Sahel. \c\cThe aviation support is provided the French Groupement Tactique Désert-Aérocombat. \c\cIn March 2016, during the UK-France Summit in Paris, the British government announced that it would consider providing support to Operation Barkhane. British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon then announced that the UK would provide monthly strategic airlift support to French forces in Africa. In July 2018, three RAF Chinook helicopters arrived in Mali to provide logistical and troop movement support to French and other military forces operating in the area. This deployment is in addition to the 90 British troops already deployed in the region. In September 2018, Forces.net reported that to date the RAF Chinooks Mk5s have made 30 sorties, transporting over 700 French troops, supplies and 70 tons of equipment across Mali. In July, 2020, the British Ministry of Defence announced that nearly 250 British Army troops would train and deploy to Mali to serve as a long-range reconnaissance force for United Nations forces. \c\cOn March 22, 2018, the Ministry of Defence of Estonia announced its intention to commit up to 50 troops and 5 Pasi XA-188 armoured vehicles to Mali as part of Operation Barkhane, to be based in Gao, pending approval by the Riigikogu. The unit, named ESTPLA-26 and headed by Maj. Kristjan Karist, was detached from the C Infantry Company of the Scouts Battalion on August 6, and arrived in Mali that same week to be stationed at the French military base in Gao. In November 2019, Estonia increased its Operation Barkhane troop deployment to 95 soldiers. \c\cThe Swedish contribution to Barkhane via Task Force Takuba arrived in Mali during February 2021. The Swedish troop contribution to Task Force Takuba is a 150-man strong helicopter-borne rapid-response force, centered around an SOG task unit and supported by three UH60M helicopters and one C130, ready to be deployed if something unforeseen occurs. The task force will also be used for other operations, as for example to support other countries that exercise and conduct operations with the Malian army. \c\cOn January 14, 2022, the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed Sweden's intention to withdraw Swedish forces from the European special forces mission in Sahel and reevaluate Swedish involvement in United Nations task force in Mali. \c\cOperations commenced 1 August 2014. French Forces sustained their first casualty during a battle in early November 2014, which also resulted in 24 jihadists dead.  On 24 November, a French special forces soldier was killed in a Caracal helicopter crash in Burkina Faso. French forces experienced their first major success of Barkhane in December 2014 with the killing of Ahmed al-Tilemsi, the leader of the Al-Mourabitoun jihadist group, by French special forces during a raid in the deserts of northern Mali. \c\cFrom 7 to 14 April 2015, French and Nigerien forces carried out an airborne operation in the far north of Niger to search for Jihadists. As part of the operation, 90 French Army paratroopers of the 2e REP jumped near the Salvador pass. Two soldiers were injured during the jump before they were joined by a joint force of Nigerien and French soldiers from the 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment (1er RHP). \c\cOn 26 November 2015, a French Air Parachute Commando died in hospital in France as a result of his injuries after being hit by an anti-tank mine on 13 October near Tessalit during a reconnaissance mission. \c\cFrench soldiers based in Mali as part of the Army Special Forces Command were rapidly deployed to Burkina Faso on 15 January 2016 after jihadists launched a terrorist attack on Ouagadougou which killed 30 people. In February, French forces killed a number of insurgent fighters in the north of Mali, including a number of high ranking foreign jihadists from AQIM. \c\cOn 12 April 2016, three French soldiers were killed when their armored personnel carrier struck a land mine. The convoy of about 60 vehicles was travelling to the northern desert town of Tessalit when it hit the mine. Another French soldier was killed on 4 November 2016 following the explosion of a mine near the town of Abeïbara, which made 2016 the deadliest year up to that point for French forces participating in Barkhane. \c\cOn 15 March 2017, French forces arrested eight jihadists in the desert north of Timbuktu. \c\cOn 5 April 2017, master corporal Julien Barbé, was killed in action near Hombori after an explosive device blew up an armoured vehicle. He was posthumously made a knight of the Legion of Honour. Heavy fighting between French forces and Jihadist groups continued into the summer of 2017, with 8 French soldiers being wounded by a mortar attack on their base in Timbuktu on 1 June. On the night of 17 June, France suffered its tenth soldier killed during an airborne operation in the north-east of Mali. \c\cOn 4 October 2017, French forces operating as part of Barkhane were the first to respond to the ambush of American soldiers searching for an Islamic State commander on the Niger-Mali border. French air support was requested by the Americans and two hours later Mirage fighter jets arrived from Niamey. Despite the French pilots being unable to engage ground targets due to the proximity of friendly forces, the jets deterrence was enough to end the ambush. A French special forces team were the first ground forces to reach the scene of the ambush, 3–4 hours after the firefight which resulted in the death of 4 American Green Berets. \c\cOn 14 October 2017, an Antonov An-26 aircraft operating in support of Operation Barkhane crashed shortly before landing at Félix Houphouët Boigny International Airport, Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Four Moldovan flight crew were killed. Two Moldovan flight crew and four French Army soldiers were injured. \c\cA French Army convoy was attacked on January 11, 2018, by a suicide car bomb while driving between the towns of Idelimane and Menaka. Three French soldiers were wounded, one seriously, in the attack which was later claimed by Islamic State in the Greater Sahara. On 14 February, a French airstrike killed at least 10 Jihadists at the border between Algeria and Mali. Two French soldiers from the 1st Spahi Regiment were killed and the Colonel-in-chief was wounded on 21 February when the armoured vehicle they were travelling in struck a mine between the towns of Gao and Menaka. \c\cOn 14 April 2018, JNIM militants launched an attack on a UN base in Timbuktu, wounding several French soldiers before being repelled by French, Malian and American troops. Four French soldiers were seriously wounded by a suicide car bomb attack against a joint French-Malian patrol in Gao on 1 July 2018. The attack, which heavily damaged a number of French VBCIs, also killed 4 civilians and seriously wounded 27 others. \c\cOn 22 February 2019, French forces backed by an armed reaper drone and a helicopter attacked a JNIM convoy killing 11 militants including senior leader Yahia Abou el Hamman in the Tombouctou Region of Mali. A militant improvised explosive device struck a French armoured vehicle carrying out an anti-terrorist operation in the Mopti Region on 2 April, killing one French soldier and seriously wounding another. Two French commandos of the Commandos Marine were killed on 9 May in the North of Burkina Faso during a rescue mission which successfully rescued four hostages, included two Frenchmen, and an  American and South Korean woman, who had been kidnapped by Islamists. \c\cIn mid-June 2019, a French Army Light Aviation Gazelle helicopter crashed in the border region between Mali and Niger after being fired upon by insurgent small arms fire. The two pilots and a special forces sniper were subsequently rescued by another helicopter after destroying the damaged helicopter. The French military base in Gao was assaulted by suicide bombers on 22 July in an attack that wounded 6 Estonian soldiers and a similar number of French personnel. A French soldier was killed on 2 November 2019 when his vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device during a patrol near Menaka in eastern Mali. French commandos launched a heli-borne raid later that month on an insurgent camp in Mali's eastern regions, which resulted in five insurgents killed and one French soldier being seriously injured. \c\cOn 25 November 2019, 13 French soldiers were killed in northern Mali when two French helicopters, a \'Tigre\' and a \'Cougar\', collided in mid-air while flying to reinforce soldiers engaged in combat with insurgents. The loss of 13 soldiers was the heaviest loss of life for the French military since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. \c\cOn 21 December 2019, the French military killed 40 militants in an operation in the Mopti Region of Mali. The area where the operation took place was controlled by Macina Liberation Front and it involved France's first ever use of a drone strike which accounted for 7 of the 40 killed insurgents. \c\cThe French Defense Minister Florence Parly announced in February 2020 that France would send an additional 600 troops to the Sahel region, bolstering Operation Barkhanes\' force to 5,100 troops. The first contingent of these reinforcements was 200 French Army paratroopers from the 2e REP who were transported to Niger and formed a battle group called Desert Tactical Grouping (GTD) "Altor". This battle group operated autonomously and without a base on the ground for over a month, receiving supplies only by airdrop. GTD Altor killed over a dozen insurgents and disrupted their logistics throughout their initial month-long operation. \c\cTwo soldiers from the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment (1er REC) were seriously wounded when their vehicle struck an IED during operations against insurgents on 23 April 2020; one of the soldier subsequently died from his wounds. On 4 May 2020, a second soldier from the 1er REC was killed in action near Gao during a firefight with an insurgent force. \c\cOn 3 June, French forces achieved one of their most significant successes of Operation Barkhane with the killing of Abdelmalek Droukdel, the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). French and American intelligence sources had identified Droukdel's presence in a group crossing the Algerian-Malian border approximately 80 kilometres east of the town of Tessalit. French special forces subsequently conducted an air assault to intercept the group during which they shot and killed Droukdel and a number of other militants. \c\cA French soldier from the 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment (1er RHP) was killed during combat operations in Mali on 23 July 2020 when an improvised explosive device was triggered next to his armoured vehicle. Two further paratroopers from the 1er RHP were killed on 5 September 2020 by an improvised explosive device which struck their vehicle during an operation in the north of Mali. On 31 October 2020, French special Forces launched an operation near the town of Boulikessi near the border of Mali and Burkina Faso, 50 jihadists were killed and four were captured. On 10 November 2020, Ba Ag Moussa, Emir of Jama\'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, along with 4 other militants were killed in an attack carried out by French Special forces. On 12 November 2020, French Mountains commandos operating under Barkhane killed 30 jihadists in Central Mali. On 30 November 2020, insurgents launched a coordinated attack on three separate French military bases in Kidal, Menaka and Gao in northern Mali using indirect rocket fire but French forces reported no casualties as a result of the attacks. A French military convoy consisting of the 1er Régiment de Chasseurs (1er RCh) was struck by two IED blasts in quick succession on 28 December 2020 during an operation in the Hombori region in central Mali, resulting in the death of three soldiers. \c\cOn 2 January 2021, two French soldiers from the 2nd Hussar Regiment (2e RH) were killed while taking part in an intelligence gathering mission in northeastern Mali. Six French soldiers were wounded on 10 January when a suicide bomber attacked their convoy during a patrol in the central region near Gourma. French and Malian forces conducted a joint offensive operation named Operation Eclipse [fr] from 2 January to 20 January in the forests surrounding the town of Boni. Over 100 jihadists were killed and 20 captured by French forces during the course of Operation Eclipse. \c\cFrench forces carried out a controversial airstrike during the course of Operation Eclipse which locals claimed targeted a wedding ceremony in the village of Bounti, in the central Mopti region, on 3 January. The French military denied these claims and asserted that the strike had successfully targeted a group of jihadist fighters. \c\cFrance announced it had suspended joint military operations with Mali on 3 June, in response to the coup d\'état carried out by the Malian military, resulting in the deposition of the interim President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane in May. \c\cThe President of France Emmanuel Macron announced on 10 June that the operation would soon be coming to an end and instead be replaced by a mission involving forces from more countries. He also added that the French forces will withdraw in a phased manner, but some will remain as part of another international mission, for which France would convince other countries to join. As to the reason for the withdrawal, he stated that France could not continue to work with the national governments in the Sahel region, as they were negotiating with terrorists. \c\cOn 2 July, France announced that it would resume its suspended joint military operations with Mali, following discussions with the interim government of the country. \c\cOn 9 July, Macron stated that France will withdraw between 2,500-3,000 troops from the Sahel, while retaining other troops to thwart militant operations and supporting regional forces. On 13 July, he announced that Barkhane would end in the first quarter of 2022. \c\cMacron on 15 September announced that Barkhane forces had killed Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, the leader of Islamic State in the Greater Sahara. The assassination was conducted on 17 August using a drone in the Dangalous Forest of Mali near the border with Niger, according to the Chief of the Defence Staff Thierry Burkhard, after gathering information on locations where al-Sahrawi was likely to hide from captured IS-GS members. Burkhard added that al-Sahrawi was travelling on a motorcycle with another person when he was killed. A unit comprising 20 soldiers of the French Army's special forces was then sent to confirm the identities of those killed and found that the strike had killed ten IS-GS members. \c\cOn 24 September, a French soldier was killed in an armed clash with insurgents in Mali, close to the border with Burkina Faso. \c\cPrior to the beginning of Operation Barkhane, 10 French troops had been killed in Mali as part of Operation Serval. Since the launch of Operation Barkhane in August 2014, the French Ministère de la Défense listed 38 servicemen were reported killed in Mali, 2 in Burkina Faso and one in Chad. The vast distances of Operation Barkhane force's area of operations across the Sahel pose a significant challenge in dealing with French casualties, with wounded troops being possibly up to 1,100 kilometres (680 mi) from advanced medical aid. To overcome these challenges, the French military created helicopter-mobile medical teams which can rapidly carry out MEDEVAC missions and transport casualties to more advanced medical care. Between 2013 and 2016, it was reported that French forces sustained 1,272 casualties which required MEDEVAC; of these casualties, 18.2% were wounded in action, 27.4% suffered trauma injuries and 46.6% were suffering from disease or sickness. \c\cAfter the first year of operations, the French Army claimed that approximately 125 insurgents had been neutralized by French forces. In late 2015, French army representatives indicated that over 150 ammunition and explosive depositories had been discovered and 25 vehicles and 80 electronic devices (GPS, computers, satellite phones and radio stations) had been destroyed. This represented 20 tons of ammunition, including 2,000 shells, 680 grenades, guided missiles, 25 IEDs and mines, 210 detonators, 30 mortars, machine guns and rocket launchers. The army also seized 3,500 kg (7,700 lb) of various drugs. French forces continued to inflict significant casualties in 2016, with nearly 150 insurgents killed or captured in that year. By July 2017, the French Forces estimated that over 400 insurgents had been killed since the start of Operation Barkhane. \c\cIn February 2018, the French Defense Minister, Florence Parly, indicated that 450 jihadists have been neutralized, amongst which 120 have been killed and 150 held as prisoners by Malian authorities. In July 2018, General Bruno Guibert, head of the Barkhane force, confirmed that 120 terrorists had been killed since the beginning of the year. In February 2019, Parly announced that over 600 jihadists had been "neutralized" since the beginning of the operation in 2014. \c\cSince 2013 and the beginning of the Operation Serval, replaced by Operation Barkhane in 2014, opinions in Mali have been divided as to the legitimacy of the French intervention. According to Mission head for Peace in Mali for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Aurélien Tobie, "Between 2013 and 2015, we quickly realised, after the peace agreements in Ouagadougou and Algiers for Mali that the Malian opinion towards the French presence was changing. People were supporting the Serval Operation, but did not understand why the French presence was being prolonged with the Barkhane Operation". \c\cIn 2017, the study "Mali-Meter", conducted by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Mali, polled the level of satisfaction with Operation Barkhane amongst the Malian population. Less than half of the respondents were satisfied with the French intervention. The study also showed geographical disparities in approbation of Operation Barkhane. \c\cAccording to Aurélien Tobie, the differences of opinion between the North and the South of the country can be explained by the difference in proximity of the population with the operations: "People in contact with the forces of Barkhane in the North of the country approve of it much more because they see changes in their daily lives. Conversely, people interviewed in Southern Mali, who are generally higher educated but also further away from the conflict zone, are much more critical of the French presence". 
The 2022 Australian Open is a scheduled Grand Slam tennis tournament that is scheduled to take place at Melbourne Park, from 17–30 January 2022. It will be the 110th edition of the Australian Open, the 54th in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament will consist of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players will compete in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor is Kia. \c\cNovak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka are the defending champions in Men's Singles and Women's Singles, respectively. Djokovic may be unable to defend the title because his Australian visa was refused by the Australian Border Force upon entering the country on 5 January 2022. Similarly, Renata Voráčová was deported on 8 January 2022 after her visa was cancelled on 7 January 2022. Djokovic appealed the visa refusal and the Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in favour of Djokovic, ordered his release from detention and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses. \c\cThe 2022 Australian Open is the 110th edition of the tournament, held at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. \c\cThe tournament is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consists of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as the mixed doubles events. There are singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which are part of the Grade A category of tournaments.  The junior competitions will be returned after a year of absence. There are also singles, doubles and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category. \c\cThe tournament is played on hard courts and will take place across a series of 25 courts, including the four main show courts of Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena, Margaret Court Arena and 1573 Arena. It is also the debut of Kia Arena, which now makes five main tennis arenas. \c\cBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points offered for each event. \c\cThe Australian Open total prize money for 2022 increased by 4.5% to a tournament record A$75,000,000. \c\c1Qualifiers prize money was also the Round of 128 prize money. \c\c*per team\c\cOn 4 January 2022, defending champion Novak Djokovic announced that he could compete in the Australian Open after he had been granted medical exemption from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination by Tennis Australia and the health department of the state of Victoria, after a blind review of his application. However, the Australian Minister for Home Affairs, Karen Andrews, stated that regardless of Tennis Australia and Victoria's decision, Australia's "border requirements" would be still enforced by the federal government, that unvaccinated individuals entering Australia "must provide acceptable proof that they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons". \c\cOn 5 January, Djokovic was detained by the Australian Border Force upon arriving in Australia as his visa did not meet the country's entry requirements for unvaccinated travellers. His lawyers requested an injunction against deportation in order to appeal the visa refusal; this allowed Djokovic to remain confined in a detention hotel pending the outcome of the appeal. On 10 January, the Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in favour of Djokovic, ordered his release from detention and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses. The reason for the ruling was that when Djokovic was in immigration holding before his visa was cancelled, Australian officials reneged on an agreement to give Djokovic sufficient time to contact his lawyers and tennis authorities before his official interview; this led the Australian government to concede that they treated Djokovic unreasonably. \c\cTwenty-five other players and staff had applied for a medical exemption and a handful of applications had been granted. Among those, two people with the same type of visa and exemption as Djokovic had reportedly been allowed into the country. Player Renata Voráčová, who was one of those granted an exemption, was allowed into the country and participated in a warm-up tournament but was subsequently detained in the same hotel as Djokovic and deported on 8 January 2022. A tennis official with an exemption was also allowed entry but left the country voluntarily. \c\cPublic opinion in Australia of an unvaccinated athlete being permitted entry while many Australians remain stranded overseas due to the pandemic, in order to participate in an event that spectators cannot attend unless fully vaccinated, has been overwhelmingly negative. \c\cOn 14 January 2022, Alex Hawke, the Australian Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, exercised his ministerial powers under the Migration Act to cancel Djokovic's visa, citing "health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so".
On January 15, 2022, an armed gunman took multiple people hostage at Congregation Beth Israel, a Jewish synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, United States. After more than 12 hours, the four hostages were freed and the attacker is dead. \c\cCongregation Beth Israel is a Reform Judaism synagogue located in Colleyville, Texas, a suburb in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The synagogue was opened in 1999 with 25 families and a religious school with 75 children. The synagogue's Rabbi is Charlie Cytron-Walker, who is originally from Lansing, Michigan. \c\cAt 10:41 a.m., a gunman entered the Congregation Beth Israel and began taking hostages. The assailant entered by posing as a homeless man in need of shelter. Reports of hostages being taken at Congregation Beth Israel came in around 11:30 a.m. via a tweet from the Colleyville Police Department. The police said the SWAT team was on the scene. Police efforts were later assisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Public Safety. Law enforcement evacuated neighborhoods in the vicinity of the crime scene. \c\cA livestream of the synagogue's services showed the ongoing situation, including the taking of hostages. Four hostages, including Charlie Cytron-Walker, the synagogue's rabbi, were taken during the middle of a bar mitzvah. In it, the hostage taker could be seen speaking to authorities, who attempted to negotiate with him. The man, who was armed, could be heard saying "If anyone tries to enter this building, I’m telling you...everyone will die." and "I\'m going to die. Don\'t cry about me..." One member of the synagogue, who was listening to the synagogue's livestream, stated that she heard him speak using anti-Israel epithets. \c\cShortly after 5:00 p.m., the Colleyville Police Department released a statement that one of the hostages was released safely and was not in need of medical attention. At 9:21 p.m., James Hartley of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported hearing "what sounds like gunshots and a much louder bang, possibly a flash grenade" from the synagogue. After more than 12 hours of the synagogue being under siege, Texas Governor Greg Abbott put out a statement via Twitter reading "Prayers answered. All hostages are out alive and safe."\c\cMultiple news agencies reported that the assailant has claimed to be the brother of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani national who in 2010 was convicted of the attempted murder of a United States Army captain while in Afghan custody. However, a former lawyer for her only biological brother, Muhammad, said that he had no involvement with the attack. Law enforcement has not identified the assailant. The hostage taker demanded to have Siddiqui released as part of his negotiations. \c\cThe assailant had Rabbi Cytron-Walker call a New York City–based rabbi to pass along his demand that Aafia Siddiqui be released. Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne told reporters with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that the attacker is confirmed to be dead. \c\cThe White House stated that they[clarification needed] were actively monitoring the situation. In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said he was "closely monitoring" the situation. Yair Lapid, the Alternate Prime Minister of Israel, said that Livia Link, the Israeli Consulate General located in Houston, Texas was on her way to the scene and that the Israeli government was in contact with American law enforcement. \c\cThe attorney who currently represents Aafia Siddiqui said "she has absolutely no involvement with [the hostage crisis]." The attorney stated that "We strongly condemn the hostage-taking at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville" and "We implore the hostage taker to immediately release all hostages and turn himself in."
A large eruption of Hunga Tonga, a volcanic island in Tonga in the Pacific Ocean, occurred on 15 January 2022. The eruption caused tsunamis in Tonga, Fiji and American Samoa; tsunami warnings were issued in Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, the United States, Canada, Chile and Ecuador. \c\cAfter being relatively inactive since 2014, the Hunga Tonga volcano erupted on 20 December 2021, sending particulates into the stratosphere, and a large plume of ash was visible from Nukuʻalofa, the capital city of Tonga, about 70 kilometres (43 mi) from the volcano. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) in Wellington, New Zealand, issued an advisory notice to airlines. Explosions were heard up to 170 kilometres (110 mi) away. This initial eruption ended at 02:00 on 21 December. Volcanic activity continued, and on 25 December, the island had increased in size on satellite imagery. As activity on the island decreased, it was declared dormant on 11 January 2022. \c\cA large eruption began on 14 January sending clouds of ash 20 kilometres (12 mi) into the atmosphere. The government of Tonga issued a tsunami warning to residents. Tongan geologists near the volcano observed explosions and a 5-kilometre (3.1 mi) wide ash column. \c\cThe following day, a significantly larger eruption occurred at approximately 17:00 (04:00 UTC). The VAAC again issued an advisory notice to airlines. Ash from the eruption made landfall on the main island of Tongatapu, blotting out the sun. Loud explosions were heard 40 miles (65 km) away in Nukuʻalofa, and small stones and ash rained down from the sky. Many residents in Tonga were stuck in traffic while attempting to flee to higher ground. The explosion was heard as far away as Samoa, roughly 520 miles (840 km) away. Residents in Fiji described the sounds of thunder. Booms were heard in the North Island of New Zealand and as far away as the east coast of Australia. From space, a very wide eruption column and shockwaves were captured propagating across the Pacific by satellites. The pressure wave was measured by weather stations throughout New Zealand at a maximum amplitude of about 7 hPa. The pressure wave was also recorded by weather stations in Australia. The United States Geological Survey registered the eruption at a surface-wave magnitude of 5.8. A pressure fluctuation of 2.5 hPa was measured in Switzerland. \c\cPreliminary observations showed that the eruption column ejected a large amount of volcanic material into the stratosphere. The eruption has potential to cause a temporary climate effect. A scientist from the University of Auckland described it as a one-in-1000-year event. \c\cLittle information is yet available on the extent of damage and casualties from Tonga due to communication issues. Video footage showing waves hitting coastal areas in Tonga was reported by Sky News. Atata, a small island off the capital city was reportedly submerged and rescue operations are being carried out. There are some reports of residents in Tonga struggling to breathe as a result of the ash. The Tonga government has not confirmed any casualties from the eruption and tsunami. \c\cThe tsunami claimed the lives of two women in Peru when a 2-meter wave struck them at Naylamp beach, Lambayeque. The two women were in a truck along with a driver; the husband of one of the woman. When the wave struck, the male occupant escaped. The bodies of the female victims were taken to a morgue. \c\cAs a result of the eruption on 15 January 2022, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake, and a 1.2-metre (3.9 ft) tsunami, struck the Tongan capital Nukuʻalofa. Tide gauges in the city recorded waves 1.5–2 metres (4.9–6.6 ft) in height. Videos posted on the Internet showed a series of waves hitting the shore and homes, sweeping away debris. Other videos show ashfall and a cloud of ash obscuring the sun. According to a resident in the Tongan capital, a series of initial smaller explosions were heard. It was followed by a tsunami approximately 15 minutes later. The first wave was said to be the largest. A long white wave was observed out at sea approaching the coast. Three waves reportedly struck the coast. In the wake of the tsunami King Tupou VI was evacuated and traffic jams formed as locals fled to high ground. \c\cIn Fiji, a tidal gauge in Suva recorded a wave measuring 20 centimetres (8 in) at 17:40 local time. Some tsunami activity was also reported in the Lau Islands. The islands of Moce, Moala, Kadavu and Taveuni were struck by low-level tsunami that triggered flooding. \c\cIn American Samoa, a tsunami measuring 0.61 metres (2 ft) was recorded by tide gauges. \c\c"Destructive" tsunami waves of 1–2.5 metres (3 ft 3 in – 8 ft 2 in) were observed in several islands in Vanuatu. The Vanuatu Meteorology & Geo-hazards Department said tsunami activity is expected to persist for the night of 15 January 2022. Waves up to 0.8 metres (2.6 ft) in height were recorded in Hanalei, Hawaii. \c\cThe tsunami sank several boats and ripped others off their moorings at a marina in Tutukaka in New Zealand. The waves took boats out into the bay and smashed some together. Debris from boats and polystyrene was reported. Civil Defence Northland said that damage at the marina was "serious". According to Hauraki Gulf Weather, the tsunami struck on 16 January at between 01.05 and 01.10 local time on Great Barrier Island with a height of 1.33 meters. The tsunami caused flooding at Mahinepua Bay where a campsite was located but all 50 individuals at the site were safe. There were no casualties reported in New Zealand. \c\cIn Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology said tsunami waves were observed on the shores along the east coast of Australia. Maximum tsunami waves of 1.27 m (4.2 ft) was recorded at Norfolk Island, 1.10 m (3.6 ft) at Lord Howe Island, 0.82 m (2.7 ft) at the Gold Coast, Queensland, 0.77 m (2.5 ft) at Twofold Bay, New South Wales and 0.50 m (1.6 ft) at Hobart, Tasmania. \c\cIn Kominato, Amami, Kagoshima, Japan, a 1.2-metre (3 ft 11 in) tsunami was reported at 23:55 JST. At Tosashimizu, Kōchi, the tsunami was 0.9 metres (2 ft 11 in) in height. A tsunami measuring 0.9 metres (2 ft 11 in) was also reported in Chichijima Futami. On the Tohoku coast, a 0.7-metre (2 ft 4 in) wave struck at 00:38 local time, 16 January. In the Sendai Port, the tsunami measured 0.9 metres (2 ft 11 in) at 00:08. In Iwate Prefecture, a 1.1-metre  tsunami was recorded at 02:26 on January 16. Tsunami waves of less than a meter was reported along the Hokkaido Pacific coast. This was the nation's first tsunami warning since the 2016 Fukushima earthquake. \c\cSignificant tsunami waves were reported hitting the Santa Cruz Harbor in California during Saturday morning. Strong currents in Half Moon Bay were reported in a tweet by the official San Mateo-Santa Cruz Fire Department account. Waves up to 0.37 metres (1.2 ft) in height were recorded in Nikolski, Alaska. On the Mexican coasts of the states of Guerrero, Colima and Baja California Peninsula, sea level rise was reported with waves of 0.30 metres (1 ft) to 0.61 metres (2 ft). The NWS reported a minor tsunami surge measuring 0.76 m (2.5 ft) in Port San Luis. Small waves were observed at Seal Beach. At San Gregorio, California, four fishermen were swept out to sea by the tsunami. Two of the men were injured and received medical treatment while another two were rescued and unhurt. \c\cAlong the coast of Peru, the tsunami was damaging. Restaurants and boats in Lagunillas beach and San Andrés District were damaged by waves. Many beachgoers evacuated to safety while businesses closed. Damage to piers and some homes occurred in the capital Lima. In some areas, boat owners dragged their boats onto shore to prevent the waves from damaging them. Some material damage was confirmed on the beaches. A wave measuring 0.68 m was recorded in the port of Callao, 0.72 m in Marcona District and 0.65 m in Paita. \c\cIn northern Chile, waves of up to 2 meters struck the coastline. Videos and images on social media from the Los Ríos Region showed the tsunami damaging piers, carrying boats and hitting beaches. Coastal evacuation notices were issued in 14 of the 16 regions in Chile. A "Red alert" level was issued to more than 6,400 km of ts coastline. The Chilean National Office for Emergency (ONEMI) said that tsunami activity can persist overnight so those affected have to sustain on their emergency supplies and aid. \c\cMinor tsunamis related to the eruption were measured as far away as the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, with NOAA reporting a maximum rise of 0.18 m (0.59 ft) in Puerto Rico. \c\cA tsunami warning was issued on 14 January in Tonga after an eruption was observed. Volcanic activity decreased following that eruption and the warning was lifted in the early morning of 15 January. A 30-centimetre wave was observed during the first tsunami warning. Another warning was issued to the whole of Tonga on the evening of 15 January following another large eruption. Warning sirens blared in Nukuʻalofa while authorities urged residents to flee to higher ground. \c\cThe Mineral Resources Department in Fiji issued advisories to people living around the coastal areas to stay away from the shores. Evacuations were made on the Lau Islands after wave activity was observed in the sea. Fiji's Acting Prime Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum urged the public to stay indoors and cover household water tanks in the event of rain due to the risk of sulfuric acid generated from the eruption. \c\cTsunami warnings were also issued to American Samoa by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC). The PTWC considered the tsunami "hazardous" and warned that changes in sea level, as well as strong currents could pose a risk along the coast. Samoa later issued a tsunami advisory. The PTWC later cancelled the tsunami warning for American Samoa. \c\cThe National Emergency Management Agency of New Zealand told residents to expect "strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges" along the north and east coast of North Island, as well as the Chatham Islands. The agency added that the currents have the potential to injure and drown people. \c\cA tsunami warning was issued by the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia, with a land warning issued for Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island, and a marine warning for the east coast of Australia, Tasmania and Macquarie Island.  On January 16, at 06:55 local time, tsunami warnings were issued to New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Tasmania for strong and dangerous currents. \c\cThe Japan Meteorological Agency informed residents that a slight disturbance in the sea could occur without any damage. The tsunami would not pose a threat to Japanese coastline. Officials from the JMA said that sea level rise of no more than 20 centimetres (7.9 in) can be expected for 24 hours from 9:00 p.m. Japan Standard Time. A tsunami warning was issued in the Amami Islands and Tokara Islands by the JMA with forecasted waves of up to 3 metres (9.8 ft). Additional warnings were issued to the east and southeast coast for waves of up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in). A warning and evacuation order was issued to Iwate Prefecture, and evacuation orders were also issued to six other prefectures. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA) said that 210,000 residents living in the seven prefectures were evacuated. \c\cThe National Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami advisory along the West Coast of the United States and British Columbia, Canada. The advisory contained all U.S. areas along the West Coast from Southern California to Alaska. Beaches were closed, and coastal residents were requested to move to higher grounds. Tsunami waves measuring 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) are expected to hit the shores as early as 7:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (UTC−8) along the Central Coast. San Francisco was expected to receive waves at 8:10. The highest tsunami waves are expected one to two hours after the arrival of the first waves. A tsunami advisory was put in place for the entirety of Hawaii. Advisories in Canada were issued along the North and Central coasts of British Columbia, along with the Haida Gwaii archipelago and Vancouver Island. No evacuation issue was ordered, but people were urged to avoid beaches and marinas. The warning level was low due to the height of reported waves, as they were below the 91 centimetres (36 in) threshold which would warrant an upgrade. Chile also issued a warning for a "minor tsunami" for most of its coastal area including the island of Rapa Nui, evacuation was declared for other 12 regions. \c\cRescue operations are underway at Atata Island, located off the main Tonga island near Nukuʻalofa after the small island was reportedly submerged by the tsunami. \c\cNew Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are discussing the provision of aid to Tonga. She has described the events in Tonga as "hugely concerning".
A very large eruption of  Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai, a volcanic island of Tonga in the Pacific Ocean, began on 14 January 2022. Hunga Tonga is 65 km (40 mi) north of Tongatapu, the country's main island. The eruption caused tsunamis in Tonga, Fiji, American Samoa and along the rim of the Pacific Ocean; tsunami warnings and advisories were issued in Fiji, Samoa, Wallis and Futuna, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Russia, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Ecuador. Damaging tsunami waves were reported in New Zealand, the United States, Chile and Peru. Two people drowned in Peru when a 2 m (6+1⁄2 ft) wave struck the coast, and two fishermen in the United States suffered minor injuries. The event is likely the largest volcanic eruption of the 21st century to date. \c\cAfter being relatively inactive since 2014, the Hunga Tonga volcano erupted on 20 December 2021, sending particulates into the stratosphere. A large plume of ash was visible from Nukuʻalofa, the capital city of Tonga, about 70 km (45 mi) from the volcano. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) in Wellington, New Zealand, issued an advisory notice to airlines. The eruption was heard more than 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) away in New Zealand, where the sound arrived two hours later. This initial eruption ended at 02:00 on 21 December 2021. Volcanic activity continued, and on 25 December 2021, the island had increased in size on satellite imagery. As activity on the island decreased, it was declared dormant on 11 January 2022. \c\cTsunamis are typically triggered by earthquakes, not volcanoes. Fewer than 100 volcanic tsunamis were recorded in the prior two centuries. \c\cA large eruption commenced on 14 January sending clouds of ash 20 km (12 mi) into the atmosphere. The government of Tonga issued a tsunami warning to residents. Tongan geologists near the volcano observed explosions and a 5 km (3.1 mi)-wide ash column. \c\cThe next day, a much larger eruption started at 17:15 local time (04:14:45 UTC). The VAAC again issued an advisory notice to airlines. Ash from the eruption made landfall on the main island of Tongatapu, blotting out the sun. Loud explosions were heard 65 km (40 mi) away in Nukuʻalofa, and small stones and ash rained down from the sky. Many residents in Tonga were stuck in traffic whilst attempting to flee to higher ground. The explosion was heard in Samoa, roughly 840 km (520 mi) away, before the sound travelled to more distant countries. Residents in Fiji described the sounds of thunder, while the "thump" of the eruption was also reported in Niue, Samoa, Vanuatu. Tremors and shaking buildings were reported by residents in southwestern Niue, around Alofi and Avatele. Booms were heard across New Zealand, and as far away as Yukon in Canada. From space, a very wide eruption column and shockwaves propagating across the Pacific Ocean were captured by satellites. The pressure wave was measured by weather stations throughout New Zealand at a maximum amplitude of about 7 hPa. The pressure wave was also recorded by weather stations in Australia, with 6.9 hPa measured at Lord Howe Island and 3.3 hPa at Perth, Western Australia. The United States Geological Survey estimated the eruption at a surface-wave magnitude of 5.8. A pressure fluctuation of 2.5 hPa was measured in Switzerland, and of just over 2 hPa when it reached the United Kingdom. \c\cIntense lightning activity was recorded during the eruption phase. The Vaisala National Lightning Detection Network detected the lightning in the form of radio waves. Several hundred to thousand flashes of lightning were recorded by the system during the two weeks prior to the eruption. From 14 to 15 January 2022, tens of thousands of lightning flashes occurred. Between 05:00 and 06:00 UTC on 15 January 2022, 200,000 flashes were recorded. \c\cPreliminary observations showed that the eruption column ejected a large amount of volcanic material into the stratosphere. The eruption has potential to cause a temporary cooling climate effect. Shane Cronin, volcanologist from the University of Auckland, described the eruption as a one-in-1000-year event for the Hunga caldera, and stated that the event could rank as high as 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. \c\cAs a result of the eruption, a 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) tsunami struck the Tongan capital Nukuʻalofa. Tide gauges in the city recorded waves 1.5–2 m (5–6+1⁄2 ft) in height. Videos posted on the Internet showed a series of waves hitting the shore and homes, sweeping away debris. Other videos show ashfall and a cloud of ash obscuring the sun. According to a resident in the Tongan capital, a series of initial smaller explosions were heard. It was followed by a tsunami approximately 15 minutes later. The first wave was said to be the largest. A long white wave was observed out at sea approaching the coast. Three waves reportedly struck the coast. In the wake of the tsunami, King Tupou VI was evacuated from the Royal Palace and traffic jams formed as locals fled to high ground. \c\cIn Fiji, a tidal gauge in Suva recorded a wave measuring 20 cm (8 in) at 17:40 local time. Some tsunami activity was also reported in the Lau Islands. The islands of Moce, Moala, Kadavu and Taveuni were struck by low-level tsunamis that triggered flooding. \c\cIn American Samoa, a tsunami measuring 60 cm (2 ft) was recorded by tide gauges. Niue, where residents evacuated coastal areas, reported no tsunami, despite tremors and the island's close proximity to Tonga. In Wallis and Futuna, a tsunami warning was issued, but no damage was reported and the alert was lifted in the evening of 15 January. \c\cDestructive tsunami waves of 1–2.5 m (3+1⁄2–8 ft) were observed in several islands in Vanuatu. The Vanuatu Meteorology & Geo-hazards Department said tsunami activity was expected to persist for the night of 15 January 2022. Waves up to 0.8 m (2 ft 7 in) in height were recorded in Hanalei, Hawaii. \c\cThe tsunami sank several boats and ripped others off their moorings at a marina in Tutukaka in New Zealand. The waves took boats out into the bay and smashed some together. Debris from boats and polystyrene were reported. Civil Defence Northland said that damage at the marina was "serious". According to Hauraki Gulf Weather, the tsunami struck on 16 January at between 01:05 and 01:10 local time on Great Barrier Island with a height of 1.33 m (4 ft 4 in). The tsunami caused flooding at Mahinepua Bay, where a campsite was located; all 50 individuals at the site were safe. A group of fishermen in Hokianga Harbour had to run for their lives to escape the waves, and reported having to drive through water over 1 m (3 ft 3 in) deep. There were no casualties reported in New Zealand. \c\cIn Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology said tsunami waves were observed throughout Saturday night on the shores along the east coast of Australia. Maximum tsunami waves of 1.27 m (4 ft 2 in) were recorded at Norfolk Island, 1.10 m (3 ft 7+1⁄2 in) at Lord Howe Island, 0.82 m (2 ft 8+1⁄2 in) at the Gold Coast, Queensland, 0.77 m (2 ft 6+1⁄2 in) at Twofold Bay, New South Wales and 0.50 m (1 ft 8 in) at Hobart, Tasmania. \c\cIn Kominato, Amami, Kagoshima, Japan, a 1.2-metre (3 ft 11 in) tsunami was reported at 23:55 on 15 January JST. At Tosashimizu, Kōchi, the tsunami was 0.9 metres (2 ft 11 in) in height. A tsunami measuring 0.9 metres (2 ft 11 in) was also reported in Chichijima Futami. On the Tohoku coast, a 0.7-metre (2 ft 4 in) wave struck at 00:38 local time, on 16 January. In the Sendai Port, the tsunami measured 0.9 metres (2 ft 11 in) at 00:08. In Iwate Prefecture, a 1.1-metre tsunami was recorded at 02:26 on 16 January. Tsunami waves of less than a metre were reported along the Hokkaido Pacific coast. This was the nation's first tsunami warning since the 2016 Fukushima earthquake. The JMA said that the tsunami struck 2.5 hours earlier than predicted. \c\cRussia's Kuril Islands in the country's far east had tsunami waves of about 20 centimetres (8 in). At least two ports were warned. \c\cThe highest tsunami waves in the United States were 1.3 metres (4.3 ft) in Port San Luis in San Luis Obispo (Southern California) and 1.1 metres (3.7 ft) in both Arena Cove and Crescent City (Northern California). Significant waves hit the Santa Cruz Harbor, and its parking lot was flooded with about 0.91 metres (3 ft) of water, whereas Soquel Creek in the neighboring city of Capitola flowed backwards. A surfing competition was cancelled. Strong currents in Half Moon Bay were reported,  while small waves were observed at Seal Beach. Waves up to 0.37 metres (1.2 ft) in height were recorded in Nikolski, Alaska. \c\cThere was an unusually high tide along the coasts of British Columbia and Vancouver Island. At 11:55 local time, the PTWC said tide levels rose 29 cm in Winter Harbour. Large tree logs were pushed up by the high tides and left onto the beaches. \c\cOn the Mexican coasts of the states of Guerrero, Oaxaca and Baja California Peninsula, sea level rise was reported with waves of 0.30 metres (1 ft) to 0.61 metres (2 ft). A maximum tide level of 2.05 metres (6 ft 9 in) was measured at Manzanillo, Colima, according to the Mareographic Service of the Institute of Geophysics of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The tsunami had an amplitude of 1.19 metres in Zihuatanejo. Waves of just under 1 metre were recorded in Acapulco, Huatulco and Salina Cruz. \c\cIn Peru, waves measuring 0.68 metres (2 ft 3 in) was recorded in the port of Callao, 0.72 metres (2 ft 4 in) in Marcona District and 0.65 metres (2 ft 2 in) in Paita. The tsunami measured 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) in Lambayeque, killing two people. \c\cIn northern Chile, waves of up to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) struck the coastline. Videos and images on social media from the Los Ríos Region showed the tsunami damaging piers, carrying boats and hitting beaches. A tsunami of 1.74 meters was measured at Chañaral. \c\cMinor meteo-tsunamis related to the eruption by slight atmospheric pressure changes were measured as far away as the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, with NOAA reporting a maximum rise of 12 cm (4.7 in) in Puerto Rico. \c\cA tsunami warning was issued on 14 January in Tonga after an eruption was observed. Volcanic activity decreased following that eruption and the warning was lifted in the early morning of 15 January. A 30-centimetre (12 in) wave was observed during the first tsunami warning. \c\cAnother warning was issued to the whole of Tonga on the evening of 15 January following the next eruption. Warning sirens blared in Nukuʻalofa while authorities urged residents to flee to higher ground. \c\cThe Mineral Resources Department in Fiji issued advisories to people living around the coastal areas to stay away from the shores. Evacuations were made on the Lau Islands after wave activity was observed in the sea. Fiji's Acting Prime Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum urged the public to stay indoors and cover household water tanks in the event of rain due to the risk of fallout of sulfuric acid from the SO2 emitted in the air by the eruption. \c\cTsunami warnings were also issued to American Samoa by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC). The PTWC considered the tsunami "hazardous" and warned that changes in sea level, as well as strong currents, could pose a risk along the coast. Samoa later issued a tsunami advisory. The PTWC later cancelled the tsunami warning for American Samoa. \c\cThe National Emergency Management Agency of New Zealand told residents to expect "strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges" along the north and east coast of North Island, as well as the Chatham Islands. The agency added that the currents have the potential to injure and drown people. \c\cA tsunami warning was issued by the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia, with a land warning issued for Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island, and a marine warning for the east coast of Australia, Tasmania and Macquarie Island.  On 16 January, at 06:55 local time, tsunami marine warnings were issued to New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Tasmania for strong and dangerous currents. \c\cThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) informed residents that a slight disturbance in the sea could occur without any damage. The tsunami would not pose a threat to Japanese coastline. Officials from the JMA said that sea level rise of no more than 20 centimetres (7.9 in) can be expected for 24 hours from 9:00 p.m. Japan Standard Time (UTC+9). A tsunami warning was issued in the Amami Islands and Tokara Islands by the JMA with forecasted waves of up to 3 metres (9 ft 10 in). Additional warnings were issued to the east and southeast coast for waves of up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in). A warning and evacuation order was issued to Iwate Prefecture, and evacuation orders were also issued to six other prefectures. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA) said that 210,000 residents living in the seven prefectures were evacuated. Japan downgraded its warnings the following morning. Russia issued a tsunami advisory for Kuril Islands. \c\cThe National Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami advisory along the West Coast of the United States and British Columbia, Canada. The advisory contained all U.S. areas along the West Coast from Southern California to Alaska. Beaches were closed, and coastal residents were requested to move to higher grounds. A surfing contest with over 100 participants was cancelled in Santa Cruz, California. Tsunami waves measuring 0.30–0.61 metres (1–2 ft) were expected to hit the shores as early as 7:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (UTC−8) along the Central Coast. San Francisco was expected to receive waves at 8:10. The highest tsunami waves are expected one to two hours after the arrival of the first waves. A tsunami advisory was put in place for the entirety of Hawaii. Advisories in Canada were issued along the North and Central coasts of British Columbia, along with the Haida Gwaii archipelago and Vancouver Island. No evacuation order was issued, but people were urged to avoid beaches and marinas. The warning level was low due to the height of reported waves, as they were below the 91 centimetres (36 in) threshold which would warrant an upgrade. By the evening, the United States lifted advisories for Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon and portions of California. They remained in effect in California in parts of the Central and North Coast. \c\cNo warnings were issued to Peru initially. After the tsunami struck, authorities stopped all maritime activities at the coast. Twenty-two (22) ports along north and central Peru were closed due to tsunami activity. \c\cChile also issued a warning for a "minor tsunami" for most of its coastal area, including the island of Rapa Nui; evacuation was declared for other 12 regions. The Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy declared a "State of Precaution" and indicated that there is a possibility of a minor tsunami in the affected regions. Later, coastal evacuation notices were issued in 14 of the 16 regions in Chile. A "Red alert" level was issued to more than 6,400 km of its coastline. The Chilean National Office for Emergency (ONEMI) said that tsunami activity could persist overnight, so those impacted would need to hold on to their emergency supplies and aid. \c\cEcuador issued a warning of maritime disturbance for the Galápagos Islands. \c\cA tsunami advisory was issued to American Samoa following a new eruption at the volcano. The advisory was cancelled almost two hours later. \c\cLittle information is as yet available on the extent of damage and casualties from Tonga due to communication issues.  Video footage showing waves hitting coastal areas in Tonga was reported by Sky News. Atatā, a small island off the capital city, was reportedly submerged and rescue operations are being carried out. There were some reports of residents in Tonga struggling to breathe as a result of the ash. The Tongan government has not confirmed any casualties from the eruption and tsunami. \c\cAccording to a New Zealand government official in the capital Nukuʻalofa, extensive damage occurred on the waterfront of the city, as it was severely hit by the tsunami. Acting High Commissioner Peter Lund said that several people were unaccounted for following the eruption and tsunami. Tattoo parlour owner, Angela Glover, a British resident in Tonga was among the people missing, swept away by the tsunami when it hit Nukuʻalofa. Though the extent of the damage in Tonga is still not clear, a blanket of thick ash has contaminated water supplies, cut off communications and prevented surveillance flights, making it difficult for relief efforts to begin. \c\cSouthern Cross Cable reported that the eruption may have broken the Tonga Cable System, which connects Tonga to Southern Cross's trans-Pacific cable in Fiji. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern had earlier stated that an undersea cable serving Tonga was affected, probably due to power cuts, and authorities were urgently attempting to restore communications. \c\cOne person in Itoman, Okinawa, Japan suffered a fall during the evacuations. A number of fishing boats in Kōchi and Mie prefectures capsized or sank. A total of 30 fishing vessels were lost. In Muroto, five small boats sank and another five were lost. A small ship capsized and sank in Owase. The tsunami also damaged fishing nets on the coast of Tokushima Prefecture. Land, sea and air transportation was affected; 27 domestic flights operated by Japan Air Lines were cancelled due to the warnings. \c\cThe tsunami killed two women in Peru when a 2 m (6+1⁄2 ft) wave struck them at Naylamp Beach, Lambayeque. The two women were in a truck along with a driver, who was the husband of one of the women. When the wave struck, the male occupant escaped; the women did not. Twenty-two ports along north and central Peru were closed due to the tsunami. Substantial material damage was done to coastal businesses and the beach areas. Videos showed the tsunami flooding the streets. Along the coast of Peru, the tsunami was damaging. Restaurants and boats in Lagunillas beach and San Andrés District were damaged by waves. Many beachgoers evacuated to safety while businesses closed. Damage to piers and some homes occurred in the capital, Lima. In some areas, boat owners dragged their boats onto shore to prevent the waves from damaging them. \c\cDespite the warnings from officials, some residents in California strayed too close to the sea where they were swept by strong surges, such as the situation at San Gregorio, California, where four fishermen were swept out to sea by the tsunami. Two of the men were injured and received medical treatment, while another two were rescued and unhurt. Another woman was rescued and treated by medical workers at China Beach. San Francisco firefighters and the U.S. Coast Guard rescued three surfers. \c\cMinor material damage occurred on the coast of Penco in Chile's Biobío Region. In Coquimbo, six people were trapped in a train in Coliumo when a wave struck. No casualties were reported due to the evacuations. A State of Precaution is still in place in Atacama, Coquimbo, Ñuble and Biobío as of January 16. \c\cRescue operations are currently underway at Atatā Island, which is located off the main Tongan island near Nukuʻalofa, after the small island was reportedly submerged by the tsunami. \c\cNew Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are discussing the provision of aid to Tonga. Ardern described the events in Tonga as "hugely concerning". On 16 January 2022, she announced New Zealand was donating NZ$500,000, which was "very much the starting point". The Royal New Zealand Navy was preparing to sail and a RNZAF P-3 Orion would be sent on a reconnaissance flight as soon as it was safe to do so. The ash cloud was estimated at 19,000 m (62,000 ft) tall, well above the Orion's service ceiling. The C-130H Hercules airlift is ready to serve as well. Following reports of no continued ashfall in Tonga, the P-3 Orion left RNZAF Base Auckland for Tonga on the morning of 17 January. \c\cTonga has accepted an offer by the Australian government of a surveillance flight to assess the damage. A Boeing P-8 Poseidon and Lockheed C-130 Hercules of the Australian Defence Force departed on the morning of 17 January 2022 for Tonga to survey damage to roadways, ports and power lines. The Australian government will coordinate its assistance with New Zealand.
On January 15, 2022, Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old British Pakistani armed with a pistol, took four people hostage in the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, United States, during a Sabbath service. Hostage negotiations ensued, in which Akram demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani national and al-Qaeda operative imprisoned in nearby Fort Worth for attempted murder and other crimes. He released one hostage after six hours, while the remaining three hostages escaped eleven hours into the standoff. Tactical officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team subsequently entered the synagogue, and fatally shot Akram. \c\cCongregation Beth Israel is a Reform Jewish synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, a suburb 15 miles (24 km) northeast of Fort Worth in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The congregation was initially a chavurah established in 1999 with 25 families; a religious school with 75 children was founded shortly afterward. After in its early years holding its services at rented facilities, Congregation Beth Israel opened a synagogue of its own in 2004. The congregation is smaller than other Jewish congregations in the area; at the time of the incident, the congregation had around 140 members. The synagogue's rabbi, Charlie Cytron-Walker, is originally from Lansing, Michigan. He became the congregation's rabbi in 2006, and he is known for his work in interfaith relations. \c\cClergy and staff at the synagogue had taken courses for a number of  years through the FBI, the Anti-Defamation League, the Colleyville Police Department, and Secure Community Network in order to prepare for the possibility of an intruder. Cytron-Walker credited the information learned in the courses with saving the hostages\' lives. \c\cMalik Faisal Akram was a 44-year-old British citizen originally from Blackburn, Lancashire, in North West England. During negotiations, he said that he had six children. A brother of Akram said that he had undiagnosed mental health issues that were well-known to the Blackburn community, and that three months prior to the incident, a younger sibling had died. \c\cIn September 2001, Akram was banned from Blackburn's magistrates\' court for threatening staff on a number of occasions, including on days when he was not due in court. His final threat was made on September 12, when he said that he wished that a court usher had been killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks the day before. Akram had a criminal record in the UK, which included a drug deal-linked assault, violent disorder, and driving offenses. A community organizer in Blackburn said that Akram served a custodial sentence in England. \c\cThe Times of London reported that Akram been referred to Prevent, a voluntary British counter-radicalization program, in 2016 and 2019 amid concerns about his views; it was unclear whether Akram took part in the program. After he spent six months in Pakistan in 2020, Akram was investigated by the MI5, the British security service. He was on a watchlist as a "subject of interest" in a four-week MI5 "short lead investigation"; by 2021, he was moved to a "former subject of interest" list, having been no longer considered a terrorist threat. Akram was not on any U.S. watchlists. \c\cAkram entered the U.S. from the United Kingdom on December 27, 2021, two weeks prior to the incident, at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, listing a Queens hotel as his local address on a customs form. He was checked against law enforcement databases and did not raise any red flags. Investigators believe that Akram lied on his tourist visa waiver, which requires applicants to disclose criminal records. \c\cAfter his arrival, he traveled to Dallas, Texas, apparently by air on December 31, 2021, and intermittently stayed in at least two local homeless shelters between January 2 and 11, 2022. While there, he was described, by an official at one of the shelters, as quiet and not being there long enough to build any relationships. On January 5, he arrived at the Islamic Center of Irving to pray, but he was then kicked out after becoming belligerent over not being able to sleep inside the building, per "city ordinances prohibiting overnight guests". Mosque officials described him as behaving erratically, but without any indication of potential violence. Akram returned the next day to apologize, and the mosque allowed him to pray inside; officials said that he was like a different person on that day and that his demeanor was a "flip flop in the behavior in the extremes."\c\cInvestigators determined that Akram purchased a handgun on the street, from someone he met at the Union Gospel Mission, one of the shelters he stayed at. His movements on January 12–15 were unclear. \c\cAafia Siddiqui is a Pakistani neuroscientist and alleged al-Qaeda operative formerly dubbed "Lady al-Qaeda". She is currently being held in the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, a women's federal prison in Fort Worth, while serving an 86-year sentence for attempted murder and other crimes. After being on the U.S. most wanted fugitives list for five years, Siddiqui was arrested in 2008 by Afghan police in Afghanistan, carrying handwritten notes plotting a "mass casualty attack", along with explosive and poisonous substances, and a list of possible targets in New York City and methods. \c\cAccording to U.S. authorities, in 2001, Siddiqui married Ammar al-Baluchi, an accused al-Qaeda member and the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was the ringleader of the September 11 attacks. Siddiqui was convicted in a jury trial in a U.S. federal court in 2010 of attempting to kill a U.S. Army captain while in Afghan custody; armed assault; using and carrying a firearm; and three counts of assault on U.S. officers and employees. \c\cFor years, Siddiqui has been a cause célèbre in Islamist militant circles and in Pakistan, where she is depicted as a martyr and heroine. The Islamist terrorist groups al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Islamic State (Daesh) have all unsuccessfully tried to negotiate Siddiqui's release at various times, as a condition for them releasing foreign hostages. The Islamic State sought to trade kidnapped American journalist James Foley for her; after the U.S. government declined, the Islamic State beheaded Foley. \c\cDuring her trial, Siddiqui made antisemitic statements and asked that there not be any Jewish people on the jury, going so far as to demand genetic tests on jurors at one point, to determine if they were Jewish. She later claimed she was not against all "Israeli Americans". After her sentencing by the U.S. court for a crime against Americans, she said, "This is a verdict coming from Israel and not from America. That's where the anger belongs."\c\cAccording to The Daily Telegraph, Congregation Beth Israel is the nearest synagogue to where Siddiqui is being held. \c\cAt around 10:00 a.m. on January 15, 2022, Akram entered Congregation Beth Israel by knocking on a window and posing as a homeless man seeking shelter. He was welcomed inside by Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, who made him a cup of hot tea. Cytron-Walker said after his rescue that he was not initially suspicious of Akram, but he was "curious" after some of his story did not add up. Cytron-Walker introduced Akram to Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue's board of trustees, who said Akram was calm and on the phone at the time. \c\cDuring Sabbath prayer, Cytron-Walker turned his back on the congregation to pray towards Jerusalem, and he then heard a click, which turned out to be Akram's pistol. Akram then began taking hostages in the synagogue. A total of four hostages, including Cytron-Walker and Cohen, were held captive. As he was being taken hostage, Cohen secretly dialed 9-1-1 and placed his phone down on its screen before moving as commanded. The Colleyville Police Department first received a 9-1-1 call reporting the situation at 10:41 a.m., and an officer responded to the scene minutes later. \c\cA report that hostages had been taken at Congregation Beth Israel was made public at around 11:30 a.m. via a tweet from the Colleyville Police Department, which said a SWAT team was on the scene. Police were later assisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Texas Department of Public Safety. Law enforcement evacuated the neighborhood in the vicinity of the crime scene. Ultimately, more than 200 local, state, and federal law enforcement officers and agents responded to the scene, including a team of around 70 FBI hostage negotiators and rescue operatives who flew in from Quantico, Virginia. \c\cA livestream of the synagogue's services on its Facebook page streamed the ongoing situation, including the forceful taking of hostages. In the livestream, Akram could be heard speaking to authorities, who attempted to negotiate with him. At one point, Akram claimed (apparently falsely) to have a bomb. The livestream also streamed Akram saying that he had flown to the city where Siddiqui was imprisoned with the intent of taking hostages. He also said that he chose to take hostages in a synagogue because the U.S. "only cares about Jewish lives" and because "Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks."\c\cDuring the incident, Akram demanded that Siddiqui be released from prison and referred to her as "sister". He believed Siddiqui was "framed." Siddiqui's lawyer said her client had no involvement in the incident. A brother of Akram's was involved in the negotiations, speaking to his brother from a Blackburn Greenbank police station, having been taken to its incident room to liaise with the FBI and negotiators. He later wrote that their whole family condemned Akram's actions. The brother urged him to release the hostages and surrender to police, but Akram said that he came to the synagogue with the intent to die. \c\cDuring negotiations, Akram was emotionally unstable and agitated. He ranted against the U.S., Israel, and Jews; used antisemitic and anti-Israeli epithets; and delivered a rambling condemnation of U.S. military conflicts overseas. He boasted about his desire for martyrdom and addressed fellow jihadists. He also threatened to kill the hostages, saying, "If anyone tries to enter this building, I\'m telling you... everyone will die," and "I\'m going to die. Don\'t cry about me...." At one point, Akram asked each hostage how many children they had, and then said to the hostage negotiator: "Do you want to have seven children lose their parent?" However, he also said "I don\'t wanna hurt \'em, yeah" in reference to the hostages. He allowed the hostages to call their families, and Cohen was able to write a post on Facebook. \c\cAkram said he would shoot hostages unless he spoke to a Jewish leader in New York. Just after 12:00 p.m., Akram called Central Synagogue in New York City and twice demanded to speak to Senior Rabbi Angela Buchdahl. While on the phone with Buchdahl, he said that he had a bomb, and asked her to use her position of influence to secure Siddiqui's release. Buchdahl immediately contacted law enforcement. Authorities suspect Akram chose to call Buchdahl because of her leadership position of a synagogue in New York City, where Siddiqui was convicted. \c\cAt around 12:30 p.m., the FBI took over hostage negotiations. At about 2:00 p.m., Facebook cut the livestream feed, but police were able to access the synagogue's closed-circuit television system and view the events in real time. Shortly after 5:00 p.m., Akram released one of the hostages. The man did not need medical attention. \c\cAs the standoff reached ten hours, and Siddiqui remained unreleased, the situation became dire. Cytron-Walker said Akram grew "increasingly belligerent and threatening." However, Cytron-Walker, Cohen, and the third remaining hostage saw that Akram was out of position, knew an exit was nearby, and positioned themselves nearby, one by one. When Akram then ordered them to get on their knees, Cytron-Walker yelled at the others to run and threw a chair at Akram while the others fled towards the exit. All three hostages escaped, and no shots were fired by Akram. Video taken outside the synagogue by WFAA just before 9:15 p.m. showed the hostages sprinting out of the building while being followed by Akram, who then withdrew into the building. Cytron-Walker credited security courses he had taken for helping the captives figure out the right moment to flee. \c\cAfter the hostages fled the building, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team was seen surrounding another part of the synagogue. At around 9:21 p.m., the FBI Hostage Rescue used a stun grenade to attempt to disorient Akram. Electricity was cut to the synagogue, and agents breached the building. Within seconds, Akram was fatally shot by FBI agents. \c\cAt around 9:30 p.m., after an 11-hour standoff, all remaining hostages were confirmed to have been recovered unharmed. After the synagogue was secured, the building was swept by the FBI's Evidence Response Team and bomb technicians. No explosives aside from police entry tools were found at the scene. \c\cThe FBI's North Texas Joint Terrorism Task Force coordinated the investigation. Immediately after the incident, an official initially said Akram's demands were "specifically focused on issues not connected to the Jewish community". The statement attracted criticism for downplaying antisemitism as a possible motive, given Akram's selection of a synagogue as a target, and Siddiqui's antisemitic beliefs. In an official FBI statement made on January 17, it said the incident was "a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted". British counterterrorism police are assisting the U.S. authorities. The UK's Foreign Office confirmed Akram was a British national. \c\cThe FBI believes that Akram acted alone, and Matthew DeSarno, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office, said there was no indication that the man was part of any broader plan. DeSarno also said the investigation into the incident will have "global" reach, and he confirmed that the FBI Shooting Incident Review Team "will conduct a thorough, factual, and objective investigation of the events." A day after the incident, President Joe Biden said Akram was armed with guns, but his claim of being armed with a bomb was not true. Akram's motive for the hostage-taking was his anger over the U.S. imprisonment of Siddiqui; a U.S. official said that the hostage situation deteriorated in its final hours in part because Akram "became increasingly skeptical that the FBI would accede to his demands to free Siddiqui."\c\cOfficials told The Washington Post that "investigators in the United States and England have been able to retrieve a significant amount of electronic data about Akram's movements and interests in the days before he came to the synagogue, including a number of Internet searches he conducted as he looked for a target."\c\cThe day after the incident, Akram's two teenage sons were apprehended in south Manchester, North West England, by officers from Counter Terror Policing North West. They were subsequently released without being charged. On January 20, two men were arrested in Manchester and Birmingham, West Midlands, as part of the investigation into the Colleyville incident. \c\cCytron-Walker expressed gratitude and thanks "for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us."\c\cOfficials in the White House monitored the situation, and President Joe Biden called it "an act of terror" and said, "We will stand against antisemitism and against the rise of extremism in this country." British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss condemned the incident, calling it an antisemitic act of terror. Livia Link, the Israeli Consul General in Houston, Texas, attended the scene, and the Israeli government established contact with U.S. law enforcement regarding the situation. \c\cThe Washington Post reported that the incident had shaken Jewish communities in the U.S. and around the world, and Haaretz reported that Jewish leaders condemned an FBI official's initial suggestion that the incident may not have been antisemitic. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, recounting the series of recent attacks on American Jews, said a "bullseye is being drawn on the backs of Jews in the United States." Many synagogues and other Jewish institutions increased security measures. \c\cMany Muslim community leaders and Islamic organizations in Texas condemned the actions of the hostage-taker and expressed their support for the synagogue in the wake of the hostage incident. The Council on American–Islamic Relations, which has called for the release of Siddiqui and asserted that she is innocent, condemned the incident as "an act of pure evil" and expressed support and prayers with the people being held hostage in the synagogue. The attorney who represents Siddiqui said she had "absolutely no involvement with [the hostage crisis]" and that they condemn the incident. The Muslim community of Blackburn, the hometown of Akram, expressed their in solidarity with the Jewish community and stated, "our sympathy goes out to the hostages and the rest of the Jewish community". \c\cDuring the aftermath of the hostage-taking, the Anti-Defamation League released a report documenting conspiracy theories and antisemitic responses to the crisis, including false claims that the incident was an inside job by the U.S. government. Supporters of the American radical right political conspiracy theory movement QAnon termed the survivors "crisis actors" and the incident a false flag operation. The document also criticized Islamophobic reactions to the incident, such as the use of the slur Paki. Far-right political commentator Gavin McInnes posted that "maybe we should consider cutting Islam out of our \'interfaith\' communities", which the ADL denounced as Islamophobic. The ADL issued resources to counter hate and misinformation.
The 2022 Al-Hasakah prison attack is an ongoing large-scale Islamic State attack aimed at freeing arrested fighters of the Islamic State from Ghuwayran prison in the city of Al-Hasakah from the Kurdish Administration of northern Syria.The attack was termed by the SOHR as the largest attack committed by the Islamic State since it lost it's last key Syrian territory in 2019. \c\cThe first wave of the attack occurred late at night on 20 January, when Islamic State forces launched a car bomb attack targeting the prison whilst Islamic State ground fighters began to open fire on the prison with heavy weapons. \c\cThe attack triggered a prison riot where the prisoners successfully managed to obtain weaponry from the armoury and then began a full blown attack on the prison staff. The prison was subsequently occupied by armed prisoners and several prisoners managed to escape. \c\cClashes continued into the next day, by which Islamic State fighters had spread to the Al-Zouhour area of Al-Hasakah city as well as solidified control of the Ghuwayran prison. In an effort to support Kurdish forces fighting in the city, forces of the International Coalition had dispatched military aircraft to the area. \c\cSDF forces also announced that they had managed to track down and arrest 89 of the prisoners that had escaped the prison. It was also reported that the electricity to several parts of Al-Hasakah city had been cut off due to the clashes. During the clashes, it was reported that U.S fighter jets had conducted 2 airstrikes on Islamic State held buildings in the city. \c\cThe SOHR reported that clashes continued between Islamic State and Kurdish forces over control of the prison and its surrounding areas."}
COVID-19 vaccination in Singapore is an ongoing immunisation campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in response  to the ongoing pandemic in the country. Singapore is currently the most-vaccinated country in the world, with more than 88% of its total population (and more than 91% of its eligible populace) having completed their vaccination regimen. \c\cThe Singapore Government invested more than one billion Singapore dollars to sign advanced purchase agreements and made early down payments on promising vaccine candidates, such as Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and CoronaVac. \c\cOn 5 October 2020, the Singapore Government appointed a 14-member Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, which was to advise and assess on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for use in Singapore. On 24 December 2020, the Expert Committee submitted its recommendations on the overall vaccination strategy of Singapore to the government. In its recommendations, they highlighted that two groups of people had to be priortised for vaccination: people who are at high risk of infection, the frontline healthcare workers; and people who are vulnerable of severe diseases and complications from infections, the elderly. The Committee continued to advise on the use of vaccines as the pandemic continues. It recommended booster shots for people above 60 of age as evidence of declining effacy of vaccination over time emerged, and updated recommendations for those with mild skin reactions after first dosage to continue their vaccination programme. \c\cOn 14 December 2020, Singapore became the first Asian country to approve Pfizer-BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine. The first shipment of the vaccine arrived seven days later on 21 December. \c\cSingapore also received its first shipment of Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac vaccine, on 22 December 2020. However, the vaccine was not authorised for use by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). On 2 June 2021, MOH approved the Sinovac vaccine for used in private healthcare settings so people, who are not suitable to take the mRNA vaccines, can take the Sinovac vaccine. However, since the China-made vaccine is not part of the national programme, those who choose to receive it will not be eligible for the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP) should they develop any adverse reactions. \c\cOn 30 December 2020, Singapore became the first country in Asia to start its COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The vaccine is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. Health workers, other frontline workers and seniors were the first inoculated with the vaccine jointly developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, Singapore also became the first country in Asia to approve Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, jointly developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and Moderna. \c\cOn 18 May, the Health Ministry announced that those who register for COVID-19 vaccination from 19 May onwards will have their second dose scheduled six to eight weeks after the first, instead of three to four weeks later. This change in strategy was aimed to have 400,000 more people in Singapore to be given at least one vaccine dose by end-July so that virtually all eligible Singapore residents will get at least one dose by early August. However, as vaccine supplies continue to arrive as planned and most of the population who are willing to take the vaccine will have received their first dose by the second half of July, MOH announced on 29 June that the interval between the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine would revert to four weeks. This was part of the efforts to ensure that more of the population will be fully vaccinated earlier. On 9 July, it was announced that the interval between doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would be further shortened to 3 weeks. It was further added that those who had previously taken a vaccine not approved under the National Vaccination Programme would be advised to take 2 doses of the approved ones. \c\cThe Health Sciences Authority (HSA) also approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for children aged 12 to 15; previously, it was given only to those aged 16 years and above. It was granted interim authorization by the HSA under the Pandemic Special Access Route in December 2020. \c\cOn 24 June, the Health Ministry concluded a purchase agreement with Novavax for its non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, with shipments expected to arrive in Singapore before the end of 2021. \c\cOn 28 July, IHH Healthcare Singapore obtained approval to import the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine (BBIBP-CorV) via the special access route (SAR). The SAR was set up on 31 May to allow individuals to choose vaccines not under the national inoculation program. \c\cOn 2 August, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary announced in Parliament that those who suffered allergic reactions after receiving the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will be invited to receive the Sinovac CoronaVac vaccine and will be deemed as fully vaccinated individuals. \c\cOn 6 August, the Health Ministry announced it shall recognize all COVID-19 vaccines listed under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) starting from 10 August 2021. This means that Singapore recognizes all individuals that have been inoculated with a WHO-approved vaccine as fully vaccinated individuals and shall be accorded vaccination-differentiated safe management measures and travel concessions. \c\cOn 20 September, an additional 101,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine was delivered. \c\cOn 23 October, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) granted interim authorization under the Pandemic Special Access Route for the CoronaVac vaccine under a three-dose regime, following which it was included in the National Vaccination Programme. Those who are ineligible to take either of the approved mRNA vaccines would be invited for this vaccine and eligible for the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP). \c\cOn 10 December, the Health Sciences Authority approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 with the first shots to be given by end-2021. At the same time, Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is approved for full registration. The first shipment of the paediatric vaccine arrived seven days later on 22 December with the first shots given on 27 December. \c\cSingapore started the rolling out of booster shots for senior citizens above 60 years of age from 14 September 2021. Subsequently, from 4 October, it will start giving booster shots for the eligible population above 50 years of age, followed by individuals above 30 years of age from 9 October. The eligible population should have their second dose taken before 6 months. From 24 November, eligible population who completed their second dose before 5 months can get booster shots for all age groups. On 10 December, the use of booster shots is extended to individuals above 18 years of age starting from 14 December. From 14 March 2022, children aged 12 to 17 will need to get a booster shot within 270 days of receiving their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. \c\cOn 19 August 2021, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) shall issue a tamper-proof vaccination sticker that is to be pasted onto their travel documents and can serve as proof of vaccination. The issuance of this special sticker will be limited to travelers who have been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the presentation of a valid English-language vaccination certificate. \c\cOn 24 September 2021, Malaysian National Recovery Council chairman Muhyiddin Yassin confirmed that Malaysia and Singapore would recognise each other's vaccination certificates  in order to facilitate travel between the two countries."}
On January 15, 2022, Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old British Pakistani armed with a pistol, took four people hostage in the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, United States, during a Sabbath service. Hostage negotiations ensued, during which Akram demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani national and alleged al-Qaeda operative imprisoned in nearby Fort Worth for attempted murder and other crimes. He released one hostage after six hours, while the remaining three hostages escaped eleven hours into the standoff. Tactical officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team subsequently entered the synagogue and fatally shot Akram. \c\cCongregation Beth Israel is a Reform Jewish synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, a suburb 15 miles (24 km) northeast of Fort Worth in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The congregation was initially a chavurah established in 1999 with 25 families; a religious school with 75 children was founded shortly afterward. After in its early years holding its services at rented facilities, Congregation Beth Israel opened a synagogue of its own in 2004. The congregation is smaller than other Jewish congregations in the area; at the time of the incident, the congregation had around 140 members. The synagogue's rabbi, Charlie Cytron-Walker, is originally from Lansing, Michigan. He became the congregation's rabbi in 2006, and he is known for his work in interfaith relations. Cytron-Walker was already set to leave the congregation in June 2022 when the incident occurred. \c\cClergy and staff at the synagogue had taken courses for a number of  years through the FBI, the Anti-Defamation League, the Colleyville Police Department, and Secure Community Network in order to prepare for the possibility of an intruder. Cytron-Walker credited the information learned in the courses with saving the hostages\' lives. \c\cMalik Faisal Akram was a 44-year-old British citizen originally from Blackburn, Lancashire, in North West England. During negotiations, he said that he had six children. A brother of Akram said that he had undiagnosed mental health issues that were well-known to the Blackburn community, and that three months prior to the incident, a younger sibling had died. \c\cIn September 2001, Akram was banned from Blackburn's magistrates\' court for threatening staff on a number of occasions, including on days when he was not due in court. His final threat was made on September 12, when he said that he wished that a court usher had been killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks the day before. Akram had a criminal record in the UK, which included a drug deal-linked assault, violent disorder, and driving offenses. A community organizer in Blackburn said that Akram served a custodial sentence in England. \c\cThe Times of London reported that Akram been referred to Prevent, a voluntary British counter-radicalization program, in 2016 and 2019 amid concerns about his views; it was unclear whether Akram took part in the program. After he spent six months in Pakistan in 2020, Akram was investigated by the MI5, the British security service. He was on a watchlist as a "subject of interest" in a four-week MI5 "short lead investigation"; by 2021, he was moved to a "former subject of interest" list, having been no longer considered a terrorist threat. Akram was not on any U.S. watchlists. \c\cAafia Siddiqui is a Pakistani national and alleged al-Qaeda operative formerly dubbed "Lady al-Qaeda". She is currently being held in the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, a women's federal prison in Fort Worth, while serving an 86-year sentence for attempted murder and other crimes. After being on the U.S. most wanted fugitives list for five years, Siddiqui was arrested in 2008 by Afghan police in Afghanistan, carrying handwritten notes plotting a "mass casualty attack", along with explosive and poisonous substances, and a list of possible targets in New York City and methods. \c\cAccording to U.S. authorities, in 2001, Siddiqui married Ammar al-Baluchi, an accused al-Qaeda member and the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was the ringleader of the September 11 attacks. Siddiqui was convicted in a jury trial in a U.S. federal court in 2010 of attempting to kill a U.S. Army captain while in Afghan custody; armed assault; using and carrying a firearm; and three counts of assault on U.S. officers and employees. \c\cFor years, Siddiqui has been a cause célèbre in Islamist militant circles and in Pakistan, where she is depicted as a martyr and heroine. The Islamist terrorist groups al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Islamic State (Daesh) have all unsuccessfully tried to negotiate Siddiqui's release at various times, as a condition for them releasing foreign hostages. The Islamic State sought to trade kidnapped American journalist James Foley for her; after the U.S. government declined, the Islamic State beheaded Foley. \c\cDuring her trial, Siddiqui made antisemitic statements and asked that there not be any Jewish people on the jury, going so far as to demand genetic tests on jurors at one point, to determine if they were Jewish. She later claimed she was not against all "Israeli Americans". After her sentencing by the U.S. court for a crime against Americans, she said, "This is a verdict coming from Israel and not from America. That's where the anger belongs."\c\cAccording to The Daily Telegraph, Congregation Beth Israel is the nearest synagogue to where Siddiqui is being held. \c\cAkram entered the U.S. from the United Kingdom on December 27, 2021, two weeks prior to the incident, at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, listing a Queens hotel as his local address on a customs form. He was checked against law enforcement databases and did not raise any red flags. Investigators believe that Akram lied on his tourist visa waiver, which requires applicants to disclose criminal records. \c\cAkram then traveled to Dallas, Texas, apparently by air on December 31, 2021, and intermittently stayed in at least two local homeless shelters between January 2 and 11. While there, he was described, by an official at one of the shelters, as quiet and not being there long enough to build any relationships. On video dated January 2, Akram was captured being dropped off at one of the shelters by an unknown individual who stayed with him at the shelter for fifteen minutes and hugged him before departing. Investigators determined that Akram purchased a handgun on the street, from someone he met at the Union Gospel Mission Dallas, one of the shelters he stayed at. \c\cOn January 5, Akram arrived at the Islamic Center of Irving to pray, but he was then kicked out after becoming belligerent over not being able to sleep inside the building, per "city ordinances prohibiting overnight guests". Mosque officials described him as behaving erratically, but without any indication of potential violence. Akram returned the next day to apologize, and the mosque allowed him to pray inside; officials said that he was like a different person on that day and that his demeanor was a "flip flop in the behavior in the extremes." His movements on January 12–15 were unclear. \c\cAt around 10:00 a.m. on January 15, 2022, Akram entered Congregation Beth Israel by knocking on a window and posing as a homeless man seeking shelter. He was welcomed inside by Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, who made him a cup of hot tea. Cytron-Walker said after his rescue that he was not initially suspicious of Akram, but he was "curious" after some of his story did not add up. Cytron-Walker introduced Akram to Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue's board of trustees, who said Akram was calm and on the phone at the time. \c\cDuring Sabbath prayer, Cytron-Walker turned his back on the congregation to pray towards Jerusalem, and he then heard a click, which turned out to be Akram's pistol. A yelling Akram then began taking hostages in the synagogue. A total of four hostages, including Cytron-Walker and Cohen, were held captive. As he was being taken hostage, Cohen secretly dialed 9-1-1 and placed his phone down on its screen before moving as commanded. The Colleyville Police Department first received a 9-1-1 call reporting the situation at 10:41 a.m., and an officer responded to the scene minutes later. \c\cA report that hostages had been taken at Congregation Beth Israel was made public at around 11:30 a.m. via a tweet from the Colleyville Police Department, which said a SWAT team was on the scene.

Electricity was cut to the synagogue, and agents breached the building at around 9:22 p.m. Within seconds, the agents shot Akram multiple times, killing him. \c\cAt around 9:30 p.m., after an 11-hour standoff, all remaining hostages were confirmed to have been recovered unharmed. After the synagogue was secured, the building was swept by the FBI's Evidence Response Team and bomb technicians. No explosives aside from police entry tools were found at the scene. \c\cThe FBI's North Texas Joint Terrorism Task Force coordinated the investigation. Immediately after the incident, an official initially said Akram's demands were "specifically focused on issues not connected to the Jewish community". The statement attracted criticism for downplaying antisemitism as a possible motive, given Akram's selection of a synagogue as a target, and Siddiqui's antisemitic beliefs. In an official FBI statement made on January 17, it said the incident was "a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted". British counterterrorism police are assisting the U.S. authorities. \c\cThe FBI believes that Akram acted alone, and Matthew DeSarno, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office, said there was no indication that the man was part of any broader plan. DeSarno also said the investigation into the incident will have "global" reach, and he confirmed that the FBI Shooting Incident Review Team "will conduct a thorough, factual, and objective investigation of the events." A day after the incident, President Joe Biden said Akram was armed with guns, but his claim of being armed with a bomb was not true. Akram's motive for the hostage-taking was his anger over the U.S. imprisonment of Siddiqui; a U.S. official said that the hostage situation deteriorated in its final hours in part because Akram "became increasingly skeptical that the FBI would accede to his demands to free Siddiqui."\c\cAmerican and British investigators retrieved electronic data about Akram's movements and interests in the days before he came to the synagogue. Over the two weeks leading up to the incident, Akram's Internet search history revealed that he looked up information about influential rabbis, Siddiqui, gun stores, and pawnshops. \c\cThe day after the incident, Akram's two teenage sons were apprehended in south Manchester, North West England, by officers from Counter Terror Policing North West. They were subsequently released without being charged. On January 20, two men were arrested in Manchester and Birmingham, West Midlands, as part of the investigation into the Colleyville incident. \c\cCytron-Walker expressed gratitude and thanks "for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us."\c\cOfficials in the White House monitored the situation, and President Joe Biden called it "an act of terror" and said, "We will stand against antisemitism and against the rise of extremism in this country." British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss condemned the incident, calling it an antisemitic act of terror. Livia Link, the Israeli Consul General in Houston, Texas, attended the scene, and the Israeli government established contact with U.S. law enforcement regarding the situation. \c\cThe Washington Post reported that the incident had shaken Jewish communities in the U.S. and around the world, and Haaretz reported that Jewish leaders condemned an FBI official's initial suggestion that the incident may not have been antisemitic. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, recounting the series of recent attacks on American Jews, said a "bullseye is being drawn on the backs of Jews in the United States." Many synagogues and other Jewish institutions increased security measures. \c\cMany Muslim community leaders and Islamic organizations in Texas condemned the actions of the hostage-taker and expressed their support for the synagogue in the wake of the hostage incident. The Council on American–Islamic Relations, which has called for the release of Siddiqui and asserted that she is innocent, condemned the incident as "an act of pure evil" and expressed support and prayers with the people being held hostage in the synagogue. The attorney who represents Siddiqui said she had "absolutely no involvement with [the hostage crisis]" and that they condemn the incident. The Muslim community of Blackburn, the hometown of Akram, expressed their solidarity with the Jewish community and stated, "our sympathy goes out to the hostages and the rest of the Jewish community". \c\cDuring the aftermath of the hostage-taking, the Anti-Defamation League released a report documenting conspiracy theories and antisemitic responses to the crisis, including false claims that the incident was an inside job by the U.S. government. Supporters of the American radical right political conspiracy theory movement QAnon termed the survivors "crisis actors" and the incident a false flag operation. The document also criticized Islamophobic reactions to the incident, such as the use of the slur Paki. Far-right political commentator Gavin McInnes posted that "maybe we should consider cutting Islam out of our \'interfaith\' communities", which the ADL denounced as Islamophobic. The ADL issued resources to counter hate and misinformation.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Romania is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Romania on 26 February 2020, when the first case in Gorj County was confirmed. \c\cAs of 22 January 2022[update], the National Institute of Public Health has reported around 2,000,000 cases, 1,800,000 recoveries, and 59,000 COVID-19-related deaths. More than 11.5 million RT-PCR tests and more than 6.8 million rapid antigen tests have been processed. \c\cAn anti-COVID-19 vaccination campaign, part of a global effort to slow down the spread of the virus, started on 27 December 2020. As of 16 December 2021[update], 46.5% of the country's eligible population received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. \c\cOn 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. \c\cUnlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. \c\cOn 21 February, following a COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, the Romanian government announced a 14-day quarantine for citizens returning from the affected regions. \c\cOn 22 February, the Romanian government announced several preventive measures including designation of five hospitals as isolation centres for new cases, purchase and placement of thermal scanners in international airports and specially designated lines for passengers coming from areas affected by COVID-19 outbreak. \c\cOn 25 February, new measures were imposed. Upon arrival on the Romanian territory, all asymptomatic travelers from the affected areas, respectively Hubei, the 11 localities in Italy, and any remaining passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship will go directly to the quarantine, for a period for 14 days. The other people coming from the Lombardy and Veneto regions will enter voluntary isolation at home for 14 days, upon arrival in Romania. \c\cOn 26 February, the Minister of Education and Research required schools to spread awareness about coronavirus. \c\cOn 28 February, the Romanian Orthodox Church suggested that followers use their own spoons and avoid the traditional kissing of icons in church. \c\cOn 2 March, more preventive measures were taken by the National Committee for Special Emergency Situations. Thus, citizens arriving from other provinces or cities in mainland China, other localities in the Lombardy, Veneto or Emilia-Romagna regions of Italy, as well as areas and localities in South Korea and Iran not previously specified for institutionalised quarantine, enter 14 days of self-isolation at home immediately upon returning to Romania. \c\cOn 8 March, the Head of the Department for Emergency Situations, Raed Arafat, announced a ban on all indoor or outdoor activities involving the participation of more than 1,000 people (these numbers were subsequently changed, see below). These restrictions are valid until 31 March, when a new assessment would be made. After Northern Italy was put under quarantine on 8 March, low-cost airline Wizz Air suspended all flights to Treviso and Bergamo until 3 April. Likewise, Blue Air cancelled all flights to and from Milan for 8 and 9 March. In the same day, flights from and to Italy have been suspended. In a press conference, Interior Minister Marcel Vela stated that if a school reports even a case, courses will be suspended throughout the school. \c\cOn 9 March, officials announced the cessation of flights to and from Italy, at all airports in the country, until 23 March. On the same day, the National Committee for Special Emergency Situations has decided to close all schools in Romania, from 11 March until 22, with the possibility of extending the measure. All bus rides and rail transport to and from Italy were suspended from 10 to 31 March. The committee also decided to establish a series of obligations for food units and for public and private providers of passenger transport, such as frequent disinfection of surfaces, avoiding crowds in commercial spaces, frequent disinfection of the passenger compartment in the means of transport, etc. \c\cOn 11 March, the Government published a list of fifteen guidelines regarding the "responsible social behavior in preventing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19)". The authorities have imposed a ban on sports, scientific, religious, cultural or entertainment events with over 100 participants in closed spaces until 31 March. Likewise, the public activities for museums were suspended until 31 March. \c\cOn 12 March, Serbian authorities closed seven border points with Romania to prevent the spread of coronavirus. On the same day, the Romanian Ombudsman asked President Klaus Iohannis to declare the state of emergency and the Romanian Parliament to approve it. In a televised statement, the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Health, Nelu Tătaru, said that the current situation does not impose such an extreme measure. The Romanian Football Federation decided to postpone all football matches in Romania until 31 March. Interior Minister Marcel Vela announced that the border crossing points with low traffic have been closed so that employees there to be directed to high traffic posts. Health Minister Victor Costache issued an order prohibiting the export of medicines and medical equipment for six months. \c\cOn 13 March, Vergil Chițac [ro], former admiral, who acts as an independent in the PNL senators\' group, was diagnosed with COVID-19. He isolated himself after finding out that a French parliamentarian, with whom he had been traveling to Brussels, was found with coronavirus. On 9 March, Chițac attended a party meeting with over 100 people. Parliamentary sources claim that he was also present in the Senate on 12 March, when he attended the group and plenary sessions. In these conditions, all members of the National Political Bureau of PNL self-isolated at home. Interim Prime-minister Ludovic Orban announced that all PNL senators have an obligation to isolate themselves and that he will self-isolate at Vila Lac 1. He also announced that all ministers will be tested for coronavirus and self-isolate. \c\cOn 14 March, after over 101 people had been diagnosed with coronavirus, Romania entered the third COVID-19 scenario. The third scenario goes from 101 to 2,000 cases. In the third scenario the doctors will perform epidemiological screening in the tents installed in the hospitals\' yards, and the hospitals of infectious diseases will treat only cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Likewise, the authorities will be able to impose quarantine at home, not just in hospitals, as in many areas the capacities of medical units could be exceeded. At the same time, according to the plan in the third scenario, public gatherings with more than 50 people are banned. Three more liberals have been diagnosed with COVID-19, all contacts of senator Vergil Chițac. Marcel Ciolacu, President of the Chamber of Deputies, announced that the Parliament will suspend its activity for a week. However, the activities will be carried out online. The same day, President Klaus Iohannis announced his decision to decree the state of emergency in Romania starting 16 March. \c\cOn 16 March, Iohannis issued the decree establishing the state of emergency in Romania for a period of 30 days and insisted that the implementation of the measures included in the decree is being made gradually. The schools will be closed during the state of emergency. If necessary, prices may be capped on medicines and medical equipment, on strictly necessary foods and on public utility services (electricity and heat, gas, water supply, sanitation, fuels, etc.). Also, gradual measures can be taken, if the situation gets worse, only after an evaluation of the National Committee for Special Emergency Situations. These include temporary closure of restaurants, hotels, cafes, clubs, gradual closure of borders, or limiting or prohibiting the movement of vehicles or people in/to certain areas. On 19 March, the Parliament convened a joint online session and unanimously adopted the decree issued by Iohannis. \c\cUntil 17 March, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitated the return to the country for 137 Romanians who were abroad, either as tourists, in transit, or in medical emergency situations and who were directly affected by the measures adopted by the states in which they were. Later that same day, the government issued its first Military Ordinance, in response to the ongoing health crisis. Four days later, on 21 March, a second Military Ordinance was issued: no groups larger than 3 people on the streets. Curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. All shopping centres were closed, except for the sale of food, veterinary or pharmaceutical products and cleaning services. It is forbidden for foreign citizens and stateless persons to enter Romanian territory, except through the specially organised transit corridor, further exceptions being made for other categories, such as residents, family members, and others. \c\cOn 22 March, the first three deaths were reported in Romania. All three had preexisting conditions: one was on dialysis, one had terminal lung cancer, and one had diabetes. The next day, on 23 March, Suceava's main hospital, the Saint John the New Emergency County Hospital of Suceava [ro], one of the largest in the country, reported at least seventy medical personnel infected with COVID-19, and 2 patients passing away. Over the following days, their numbers would increase. The hospital director was dismissed, shortly thereafter, for mismanagement. \c\cFollowing a surge in new confirmed cases, on 24 March, the government announced Military Ordinance No.3, instituting a national lockdown and calling in the military to support police and Gendarmerie personnel in enforcing the new restrictions. Movement outside the home or household is prohibited, with some exceptions (work, buying food or medicine etc.). People over 65 were allowed to leave their homes only between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Two days later, on 26 March, the state airline TAROM suspended all internal flights. \c\cA fourth Military Ordinance has been issued on 29 March, further strengthening previously imposed fines and restrictions. Two more would soon follow, issued close to the end of the next day; namely, a fifth, extending the ban on international travel, and a sixth, placing Suceava, along with eight adjacent communes, under total quarantine, the first Romanian city to be placed under complete lockdown since the start of the outbreak in late February, holding over a quarter of all infected cases, and about two-thirds of all infected medical personnel. Some hospital staff have quit, others have signed a petition stating they "are sent to death barehanded". \c\cOn 2 April, Harghita reported its first case, becoming the last county in Romania to report at least one case. \c\cOn 4 April, a seventh Military Ordinance was issued, further extending the national lockdown period, and imposing a second local quarantine on the town of Țăndărei, Ialomița County. On the same date, various counties and localities have started drafting local legislation requiring denizens to wear protection masks, whether professional or improvised. The next day, Raed Arafat posted an article on his official Facebook page, later picked up by the national media and other news outlets, encouraging citizens to wear protective masks, even if homemade. Prime minister Ludovic Orban, on the other hand, expressed doubts concerning not only the safety of homemade improvisations, but also about the necessary logistics for successfully implementing such a large scale operation, inasmuch as the demand would greatly outweigh the extant offer currently available on the market. \c\cOn 7 April, a 53-year-old paramedic from Suceava became the first reported casualty among Romanian medical personnel. As of 18 April, there were over a thousand infected medical staff in the country. \c\cOn 9 April, an eighth Military Ordinance came into effect, reinforcing previously adopted measures, prohibiting the export of certain basic foods, banning the commerce of majority share packages in the National Energetic System, recommending that residential buildings be equipped with sanitary products and that their stairways and elevators be periodically disinfected, and making provisions for various professional categories, such as fishing, apiculture, car service and dealership, the food market, pharmaceuticals, cross-border workers, social services, medical staff etc. A week later, on 16 April, a ninth Military Ordinance was issued. \c\cOn 21 April, over 300 new cases, representing two-thirds of the staff and patients of a local neuropsychiatric hospital, were reported in a village from Cornu Luncii commune in Suceava county, not belonging to those already placed under strict quarantine. On the previous day, Pimen Zainea, the Romanian Orthodox archbishop of Suceava, was flown into the Matei Balș Institute for Infectious Diseases in Bucharest, after testing positive for COVID-19, where he would pass away a month later. Saint John the New Monastery has been placed in lockdown, and an epidemiological investigation was initiated. \c\cOn 22 April, President Iohannis issued a press release, stating the government's intention to adopt, by mid-May, official legislation requiring citizens to wear surgical masks in public. That same day, Timișoara, Romania's third largest city, made the use of both facial masks and protection gloves mandatory in enclosed public spaces, including transportation. This decision came a week after Constanța, a major urban centre and one of the country's main tourist destinations, took similar measures on 15 April. \c\cOn 27 April, the tenth Military Ordinance came into effect. Except for work and medical emergency, people over 65 were only allowed to leave their homes between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. and between 7 p.m and 10 p.m. Two weeks later, on 11 May, an eleventh Military Ordinance lifted the Țăndărei quarantine. Two days later, a further Military Ordinance lifted the Suceava quarantine. On 14 May, a thirty-day state of alert was decreed, starting the following day, thus ending the stricter state of emergency, in force until that date. \c\cThe state of emergency ended on 14 May and was replaced by the state of alert, starting with 15 May, when the hairdressing salons, barbershops, dental offices and museums were reopened. Leaving the city of residence, possible only with a statement and reason and those who return to the country are isolated at home. The malls with an area under 15,000 sq m are reopened. \c\c250 thousand Romanians donated for the construction of the most modern modular coronavirus hospital. The hospital was ready in two weeks. \c\cArchbishop Theodosius of Thomis shared several children using the same teaspoon and the same chalice, defying the rules imposed by the authorities and the Holy Synod. \c\cNew sanctions from 1 July: suspension of the operating license for organizers of activities and events that do not comply with anti-COVID rules. \c\cImages with dozens of people singing and dancing, in Vama Veche, without taking into account the distance rules imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have appeared on social networks. The administrator of a club, fined 2,000 lei. \c\cTwo PSD deputies - Adrian Solomon and Irinel Stativa - refused to wear a mask in a fast food restaurant in sector 3 and quarreled with the police were fined and for not wearing a protective mask, according to the law on alert status . The announcement was made by the Capital Police, which states that in the meantime the images captured by the video cameras in the place were viewed. Parliamentarians were initially fined for causing a scandal. \c\cThe state of alert in Romania extended by 30 days, President Klaus Iohannis announced. He said no new restrictions would be imposed, but there would be no new easing measures. \c\cThe new restrictions that came into force on 1 August: The protective mask will be mandatory in open spaces, at certain time intervals, which will be set by the county authorities, and the premises with terrace will be open only until 23.00. Specifically, "the sale and consumption of food, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages in specially designated areas between 23.00 and 06.00 will be prohibited." The gambling halls will also be closed at the same time. \c\cThe National Committee for Emergency Situations has adopted Decision number 43 which provides for the reopening starting with 1 September 2020 of restaurants and cafes inside buildings, including in the case of accommodation units, the limitation at national level of the operation of terraces between 06.00- 24.00 and increasing the number of people who can participate in private events to 50 in an enclosed space, respectively 100 in an open space. However, the clubs and discos inside will remain closed. \c\cThe Ministry of Health has published the epidemiological analysis by counties and localities which shows the incidence rate of coronavirus infections per thousand inhabitants, essential data for the beginning of the new school year. The epidemiological criterion based on which the educational units / institutions establish one of the 3 scenarios is the cumulative incidence rate, respectively the total number of new cases in the last 14 days compared to 1000 inhabitants: Scenario 1 - green - school starts with the physical presence of all students - Incidence rate less than 1 per thousand inhabitants; Scenario 2 - yellow - hybrid scenario - Only students in grades VIII and XII will participate physically daily in classes, while the rest of the students will return partially (by rotation every 1-2 weeks). Incidence rate between 1 and 3 per thousand inhabitants; Scenario 3 - red - Online school only - Incidence rate higher than 3 per thousand inhabitants. \c\cThe resurgence in new infections, hospitalizations and deaths have resulted in imposing of new restrictions that took effect on 9 November. They included the closure of schools, a curfew between 23:00 and 5:00, the requirement of wearing face masks in both open and closed areas nationwide, and the closure of agri-food markets in closed areas. Remote working was encouraged where possible. Leaving the home or household during the curfew was prohibited, with some exceptions, while only gas stations, pharmacies, and economical operators with home delivery activities were allowed to operate after 21:00. \c\cThe Romanian authorities were criticized for not delaying the 2020 legislative elections past 6 December, as well as for the closure of agri-food markets and the lack of testing compared to other European countries. They\'ve defended their decisions by saying that "democracy cannot be put in parenthesis", that "agri-food markets in closed areas are super-spreaders", and that "there are no requests for testing". President Iohannis announced on 2 December that agri-food markets in closed areas would reopen beginning "the end of the current week (at the time of the issuing of the press release)". \c\cOn 27 December, at the same time as other member states of the European Union, in which Romania was a member of, the vaccination campaign had started, the process being divided into three phases. \c\cOn 28 December, the then-new Minister of Education, Sorin Cîmpeanu, announced the Ministry's intention to reopen schools starting 8 February, when the second semester would begin. This was conditioned by the evolution of the pandemic, if the number of new cases will surge after the Winter holidays or not, as well as by how other countries managed the situation. Until then, schools continued their activity online. \c\cThe first case with the more contagious British COVID-19 strain (Lineage B.1.1.7) was confirmed in Romania on 8 January, on a woman from Giurgiu County. She, however, did not travel outside Romania. It was followed by 16 other cases in an outbreak at the School No. 28 of Bucharest. \c\cOn 15 January, Romania entered the second phase of the process of vaccinating against COVID-19, when President Iohannis was vaccinated against the virus. \c\cOn 18 January, the National Committee for Emergency Situations had decided to exempt the people who have gotten the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at least 10 days prior to their arrival in Romania from countries considered high-risk. If the vaccinated person arrives in the country with their children, they would still have to remain in quarantine with them, because the vaccines that were authorized at the time cannot be administered on children. \c\cThe final decision on schools was made on 2 February. In a press release issued by President Klaus Iohannis on that day, he announced that schools will reopen on 8 February, based on local incidence rates, after a review of the epidemiological situation in Romania and of what other member states of the European Union do. Students would be tested for COVID-19 in school if it presents symptoms of the virus during courses, with the agreement of their parents. Cîmpeanu stated that the usage of transport services for school should not be a factor of transmission. \c\cOn 8 February, schools were reopened for the second time during the pandemic. Unlike in fall 2020, schoolwide restrictions based on the three scenarios were different. Thus, in the yellow scenario, unless the student attends primary education or is in a final year, every student attends courses exclusively online. Only primary school students would attend school physically in the red scenario. \c\cOn 10 February, prime minister Florin Cîțu announced that the incidence rate of COVID-19 cases would begin to include outbreaks in over 14 days from the announcement date, with the state of alert being prolonged with 30 more days. The following day, the first case among students who participate physically since 8 February was detected, on a girl in 2nd grade from Bucharest. Four other cases were detected at noon, which included one teacher, before the number of detected cases of infected students and school personnel began to surge throughout the day. In total, there were 244 students and 329 school personnel that were infected with COVID-19 since 8 February, all of which cases were, according to the Ministry of Education, based on infection in the week before the reopening of schools. In a press release on the same day, president Iohannis said that the situation is good after the reopening of schools. \c\cThe total number of infections in schools exceeded 1,000 by 17 February, when 600 students and 472 school personnel were reported to have been tested positive since the reopening. \c\cOn 18 February, MedLife announced that the Lineage B.1.1.7 strain had become the dominant variant in Romania's major cities and that it would most likely become the most frequent variant in the country in around 3-5 weeks. They\'ve analyzed 90 samples, and 50% of them contained the strain that originated from the United Kingdom. \c\cOn 24 February, the National Institute of Public Health had done an analysis on the evolution of the pandemic in Romania. They estimated a new resurgence in new infections, with the worst scenario being a rise by 4% in new cases, to a medium amount of almost 9,000 new infections per day by 20 March. The incidence rate of cases began including outbreaks from 26 February 2021, as announced earlier. \c\cOn 27 February, the Minister of Education Sorin Cîmpeanu proposed that students in the VIII and XII grades mandatorily go physically to school in localities in the red scenario, as they attend national exams during summer. The next day, the National Council of Students said it disapproves this idea due to the high-risk of infection in these localities and asked the Ministry to adopt a measure in which students/parents have the freedom to choose between physical and digital learning. \c\cThe third wave had become noticeable in statistics by 2 March. Experts say that the third wave would this time affect younger people more than adults. More counties and localities have entered the red scenario, in which several restrictive measures were taken, including closure of schools for students in the 8th and 12th grades, restaurants, cafes, gambling halls, cinemas and cultural institutions. \c\cOn 5 March, the first two cases of the South African variant, the Lineage B.1.351, were confirmed in Romania, in patients from Bucharest and Pitești respectively. The same day, the National Committee for Emergency Situations adopted Decision number 15 which modifies the common agreement between the Ministries of Health and Education on the functioning of schools during the pandemic, so that students in 8th and 12th grades are allowed to participate physically in school no matter what, unless the locality the school is located in is quarantined. A common agreement between the Ministries of Health and Education issued on the next day mentioned that only up to half of students of every class of 8th and 12th grades would physically attend school. In addition, face masks were no longer mandatory for during physical education (if in outdoor) and for preschoolers regardless of age. \c\cOn 8 March, the first two cases of the Brazilian variant were confirmed in Romania, both in Bucharest. \c\cOn 9 March, as the number of new cases in 24 hours was nearing 5,000, President Klaus Iohannis issued a press release, where he announced that the night curfew would begin an hour earlier, at 22:00 (10:00 pm). He also stated that there would never be a nationwide lockdown interfering with the Easter holidays of 2021 as a measure to curb the third wave of cases. \c\cOn 15 March, Romania entered the third phase of the process of vaccination against COVID-19. This is the final phase, in which the general population who meet the minimum eligibility age (16) would be vaccinated. \c\cOn 23 March, the Minister of Education Sorin Cîmpeanu announced the modification of the 2020–2021 school year structure so that students would be on holiday between 2 April and 4 May, to reduce mobility amid the third wave of infections. \c\cOn 25 March, the government announced a series of new restrictions. This included closure of gyms in localities where the incidence rate exceeded 4/1,000 inhabitants, while on Friday and at the weekend, the night curfew would begin at 20:00, with activity of economic operators allowed until 18:00. In localities where the incidence rate was over 7,5/1,000 inhabitants, imposed restrictions on Friday and the weekend would apply every day. The same day, Cîmpeanu announced that the school holiday would be interrupted between 12 and 29 April for students in their final years; all schools remained closed but remote learning would be enforced. In addition, the school holiday was set to end on 9 May for these students. \c\cThe fourth wave has been the most severe of all infection waves in the COVID-19 pandemic. Romania is the European Union member state with the second lowest percentage of fully-vaccinated people, after Bulgaria. Romania has been hitting record highs in the infections and deaths toll, occupying the 3rd place in new deaths and the 4th place in new infections worldwide on 13 October, and 2nd highest per capita COVID-19 death rate in the world as of 19 October 2021[update]. Roughly 13% of the 42,000 overall epidemic-related deaths have occurred in October, with the low vaccination rate exposing entrenched distrust in state institutions, misinformation campaigns, poor rural infrastructure and weak vaccine education. \c\cThe pressure on the Romanian healthcare system that reached its maximum capacity in the fourth wave led to the authorities asking the European Union for help through its Civil Protection Mechanism. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) was also concerned, with the fourth wave in Romania prompting them to have a teleconference with the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) on the matter on 18 October 2021. \c\cDespite the severity of this wave compared to others, the Romanian government had chosen to take a slightly more relaxed approach, unwilling to close the economy even partially in any way, shape or form. To avoid closures and radical restrictive measures, it had chosen to instead impose a digital green certificate requirement for some activities. Schools had been remaining open regardless of epidemiological situation, with Education Minister Sorin Cîmpeanu advocating strictly for the "close last, open first" strategy of school functioning. Schools would only close if at least half of its personnel and students were found infected, or at the directors\' request. The Public Health Directorate (DSP) of Ilfov, one of the most affected counties by the fourth wave with a incidence rate of over 15/1,000 on 13 October 2021, set school closures countywide for at least 14 days starting 18 October, a decision severely criticized by Cîmpeanu, who was accused shortly afterwards by parents of ignoring health authorities. In localities with incidence rate over 6/1,000, face masks have been required in outdoor areas, while a night curfew was imposed. Vaccinated people wouldn\'t be affected this time by the curfew, which would apply between 20:00 and 5:00, and the unvaccinated was required to stay home and not go out for unessential tasks. \c\cOn 8 January 2022 Romania reintroduces mandatory face mask wearing in outdoor and indoor public spaces, reduces the operating hours and capacity of bars, restaurants, cinemas, gyms, and sporting events, and also reduces the quarantine period, amid concern that the next wave of COVID-19 could overwhelm the health system. On 21 January Romania reports a record 19,649 new cases of COVID-19 and the next day has exceeded 2 million COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic. \c\cRomania received the first 10,000 vaccines against the virus on 26 December 2020 and officially started the vaccination campaign on Sunday, 27 December. The first person who took the vaccine was a nurse from the Matei Bals Institute for Infectious Diseases in Bucharest. She was soon followed by several hundred doctors and nurses from COVID-19 dedicated hospitals throughout the country. Romania has contracted about 10 million vaccines made by BioNTech-Pfizer. Vaccination is free of charge and non-mandatory. By 16 December 2021, Romania had the second lowest vaccination rate in the European Union, almost 47%. \c\cDuring the second week of March, the Bucharest Stock Exchange recorded losses on all five trading sessions, the main index BET collapsing by 17.6%, the steepest decline since December 2018. \c\cOn 16 March, the National Bank of Romania announced a reference rate of 4.8242 lei/euro, a historical maximum for the single European currency against the leu. The leu continued its depreciation, reaching a maximum of 4.9156 lei/euro on 30 March 2021. \c\cRomania's economy contracted by 4.7% in H1 of 2020, driven by a decline of 10.5% in Q2. On the demand side, exports of goods and services fell by 15.1% in H1 of 2020, as European trading partners were significantly affected by the crisis. Imports contracted less than exports (down 9.4%), leading to a 21% increase in the trade deficit in H1. The weakening of external demand from Europe alongside pandemic-related restrictions caused industry to contract by 14.1% in H1. The sharp decline in output led to deteriorating labor market conditions, with deeper effects noted for younger workers and women: job vacancies fell between Q1 and Q2 2020, while the unemployment rate increased to 5.4% in July from 4.1% in February. Job and household income losses were stemmed by the technical unemployment relief program, which covered 1.3 million beneficiaries during the state of emergency at a cost of approximately 370 million euros (0.2% of GDP). \c\cAccording to the autumn economic forecasts published on 5 November by the European Commission, Romania's economy would record a contraction of 5.2% in 2020, less severe than initially estimated, thanks to investments and construction works. Also, Romania's budget deficit was expected to increase significantly, up to 10.3% of GDP, in the context in which the fiscal effort needed to combat the crisis was added to the past fiscal slippages. Consequently, Romania's debt-to-GDP ratio was forecast to increase from 35.3% in 2019 to 46.7% in 2020. \c\cOn 9 March 2020, interim Prime Minister Ludovic Orban announced the closure of all schools between 11 and 22 March. The measure targeted all kindergartens, primary, secondary and high schools in Romania, both public and private, according to Education Minister Monica Anisie. The decision affected 3.5 million students. Likewise, several universities in the major student centres suspended their courses. These include the University of Bucharest, the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, the Politehnica University of Bucharest, the Babeș-Bolyai University and the West University of Timișoara, among others. Furthermore, Anisie announced that, as a measure of prevention and control of the illnesses with COVID-19 in schools, the Ministry of Education had decided to suspend all county and regional school olympiads, as well as sports competitions. Schools were closed suddenly, without any prior preparation. The Ministry of Education was constantly encouraging teachers to continue the educational process online, but they were not offered any support, on a national level. The Government made available a single resource on the national public television channel TVR, a show called Teleșcoală (Teleschool), in which children could observe mathematics, Romanian, biology, history and geography classes. The program was divided into two sections, between 9 and 10 a.m. courses for the 8th grade and between 3 and 4 p.m. courses for the 12th grade; the courses could be watched both on TV and on TVR's YouTube channel. In the first week of broadcasting, the program was watched by 1.3 million people, being the most watched TVR content between 16 and 21 March. \c\cOn 16 March, Anisie announced that schools would remain closed while the state of emergency was in place, at least until after the Easter holidays. \c\cOn 1 April, in response to a fake news story which had gained traction on social media and was being distributed on WhatsApp, saying that students would have to return to school in less than a week, Anisie and the Ministry of Education issued an official statement condemning the spread of false information and promised to provide in the next few days the date for the reopening of schools, as well as the national examinations. On 6 April, Anisie announced the cancellation of national exam simulations, as well as of all school competitions and olympiads. The Minister of Education said that the Baccalaureate and the National Evaluation would most likely be held in July, all of the examinations excluding the second semester curriculum. \c\cIn May, four months before the start of the new school year, the Government announced the purchase of 250,000 tablets to facilitate distance learning activities. For these tablets, the Government has allocated 150 million lei from the reserve fund, both for devices and internet services. Previously, Anisie stated that approximately 250,000 students do not have access to technology and thus cannot attend online courses. Of the 250,000 tablets, around 82,000 were purchased through the National Office for Centralized Acquisitions. As of November, just over 43,000 were distributed to students. \c\cA study conducted by World Vision Romania between 10 May and 27 June showed that approximately 40% of students in rural areas did not participate in online courses and only 64% of teachers organized such courses. Moreover, according to the same study, 1 in 4 rural schools does not have an internet connection, and 9 out of 10 do not have laptops, PCs or tablets for digital education. \c\cIn a government meeting on 5 November, President Klaus Iohannis announced a series of partial quarantine measures, including the closure of all schools nationwide and the transition to online education for the next 30 days. During this period, only nurseries and after-schools remained open. The president's announcement, later doubled by a government decision, sparked a wave of discontent. The National Council of Students announced in a statement that it disapproves of the measure, as many schools are located in communities where the transmission rate is less than 3 per thousand inhabitants and hundreds of thousands of students in Romania do not have the opportunity to access online courses due to lack of digital infrastructure. According to a survey by the National Federation of Parents\' Associations, about 47.2% of parents considered that the closure of schools was not a good one for the education system, while 45.2% of them considered this decision as a necessary one. \c\cOn 7 November, Anisie announced that students will no longer take their theses in the 2020–2021 school year, which will be replaced by a summative evaluation. \c\cSchools have been reopened nationwide on 8 February. Despite their autonomy in relation to education-related decisions, most universities did not resume regular, face-to-face, courses, mainly due to restrictions imposed to in-door group gatherings. However, as new cases have risen in the country, the structure of the 2020–2021 school year had been modified so the spring break starts in 2 April and ends in 4 May, however doesn\'t apply to students in terminal years, who would instead have to attend online courses between 12 and 29 April, with spring break ending in 9 May. \c\cSchools reopened, once again, on 5 and 10 May respectively (depending on grade), but with two scenarios rather than three. Schools in localities with an incidence rate below 1/1,000 inhabitants would be completely open, while in localities with an incidence rate above 1/1,000 inhabitants only pupils in primary and special education, as well as students in either the 8th, 12th or 13th grades, in terminal years of postliceal and vocational education, and those who attend recovery courses would go physically to school, unless the locality is quarantined. \c\cThe Romanian Football Federation and the Romanian Handball Federation decided to suspend all matches until 31 March. The rugby match between Romania and Belgium, to be held in Botoșani on 14 March, was postponed by Rugby Europe. The IWF Junior World Weightlifting Championships in Bucharest, scheduled for 14–21 March, were cancelled. \c\cThe Romanian tourism industry has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures that have been taken in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. Both hotels and travel agencies have seen massive decreases in bookings and cancellations of events. Since the beginning of March, the occupancy rate of hotels has decreased by 40% in Bucharest and by 50% in resorts. In the first nine months of the year, arrivals in tourist reception facilities decreased by 50.6%, overnight stays by 49.5%, and arrivals of foreign visitors decreased by 59%. \c\cTeleworking has been a necessary practice for many firms and workers during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 crisis. Due to the nature of the activity, only 7% of jobs in hospitality industry can plausibly be performed at home. As of 28 April, the Ministry of Labor reported 114,494 individual employment contracts suspended in the hotels and restaurants sector. \c\cThe government's response to COVID-19 raised human rights concerns including in relation to policing, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to education. \c\cOn 16 March 2020, President Iohannis signed an emergency decree, giving authorities the power to remove, report or close websites spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic, with no opportunity to appeal. On 30 March, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Harlem Désir, expressed his concerns about the provisions of the emergency decree, noting that they "pose a risk of undue restriction to the work of journalists, of self-censorship for media actors trying to inform the public, and could even be counterproductive". Previously, several civil society organizations issued a manifesto to request for greater transparency of data related to the spread of COVID-19 in Romania. \c\cOn 19 March, Romania activated Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which allows signatories to derogate from the convention in times of a "public emergency threatening the life of the nation". \c\cUntil 26 September 2021, the National Institute of Public Health reported 1,199,761 cases of COVID-19. Bucharest accumulates 17.2% of the total number of infections. It is followed by Cluj with 5.3%, Timiș with 5.1%, Ilfov with 4.2% and Constanța with 4%. 1 in 77 reported cases was recorded among medical staff. A study conducted by the Sanitary Solidarity Federation in October 2020 revealed that about 10% of respondents had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2. According to the same study, nurses have the largest share of all infected workers and have the highest percentage of infection among occupational categories. \c\cAs of 26 September 2021, there were 36,450 COVID-19-related deaths, with 9.1% of them reported in Bucharest, 4.5% in Prahova, 3.9% in Bihor, 3.8% in Timiș and 3.8% in Suceava. 85.8% of all deaths were in people over 60, and 57.7% of deaths were in men. 94.5% of the deceased had at least one associated comorbidity. A November 2020 study by the National Institute of Public Health on data from the records of 21,766 patients indicated that the main risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19 in Romania are cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases and cancer. \c\cAs of 14 March 2021, the average age of cases is 48 years. The average age of deaths is significantly higher, at 71 years.
On 25 January 2022, militants stormed a security post belonging to Pakistani military in a remote area of Dasht, Kech District in Balochistan killing at least ten security personnel and injuring three others. The clash lasted for few hours in which militants also suffered several casualties. Additionally, the militants also seized weapons that were present in the security post. Locals in the area also confirmed that an attack on the security post took place and that the militants suffered heavy casualties in the attack. \c\cPakistani law enforcement agencies say that one militant was killed and several other militants were injured when the militants attacked the security post. Three militants responsible for the attack were also arrested by the law enforcement agencies during a search operation in the vicinity of the security post. No group has taken responsibility for the attack on security post initially.After several times,Gohram Baloch, the spokesperson of the banned Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) has claimed responsibility for the attack.
The 2022 Italian presidential election was held in Rome, Italy, between 24 and 29 January 2022. The president of Italy was elected by a joint assembly composed of the Italian Parliament and regional representatives. The election process extended over multiple days, culminating in incumbent president Sergio Mattarella being confirmed for a second term, with a total of 759 votes on the eighth ballot, the second most votes after Sandro Pertini in 1978. Mattarella became the second president to be re-elected, his predecessor Giorgio Napolitano being the first. \c\cMattarella had initially ruled out a second term. On 29 January 2022, he agreed to serve a second term, as most party leaders and Mario Draghi, the prime minister of Italy, asked him to accept their joint nomination for another term. Mattarella had previously already received significant and growing support in several rounds of voting, namely 125 votes on the third ballot, 166 votes on the fourth ballot, 336 votes on the sixth ballot, and 387 votes on the seventh ballot. Among Italian presidential elections, it had the highest number of ballots since 1992, when Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was finally elected on the 16th ballot. \c\cThe incumbent president Sergio Mattarella was elected in 2015 by the Parliament and regional representatives. Mattarella was supported by the centre-left coalition, led by then-prime minister and secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) Matteo Renzi, and gained broad support. The result of the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum led to Renzi's resignation and to the formation of the Gentiloni Cabinet headed by Paolo Gentiloni, at the time a deputy from the PD, as the prime minister. \c\cThe 2018 general election resulted in a hung parliament. As a result of the ensuing government formation talks, the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League (Lega) formed a new cabinet led Giuseppe Conte, a law professor close to the M5S. During the government formation, Mattarella's role became particularly important when he refused to appoint the Eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona as minister of finance. \c\cIn August 2019, Lega's leader Matteo Salvini announced a motion of no confidence against Conte after growing tensions within the majority. Many political analysts believed that the no confidence motion was an attempt to force early elections and to improve Lega's standing in the Italian Parliament, so that Salvini could become the next prime minister. On 21 August, Mattarella started the consultations with all the parliamentary groups. On the same day, the national direction of the PD officially opened to form a new cabinet in a coalition with the M5S. On 29 August, Mattarella summoned Conte to the Quirinal Palace to give him the task of forming the new cabinet. \c\cIn 2020, Italy became one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Conte's government was the first in the Western world to implement a national pandemic lockdown to stop the spread of the disease. Despite being widely approved by public opinion, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Italy was also described as the largest suppression of constitutional rights in the history of the Italian Republic. Mattarella described the COVID-19 crisis as "three emergencies on the health, social and economic fronts" that needed a stable government and made sure a new government could be formed after the Conte II Cabinet fell, amid high popularity and the possibility of a bis. \c\cIn January 2021, Renzi's Italia Viva (IV), a member of the coalition supporting Conte's cabinet, withdrew its support for the government. Although Conte won confidence votes in the parliament in the subsequent days, he chose to resign, having failed to reach an absolute majority in the Senate of the Republic. After negotiations to form a third Conte cabinet failed, President Mattarella appointed Mario Draghi, the former president of the European Central Bank, as the prime minister at the head of a national unity government composed of independent technocrats and politicians from M5S, Lega, PD, IV, Forza Italia (FI), and Free and Equal (LeU). \c\cDuring 2021, President Mattarella expressed his unavailability regarding a second term, which had been proposed by various political forces, recalling similar remarks made by his predecessors Antonio Segni and Giovanni Leone. Other political figures stated that they did not intend to run as president, among them Romano Prodi, Emma Bonino, and Liliana Segre. \c\cDuring a press conference in Rome on 22 December 2021, Prime Minister Draghi, questioned on the hypothesis of his rise to the Quirinal Palace, declared that he was "at the service of institutions". The declaration was widely interpreted as a confirmation of his willingness to be elected president and accelerated the debate around the consequences of a possible election as president of the prime minister, a fact that had never happened before. \c\cOn 14 January 2022, the leaders of the centre-right coalition expressed their willingness to nominate former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi as their candidate to the presidency. Berlusconi's candidacy was widely criticised by PD, M5S, and other centrist and leftist parties. PD secretary Enrico Letta described it as "divisive", stating that Italy needed a unitary president and not a long-time party leader like Berlusconi. On 22 January, after he acknowledged not to have enough votes to be elected, Berlusconi announced the withdrawal of his candidacy. \c\cOn 16 January, forty parliamentarians in opposition to the Draghi government and belonging to the Mixed Group factions of Alternativa, Communist Party (PC), and Power to the People (PaP), supported the candidacy of the former vice-president of the Constitutional Court of Italy Paolo Maddalena, subsequently obtaining the support of Italexit, Italy of Values (IdV), and the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC), the latter of which is not represented in the assembly. Before the start of the voting process, PaP withdrew its support for Maddalena due to his positions against abortion and same-sex marriage. A similar choice was also expressed within the Mixed Group by Green Italia's parliamentary group FacciamoEco, which decided to vote for Marco Cappato, an activist and member of Italian Radicals. \c\cVarious hypothetical candidacies were proposed by media, journalists and political analysts in the days before the election. The list notably included Elisabetta Casellati, who is serving as the president of the Senate, former president of the Senate Marcello Pera, former presidents of the Chamber of Deputies like Pier Ferdinando Casini and Luciano Violante, the European Commissioner and former prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, the judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy and former prime minister Giuliano Amato, former ministers like Franco Frattini, Giulio Tremonti, Andrea Riccardi, Rosy Bindi, and Paola Severino, the judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy Silvana Sciarra, and the diplomat Elisabetta Belloni. \c\cOn 24 January, the day of the first ballot, in the absence of a common candidate, both centre-right and centre-left coalitions requested the blank vote. On the other hand, the candidacies of Maddalena and Cappato were voted by minor parties and parliamentary groups, while Action and More Europe confirmed their support to the Minister of Justice Marta Cartabia. On the same day, Giorgia Meloni, the leader of Brothers of Italy (FdI), proposed former deputy attorney of Venice Carlo Nordio. Nordio rejected the candidacy, citing lack of political experience. \c\cOn 25 January, the leaders of the centre-right coalition organized a press conference to announce a list of presidential candidates. The candidates were Marcello Pera, former president of the Senate, Letizia Moratti, a former mayor of Milan who previously rejected the candidacy in favor of Berlusconi, and Nordio, the former magistrate who also had already rejected the candidacy. Letta described the three candidacies as "a step forward, useful for dialogue"; however, despite respecting the legitimate choices of the centre-right coalition, he added "not to believe that they can not be considered shared candidacies". Also in the second round, both the centre-right and centre-left coalitions decided to vote blank. \c\cOn 26 January, Meloni officially proposed her own party's co-founder Guido Crosetto as candidate in the third ballot, while members of For the Autonomies, a minor group of regionalist parties, announced their votes for Casini. Despite the two coalitions still deciding to vote blank, incumbent president Mattarella resulted as the most voted candidate with 125 votes, even though no parties proposed him as candidate and he had always ruled out a second term. Mattarella was followed by Crosetto with 114, Maddalena with 61, and Casini with 52. \c\cOn 27 January, contrasts between the two major coalitions prevented the proposal of a shared candidacy. On the fourth ballot, the centre-right coalition decided to abstain, while the centre-left one voted blank. Alternativa and other minor opposition parties voted for Nino Di Matteo, an anti-mafia prosecutor and member of the High Council of the Judiciary. Once again, President Mattarella resulted as the most voted candidate, gaining 166 votes, followed by Di Matteo with 56 votes. \c\cOn 28 January, the centre-right coalition officially proposed Casellati as its candidate for the presidency in the fifth ballot. Casellati, President of the Senate and member of FI, was strongly supported by Lega's leader Matteo Salvini, who stated that it was a "true honor to propose her as the first female president". The centre-left coalition opposed her candidacy and decided to abstain. Casellati gained a mere result of 382 votes, far below the majority threshold of 505 required to be elected and even below the number of centre-right electors, due to more than 70 so-called "snipers" (Italian: franchi tiratori). Casellati was followed by Mattarella with 46 votes and Di Matteo with 38. In the sixth ballot on the evening of 28 January, the centre-right abstained, while the centre-left formally voted blank. Once again, President Mattarella resulted as the most voted candidate with 336 votes, despite any party formally supporting his re-election, as well as his firm denial to a second term. \c\cIn the evening of 28 January, Salvini announced his willingness to propose a female candidate as president. Salvini's statement was soon followed by a remark of Giuseppe Conte, leader of the M5S, opening to a possibile agreement between Lega and M5S on the candidacy of Elisabetta Belloni, a diplomat and director of the Department of Information for Security. This possibility was later confirmed with a tweet by M5S founder Beppe Grillo, who wrote: "Welcome Madame Italy, Elisabetta Belloni." Belloni's candidacy was immediately opposed by former prime minister and IV leader Matteo Renzi, who stated that the serving head of national intelligence can not be elected president, while the foreign affairs minister Luigi Di Maio described the manner Belloni was proposed as "indecorous". The candidacy was also attacked by Coraggio Italia (CI), FI, LeU, and by various factions of the PD and M5S. \c\cIn the morning of 29 January, the seventh ballot was inconclusive, as Lega and FI abstained, the centre-left voted blank, and FdI supported Nordio. Mattarella was again the most voted candidate with 387 votes, followed by Nordio with 64, and Di Matteo with 40. During the seventh ballot, after the fall of all other possible candidacies, the re-election of incumbent president Mattarella became a serious alternative. Letta, who had already proposed his re-election a few weeks before, asked the other leaders to follow "the Parliament's wisdom", referring to the massive support that Mattarella had received in the previous ballots; Salvini, accusing the centre-left of having rejected all his proposals, opened to a new term for the incumbent president. Salvini's proposal for a new term met the criticism of Meloni, who stated in a tweet that she did not "want to believe it". Casini, who was widely considered one of the most reliable candidates, asked to rule out his name and vote for Mattarella. Prime Minister Draghi, another probable candidate, asked Mattarella to accept a second term for "the good and the stability of the country". In the early afternoon, the delegations of parliamentary groups of PD, M5S, Lega, FI, IV, CI, LeU, and For the Autonomies went to the Quirinal Palace asking Mattarella to concede his availability to a second term. Mattarella agreed to serve a second term. \c\cIn the eight ballot, on January 29's evening, Sergio Mattarella was re-elected president of Italy with 759 votes, becoming the most-voted president after Sandro Pertini in 1978. In ballot, Mattarella was followed by Nordio with 90 votes, and Di Matteo with 37. \c\cIn accordance with the Constitution of Italy, the election was held in the form of a secret ballot, with 321 senators, 630 deputies, and 58 regional representatives entitled to vote. Each of the twenty regions of Italy had three representatives, except for Aosta Valley, which had only one. The election was held in the Palazzo Montecitorio, home of the Chamber of Deputies, with the capacity of the assembly room expanded for the purpose. As there is no official candidacy process, representatives were free to vote for any person who meets the requirements. The first three ballots require a two-thirds majority of the 1,009 voters to elect a president, or 673 votes. Starting from the fourth ballot, an absolute majority is required for candidates to be elected, or 505 votes. The presidential mandate lasts seven years. \c\cThe election process started on 24 January 2022. The election was presided over by Roberto Fico, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, who processed to the public counting of the votes, and by Elisabetta Casellati, the President of the Senate. Fico had anticipated that he would consider only announcing the surname of the candidate written on each ballot whilst counting the votes, ignoring any additional names or titles. This was seen as a move to counteract Berlusconi's strategy, which reportedly involved having his supporters mark the ballots in recognizable ways. \c\cThe eligibility requirements, contained in the first paragraph of Article 84 of the Constitution of Italy, are to have Italian citizenship, have reached the age of 50, and enjoy civil and political rights. \c\cElectors per parliamentary group, including the regional delegates, were announced on the date of the election. With no snap elections being held on the national or regional level, below is the party breakdown of the presidential electors. \c\cThese candidates were officially proposed as president and voted in at least one ballot, by parties, coalitions, or parliamentary groups which took part in the election. \c\cA two-thirds majority of 672 votes was needed to elect a candidate on the first ballot. Since two thirds of the electors left their ballots blank following party instructions, and others cast invalid votes, no candidate could receive the required majority. The candidate with the most votes was Paolo Maddalena, supported by members of the Mixed Group, with 36 votes, followed by incumbent President Mattarella and incumbent Minister of Justice Marta Cartabia. \c\cAnother ballot was scheduled on 25 January. \c\cA two-thirds majority of 673 votes was needed to elect a candidate on the second ballot. Since more than half of the electors left their ballots blank following party instructions, and others cast invalid votes, no candidate could receive the required majority and another vote was scheduled on 26 January. \c\cA two-thirds majority of 673 votes was needed to elect a candidate on the third ballot. Since nearly half of the electors left their ballots blank following party instructions, and others cast invalid votes, no candidate could receive the required majority and another vote was scheduled on 27 January. \c\cAn absolute majority of 505 votes was needed to elect a candidate on the fourth ballot. Since the centre-right coalition decided to abstain and the centre-left voted blank, no candidate could receive the required majority and another vote was scheduled on 28 January. \c\cAn absolute majority of 505 votes was needed to elect a candidate on the fifth ballot. The centre-right coalition proposed Elisabetta Casellati as its candidate, while the centre-left and M5S, opposing her, decided to abstain. Casellati received only 382 votes, far below the required majority, and another vote was scheduled for 5pm on 28 January. \c\cAn absolute majority of 505 votes was needed to elect a candidate on the sixth ballot. The centre-right coalition abstained, while the centre-left voted blank. Despite the lack of any formal support to his candidacy, Mattarella led with 336 votes, still well short of the required majority, and the seventh and eighth ballots were scheduled for 9:30am and 4:30pm, respectively, on 29 January. \c\cAn absolute majority of 505 votes was needed to elect a candidate on the seventh ballot. The centre-right coalition abstained, while the centre-left formally voted blank. Once again, Mattarella led with 387 votes, still well short of the required majority, and the eighth ballot was scheduled for 4:30pm on 29 January. \c\cAn absolute majority of 505 votes was needed to elect a candidate on the eighth ballot. After Mattarella reversed his earlier position and agreed to serve a second term, he obtained the necessary majority and was re-elected president.
Between January 31 — February 1, 2022, heavy rainfall impacted Ecuador, which caused multiple landslides, floods, and mudflows.  A landslide in Quito, Ecuador, killed 23 people, injured 47 others and left nine missing.
Partygate is an ongoing political scandal surrounding gatherings of United Kingdom government and Conservative Party staff that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, when there were public health restrictions on specified types of gatherings. Whilst several lockdowns in the country were in place, reported social gatherings occurred at 10 Downing Street, its garden, and other government buildings. Starting in December 2021, these attracted substantial media attention, public debate, and controversy. \c\cThe Daily Mirror was first to report allegations in December 2021 that some 10 Downing Street staff had held gatherings during the 2020 Christmas season, after their planned Christmas party was cancelled due to the COVID-19 "tier" regulations in place at the time. Prime Minister Boris Johnson denied that any rules were broken, and a spokesperson denied that a party occurred. A week later, video of a practice press conference held in 10 Downing Street was leaked to and broadcast by ITV News in which joking comments parodying answers to questions about a party having taken place were made. Allegra Stratton, then Downing Street press secretary, featured in the video, and resigned her subsequent Government position after the video surfaced. In January 2022, reports emerged that there were around 30 in one account, and 40 in another, attendees at a gathering with drinks, which took place on 20 May 2020 in the garden of 10 Downing Street during the first national lockdown. Johnson said that he attended and apologised for doing so. Downing Street apologised to Queen Elizabeth II for two further gatherings that took place on 16 April 2021, on the day before Prince Philip's funeral, during a third lockdown across England. Reports followed of a gathering at which Johnson's birthday was celebrated with a cake in June 2020. \c\cAfter the press conference video leaked, on 8 December 2021 Johnson announced a Cabinet Office inquiry would be undertaken by the Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, to investigate whether COVID-19 restrictions were broken at that or other staff events. Case stepped back from the inquiry on 17 December, amid reports that his own office had also held a party in December 2020, and responsibility for the inquiry was handed to Sue Gray. In January 2022, the Metropolitan Police opened its own investigation into potential breaches of COVID-19 regulations in government buildings, leading to uncertainty over the timing and possible content of Gray's report. \c\cShaun Bailey resigned from a number of his positions, including chair of the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee, after admitting to a party on 14 December 2020 with Conservative Party staff. A gathering on 10 December 2020 at the Department for Education is also part of the Cabinet Office inquiry. \c\cPublic disquiet over how government staff and others in Westminster were perceived to have been breaking restrictions led to a decline in public support for Boris Johnson, the government and the Conservative Party, and is thought to have contributed to the party's loss of the 2021 North Shropshire by-election. In January 2022, a number of Conservative and opposition politicians called for Johnson's resignation. \c\cIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, a UK-wide lockdown began on 23 March 2020, made under a new statutory instrument. This was an explicit stay-at-home order that prohibited all non-essential travel and social gatherings. Some rules were incrementally relaxed in the following months in England; starting from 13 May, "two people from separate households were permitted to meet outside in a public place, such as a park, provided they stayed 2 metres apart". Six people were allowed to socialise outdoors by June, and indoor social gatherings were only permitted from 4 July and only between members of two households. \c\cWith the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, a second national lockdown started in England on 5 November 2020. A regional tiered lockdown system replaced this on 2 December. London was initially placed in "Tier 2", was moved to the highest level "Tier 3" on 16 December, and finally placed under a newly introduced stay-at-home order, "Tier 4", on 19 December. People socialising between households or outside of support bubbles was not allowed throughout this period. Household mixing and socialising for Christmas itself was also restricted to a small number of households and only permitted on 25 December across much of the UK, and in London was cancelled altogether. \c\cOn 5 January 2021, a third lockdown began across the whole of England. This was gradually lifted in a series of steps beginning 29 March, with social contact limited to groups of six from no more than two households, with social distancing, and only permitted outdoors, into April. \c\c10 Downing Street is a government building in the City of Westminster, central London, used by some staff in the Cabinet Office. It also contains a personal flat designated for the Prime Minister, though Boris Johnson uses the larger flat in the adjoining 11 Downing Street. \c\cIn December 2021, an article in The Spectator argued that COVID-19 restrictions, that rely on the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, may not legally apply to 10 Downing Street as it is Crown Land, while a second article argued against this, on the basis that relevant COVID-19 laws applied to individuals rather than land. In January 2022, Jenny Jones, a Green Party member of the House of Lords, asked the government to clarify the matter and Nicholas True, a Minister of State at the Cabinet Office, replied: "No 10 Downing Street is a Crown property. Regulations under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 which relate to the activities of people, apply regardless of whether those activities took place on Crown property or not". \c\cOn 30 November 2021, the Daily Mirror reported allegations that some Downing Street staff had held multiple gatherings in November and December 2020, when London was under COVID-19 tier 3 lockdown restrictions.  The restrictions prohibited indoor gatherings of more than six people, with exceptions for certain work-related activities. The first event was said to have been a leaving party for an aide on 27 November and attended by Johnson. The second event was said to have been a Christmas party held on 18 December. The official response to the report in the Daily Mirror was that "Covid rules have been followed at all times". Johnson denied that any rules were broken, and a spokesperson denied that a party occurred. \c\cThe following day, other media outlets reported further details of the alleged event on 18 December, with BBC News reporting it involved "drinks, nibbles, and games" and a source told the Financial Times that parties were vital for Downing Street staff to relieve stress. Downing Street responded by saying "We don\'t recognise these accounts". At Prime Minister's Questions, Johnson told the House of Commons, "All guidance was followed completely [in] Number 10". On 3 December, Labour MP Barry Gardiner wrote to the Metropolitan Police asking them to investigate but they responded saying that they do not normally investigate "retrospective breaches of the Covid-19 regulations". Vaccines minister Maggie Throup appeared on the BBC's Question Time and stated "all guidance was followed" and dismissed reports as "rumour and hearsay". On 5 December, the Justice Secretary Dominic Raab told Andrew Marr that if a "formal party" had taken place "then of course it would be wrong" but that the reports were based on "unsubstantiated, anonymous claims" which is why Downing Street did not respond more directly. Raab also stated "the police don\'t normally look back and investigate things that have taken place a year ago", about which a Full Fact investigation concluded "Police often investigate alleged offences which took place years before. This is less clear cut in the context of breaches of Covid-19 regulations, which police say they do not routinely investigate retrospectively." On 6 December, former government adviser Dominic Cummings alleged that unnamed journalists attended the reported party and that it was "very unwise for No 10 to lie" about the events. The Prime Minister's spokesperson reiterated, "There was not a party and Covid rules have been followed at all times" and when challenged about how this could be true responded, "I don\'t need to get into the positions we’ve taken. It is simply just a statement of fact". \c\cOn 7 December 2021, ITV News released a video, in which Allegra Stratton and other Downing Street staff – during a mock press conference on 22 December 2020 – made joking references to a Christmas gathering in 10 Downing Street four days earlier on 18 December 2020. The leaked 47-second clip began with media advisor Ed Oldfield playing the role of a journalist and asking Stratton "I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognise those reports?" In response, Stratton and other Downing Street staff joked about the "fictional party" being just "cheese and wine" and a "business meeting", with "no social distancing". The Guardian reported that the video gave "the strong impression that a staff-based party took place on 18 December 2020 and that No 10 officials realised that they were likely to have broken rules". BBC News reported that the event had "several dozen" attendees, and that "party games were played, food and drink were served, and the party went on past midnight". The Times reported allegations that the party was organised via WhatsApp with staff requested to bring Secret Santa gifts. \c\cOn 8 December, following the release of the video and in response to further requests for an investigation, the Metropolitan Police said that they had "received a significant amount of correspondence relating to allegations reported in the media that the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations were breached at gatherings at No 10 Downing Street in November and December 2020" and that "all this correspondence has been considered by detectives in detail, as well as footage published by ITV News". They concluded that the "correspondence and footage does not provide evidence of a breach of the Health Protection Regulations, but restates allegations made in the media. Based on the absence of evidence and in line with our policy not to investigate retrospective breaches of such regulations, the Met will not commence an investigation at this time". \c\cAccording to BBC News on 9 December, Jack Doyle, the deputy Downing Street Director of Communications at the time, was understood to have attended the event on 18 December, gave a speech, and handed out awards at the function. On 10 December, the government's Chief Whip Mark Spencer said that the event had been a "meeting", rather than a social gathering. The New York Times commented that, according to some, the government was not following the rules it had set for the general population. \c\cOn 11 December, reports emerged that two dozen HM Treasury staff gathered for drinks on 25 November 2020 to celebrate Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Autumn Spending Review. On 12 December Downing Street confirmed that Johnson "briefly" took part in a virtual Christmas quiz held at the venue on 15 December 2020 after the Sunday Mirror published a picture of him participating via his computer in the event, in a room with two other people. Downing Street said he was there to thank staff for their work during the pandemic and that the event was a "virtual" one, while Johnson himself responded that he "certainly broke no rules". The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) also confirmed that staff working past normal employment hours drank alcohol and ate takeaway "late into the night" on a number of occasions during COVID restrictions after this was reported by the Sunday Mirror. A DWP spokesman said: "The team regularly worked late into the evening and on a number of occasions they ate takeaway food and drank some alcohol". \c\cNorthern Ireland First Minister, Paul Givan, and his deputy Michelle O\'Neill, said that the controversy had damaged the public health message in Northern Ireland. On 12 December, The Independent reported that senior police officers feared people would be less likely to comply with any new COVID restrictions because of the controversy. The newspaper said they had gathered anecdotal evidence of terse exchanges between police officers and members of the public in early December 2020. \c\cOn 15 December, former Conservative candidate as Mayor of London, Shaun Bailey, resigned from his position as chair of the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee after photographs were published of him and over 20 members of staff at an event with drinks and a buffet held in the basement of Conservative Campaign Headquarters on 14 December 2020, when he was a mayoral candidate. Those attending included four aides seconded from the Conservative Central Office, who were subsequently disciplined. Cabinet member Grant Shapps stated that the event was "absolutely unacceptable", and not authorised by the Conservative Party. The Metropolitan Police later said they would contact two people who were at the party over possible breaches of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations. \c\cOn 16 December, The Guardian and The Independent, in a joint investigation, reported allegations that Johnson attended a party in Downing Street on 15 May 2020, during the first national lockdown. Downing Street issued a statement saying "On 15 May 2020 the prime minister held a series of meetings throughout the afternoon, including briefly with the then health and care secretary and his team in the garden following a press conference. The prime minister went to his residence shortly after 7pm. A small number of staff required to be in work remained in the Downing Street garden for part of the afternoon and evening." On 19 December The Guardian published a photograph of the event showing 19 people drinking wine and noted that "there are no laptops, files or notepads to take minutes on show". Johnson was shown sitting next to his then-fiancée, Carrie Symonds, who was holding their newborn son. Downing Street insisted that the photograph showed a work meeting. \c\cThe Metropolitan Police referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the police watchdog, on 17 December, following a complaint by Green Party peer, Jenny Jones. Jones said that there was a "conflict of interest and a potential cover up" in relation to the police declining to investigate an allegation that a party took place in Downing Street in the run-up to Christmas 2020, and their role and involvement in the policing and security of the buildings. \c\cIn a blog post on 7 January, Dominic Cummings argued that the photo from 15 May 2020 in the garden of 10 Downing Street did not show a party. He described having a work meeting with Boris Johnson and the Prime Minister's Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds, with Carrie Symonds subsequently joining them.[unreliable source?] Meanwhile, according to his account, various other groups of people were also meeting in the garden, and staff had been advised to meet outside in the garden where there was less risk of COVID-19 transmission. \c\cCummings said that there was a "socially distanced drinks" gathering in the garden on 20 May 2020 that he and another special adviser cautioned against. On 10 January, ITV News showed a 20 May 2020 email sent on behalf of Reynolds to over one hundred 10 Downing Street staff, inviting them "to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening.... bring your own booze!" Various news organisations reported that around 30–40 people were present that evening, eating picnic food and drinking, including Johnson and Symonds. Johnson initially declined to comment on whether he was present or not. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said he still had confidence in Reynolds. Campaigners, including the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, called for Reynolds to be dismissed. \c\cOn 11 January, the Metropolitan Police said it was in contact with the government over "widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches" of COVID rules. There was additional reporting of an party in Downing Street on 18 December, with Reynolds said to have been present. Shaun Bailey resigned as chair of a second London Assembly committee, the economy committee, in addition to his resignation from the police and crime committee in December. Opposition party leaders Ed Davey and Nicola Sturgeon called on Johnson to resign. Tory donor, John Caudwell told Boris Johnson to, "sort it out or step aside", Caudwell added, "Each one of these new revelations gives greater force to the accusation that areas of the government think it's \'one rule for them, one rule for the rest of us\'. The Good Law Project announced that it had started legal proceedings against the Metropolitan Police over their refusal to investigate reports of the 18 December 2020 party. \c\cOn 12 January, Johnson, speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, said that he had attended the gathering and apologised for doing so. He said that he was present for about 25 minutes and that he thought it was an allowed work meeting. He said, "I should have recognised that even if it (the gathering) could be said technically to fall within the guidance, there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way."\c\cThe leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer, said in the House of Commons, "There we have it. After months of deceit and deception, the pathetic spectacle of a man who has run out of road. His defence... that he didn\'t realise he was at a party is so ridiculous that it's actually offensive to the British public. He's finally been forced to admit what everyone knew, that when the whole country was locked down he was hosting boozy parties in Downing Street. Is he now going to do the decent thing and resign?" Other Labour MPs and MPs from other parties also called on Johnson to resign, including some MPs from his own party, including Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross. In response to his comments, the Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg referred to Ross as "quite a lightweight" person who has always opposed Johnson and called Alister Jack (the Scotland secretary, who supported Johnson) a "much more substantial and important figure". Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, was similarly dismissive, saying: "My instant response is he's in Elgin and the national Tory leader is in London". All 31 Conservative MSPs supported Ross's call for resignation. Articles in New Statesman and The Guardian, among others, criticised the wording of Johnson's apology for being insufficient. \c\cOn 13 January, it was reported that two separate parties were held in 10 Downing Street on 16 April 2021. These were leaving events for James Slack, Johnson's director of communications, and a photographer. The date was the eve of the funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, when the UK was observing a period of national mourning, and England was in step two of its lockdown roadmap, with indoor mixing banned. Johnson was reported to be out of London at the time. The photographer's party reportedly involved loud music, a DJ and a staff member sent to the Co-op store on the Strand to fill a suitcase with bottles of wine. The next day, Slack and Downing Street confirmed there was an event, with Slack apologising for what happened. Number 10 apologised to Queen Elizabeth II for the two parties that were held. \c\cOn 14 January, The Independent reported that Johnson had drawn up a plan, named "Operation Save Big Dog", in an attempt to retain his premiership. The plan included a list of officials who should resign over the parties controversy, a communications strategy for cabinet ministers, as well as "sounding out support" for leadership rivals from backbenchers. The Daily Mirror reported that Downing Street staff had regular Friday evening events with wine, for which a dedicated fridge was bought, being delivered on 11 December 2020. What were called "Wine time Fridays" were purportedly scheduled into the diaries of about 50 staff from 4–7pm. Johnson was reported to visit some of these and to be aware of their existence. 10 Downing Street did not deny the allegations. \c\cOn 16 January, in a column in The Times, Dominic Lawson said a former Downing Street official had told him of at least two people warning Johnson that the 20 May 2020 event should be cancelled and that Johnson said they were "overreacting". Johnson's spokesperson said that the report was not accurate, although other journalists were reported to have corroborated it. On 17 January, Cummings reiterated his claim that Johnson knew in advance about the party, that Cummings raised concerns about it and that Johnson said it could go ahead, and consequently that Johnson had lied to Parliament about what happened. Cumming said he would "swear under oath this is what happened". Sky News reported a second source also said Johnson had been warned in advance about the party. BBC News Online reported that two other former Downing Street officials said "they remembered Mr Cummings telling them that day he had warned the prime minister not to allow the drinks to go ahead". \c\cStarmer accused Johnson of breaking the law. Starmer, a one time Director of Public Prosecutions said, "I think he broke the law. I think he's as good as admitted that he broke the law. (...) I think it's pretty obvious what's happened, this industrial-scale partying had been going on at Downing Street, not much of it is really denied, and I think that the public have made up their mind. I think the facts speak for themselves. I think the Prime Minister broke the law, I think he then lied about what had happened. (...) Once Sue Gray has come to her findings, she will set out all the facts, she is very well respected, I think that all of those should be passed to the police to look at."\c\cAndrew Bridgen, Conservative MP said, “It doesn’t matter whether the prime minster was present or not present—ultimately, he is responsible for what goes on in the government, he’s responsible for the culture in No. 10 and what we’re seeing is a culture where there’s one rule for them and the rest of us do what we’re told.”\c\cA photograph of Keir Starmer drinking from a bottle of beer in a constituency Labour Party office shortly before the Hartlepool by-election in May 2021 was republished by some media in January 2022. Starmer denied being in breach of the rules in place at that time, explaining he was working late with staff and they ate a takeaway together. Starmer stated, "There is simply no comparison" with the culture in Downing Street, and added Conservatives who brought it up were trying "to take everyone into the gutter with them". \c\cOn 17 January, the Daily Mirror reported that Johnson attended a leaving party for Steve Higham, his former defence advisor, shortly before Christmas 2020 while strict coronavirus restrictions applied in London. Johnson was reported to have attended for a few minutes and to have given a speech. \c\cOn 18 January, The Guardian reported that Conservative rebel MPs had a plan to oust Johnson from office, named "Operation Rinka", after the dog that was shot in the Thorpe affair. On the same day, Johnson gave an interview to Beth Rigby, after to one of his immediate family had tested positive for COVID the previous week and having not appeared in public himself for nearly a week. He repeatedly apologised and said of the 20 May 2020 event, "I\'m saying categorically that nobody told me, nobody said this was something that was against the rules". Sky News reported that one Conservative MP described Johnson in the interview as "absolutely beaten" and Rigby described him as looking "defeated". The i described the interview as "excruciating". \c\cWhen Simon Hattenstone asked Keir Starmer about Johnson claiming he did not know it was a party Starmer said further, "The cover-up isn\'t worse than the crime, but the cover-up compounds the crime. Johnson's now on his third defence. His first defence when we tackled him on this at the beginning of December was: \'I\'ve been assured there were no parties,\' and his second defence when the video came out was: \'I\'m furious there have been these parties; I\'ve only just found out.\' And if the third defence is true, then obviously the first two are false – and that's a major problem for him."\c\cOn 24 January, ITV News reported that a surprise birthday get-together was held for Johnson on 19 June 2020, allegedly organised by Carrie Symonds. Up to 30 people are said to have been present, including Johnson, Symonds, and interior designer Lulu Lytle who was working on Johnson and Symonds’ flat at the time. It was said that cake was served and attendees sang "Happy Birthday". Downing Street said the Prime Minister attended for less than 10 minutes. A spokesperson for Lytle's company said "Lulu was not invited to any birthday celebrations for the Prime Minister as a guest. Lulu entered the Cabinet Room briefly as requested, while waiting to speak with the Prime Minister". The Chancellor Rishi Sunak was reported to have been "unintentionally present" when the cake was served, whilst waiting for a meeting. The Guardian reported Downing Street sources saying that, in the evening, Johnson celebrated outside with family, as allowed under the then rules. ITV News also alleged that family friends then went up to Johnson's flat. A Number 10 spokesperson denied this, saying, "This is totally untrue. In line with the rules at the time the Prime Minister hosted a small number of family members outside that evening". More than two people were forbidden to socialise indoors, while up to six were allowed outdoors. Sue Gray, who is running an inquiry into events, was reported to have known about the event prior to the news breaking. \c\cOn 25 January, in an interview with Channel 4 News, Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns defended the Prime Minister by stating that, rather than being a pre-planned party, the Prime Minister was "ambushed by a cake". Burns\' comments were ridiculed online in a series of memes, including a tweet from celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, who quipped that "Ambushed By Cake" should be the title of her next cookbook. Burns later told The Daily Telegraph's podcast "that there actually wasn’t a cake". On 28 January, it emerged that The Times had published an article in June 2020 reporting the gathering on Johnson's birthday and that he "tucked into a Union Jack cake". \c\cKeir Starmer again called on Johnson to resign. Conservative peer, Baroness Warsi said Johnson should, "think long and hard about what is in the best interest of this country. (...) Is me staying in office allowing me to run this office in a way in which is making the country better, or am I a distraction?" On 28 January, Starmer said that "the whole of government is paralysed because the police are now looking at what the PM was getting up to in Downing Street". Alistair Carmichael (Liberal Democrat) and Ian Blackford (SNP) both said that the delay increasingly gave the appearance of an establishment "stitch-up". \c\cLate on 29 January, The Times reported that Gray had discovered that friends of Carrie Johnson's knew the PIN code to access her flat with Boris Johnson in 11 Downing Street. Cummings claimed that, in early 2020, he discovered highly confidential Government documents were left lying around in the flat, leading to he and Martin Reynolds instituting tighter controls on what papers left Johnson's office. \c\cIt was initially reported that at least seven parties that may have been in contravention of COVID-19 restrictions occurred in November–December 2020 overall. Additional events from May 2020 to April 2021 were then reported. In addition to the specific dated events listed below, the Department for Work and Pensions confirmed staff drank alcohol and ate takeaways "on a number of occasions" while working late during the period of COVID-19 restrictions. The Daily Mirror reported that "wine time Fridays" were a regular occurrence at Downing Street throughout the period. On 22 January 2022, The Sunday Times reported that Gray was also investigating Carrie Johnson hosting two friends (who worked at the time for Michael Gove at 70 Whitehall, part of the Downing Street complex) in the Downing Street flat multiple times during lockdown. It was stated that the visits were for "work reasons" but a Whitehall source noted that there were no officials present. On 25 January 2022, the New Statesman published an analysis stating that "that both Boris and Carrie Johnson do not believe they have done anything wrong, as they consider gatherings among those who worked at Downing Street during the pandemic to have been part of a \'household bubble\'". \c\c15 May 2020: multiple people were present in the garden at 10 Downing Street, including Johnson; The Guardian published a photograph showing Johnson, Carrie Symonds, then Health Minister Matt Hancock and 17 staff members in the 10 Downing Street garden with cheese and wine. A spokesperson for 10 Downing Street described the gathering as a work meeting. Sky News reported anonymous sources as saying that some people stayed until late into the evening. \c\c20 May 2020: Johnson's PPS, Martin Reynolds, invited staff at 10 Downing Street to what the invitation described as "socially distanced drinks". Johnson acknowledged being present for about 25 minutes, but said he thought the event was an allowed work meeting. Carrie Symonds also reportedly attended. Dominic Cummings, then an adviser to the PM, claimed that he and others warned against the event and Cummings also said he did not attend. \c\c19 June 2020: a surprise get-together for Johnson's birthday occurred in the Cabinet Room; Downing Street said Johnson attended for less than 10 minutes. There was also a celebration in the evening: Downing Street said that "the Prime Minister hosted a small number of family members outside that evening", but ITV News alleged family friends subsequently went up to Johnson's flat. \c\cSeptember 2020: A photo was taken of Carrie Symonds embracing a friend at an engagement party. She admitted to breaching social distancing guidelines and apologised. \c\c13 November 2020: a source told the BBC that staff had impromptu drinks at their desks to mark the leaving of Lee Cain, the Prime Minister's departing director of communications at 10 Downing Street, and that the gathering was over by 20:30. It was reported that Johnson visited Cain in his office and gave a farewell speech. \c\c13 November 2020: multiple sources, including Cummings, said Downing Street staff joined a gathering with the Prime Minister's then-fiancée, Carrie, in their flat above 11 Downing Street; a spokesperson for Mrs Johnson denied there was any party. \c\c25 November 2020: Treasury staff were reported as gathering for drinks; The Times reported that around two dozen civil servants attended, but a Treasury spokesperson described an "impromptu" event with a "small number" of staff involved. \c\c27 November 2020: an informal leaving event for Cleo Watson, a 10 Downing Street aide, was reported as taking place and that the Prime Minister gave a speech. Cummings has said no party happened then.[non-primary source needed]\c\cDecember 2020 (exact date uncertain): Boris Johnson reportedly attended and spoke at a leaving party for his defence adviser Captain Steve Higham. \c\c10 December 2020: Christmas party at the Department for Education's café hosted by the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson and attended by the Permanent Secretary, Susan Acland-Hood; a department spokesman said that "a gathering of colleagues who were already present at the office" had taken place. A spokesperson confirmed that Williamson gave a speech and that "drinks and canapes" were served. \c\c14 December 2020: Christmas party held by Shaun Bailey for his campaign team; Bailey admitted the party took place and has resigned as chair of a London Assembly committee on policing, with disciplinary action taken against four Conservative Party employees. \c\c15 December 2020: a Christmas quiz took place for 10 Downing Street staff; Johnson took part virtually. A Downing Street spokesperson said the event was all held virtually; other sources said teams were sitting together in a room. \c\c16 December 2020: Christmas party by staff working for Grant Shapps at the Department of Transport; Shapps, who was not present, apologised for what happened. \c\c17 December 2020: Simon Case's team had a Christmas party at 5.30pm in room 103 of the Cabinet Office, at 70 Whitehall. Sky News reported the event was described as a "Christmas party", that it was an hour long, and that it involved a quiz with the 6 people who were already in the office and around 6 more people attending virtually. Case did not take part in the event, but walked through the room. \c\c17 December 2020: Cabinet Office staff gathered with drinks to mark the departure of Kate Josephs, Director General of the COVID Taskforce. Josephs apologised for the event. Paul Scriven, a former Leader of Sheffield City Council, called for Josephs's resignation from her current role as chief executive of Sheffield Council. \c\c18 December 2020: Christmas gathering at 10 Downing Street. Sky News described allegations of this being a "cheese and wine night", with sources saying around 40 people were in attendance and that it continued until 2am. \c\c16 April 2021: there were two leaving events (one for James Slack, Boris Johnson's director of communications; one for a personal photographer to Johnson) in different parts of Downing Street, which later merged into one, with about 30 people present. Johnson was not in London at the time. Slack (now deputy editor of The Sun) apologised for the event on 14 January 2022. Both parties took place on the evening before the funeral of Prince Philip on 17 April 2021, and featured alcohol and one of them featured loud music. The Telegraph reported partying continued from 6pm until 1am. \c\cAt Prime Minister's Questions on 8 December, Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised for the video of the mock press conference, describing himself as "furious" about it, but maintained that, as far as he knew from senior staff, a party had not taken place and declared that an investigation would be undertaken by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. Three hours later, Stratton, who featured in the video, resigned from her position as a Government spokesperson for the COP26 summit. \c\cOn 9 December, it was announced that the inquiry led by Simon Case would focus on three events, two at 10 Downing Street on 27 November and 18 December 2020, and one at the Department for Education on 10 December 2020. Johnson was said to have attended the event on 27 November, which is under inquiry. \c\cOn 17 December 2021, it was announced that Case would no longer lead the inquiry following reports that a party had been held in his own office on 17 December 2020. The inquiry is now to be concluded by senior civil servant Sue Gray. Lord Barwell, a former Conservative MP and chief of staff for Theresa May when she was the prime minister, is reported by the BBC to have said "he could not think of a better person for the role". Two opposition politicians, Labour MP Chris Bryant and SNP MP Ian Blackford, called for the inquiry to be led by a person independent of the government and civil service. \c\cIn January 2022, ITV reported that Gray's investigation would also cover the 15 May 2020 photo and Dominic Cummings\' allegations of parties on 20 May and 13 November 2020. \c\cAlex Thomas, the civil service programme director at the Institute for Government told Channel 4, and it was reported in New Statesman, that Sue Gray, as a civil servant, is not independent of government. \c\cGray had reportedly questioned Johnson, by 17 January, about events and also Cummings. Robert Peston reported that she was to talk to a senior official who would also say that Johnson was warned that the 20 May event should not go ahead. Gray has also had access to swipe card and other security data on people's movements in and out of 10 Downing Street, and has talked to police officers who were on duty, whose evidence was described by one source as "extremely damning". Sky News reported that Gray had received photos showing Johnson attending events with alcohol. \c\cGray's report was expected in the week beginning 24 January 2022 and to be about 25 pages long. Following press speculation that the Gray report could be just a brief summary of findings, Labour and the Liberal Democrats stated that all accompanying evidence, including emails and witness accounts, should also be published. The Guardian wrote, "The email is crucial, as Johnson insists he was not warned that the "bring your own booze" event might be against the rules, and that he was unaware it was a party". Deputy Prime Minister, Dominic Raab would not confirm that Gray's report would be published in full, and said that Johnson would decide how much detail would be released publicly. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said "the findings of her [Gray's] report will be made public". In The Guardian, political editor Peter Walker wrote that, if only the findings are released, they are "likely to exclude evidence such as emails, text messages or transcripts of interviews, or precise details about what happened at any of the alleged gatherings". \c\cOn 25 January, ITV political editor Robert Peston, reported that the investigation had concluded and said, "It will, I am told, be a report that will make for very uncomfortable reading for the PM and Tory MPs."\c\cThere was speculation through 26 January about when the report would be released, but it had not been delivered to 10 Downing Street by the conclusion of the day's Commons sitting. It was said to have been delayed by Gray checking the document with lawyers to ensure full publication was possible. On 27 January 2022 Johnson promised to publish the Gray report in full. The BBC suggested that the report may not include WhatsApp messages and photographs, and that not all of Gray's evidence taken or given to the police will be published. \c\cOn 28 January, it was reported that the Metropolitan Police had asked Gray to "keep key details out of her report", of events that they were investigating, to avoid any prejudice to their investigation.  As a result, there was uncertainty over when, or even whether, Gray's report would be published. \c\cGray's report was delivered to Johnson on 31 January 2022. \c\cOn 25 January 2022, Cressida Dick said that the Metropolitan Police would investigate potential breaches of COVID regulations in Whitehall and Downing Street during the pandemic. They contacted the Cabinet Office on 24 January, asking for all relevant information from the Gray inquiry. Dick said such investigations happened in potential cases of the, "most serious and flagrant breach" of rules, or when it appeared the people who did it, "ought to have known that what they were doing was an offence". They are reported to be investigating eight events. \c\cSky News reported that the Metropolitan Police did not object to the inquiry being released before its investigation, and that Gray is in communication with the police. \c\cSince early December 2021, some British media have referred to the controversy over the alleged events as "Partygate". The term is similar to that used for previous political scandals and controversies. Some commentators made comparisons between these possible social gatherings, and the lack of social contact when observing COVID restrictions when people were dying or at funerals. At Prime Minister's Questions on 8 December 2021, Keir Starmer, the leader of the Opposition, raised the example of Prof Trish Greenhalgh being unable to visit her dying mother in December 2020. The Conservative backbench MP Tracey Crouch said, "My constituents have every right to be angry. Their memories of lost loved ones are traumatised knowing that they died alone, first and last Christmases passed by, and many spent what is usually a special day by themselves."\c\cThe story became the subject of political satire by Ant and Dec on the ITV entertainment show I\'m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! A clip of this on social media was seen 5 million times. \c\cThe controversy was seen as one factor in the Conservatives\' loss of a by-election in North Shropshire, held on 16 December 2021. Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC's then political editor, wrote that, "Boris Johnson has been put on notice by his own side" and discussed a possible challenge to his leadership. The New York Times also suggested Johnson's political career was threatened by the controversy. \c\cThere was debate as to whether public disquiet about the controversy might lead to the public being less willing to adhere to new restrictions brought in response to the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, which began spreading in the UK in December 2021. However, Steve Reicher argued in The BMJ that any effect was likely to be small and that it could lead some individuals to be more adherent. \c\cThe Week, the BBC and The Daily Telegraph all selected a photo of Allegra Stratton giving her resignation statement as a key image of 2021. \c\cThe reported gathering on 16 April 2021, on the day before the funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was compared by opposition politicians and The Guardian to the social distancing rules that applied to the funeral attended by Queen Elizabeth II. Professor Vernon Bogdanor said, "It shows that those in government feel entitled to break the rules which ordinary people have been observing". \c\cOn 19 January 2022, in a statement to the London Stock Exchange, JD Wetherspoons founder Tim Martin accused Johnson of "hypocrisy", arguing that much of the controversy would have been avoided if Downing Street staff had been able to visit pubs, which at the time were closed due to lockdown restrictions. On the same day, the campaign group Led By Donkeys produced a spoof video of Johnson being questioned about the controversy by characters from the TV drama Line of Duty. It was viewed 5 million times with a day of publication. \c\cBBC News reported that barrister Adam Wagner argues, "If you were doing something which wasn\'t necessary for work then you weren\'t outside of your house [with] a reasonable excuse and you were potentially committing a criminal offence."  He went on to say that the prime minister and his wife had not left their home to attend as they live in Downing Street. Gatherings in a public place of more than two people were illegal unless they all belonged to the same household or the gathering was "essential for work purposes" and the BBC say "lawyers have noted that Downing Street is not a public place". On the day the party happened the government Twitter account summarised guidance (not legally enforceable) advising that outdoor gatherings should be limited to two people. By 20 May 2020 workplace gatherings guidance said, "Workers should try to minimise all meetings and other gatherings in the workplace."\c\cOn 12 January 2022, during Prime Minister's Questions, Keir Starmer called for the Prime Minister's resignation in his first question. Throughout the day, many senior figures of the Scottish Conservatives called for Johnson to resign, including leader Douglas Ross and former leaders Ruth Davidson and Jackson Carlaw. The Guardian reported that "nearly all" of the 31 Conservative MSPs supported Ross\' call. William Wragg, the Conservative Chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee, called for Johnson's resignation, calling his position "untenable". \c\cOn 13 January, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen in an article for The Daily Telegraph stated that he had submitted a letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister calling for him to resign. The Sutton Coldfield Conservative Association voted unanimously to pass a motion calling for the Prime Minister to stand down. A poll of Conservative Party members conducted in early January 2022 by YouGov found that 38% felt that Johnson was doing a bad job as Prime Minister and 34% wanted him to resign. While these were both still minority positions, they were held by a much larger proportion of members than when YouGov had last polled Conservative members in the summer of 2020. \c\cOn 15 January, former Conservative minister Tobias Ellwood told the BBC that Johnson had to "lead or step aside". MP Andrew Bridgen said: "I don\'t need to see what Sue Gray says to know that for me Boris Johnson has lost the moral authority to lead the country. If there's another emergency where he has to call on the public to make sacrifices, he doesn\'t have that authority. That makes his position in my book, as prime minister, completely untenable." Former children's minister and MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, Tim Loughton called for Johnson to resign, saying that his position was "now untenable". In a post on social media, he said: "His resignation is the only way to bring this whole unfortunate episode to an end and I am working with colleagues to impress that view on Number 10. Obfuscation, prevarication and evasion have been the order of the day when clarity, honesty and contrition was what was needed and what the British people deserve."\c\cIt was reported that as many as 30 Conservative MPs had signed letters to the 1922 Committee requesting a no confidence vote for Johnson. \c\cJohnson faced more anger from MPs as they arrived back at Westminster on 17 January, after dealing with negative responses from Conservative associations and constituents. Some reported they had received almost 1,000 emails from dissatisfied voters. Science Minister George Freeman, said he was "shocked and flabbergasted" added that stories of "boozy" gatherings in No 10 had caused "serious damage" to public trust in the government. Maria Caulfield, a health minister, said that whether or not rules were "technically" breached, "the spirit of the rules" was broken: she would "consider what action is needed" after the report by Sue Gray. \c\cThe Times reported that, on the evening of 18 January, more than 20 Conservative MPs first elected in 2019 had met to discuss Johnson's leadership, with some preparing to submit letters of no confidence after Prime Minister's Questions on 19 January. The Evening Standard said that as many as 20 of the MPs were preparing to submit the letters. This was dubbed the \'Pork Pie Plot\' (or \'Putsch\') by a Johnson loyalist minister as one of the MPs who was said to be involved, Alicia Kearns, represents Rutland and Melton, the town of Melton Mowbray being famous for its pork pies. Kearns has denied being an organiser of the rebellion. The Daily Mirror quickly re-dubbed it the \'Porkie Pie Plot\' in reference to Johnson (in the UK, "porkie pie" is rhyming slang for a lie). \c\cOn 19 January, Bury South MP Christian Wakeford publicly announced that he had submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson's leadership as a result of the scandal. Later that day, shortly before Prime Minister's Questions, Wakeford defected from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party, although his first contact with Labour predated the controversy and he was initially motivated by other issues. \c\cAt the end of Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative former minister David Davis dramatically called for Johnson to resign, quoting Leo Amery calling on Neville Chamberlain to resign during the Norway Debate in 1940, and saying: "You have sat there too long for all the good you have done. In the name of God, go." (The words are originally attributed to Oliver Cromwell.) BBC Newsnight's Political Editor Nick Watt said it was an "extraordinarily significant moment" and that Davis would have intended it to be "particularly devastating" to Johnson. \c\cBy the end of 19 January, some Conservative MPs told the BBC that Wakeford's defection had caused a change in mood, namely that there was a "stepping back" from immediate attempts to obtain a no-confidence vote in Johnson's leadership and a wish to wait until after Sue Gray's report was published. \c\cOn 26 January, Nicky Wylie the leader of the Conservative group on Cheshire East Council quit the party, citing the controversy as her reason. \c\cOn 20 January, Conservative MP William Wragg, chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee, accused 10 Downing Street staff of threatening him and other colleagues over their opposition to Johnson's leadership. He said "the intimidation of a member of parliament is a serious matter" and "The reports of which I\'m aware would seem to constitute blackmail." Wragg claimed damaging publicity had been threatened, as had removal of government investment in MPs’ constituencies. Wragg advised MP's affected to contact the police or the Commons Speaker. \c\cJohnson said he had "seen no evidence [and] heard no evidence" of Wragg's claims and that he would look into them. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, called Wragg's accusations "attention-seeking behaviour" and "nonsense". Energy minister, and former government whip, Greg Hands, said of Wragg's claims that they "not been borne out by anybody else", and that "This is not something that happens". \c\cLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said, "It is simply remarkable that a prime minister could countenance scrapping local projects and funding if MPs refuse to back him. All Boris Johnson cares about is saving his own skin. He's acting more like a mafia boss than a prime minister." Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner called for an investigation. \c\cChair of the Commons Select Committee on Standards, Chris Bryant, said roughly a dozen Conservative MPs had made similar allegations of whips threatening to withdraw funding for their constituencies in the past few days; threats included withholding funds for campaigning and infrastructure such as by-passes and schools. Bryant said, "I have even heard MPs alleging that the prime minister himself has been doing this. What I have said to all of those people is that that is misconduct in public office. The people who should be dealing with such allegations are the police. It is illegal. We are meant to operate as MPs without fear or favour. The allocation of taxpayer funding to constituencies should be according to need, not according to the need to keep the prime minister in his job." Bryant also said, "We are not the United States. We don\'t run a \'pork barrel\' system. It is illegal."
A coup d\'état was attempted in Guinea-Bissau on 1 February 2022. President Umaro Sissoco Embalo said that "many" members of the security forces had been killed in a "failed attack against democracy."\c\cThe president Umaro Sissoco Embalo told AFP news agency in a telephone call: “All is well” and added that the situation is “under control”. The Portugal’s foreign affairs minister, Augusto Santos Silva, said that the president of Guinea-Bissau was at his residence but it was unclear if an attack on the government of Guinea-Bissau was over. \c\cThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) called for peace in Guinea Bissau.  ECOWAS said in a statement, "ECOWAS condemns the coup attempt and holds the military responsible for the physical integrity of President Umaro Sissoco Embalo and members of his government." The statement concluded, " ECOWAS asks the military to return to their barracks and maintain a republican posture" The African Union also condemned the \'attempted coup\'. 
On 2 February 2022, over 60 civilians were killed in a massacre in Djugu territory, Ituri Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo. \c\cDuring the early hours of 2 February 2022, CODECO insurgents armed with machetes and "edged weapons" carried out a massacre of over 60 residents of Plaine Savo, a camp for internally displaced people in Ituri Province in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in which around 4,000 people live. 
The Washington Redskins name controversy involved the name and logo previously used by the Washington Commanders, a National Football League (NFL) franchise located in the Washington metropolitan area. Native American groups had questioned the use of the "Redskins" name and image since the 1960s and the topic began receiving widespread public attention in the 1990s. Native Americans demanding a name change included tribal nations, national tribal organizations, civil rights organizations, and individuals. The largest of these organizations, the National Congress of American Indians, counted the enrollment of its member tribes as totaling 1.2 million individuals in 2013. The Washington team was only one example of the larger Native American mascot controversy, but it received more public attention because modern dictionaries define the name as derogatory or insulting and because the team is located in the nation's capital. After decades of refusal, in 2020 the team responded to economic pressure in the wake of widespread recognition of systemic racism by retiring the name and logo, and began the rebrand process, temporaraly naming themselves the Washington Football Team. It was decided that the new name would leave behind all references to Native Americans and the Commanders nickname was made official on February 2, 2022. \c\cSupport for continued use of the name "Redskins" had come from the team's owners, management, the NFL Commissioner, and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters said that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it was not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as former team president Bruce Allen, also pointed to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a Native American student majority. Supporters asserted that a majority of Native Americans were not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. A 2019 study by UC Berkeley found that 49% of Native Americans found the name offensive, rising to 67% of those who said they regularly participated in native or tribal culture. \c\cIn July 2020, amidst the removal of many names and images as part of the George Floyd protests, a group of investors worth $620 billion wrote letters to major sponsors Nike, FedEx, and PepsiCo encouraging pressure on the Redskins to change their name. \c\cAt the beginning of the protests, when the Redskins participated in "Blackout Tuesday" on June 2, 2020, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded, "Want to really stand for racial justice? Change your name." Subsequently, Washington, D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser reiterated her position that the name is an impediment to the team's return to a stadium in the District of Columbia. A statue of the team's founder, George Preston Marshall, has been removed from the grounds of RFK Stadium after being spray-painted with the words "Change the Name." The management of the stadium stated that the statue would not return, and that its removal was long overdue. In the following week, the team removed mention of Marshall from the team's other facilities and website. \c\cFedEx called on the team to change its name on July 2, 2020. The same day, Nike removed Redskins apparel from its website. \c\cOn July 3, the league and the franchise announced that it was "undergoing a thorough review of the team name." On July 7, it was acknowledged that the Redskins were not in contact with a group of Native Americans who petitioned the NFL to force a name change and that Redskins head coach Ron Rivera also stated the team wanted to continue “honoring and supporting Native Americans and our Military.”\c\cThe team initiated a review which resulted in the decision to retire its name and logo, playing as the Washington Football Team pending adoption of a more permanent name. \c\cTeam president Jason Wright announced on July 12, 2021 that the new name will not include any ties to Native Americans, including the name "Warriors"; research having shown that anything other than a clean break with the past is a slippery slope.  While the team expects fans to continue to wear their jerseys with the former name and logo, Native American inspired headdresses or face paint will not be allowed in the stadium. \c\cThe new name, Washington Commanders, was selected on February 2, 2022. Amanda Blackhorse responded that the change is an empty gesture, the team's owner having made no substantial effort to repair the effects the decades of insults, nor advocated that other teams with offensive mascots also change. \c\cIn 1933, the football team that shared both the name and playing field with the Boston Braves baseball team moved to Fenway Park, already home to the Boston Red Sox. Co-owner George Preston Marshall changed the name to the Redskins, more likely to avoid confusion while retaining the Native American imagery of the team than to honor coach William Henry "Lone Star" Dietz, whose identity as a Native American was debated. The logo for the NFL Braves was similar to the Redskins logo, a Native American head in profile with braids and trailing feathers. A redesigned logo introduced in 1972 was proposed by Walter Wetzel, a former Blackfeet tribal chairman and past president of the National Congress of American Indians, and was modeled after the likeness on the Buffalo nickel. Members of the Blackfeet tribe express a range of opinions, from support to indifference to strong opposition to the Redskins name based upon their personal experiences. \c\cAdvocates of changing the team's name said that stereotypes of Native Americans had to be understood in the context of a history that includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts by federal and state governments to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \c\c"Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as noble savages, ignoble savages, teary-eyed environmentalists or, most recently, simply as casino-rich, native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted."\c\cThe historical context for the emergence in the Americas of racial identities based upon skin color was the establishment of colonies which developed a plantation economy dependent upon slave labor. Prior to the colonial era, many Europeans identified themselves as Christians rather than white. "At the start of the eighteenth century, Indians and Europeans rarely mentioned the color of each other's skins. By midcentury, remarks about skin color and the categorization of peoples by simple color-coded labels (red, white, black) had become commonplace."\c\cDocuments from the colonial period indicate that the use of "red" as an identifier by Native Americans for themselves emerged in the context of Indian-European diplomacy in the southeastern region of North America, before later being adopted by Europeans and becoming a generic label for all Native Americans.  Linguistic evidence indicates that, while some tribes may have used red to refer to themselves during the Pre-Columbian era based upon their origin stories, the general use of the term was in response to meeting people who called themselves "white" and their slaves "black".  The choice of red rather than other colors may have been due to cultural associations, rather than skin color. \c\cIn the debate over the meaning of the word "redskin", team supporters frequently cite a paper by Ives Goddard, a Smithsonian Institution senior linguist and curator emeritus, who asserts that the term was a direct translation of words used by Native Americans to refer to themselves and was benign in its original meaning. In an interview Goddard admits that it is impossible to verify if the native words were accurately translated. Darren R. Reid, a history lecturer at Coventry University, contends that Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers. Reid states that the team logo works together with the name to reinforce an unrealistic stereotype: "It is not up to non-Indians to define an idealized image of what it is to a Native American." The "positive" stereotypes allow fans and supporters to honestly state that they are honoring Native Americans, but this is "forcing your idea of what it is to honour those people onto them and that, fundamentally, is disrespectful." Sociologist James V. Fenelon makes a more explicit statement that Goddard's article is poor scholarship, given that the conclusion of the origin and usage by Natives as "entirely benign" is divorced from the socio-historical realities of hostility and racism from which it emerged. \c\cAdvocates of changing the name emphasize current meanings in dictionaries of American English, which include "usually offensive", "disparaging", "insulting", and "taboo". Such meanings are consistent with the usage found in books in the period between 1875 and 1930, which is after that studied by Goddard. John McWhorter, an associate professor of linguistics at Columbia University, compares "redskin" becoming a slur to other racial terms, such as "Oriental", which acquired implied meanings associated with contempt. \c\cA controversial etymological claim is that the term emerged from the practice of paying a bounty for Indians, and that "redskin" refers to the bloody scalp of Native Americans. Although official documents do not use the word in this way, a historical association between the use of "redskin" and the paying of bounties can be made.  In 1863, a Winona, Minnesota, newspaper, the Daily Republican, printed an announcement: "The state reward for dead Indians has been increased to $200 for every red-skin sent to Purgatory. This sum is more than the dead bodies of all the Indians east of the Red River are worth." A news story published by the Atchison Daily Champion in Atchison, Kansas, on October 9, 1885, tells of the settlers "hunt for redskins, with a view of obtaining their scalps" valued at $250. For sociologist C. Richard King the lack of direct evidence does not mean that contemporary Native people are wrong to draw an association between a term that emphasizes an identity based upon skin color and a history that commodified Native American body parts. \c\cThe meaning of the term "redskin" was addressed in two cases challenging the trademark registrations held by Pro-Football, Inc., the team's corporate entity. The challenge was based upon a provision of the Lanham Act which prohibited the registration of any mark that "may disparage persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute." The first case, filed in 1992 by Suzan Shown Harjo and six other Native American leaders resulted in the cancellation of the federal registrations for the Redskins marks by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB); however in 2005 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia reversed the TTAB's decision on the grounds of insufficient evidence of disparagement. Subsequent appeals were also rejected on the basis of laches, that the Native American petitioners had pursued their rights in an untimely manner. \c\cA second case was filed with younger plaintiffs not affected by laches, led by Amanda Blackhorse. The linguistic expert for the petitioners, Geoffrey Nunberg, successfully argued that whatever its origins, "redskins" was a slur at the time of the trademark registrations, based upon the passages from books and newspapers and the movie clips in which the word is inevitably associated with contempt, derision, condescension, or sentimental paeans to the noble savage. "Nigger" also began as a benign reference to skin color, only to become a racial slur through disparaging use. On June 18, 2014, the TTAB again voted to cancel the trademarks in a two to one decision that held that the term "redskins" is disparaging to a "substantial composite of Native Americans." Evidence of disparagement include the frequent references to "scalping" made by sportswriters for sixty years when reporting the Redskins loss of a game, and passages from movies made from the 1940s to the 1960s using "redskin" to refer to Native Americans as a savage enemy. The TTAB majority held that the NCAI represented about 30 percent of Native Americans during the time in question, which the Board found satisfied the substantial composite test of the trademark law. \c\cIn December 2015, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the disparagement prohibition in the trademark law in a case (Matal v. Tam) involving a denial of trademark registration to the Asian-American band The Slants. The majority opinion stated, in part, that "[w]hatever our personal feelings about the mark at issue here, or other disparaging marks, the First Amendment forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find speech likely to offend others." On June 19, 2017, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of Tam, stating "The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government's contention, trademarks are private, not government speech." On June 29, 2017, both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department withdrew from any further litigation now that the Supreme Court has rendered the legal issue moot. While team owner Daniel Snyder expresses the opinion that the court decision is a victory for the team, the Executive Director of the NCAI asserts that the name remains a slur, and the decision that grants it First Amendment protection does not alter any of the arguments against its continued use. \c\cSupporters of the Redskins name note that three predominantly Native American high schools use the name for their sports teams, suggesting that it can be acceptable. However, in 2013, the principal of one of these, Red Mesa High School in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created". Teec Nos Pos, on the Navajo Nation, is 96.5% Native American. Wellpinit, Washington, a town within a reservation of the Spokane people, is 79.3% Native American. In 2014, Wellpinit High School voted to keep the Redskins name. The third school, Kingston High School in Kingston, Oklahoma is 57.69% Native American. \c\cNative American writer and attorney Gyasi Ross compares Native American use of variations of the word "redskin" with African-American use of variations of the word "nigger"; specifically Natives calling each other "skins" as analogous to "nigga". Ross argues that the use of terms by some members of minority communities does not mean that the same may be used by outsiders; this is generally recognized by white people with regard to black expressions, yet whites feel free to say how Natives should feel about "redskin". Ross also notes that there is no consensus among Natives regarding either opposition to the Washington team's use of the name, or the importance of the issue compared to more immediate concerns. However, in response to the argument that Native Americans ought to focus on social issues larger than a team name, Ross stated that "Native people shouldn\'t be forced to choose between living or racial discrimination. Those are false binaries."\c\cIn February 2013 a symposium on the topic was held at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York sponsored a series of radio ads in each city to coincide with games of the 2013 season, each featuring a targeted message. A broader range of persons spoke in favor of change or open discussion, including local government leaders, members of Congress, and President Barack Obama. Statements in support of a name change by academic, civil rights and religious organizations were added to those that Native American groups have been making for decades. \c\cIn 2017, when professional sports dealt with a number of racial issues, from individual acts by players to widespread protests during the National Anthem, some commentators speculated why there had been no action to address the stereotyping of Native Americans, including the decision to have the Washington Redskins host a game on Thanksgiving. \c\cThe issue is often discussed in the media in terms of offensiveness or political correctness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the historical, psychological and sociological context provided by academic research on the negative effects of the use of Native American names and images by sports teams. The effect of stereotyping on high or low expectations, confidence, and academic performance has been well-established. This effect is enhanced due to the invisibility of Native Americans in mainstream society and media, leaving stereotypes as the primary basis for thinking about the abilities and traits associated with Natives, including the roles and opportunities Natives Americans envision for themselves. Furthermore, even when stereotypes are positive (e.g. "Native Americans are spiritual"), they may have a limiting, detrimental effect on individuals. Stereotyping may directly affect the academic performance and self-esteem of Native American youth, whose people face high rates of suicide, unemployment, and poverty. Euro-Americans exposed to mascots may be more likely to believe not only that such stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Research indicates that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking with regard to other minority groups in addition to the target of the stereotype, a "spreading effect". \c\cNative Americans opposed to mascots point to the oversimplification of their culture by fans "playing Indian" with no understanding of the deeper meaning of feathers, face paint, chants, and dancing. Richard Lapchick, director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, wrote: "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in black face at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with war paint on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?"  The unofficial mascot of the Redskins team was Zema Williams (aka Chief Zee), an African American man who attended games for 38 years beginning in 1978 dressed in a red faux "Indian" costume, complete with feathered war bonnet and rubber tomahawk. Other fans dress in similar costumes for games. \c\cIn a report published by the Center for American Progress summarizing the research on "The Real Impact of Native Mascots and Team Names on American Indian and Alaska Native Youth", a case is made that the public debate misses the point, since individual opinions on either side do not matter given the measurable effects on the mental health of Native American young people exposed to such misrepresentations of their ethnic identity, and the often hostile or insulting behavior of non-natives that occur when teams with such names and mascots play. Clinical Psychologist Michael Friedman writes that the use of Native imagery, in particular the use of a dictionary defined slur, is a form of bullying, the negative impact of which is magnified by its being officially sanctioned. \c\cThe majority of scholars argue that the use of any stereotype, whether positive or negative, is a hindrance to the advancement of the targeted group. The national organizations representing several academic disciplines, after reviewing the research done on the issue, have passed resolutions calling for the end of all Native American mascots and images in sports. These include the Society of Indian Psychologists (1999), the American Counseling Association (2001), the American Psychological Association (2005), the American Sociological Association (2007). and the American Anthropological Association (2015). The executive board of the nation's leading organization of scholars of U.S. history approved a resolution in April 2015: "The Organization of American Historians hereby adds its voice to the growing demands by Native American organizations, our sister disciplines, and conscientious people of all ethnic backgrounds, to change the name and logo of the Washington \'Redskins\'."\c\cIn the 1940s the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports. The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the Braves and the Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people,  and demean their native traditions and rituals. The NCAI issued a new report in 2013 summarizing opposition to Indian mascots and team names generally, and the Washington Redskins in particular. In the trademark case, the TTAB placed significance on the NCAI opposition, estimating that the organization represented about 30% of the Native American population at the time the trademarks were granted, which met their criteria for a "substantial composite" of Native Americans finding the name disparaging. In its amicus brief filed in the case, the NCAI states that the combined enrollment of its member tribes in 2013 was 1.2 million individuals. \c\cMany tribal councils have passed resolutions or issued statements regarding their opposition to the name of the Washington Redskins, including the Cherokee and Comanche Nations of Oklahoma, the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes, the Oneida Indian Nation (New York), the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (North Dakota) and the United South and Eastern Tribes (USET). In April 2014, Navajo Nation Council voted in favor of a statement opposing the name of the Washington team, as well as other disparaging references to American Indians by other professional sports franchises. Other Native American groups advocating change include: the Native American Bar Association of DC, the National Caucus of Native American State Legislators, and the Society of American Indian Government Employees. \c\cIndividual Native Americans who are or have been actively opposed to the Redskins\' name include:\c\cChief Ray Halbritter of the Oneida Indian Nation\c\cAuthor Sherman Alexie (Spokane)\c\cCo-founder of the American Indian Movement Clyde Bellecourt (Ojibwe)\c\cFormer U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell (Northern Cheyenne)\c\cHistorian and author Vine Deloria, Jr. (Sioux)\c\cDirector of the National Museum of the American Indian Kevin Gover (Pawnee)\c\cAuthor and recent Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Suzan Shown Harjo (Cheyenne/Hodulgee Muscogee)\c\cActivist/actor Russell Means (Oglala Lakota)\c\cAt its 2013 annual conference, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights (LCCHR), which includes the NAACP and the ACLU as members, passed a unanimous resolution of the 85 representatives present that, while recognizing that a business has the First Amendment right to use any name that it chooses, others need not be complicit in the use of a pejorative and insulting name; and calling upon all Federal, state and local government entities "to end any preferential tax, zoning, or policy treatment that could be viewed as supporting the franchise as long as it retains its current team name". The resolution also commended the "current and former government officials, media outlets, and other entities that have encouraged the Washington Redskins franchise to change its team name or that have refused to be complicit in promoting the current team name". In response, the team released a brief statement reiterating their previous position, and quoting two individuals as being both Native American and Redskins fans who do not want the name to change. The LCCHR also issued a press release in 2014 applauding the decision to cancel the trademark protection for the team's name. The NAACP issued their own press release supporting the TTAB decision stating "The NAACP has called specifically for this name change since 1992, and will continue to stand with the Native Indian community until the derogatory moniker has been changed."\c\cThe Fritz Pollard Alliance, a non-profit organization closely allied with the NFL on civil rights issues, announced its support of a name change in 2015 after repeated attempts to discuss the issue with the team owner and representatives. An attorney for the Alliance, N. Jeremi Duru, an American University law professor, made a study of the controversy in which he concluded that Native Americans are justified in finding the name offensive. \c\cIn 1992, the Central Conference of American Rabbis issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams names that promote racism, in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins. The Anti-Defamation League was one of the organizations signing a letter to broadcasters urging them to avoid using the name. The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism also advocates a name change. \c\cIn 2013 a group of 61 religious leaders in Washington, D.C., sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and team owner Dan Snyder stating their moral obligation to join the Change the Mascot movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended. \c\cIn June 2015, the United Church of Christ General Synod passed a resolution calling for a stop to using images or mascots that could be demeaning to the Native American community. \c\cIn June 2016; Sidwell Friends School, affiliated with the Quakers, amended its dress code to ban apparel with the Redskins name or logo as "offensive and antithetical to the values of the community". In August 2017; another private school in Montgomery County, Maryland, adopted a similar policy. \c\cIn 2018 a Native American employee filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy claiming that the agency racially discriminated against her by allowing other employees to discuss the Washington Redskins football team and display Redskins paraphernalia at work. She also alleges that the Department of Energy retaliated against her after she raised concerns about the Redskins following in the office. The United States District Court, District of Columbia dismissed the discrimination claim on the basis that the derogatory nature of the team name is in dispute, and that  the law does not require employers to take sides in that dispute. In addition, while accepting that the name is hurtful to the employee, discussion of a local football team by co-workers is not equivalent to the use of a hurtful term directed toward an individual. However, the court did not dismiss the claim that the agency retaliated against the employee for bringing up the issue. \c\cIn response to the possibility that the team could return to the District of Columbia in a new stadium, a coalition of nine civil rights organizations issued a statement in August 2018 that such a move should not be made "unless the team agrees to drop the \'R-word\' racial slur as its mascot."\c\cAlthough often assumed to be a debate of recent origins, local Washington, D.C. newspapers published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971, all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking for the name to be changed. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, prompting numerous Native Americans to write letters to Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke; others boycotted Redskins products and protested, but Cooke rejected the possibility of change. There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; the American Indian Movement's (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt was one of the main organizers of the protest. \c\cSince 2013, picketing at stadiums occurred occasionally when the Redskins played, particularly in cities with a significant population of Native Americans, such as Dallas, Denver and Minneapolis. The latter protest was supported by several Minnesota politicians and was through documented by two films: Dodging Bullets—Stories from Survivors of Historical Trauma and More Than A Word. Picketing resumed for the 2014 season in Glendale, Arizona, when the team played the Arizona Cardinals, and again the largest rally was in Minneapolis, where estimates of the number of protestors was between 3,500 and 5,000. At a protest in Philadelphia in 2017, Native Americans pointed out the irony of NFL players making a statement opposing racial injustice by "taking a knee" for the National Anthem while one of the teams taking the field continues to use a racially offensive name and logo. Playing in Minnesota for the first time since 2014, hundreds of Native Americans protested against the team name outside of U.S. Bank Stadium during the game on October 24, 2019. On December 8, 2019, members of the Wisconsin Indian Education Association's Indian Mascot and Logo Task Force led a protest at Lambeau Field in Wisconsin. The Oneida Nation sponsored a video shown on the Jumbotron during the game expressing pride in being Native American as the antithesis of the message sent by the Redskins name and logo. \c\cFedEx owns the naming rights to the team's stadium, FedExField, through 2026, and had been the only corporate sponsor officially subject to boycotts by Native Americans: the Osage Nation, the Native American Rights Fund (NARF), and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes, the largest tribe of Native Alaskan peoples. \c\cOn December 13, 2017 a Native American group, Rising Hearts, created a Twitter campaign and several parody web sites including one for the team that made it appear that the Redskins had agreed to change its name to the Washington Redhawks for the 2018 season. The organizers stated that their intention was to stimulate debate that will eventually lead to an actual name change. \c\cFollowing the February 2013 symposium "Racist Stereotypes and Cultural Appropriation in American Sports" at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, 10 members of Congress sent a letter to the Redskins\' owner and the NFL Commissioner requesting that the name be changed since it is offensive to Native Americans. In response, Daniel Snyder told USA Today: "We\'ll never change the name. ... It's that simple. NEVER—you can use caps." Snyder addressed an open letter to fans that was published in The Washington Post on October 9, 2013; in which he stated that the most important meaning of the name is the association that fans have with memories of their personal history with the team. Snyder also states that the name was chosen in 1933 to honor Native Americans in general and the coach and four players at that time who were Native American; and that in 1971 coach George Allen consulted with the Red Cloud Indian Fund on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation when designing the logo. In 2013, the Red Cloud Athletic Fund sent a letter to the Washington Post stating that "As an organization, Red Cloud Indian School has never—and will never—endorse the use of the name \'Redskins\'. Like many Native American organizations across the country, members of our staff and extended community find the name offensive."\c\cIn June 2013, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell defended the name by citing its origins, traditions and polls that support its popularity. In February 2018, following the announcement by MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred that the Cleveland Indians would remove their Chief Wahoo logo from the stadium and uniforms, Goodell stated that the Redskins name and logo would remain, primarily citing the 2016 Washington Post opinion poll. \c\cOn their website the team stated that a 2014 annual NFL poll showing 71 percent support for the name, "along with the poll taken among Native Americans by the Annenberg Institute, demonstrates continued, widespread and deep opposition to the Redskins changing our name... We respect the point of view of the small number of people who seek a name change, but it is important to recognize very few people agree with the case they are making."\c\cBruce Allen addressed a letter dated May 23, 2014, to then Senate majority leader Harry Reid repeating the position that the name was originated by Native Americans to refer to themselves, that the logo was also designed and approved by Native American leaders, and that the vast majority of both Native Americans and the public do not find the name offensive. \c\cConservative columnists George Will and Pat Buchanan stated that opponents of the team name are being oversensitive, although Charles Krauthammer drew a parallel between the evolution of "Negro" and "Redskin" from being in common use to being condescending and insulting.  W. James Antle III, Rich Lowry, and Dennis Prager wrote that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals, rather than being the authentic voice of Native Americans. \c\cThree Virginia Indian leaders said in 2013 that they are not offended by the name Redskins but are more concerned about other issues such as the lack of Federal recognition for any Virginia tribe. Robert "Two Eagles" Green, retired chief of the Fredericksburg area Patawomeck Tribe, stated on a radio talk show he would be offended if the team changed its name. In an article in The American Spectator, the chief of the Patawomeck Tribe, John Lightner, said that while he was not offended by the current name, he would support changing the team to the Washington Potomacs. \c\cOn November 25, 2013, as part of the NFL's "Salute to Service" month and Native American Heritage month, the Washington Redskins recognized four members of the Navajo Code Talkers Association briefly during a commercial break. One of them, Roy Hawthorne, has stated, "My opinion is that's a name that not only the team should keep, but that's a name that's American." This action was criticized by Amanda Blackhorse, also Navajo, who described it as a publicity stunt. In April 2014, Navajo Nation Council voted in favor of a statement opposing the name of the Washington team, as well as other disparaging references to American Indians by other professional sports franchises. Later that year, members of the Navajo and Zuni Tribes and students from the Red Mesa Redskins High School attended a Redskins vs. Cardinals game as guests of the Washington team. \c\cIn 2014, the Redskins released a two-minute video on YouTube entitled "Redskins is a Powerful Name" in which several Native Americans express their support for the team. Of the fourteen individuals, five are members of the Chippewa Cree tribe on the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation in Montana and are associated with the Team Redskins Rodeo club. Two are Mike Wetzel and Don Wetzel, Jr. (Blackfeet), descendants of the logo designer, and the six others are members of diverse tribes and state that they are fans of the team and find nothing wrong with the name, or think it is positive. One of the individuals in the video is Mark One Wolf, who was reported as being born Mark E. Yancey in Washington, D.C., of African-American and Japanese descent. \c\cIn July, 2020, the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, Virginia, which is the location of the corporate headquarters of the team, sent a letter to the owner urging a change. \c\cIn the mid-2010s, the majority of those advocating a name change were Democrats, though there was no indication that the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls during that period showed a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California. \c\cIn November 2015, President Barack Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms. On May 22, 2014, fifty U.S. Senators, forty-eight Democrats and two Independents, sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Goodell asking the league, referencing the Donald Sterling case, to "send the same clear message as the NBA did: that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports." Five Democratic Senators declined to sign the letter, and Republicans were not invited to do so.  During his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump defended the name. \c\cThe team headquarters is in Ashburn, Virginia and its home stadium, FedExField, is in Landover, Maryland. Much of the local political discussion has been about the location of a stadium, beginning in the 1990s. The mayors of Washington asserted that a return to the District of Columbia was contingent upon a name change, a possibility the team had rejected. In 2018 the NAACP also opposed the return of the team to the District unless the name where changed. \c\cFor many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Virginia fans were the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. Several Maryland politicians stated that the name should change, but governor Larry Hogan at that time opposed any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. \c\cIn addition to several direct sponsors advocating change in 2020, retailers Amazon, Nike, Target and Walmart withdrew Redskins merchandise from their stores and websites. \c\cTwo professors at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University summarized their research in a 2014 New York Times editorial. They found that studies of college teams that have changed their names and mascots indicate that doing so has a long-term financial benefit. While vocal opponents of change often threatened withdrawal of support, this never materialized. There have been no name changes by professional teams, though a comparison of NFL teams shows the highest negative trend in brand equity affects the Washington Redskins and the Kansas City Chiefs, calling into question the business logic of retaining Native American names or logos that are offensive to even a minority. \c\cThe number of high schools using the Redskins name has been in steady decline, 40% having had local efforts to change the name. Between 1988 and April 2013, 28 high schools in 18 states had done so. By December 2017, the number of high school "Redskins" had continued to decline from 62 to 49, including four affected by a 2015 California law. Following the Washington NFL decision, changes by high schools have accelerated, with only 40 remaining. \c\cCollege teams that had been Redskins changed their names voluntarily decades ago, including: the University of Utah became the Utah Utes in 1972; Miami University became the RedHawks in 1997; and the Southern Nazarene University became the Crimson Storm in 1998. \c\cWhile varying somewhat, national opinion polls consistently indicated that a majority of the general public did not advocate a name change: 79 percent (April 2013), 60 percent (June 2014), and 71 percent (September 2014). \c\c In three polls, although they supported the team name, 59 percent, 56 percent, and 53 percent of DC, Maryland, and Virginia fans also said that the word "redskin" is offensive to Native Americans in at least some contexts. The September 2014 national poll found that 68 percent think the name is not disrespectful of Native Americans, 19 percent say it shows "some" disrespect, and 9 percent say it is "a lot" disrespectful. \c\cIn May 2016, The Washington Post released a poll of self-identified Native Americans that 90% of the 504 respondents were "not bothered" by the team's name. NCAI Executive Director Jacqueline Pata stated "The survey doesn\'t recognize the psychological impacts these racist names and imagery have on American Indian and Alaska Natives. It is not respectful to who we are as Native people. This poll still doesn\'t make it right." The Native American Journalists Association issued a statement calling the publication of the poll, and the reporting of its significance, as not only inaccurate and misleading but unethical. "The reporters and editors behind this story must have known that it would be used as justification for the continued use of these harmful, racist mascots. They were either willfully malicious or dangerously naïve in the process and reporting used in this story, and neither is acceptable from any journalistic institution." The Washington Post editorial board continued to support changing the name, citing opposition to such mascots by Native American tribes, which has resulted in continued retirement of "Redskins" by high schools such as in Driggs, Idaho in 2019. 
Since the 1960s, the issue of Native American and First Nations names and images being used by sports teams as mascots has been the subject of increasing public controversy in the United States and Canada. This has been a period of rising Indigenous civil rights movements, and Native Americans and their supporters object to the use of images and names in a manner and context they consider derogatory. They have conducted numerous protests and tried to educate the public on this issue. \c\cIn response since the 1970s, an increasing number of secondary schools have retired such Native American names and mascots. Changes accelerated in 2020, following public actions related to issues of institutional racism and nationally covered cases of police misconduct. National attention has been focused on the prominent use of names and images by professional franchises including the Washington Football Team (Redskins until July 2020) and the Cleveland Guardians (Indians until November 2021). In Canada, the Edmonton Eskimos have become the Edmonton Elks. Each such change at the professional level has been followed by changes of school teams; for instance, 29 changed their names between August and December 2020. But the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) says some 1,900 schools in 1,025 school districts still have caricature tribal mascots. \c\cThe issue has often been reported in the media only in terms of Native American individuals being affected by the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances. This reduces the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. It prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate such practices. Social science research has shown that sports mascots and images are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects in society. A 2020 analysis of this research indicates only negative effects; those psychologically detrimental to Native American students and to non-Native persons by promoting negative stereotypes and prejudicial ideas of Native Americans and undermining inter-group relations. Based on such research showing negative effects, more than 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts, have adopted resolutions stating that such use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping; it promotes misunderstanding and prejudice that contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans. \c\cDefenders of mascots often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being strong, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. In general, the social sciences recognize that all ethnic stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals. Defenders of the status quo also state that the issue is not important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than "political correctness", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. \c\cThe NCAI and over 1,500 national Native organizations and advocates have called for a ban on all Native imagery, names, and other appropriation of Native culture in sports. The joint letter included over 100 Native-led organizations, as well as tribal leaders and members of over 150 federally recognized tribes, reflecting their consensus that Native mascots are harmful. Use of such imagery and terms has declined, but at all levels of American and Canadian sports it remains fairly common. Former Representative Deb Haaland (D-New Mexico), approved in March 2021 as the first Indigenous Secretary of the Interior, has long advocated for teams to change such mascots. \c\cEuropean Americans have had a history of "playing Indian" that dates back to the colonial period. In the 19th century, fraternal organizations such as the Tammany Societies and the Improved Order of Red Men adopted the words and material culture of Native Americans in part to establish an aboriginal identity, while ignoring the dispossession and conquest of Indigenous peoples. This practice spread to youth groups, such as the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) (in particular, the Order of the Arrow) and many summer camps. University students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted Indian names and symbols for their sports teams, as traditional Native American life was imagined by European Americans. \c\cProfessional team names had similar origins. In professional baseball the team that is now the Atlanta Braves was founded as the Boston Red Stockings in 1871; becoming the Boston Braves in 1912. Their owner, James Gaffney, was a member of New York City's political machine, Tammany Hall. It was nominally formed to honor Tamanend, a chief of the Lenape, then known as the Delaware. The team that moved to become the Washington Redskins in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves; both the football and baseball teams played at Braves Field. After moving to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a "red" identifier while retaining the Braves "Indian Head" logo. While defenders of the Redskins sometimes say the name honored coach William Henry Dietz, who claimed Native American heritage, the use of Native American names and imagery by this NFL team began in 1932 - before Dietz was hired in 1933. \c\cThe Cleveland Indians\' name originated from a request by club owner Charles Somers to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the "Naps", following the departure of their star player Nap Lajoie after the 1914 season. The name "Indians" was chosen. It was a nickname previously applied to the old Cleveland Spiders baseball club during the time when Louis Sockalexis, a member of the Penobscot tribe of Maine, played for Cleveland. The success of the Boston Braves in the 1914 World Series may have been another reason for adopting an Indian mascot. The version that the team is named to honor Sockalexis, as the first Native American to play Major League Baseball, cannot be verified from historical documents. According to a 21st-century account, the contemporary news stories reporting the new name in 1915 make no mention of Sockalexis, but do make numerous insulting references to Native Americans. \c\cThe stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures. The government-sponsored boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries separated young Native Americans from their families in an effort to assimilate them to the mainstream and educate them as European Americans. As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland (Anishinaabe) and David E. Wilkins (Lumbee), both professors of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota: \c\cIn the 1940s, the NCAI created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports. The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the Braves and the Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people and demean their traditions and rituals. "Often citing a long-held myth by non-Native people that "Indian" mascots "honor Native people," American sports businesses such as the NFL's Washington \'Redskins\' and Kansas City \'Chiefs\', MLB's Cleveland \'Indians\' and Atlanta \'Braves\', and the NHL's Chicago Black Hawks, continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were commonplace."\c\cSeveral of the founders of the American Indian Movement, including Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest team names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites Indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism. By placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, this continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism. \c\cNative mascots are part of the larger issues of cultural appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights. This encompasses all instances when non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. Scholars contend that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress Indigenous groups. The use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots has been characterized as contributing to the marginalization of the people in the larger culture. While consultation with other minorities on major projects has improved, decisions affecting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, have been made while excluding Native concerns. \c\cIssues related to misunderstanding of Native American legal status have also arisen in cases of foster care or adoption of Native American children. Among these is what is known as the Baby Veronica case, in which a child was adopted by a white family without the consent of her father, an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation. Federal legislation has been passed to strengthen the priority of tribes in determining the care of their children, as often extended family take over care when needed. \c\cNot all Native Americans totally oppose mascots. Steven Denson (Chickasaw), a professor at Southern Methodist University, has said that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner. He says: \c\cThe NCAI has recognized the right of individual tribes to establish relationships with teams that allow the latter to retain tribal names. For instance, the Spokane Indians, a minor league baseball team, has established a relationship with the Spokane tribe. It has abandoned Native American imagery that it had used when the team was founded in 1903. The logo is an "S" and includes a feather; "Spokane" is written on the team jerseys in Salish, the Spokane language; this is also used for bilingual signs in the ballpark. The mascot is a person dressed as a trout, in reference to the tribe's tradition of fishing. Opponents of Native mascots are divided on this approach. Suzan Shown Harjo says that there is no such thing as a positive stereotype; while Stephanie Fryberg responds that even if the team's use of the name may be respectful, opposing fans may use racist gestures and references. \c\cA consensus on the damage caused by the use of Native American mascots was stated by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999:\c\cSports mascots have been cited as an example of microaggressions, the everyday insults that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to by other groups in society. \c\cIn 2005, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative effects on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. Such use also affects non-natives: by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, and preventing learning about Native American culture. The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs, traditions and values of Native Americans. In 2021, the New York Association of School Psychologists reiterated the APA position on Native mascots in its position statement advocating the inclusion of Indigenous persons in educational programs regarding diversity. \c\cSimilar resolutions have been adopted by the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport, the American Sociological Association, the American Counseling Association, and the American Anthropological Association. In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students, the National Education Association included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as a recommendation for improvement. In 2018, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced it would no longer consider teams with racist mascots, such as the Kansas City and Washington football teams, for its annual RWJF Sports Award; this recognizes organizations that contribute to public health through sports. \c\cSocial science research has substantiated the objections by Native Americans to use of such elements. In particular, studies support the view that sports mascots and images are not trivial. Stereotyping directly affects academic performance and self-esteem of Native American students, contributing to other issues faced by Native Americans, including suicide, unemployment, and poverty. European Americans exposed to mascots are more likely to believe not only that stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Two studies examining the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot found a tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group (Asian Americans), which is indicative of a "spreading effect". Exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking; demonstrating the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. A connection between stereotyping and racism of any group increasing the likelihood of stereotyping others was made by Native Americans opposing the "Indians" mascot in Skowhegan, Maine, when fliers promoting the KKK were distributed in that town. \c\cThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for the end of the use of Native American names, images, and mascots in 1999. \c\cIn 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released an advisory opinion calling for an end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans. \c\cIn a report issued in 2012, a United Nations expert on Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples cited the continued use of Native American references by sports team as a part of the stereotyping that "obscures understanding of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive racially discriminatory attitudes." Justice Murray Sinclair, the head of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said in 2015 "sports teams with offensive names, such as Redskins and cartoonish aboriginal-looking mascots have no place in a country trying to come to grips with racism in its past". \c\cIn testimony at a session of the Nebraska Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in December 2020, local Tribal leaders said it's time for the 22 schools statewide to review their use of Native American names, symbols, and images for their mascots. The Nebraska School Activities Association which oversees interscholastic sports indicated support for ongoing discussion, but that they had no authority to issue statewide mandates regarding mascots. University of Nebraska Omaha Professor Edouardo Zendejas, a member of the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska, in addition to advocating legislation, sees the need to revise the history curriculum to include accurate information regarding Native Americans which is currently lacking. \c\cWhile all advocates for elimination of Native mascots agree that the practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for legal remedy based upon violation of civil rights. Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by African Americans and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The appropriation of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular African Americans, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the "noble savage" honors Native Americans. \c\cIn February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a complaint with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established. \c\cA legal claim of discrimination rests upon a group agreeing that a particular term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage who say they are not offended. This raised the difficulty of Native American identity in the United States, also an evolving controversy. \c\cIn 1992, the Central Conference of American Rabbis issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams names that promote racism, in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins. In 2001, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution to establish relationships with groups working to end the use of Indian images and symbols for sports and media mascots. In 2004, the United Methodist Church also passed a resolution condemning the use of Native American team names and sports mascots, which was highlighted in a meeting of the Black caucus of that organization in 2007. \c\cIn 2013 group of sixty-one religious leaders in Washington, D.C. sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Redskins owner Daniel Snyder stating their moral obligation to join the "Change the Mascot" movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended. \c\cMembers of the Indian Affairs Committee of the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends approved a formal statement condemning the name of the Washington football team, stating that "the NFL has violated its core principles for decades by allowing the team playing in Washington, D.C., to carry the name \'redskins,\' a racist epithet that insults millions of Native Americans. Continued use of the term encourages and perpetuates persecution, disrespect, and bigotry against Native men, women, and children". The Torch Committee, the student government organization of the Sandy Spring Friends School in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, voted to ban any apparel on the campus which includes the Redskins name, although the logo would continue to be allowed. \c\cIn a meeting March 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Central Atlantic Conference of the United Church of Christ (UCC) unanimously passed a resolution proposing that its members boycott Washington Redskins games and shun products bearing the team's logo until the team changes its name and mascot. Redskin's spokesman Tony Wyllie offered a response, saying, "We respect those who disagree with our team's name, but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen to the voice of the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Native Americans, who support our name and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community." At its annual meeting in June 2014, the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting the boycott. The resolution and boycott was passed by the National Synod of the UCC in June, 2015. \c\cGeneral public opinion is shifting towards approval of eliminating mascots, with a majority of fans and younger people supporting recent changes by professional teams, as indicated by an Nielson poll conducted in March 2021. \c\cThe topic became an issue on a national level in the twenty-first century, with a hearing before the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2011, and a symposium at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in 2013. In November, 2015 President Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms. \c\cMainstream opinion reflects the function of identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. In an open letter published in 2013, Daniel Snyder explicitly invoked these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to the players and the team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots being clearly racist. \c\cSome individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to Native American people. Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team in 2003, declared in the magazine Sports Illustrated that his team's name "symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership", and that the "Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people". \c\cHowever, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. Richard Lapchick, director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in black face at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with war paint on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?"\c\cOthers claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. Chief Illiniwek, the former mascot for the University of Illinois, became the subject of protest in 1988. In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: "His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them." However, the mascot costume was not based on the clothing of the people of the Illinois Confederation, but of the Lakota people, and the first three men to portray Illiniwek were not performing authentic Native American dances, but routines they had learned from other non-Native hobbyists in the Boy Scouts of America. The Peoria people are the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy. In response to requests by those who had portrayed the mascot to bring back occasional performances, Peoria Chief John P. Froman reaffirmed the tribe's position that Chief (Illiniwek) "was not in any way representative of Peoria culture". \c\cConservative columnists have asserted that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals, rather than being the authentic voice of Native Americans. \c\cMany argue there is a double standard in Native Americans being so frequently used as a sports team name or mascot when the same usage would be unthinkable for other racial or ethnic group. One current exception is the Coachella Valley High School "Arabs" which has also been the subject of controversy, resulting in the retirement of its more cartoonish representations. \c\cThe University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's "Ragin\' Cajuns" are sometimes cited as counter-arguments to those that favor change. However, rather than referring to "others" these teams employ symbols that European American cultures have historically used to represent themselves. The University of Notre Dame mascot, the Leprechaun is a mythical being that represents the Irish, which is both an ethnic and a national group. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette mascot is an anthropomorphic cayenne pepper, an ingredient frequently found in Cajun cuisine. Proponents of change also see a false equivalency in the argument that if one group is not insulted by a particular portrayal, then no group has the right to feel insulted, which only serves to discount what Native American voices are saying. This argument ignores the vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and social positions of the groups; and the effects of systemic racism that continues to impact Native Americans but no longer white minorities such as the Irish. Also ignored are the cumulative effects of hundreds of Native mascots compared to the rare use of a white ethnic mascot. \c\cThe U.S. Commission on Civil Rights call for an end to the use of Native American mascots was only for non-native schools. In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation or stereotyping. Examples include the Fighting Indians of the Haskell Indian Nations University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP), which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and close ties to the Lumbee tribe. The UNCP nickname is the Braves, but the mascot is a red-tailed hawk. Pembroke Middle School, which also has close ties to the Lumbee tribe, is nicknamed the Warriors. \c\cMany supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames generate millions of dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless. The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools. Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the American Indian Movement stated: "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating."\c\cA study done by the Emory University Goizueta Business School indicates that the growing unpopularity of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, losing money compared to more popular animal mascots. Writing for Forbes in response to the statewide mascot ban passed by Maine in 2019, marketing analyst Henry DeVries compares Native mascots to the retired "Frito Bandito" mascot, and argues that "offensive marketing mascots" are a bad idea financially and "on the wrong side of history". \c\cA survey conducted in 2002 by The Harris Poll for Sports Illustrated (SI) found that 81% of Native Americans who live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53% of Indians on reservations did not find the images discriminatory. The authors of the article concluded that "Although most Native American activists and tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree". According to the article, "There is a near total disconnect between Indian activists and the Native American population on this issue." An Indian activist commented on the results saying "that Native Americans\' self-esteem has fallen so low that they don\'t even know when they\'re being insulted". Soon after the SI article, a group of five social scientists experienced in researching the mascot issue published a journal article arguing against the validity of this survey and its conclusions. First they state that "The confidence with which the magazine asserts that a \'disconnect\' between Native American activists and Native Americans exists on this issue belies the serious errors in logic and accuracy made in the simplistic labeling of Native Americans who oppose mascots as \'activists.\'"\c\cA flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely upon self-identification to select the target population. In an editorial in the Bloomington Herald Times, Steve Russell (an enrolled Cherokee citizen and associate professor of criminal justice at Indiana University), states that both SI and Annenberg's samples of "self-identified Native Americans ... includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with Indians". Individuals claiming to be Native American when they are not is well known in academic research, and people claiming Indian identity specifically to gain authority in the debate over sports mascots has been criticised. \c\cAt the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at California State University, San Bernardino a survey has conducted of 400 individuals whose identity as Native American was verified, finding that 67% agreed with the statement that "Redskins" is offensive and racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive. In a 2020 study at UC Berkeley 49% of self-identified Native Americans responded that the Washington Redskins name was offensive or very offensive, while only 38% were not bothered by it. However, for study participants who were heavily engaged in their native or tribal cultures, 67% said they were offended, for young people 60%, and those with tribal affiliations 52%. \c\cWhile protests began in the 1970s, national attention to the issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought the behaviour of some fans to the attention of Native Americans. The appearance of the Atlanta Braves in the 1991 World Series and the Washington Redskins at the 1992 Super Bowl prompted the largest response because the games were played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which has a large Native American population. \c\cThe documents most often cited to justify the elimination of Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination. However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated. \c\cIndividual school districts have responded to complaints by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 when one of the teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles. Little League International has updated its 2019 rulebook to include a statement prohibiting "the use of team names, mascots, nicknames or logos that are racially insensitive, derogatory or discriminatory in nature." This decision has been applauded by the National Congress of American Indians. In February, 2019 US Lacrosse issued a position statement which said in part "As the sport's national governing body, US Lacrosse believes that the misuse of Native American nicknames, logos, and mascots reflect and promote misleading stereotypes that are degrading and harmful to Native Americans. We will make every effort to assure that offensive or stereotypical mascots and logos will not be visible or promoted at events that US Lacrosse controls."\c\cThe National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) says there are still 1,916 schools in 1,025 school districts that use such mascots. The most common names are "Indians" (799), "Warriors" (417), "Braves" (208), "Chiefs" (181), and "Redskins" (95). \c\cLaws or school board decisions regarding team names and mascots have passed mainly in states with significant Native American populations; including California (2015), Colorado (2021), Michigan (2012), Nevada (2021), Oregon (2012), and Washington (2021). These laws allow for exemption for schools gaining approval agreements with local tribes. To date, Maine is the only state to completely ban Native American-themed mascots. However, opposing the trend for change, in response to the Tennessee Commission of Indian Affairs seeking a ban though the Tennessee Human Rights Commission, the Tennessee Senate passed a law allowing only elected officials to take any action banning school teams using American Indian names and symbols. The Wisconsin law passed in 2010 meant to eliminate "race-based nicknames, logos and mascots" was revised in 2013 making change much more difficult. In the original law, a single individual could file a complaint with the burden of proof on the school to defend their mascot, in the new law a petition signed by 10% of the school district residents is needed, and the petitioners need to prove discrimination. \c\cSecondary schools in both the United States and Canada have displayed a range of actions, with some voluntarily changing names or images, while others have kept current mascots. A 2013 analysis of a database indicated that more than 2,000 high schools have mascots that referred to Native American culture. Following a period of extended population growth in both countries over 50 years, this compares to around 3,000 schools with such names at the beginning of that period. \c\cThe Department of Educational Foundations at the University of Saskatchewan passed a resolution in 2013 calling for the retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict First Nations people. \c\cIn addition to changing their sports mascots, school boards in Ontario in 2016 were considering a ban on students wearing any articles bearing offensive names or logos, whether related to professional or local teams. \c\cSince the early 21st century, the Nepean Redskins Football Club, a minor league youth team operating for 35 years in Ottawa, Ontario, had been asked to change its name. In 2013 Ian Campeau (Ojibway), a musician and activist in Ottawa, filed a human rights complaint against the team on behalf of his five-year-old daughter. Campeau said, "How are they going to differentiate the playing field from the school yard? What's going to stop them from calling my daughter a redskin in the school yard? That's as offensive as using the n-word." Assembly of First Nations National Chief Shawn Atleo said he supported this suit because the word "Redskin" is "offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate. The team changed its name to the "Nepean Eagles" for the 2014 season; it was chosen from 70 suggestions submitted. Niigaan Sinclair (Anishinaabe), a writer and assistant professor at the University of Manitoba, applauded the team's action. He contrasted it with the insistence at the time of Daniel Snyder, owner of the professional Washington Redskins team in the US, in keeping that name. (Note: The Washington team did change its name in 2020.)\c\cIn 2017, the Swift Current Indians baseball club changed its name to the Swift Current 57's. \c\cThe city school board in Rutland Vermont voted in 2020 to drop Rutland High School's "Raiders" name and arrowhead logo. "Ravens" was selected at the new mascot in 2021. In January, 2022 the board voted 6-5 to reinstate the Raiders name after a long debate. \c\cIn January 2020 the school board of Killingly High School in Connecticut, had a Republican majority. It voted to reinstate the team's "Redmen" mascot. The vote reflects a generational split, as the new school board members represent mainly older alumni in the town. Current students of the public high school, its faculty and Native Americans supported dropping the Redmen mascot. A senior active in the debate said, "We look racist ... this is not what I want our school to be known for." The mascot had been removed after the Nipmuc Tribal Council objected to it, saying that no Native mascots were flattering to Native Americans. In October 2019, "Red Hawks" had been chosen as the new mascot, but after a contentious meeting in December, the School Board decided the school would have no mascot. Renewed discussion of whether the mascot is offensive had begun in June 2019, prompted by a student initiative. The name change was used as a wedge issue in the 2019 municipal elections; there was a record turnout and several Republican victories. \c\cThis issue was dealt with differently in Maine, where there was also support for changing such offensive names. In Skowhegan, Maine, where the area high school sports team was named the "Indians", the Penobscot Nation and the ACLU of Maine urged that it be changed. In March 2019 the local School Board voted to eliminate the mascot at Skowhegan Area High School. This was the last school in the state to retire this name. Similarly, at several other schools with sports teams named "Warriors", Native American imagery was removed. By early March 2019, in independent actions through the state, Maine was the first state to eliminate Indigenous mascots in all secondary schools. In keeping with this movement, a bill to ban Native American mascots in all public schools passed the Maine House of Representatives and Senate, and was signed into law by Governor Janet Mills in May 2019. This was another first for the state. \c\cDue to media coverage of the controversy over the prominent Washington Redskins, high schools with the sports teams named Redskins have received particular attention across the country. Three have a majority of Native American students. Advocates for the name suggest that, because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves, it is not insulting. But, the principal of Red Mesa High School, a Native American-majority school in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created."\c\cSome high schools have established consulting relationships with tribes in order to retain Native names and to improve their portrayal of Native tribes and cultures. For instance, Arapahoe High School, located in Centennial, Colorado, negotiated with the Arapaho Tribe of Wyoming and now uses a logo provided by them. The school agreed to the tribe's request not to have the logo image placed on the gym floor, or on any article of clothing. The logo is not used on team uniforms, but sometimes has been used in other ways at the school. The agreement includes tribal participation in school events. Strasburg High School in Strasburg, Colorado, whose sports team mascot was known as the "Indians", worked out a similar agreement with the Northern Arapahoe Tribe. \c\cThe city of Salamanca, New York, lies within the boundaries of the Allegany Indian Reservation of the Seneca Nation of Indians. They are descendants of the westernmost of the historic Six Nations of the powerful Iroquois League, also known as Haudenosaunee, which dominated much of the territory of New York south of the Great Lakes and west of the Hudson River. Some 26% of the Salamanca Central High School students are Native American (primarily Seneca), and its sports teams were called the "Warriors". \c\cIn 2001, the commissioner of the New York State Education Department sent a letter to all New York school boards calling for the elimination of Native American mascots, in response to it have been an issue of controversy, as noted. The Seneca Nation Tribal Council responded with support for the Warrior imagery in the Salamanca school. Other members of the community also wanted to retain it. Since the late 20th century, keeping the Warrior sports identity has resulted in negotiations in Salamanca between the Seneca and non-Seneca populations and actions that have raised general awareness of true Seneca culture. For example, the school logo was changed to accurately depict a Seneca man; this replaced a stereotypical Plains Indian warrior image that had been used prior to 1978. \c\cSome college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots. Stanford University had "The Stanford Indian" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972. Today Stanford's athletic team identity is built around the "Stanford Cardinal", reflecting the primary school color that has been used from the earliest days, while the unofficial mascot shown on its primary logo is the Stanford Tree. Another early change was the "Saltine Warrior" that represented Syracuse University from 1931 until 1978. After a brief attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became Otto the Orange for the school color. Miami University began discussion regarding the propriety of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname to RedHawks in 1996. \c\cAlthough Dartmouth College had not used an Indian mascot for many years, Yale University printed a program for the 2016 game commemorating its 100th game against Dartmouth showing historical program covers featuring depictions of Native Americans that are now viewed as racist. \c\cThe Florida State Seminoles of Florida State University use names and images associated with the Seminole people.  The use is officially sanctioned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida even though the NCAA "continues to believe the stereotyping of Native Americans is wrong."\c\cThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to 31 colleges in 2005, for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice. Nineteen teams were cited as having potentially "hostile or abusive" names, mascots, or images, that would be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited from hosting tournaments. Subsequently, all of the colleges previously using Native American imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained official support from individual tribes based upon the principle of tribal sovereignty. \c\cSan Diego State University (SDSU) was not cited by the NCAA in 2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe with any living descendants. However, in February 2017 the SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) supported removal of the mascot, calling its continued use "institutional racism" in its official statement to the Committee on Diversity, Equity and Outreach. A task force of students, faculty, and alumni was appointed to study the issue and make a recommendation by April, 2018. The recommendation was to keep the mascot but take steps to use only respectful references to Aztec culture, however there are few signs of this being implemented. \c\cThe Atlanta Braves remain the home of the tomahawk chop (although it began at Florida State University). The logo has changed through the years from an Indian in full headdress to an Indian with a Mohawk hairstyle and single feather (described as either laughing or shouting), then to the Braves name in script over a tomahawk. The mascot Chief Noc-A-Homa was replaced in 1986 by a baseball-headed "Homer the Brave", and in 2018 by "Blooper". \c\cThe tomahawk chop and the accompanying chant are controversial. In February 2019 after the removal of the Cleveland Indians\' Chief Wahoo logo, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said, "The Braves have taken steps to take out the tomahawk chop". In October, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley, a member of the Cherokee Nation, said that the tomahawk chop and chant misrepresents Native Americans. In response to this complaint, the Atlanta Braves, in their October 9 game against the Cardinals, did not provide fans with foam tomahawks, although the music accompanying the chant was played while fans performed the arm gesture. When the Braves lost to the Cardinals 13–1, the San Francisco Bay Area Fox affiliate used the headline "Braves Scalped", drawing criticism as an example of why most Native Americans oppose the use of American Indian imagery and mascots in sports. The station soon apologized. The team front office said in 2019 that there would be talks with Native Americans during the off-season regarding the tomahawk chop tradition, while leaders of two tribes that once inhabited Georgia, the Cherokee and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation agree that the tradition is inappropriate. \c\cIn July 2020, Richard Sneed, the Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI), released a statement about the tribe's conversations with the Braves. The statement said "that candid, thoughtful conversations are crucial to educating leaders and bringing about positive change." The EBCI statement also applauded "the Braves\' willingness to engage in this effort and look forward to continuing to build the relationship the EBCI shares with them to present a model for how other professional sports teams can work with Native Nations in a respectful and constructive manner." Sneed also said he is not offended by the name Braves or the tomahawk chop cheer, but respects the opinion of those who feel differently. However, Sneed criticized the use of the word Redskins among sports teams. \c\cThe death of Hank Aaron in 2021 renewed suggestions that the team change its nickname to "Hammers" in his honor. \c\cThe continued performance of the tomahawk chop and war chant by Braves fans was made highly visible nationally by the team's appearance in the 2021 World Series. The Braves were defended by MLB Commissioner Manfred by referring to the support of the team by Richard Sneed. Other Native American leaders around the country continue to describe "the Chop" and its associated fan behavior as deeply insulting while avoiding direct criticism of Sneed. Psychologist Stephanie Fryberg, considered the leading authority on Native mascots and their effects, states that personal opinions have little to do with the social science evidence of detrimental effects to Native American youth and communities, and rejects the notion that mascots have any positive effects. \c\cNative American rights advocate Suzan Shown Harjo (Cheyenne and Hodulgee Muscogee) says the Chicago Blackhawks have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams using Native imagery because hockey is not a cultural force on the level of football. But she says national American Indian organizations have called for an end to all Indian-related mascots and that she found the hockey team's name and Indian head symbol to be offensive. "It lacks dignity," she said. "There's dignity in a school being named after a person or a people. There's dignity in a health clinic or hospital. There's nothing dignified in something being so named (that is used for) recreation or entertainment or fun." The National Congress of American Indians also opposes the Blackhawks\' logo, as it does all Native American mascots. Members of Black Hawk's family have spoken out opposing the use of Black Hawk as a mascot and caricature logo. \c\cIn 2019, the American Indian Center of Chicago ended all ties to the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation, stating they will no longer affiliate "with organizations that perpetuate stereotypes through the use of \'Indian\' mascots." The AIC said that they "previously held a relationship with the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation with the intention of educating the general public about American Indians and the use of logos and mascots. The AIC, along with members of the community have since decided to end this relationship" and stated that "going forward, AIC will have no professional ties with the Blackhawks, or any other organization that perpetuates harmful stereotypes."\c\cWhile stating they will retain their name after the decision by the Washington Football Team to change theirs, the Blackhawks did agree to ban Native American headdresses at home games in recognition of their status as sacred symbols. Before the ban was enacted, there had in fact been incidents where some Blackhawk fans wore headdresses. After the Cleveland Indians announced in December 2020 that the team would change their name after the 2021 season, new CEO Danny Wirtz reiterated that the Blackhawks would not change. \c\cThe Chi-Nations Youth Council (CNYC), an Indigenous youth organization in Chicago, said in 2020, "The Chicago Blackhawks name and logo symbolizes a legacy of imperialism and genocide." "As statutes  [sic] of invaders, slave holders, and white supremacists fall across the nation so too should the images and language of the savage and dead \'Indians\'." CNYC also said "As social consciousness has grown over the past decades so has the Blackhawks performative gestures of buying their reprieve from those willing to sell out the health and humanity of our future generations."\c\cIn 1963 the Kansas City Chiefs adopted their name when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated. "Chiefs" was not a direct reference to Native Americans, but to the nickname of Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle, who was instrumental in bringing the Texans to Kansas City, Missouri. Bartle earned his nickname as founder of a Boy Scouts honor camping society, Tribe of Mic-O-Say, in which he was "Chief" Lone Bear. Bartle had been known by the nickname as a prominent Kansas City businessman, so it soon became the unavoidable name for the team. In spite of attempts to downplay Native American associations, fan behavior such as the tomahawk chop and wearing face paint and headdresses drew criticism. \c\cIn 1989 the Chiefs switched from Warpaint, a Pinto horse ridden by a man in a feathered headdress, to their current mascot K. C. Wolf. Warpaint returned in 2009, but was ridden by a cheerleader. In July 2021 Warpaint was again retired, the team president stating that it is the right thing to do at this time. \c\cThe Chiefs drew little attention compared to other teams until 2013, when photographs of fans in "Indian" dress appeared in the Kansas City Star. In 2014 the Star reported that the team's management planned discussions with some Native American groups to find a non-confrontational way to eliminate, or at least reduce, offensive behavior. Achieving greater visibility by reaching the playoffs in 2016, Native Americans at Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas, asked the Chiefs to stop behavior that invokes stereotypes, such as wearing headdresses and doing the "tomahawk chop". In a statistical analysis of social media comments (tweets) leading up to Super Bowl LIV, researchers found many more negative terms associated with the Kansas City team compared to San Francisco. While both teams were referred to in terms related to violence, the Chiefs were much more likely to receive insults related to intelligence (being called stupid) and many insults were specific references to negative Native American stereotypes, such as drunkenness ("firewater"), and being inbred or extinct. The conclusion drawn was support for Natives being insulted, rather than honored, by Native American mascots. \c\cOn August 20, 2020, the Chiefs announced that headdresses and Native American–style face paint would be banned at Arrowhead Stadium. The ban went into effect during the 2020 season opener on September 10, 2020. The Tomahawk chop also underwent a subtle modification, as Arrowhead-based cheerleaders are now required to lead the chop with a closed fist rather than the traditional open palm. While fans said they will not change their behavior, a Native activist said that the chop should be eliminated entirely. The appearance of the chop in Super Bowl LV focused attention on the Chiefs in 2021 to follow the example set by Washington, Cleveland, and many high schools. A group of two dozen Native Americans from Florida, Kansas City and elsewhere protested in front of the stadium on game day. Protests by Native Americans at Arrowhead Stadium on game day have increased. \c\cSeveral teams changed when they moved to other cities, while others went out of business. The Atlanta Hawks were originally the Tri-Cities Blackhawks (using an "Indian" logo), and the Los Angeles Clippers were originally the Buffalo Braves. \c\cThe United States national rugby league team was known as the Tomahawks until 2015, when USA Rugby League replaced the American National Rugby League as the sport's governing body in the U.S. and chose the simpler Hawks as the new name for the team. \c\cOn March 21, 2018, the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, enacted a ban on Chief Wahoo being featured on future Hall of Fame plaques. This ban immediately went into effect with new Hall of Fame inductee Jim Thome, who was inducted as an Indian without Chief Wahoo's image. Starting in the 2019 season, the Chief Wahoo logo did not appear on uniforms nor on stadium signs, although it was still licensed for team merchandise within the Cleveland area. However, merchandise with Chief Wahoo's image was removed from the team's website. Local groups said they would continue to advocate for a change of the team name, and objected to the continued sale outside the stadium of merchandise with the Wahoo image. \c\cChief Wahoo is part of an exhibit at the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia maintained by Ferris State University in Michigan. For David Pilgrim, a sociology professor at Ferris State and an expert in racial imagery, the symbol was a "red Sambo" that hardly differs from the caricatures of blacks popular in the Jim Crow era in which Wahoo was created, when such depictions of minority races were popularly used to inflame prejudice and justify discriminatory laws and behavior. Pilgrim explained how the exaggerated features serve their discriminatory purpose by emphasizing the differences of the depicted race, thereby reinforcing the idea that the caricatured race is inferior. \c\cThe Cleveland Indians acknowledged on July 3, 2020, that they were ready to discuss changing their team name in the wake of news that the Washington Redskins would be reviewing theirs. \c\cOn December 14, 2020, the team owner Paul Dolan announced that the process of changing the name would begin and that the team would continue to play as the Indians for the 2021 season while a new name was selected and other decisions necessary for rebranding were implemented. Starting with the 2021 season, face paint and headdresses were banned from Progressive Field. \c\cOn July 23, 2021, the ball club announced the name will change to the Cleveland Guardians at the end of the 2021 season. The new name was selected with reference to the Guardians of Traffic statues that adorn the Hope Memorial Bridge. The name change was made official on November 19, 2021. \c\cIn part because they did not use any native imagery, the Edmonton Eskimos were rarely mentioned with regard to the controversy. However Natan Obed, the President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Canada's national Inuit organization, said in 2015 that "Eskimo is not only outdated, it is now largely considered a derogatory term" and is a "relic of colonial power". The editorial board of the Toronto Star in 2017 saw a name change as the inevitable result of social evolution, and reflecting respect for Indigenous peoples. After a year of considering alternatives, the team decided in February 2020 to retain the name, finding no consensus among Indigenous groups including the Inuit. \c\cHowever, on July 16, 2020, it was reported that the club would drop the \'Eskimos\' name. On July 21, the team officially retired the name, and began using "Edmonton Football Team" and "EE Football Team" until a new name was decided.  On June 1, 2021, the team was renamed to the Edmonton Elks. \c\cThe Golden State Warriors eliminated Native American imagery as the team relocated. Originally the Philadelphia Warriors (1946–1962), their logo was a cartoon Native American dribbling a basketball. When they moved to San Francisco, the logo became a Native American headdress (1962–1968). The final elimination of Native imagery occurred with the move to Oakland and the change to the current name (1971). \c\cWhile playing as the Washington Redskins, the Washington Football Team received the most public attention due to the prominence of the team being located in the nation's capital, and the name itself being defined in current dictionaries of American English as "usually offensive", "disparaging", "insulting", and "taboo". Native American opposition to the name began in the early 1970s with letters to the owner of the team and the editors of The Washington Post. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, and again when the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills was held in Minnesota. Those officially censuring and/or demanding the name be changed include more than 80 organizations that represent various groups of Native Americans. \c\cIn July 2020, amidst the removal of many names and images as part of the George Floyd protests, a group of investors worth $620 billion wrote letters to major sponsors Nike, FedEx and PepsiCo encouraging pressure on the Redskins to change their name. FedEx called on the team to change its name on July 2, 2020. The same day, Nike removed Redskins apparel from its website. On July 3, the league and the franchise announced that it was "undergoing a thorough review of the team name." On July 7, it was acknowledged that the Redskins were not in contact with a group of Native Americans who petitioned the NFL to force a name change and that Redskins head coach Ron Rivera also stated the team wanted to continue "honoring and supporting Native Americans and our Military." On July 13, 2020, the team made an official statement that their review would result in the retirement of the Redskins name and logo. On July 23, 2020 the team announced that they will be called the Washington Football Team with a block "W" logo for the 2020 season. The new name, Washington Commanders, was selected on February 2, 2022. Amanda Blackhorse responded that the change is an empty gesture, the team's owner having made no substantial effort to repair the effects the decades of insults, nor advocated that other teams with offensive mascots also change. \c\cIn addition to the behavior of the teams that have Native American names or mascots, their rivals often invoke racist stereotypes. In December 2013 when the Washington Redskins played the Kansas City Chiefs an employee of a Sonic Drive-In in Missouri placed a message outside that used scalping, reservations and whiskey to disparage the "Redskins". It was quickly removed with the owner's apologies. A rubber severed "Indian" head impaled on a knife has been used by a sports fan in Philadelphia to taunt rival teams with Native American mascots. There have been a number of incidents of rival high school teams displaying banners or signs referencing the Trail of Tears, which have been criticized for both insensitivity and ignorance of history. Although the Central Michigan Chippewas have the support of the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation of Michigan, a student at rival Western Michigan University designed a T-shirt showing a Native American behind bars with the legend "Caught a Chippewa about a week ago". It was quickly condemned by both university presidents, who agreed that anyone wearing the shirt at a game would be ejected. In spite of the University of North Dakota changing their nickname from the Fighting Sioux to the Fighting Hawks, students at rival North Dakota State University (NDSU) continue to chant "Sioux suck shit" whenever their football team makes a first down. The NDSU president, along with the presidents of the student body and faculty senates, have called for an end to the practice, which they describe as hateful, and coming from a misplaced sense of tradition. Some NDSU fans also wear T-shirts with graphics depicting variations on the "Sioux suck" theme. \c\cTo further complicate this controversy, many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending upon the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the Cleveland Indians\' Chief Wahoo; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as Redskins or Squaws; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures, such as the tomahawk chop. \c\cThe practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response to the controversy. A local example is Washington High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Many Native American images have been removed, and the "Warriors" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a "circle of courage" logo with eagle feathers and has also "updated" the murals of Chief Hollow Horn Bear in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at Sinte Gleska University in Mission, stated: "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images. \c\cNative American names and images are used by teams in other countries, generally those playing American-style sports and copying the imagery of American teams. Several are in countries that also have a tradition of Native American hobbyists often associated with the popularity of the stories written by German author Karl May. In South America there are a number of teams that reference the Guaraní people. In Brazil, these teams may be referred to using the derogatory term bugre.
Whaling in Iceland began with spear-drift hunting as early as the 12th century, and continued in a vestigial form until the late 19th century, when other countries introduced modern commercial practices. Today, Iceland is one of a handful of countries that formally object[clarification needed] to an ongoing moratorium established by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, and that still maintain a whaling fleet. One company remains concentrated on hunting fin whales, largely for export to Japan, while the only other one previously hunted minke whales for domestic consumption until 2020, as the meat was popular with tourists.  In 2018, Icelandic whalers were accused of slaughtering a blue whale. Whaling has been temporarily paused in Iceland since 2019 as coronavirus restrictions, competition from subsidized Japanese whaling, and increasing domestic whale watching tourism have hampered the industry. It is uncertain if commercial whaling will resume in 2022. In 2022, Iceland announced that they would halt commercial whaling by 2024. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/4/iceland-to-end-whaling-as-demand-dwindles\c\cIceland has a whale watching sector, which exists in tension with the whaling industry. 
The series of occasional armed skirmishes and firefights have occurred along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border between the Afghan National Security Forces and the Pakistan Armed Forces since 1949. The latest round of hostilities between the two countries began in April 2007. Militants belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar also use Afghanistan's territory to target Pakistani security personnel deployed along the border. The Diplomat say that the presence of terrorists belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban (Pakistan) on Afghan soil is the reason for sporadic shelling of Afghanistan's territory by Pakistani security forces. \c\cHostilities existed between Afghanistan and the newly independent Pakistan since 1947, when Afghanistan became the only country to vote against the admission of Pakistan to the United Nations. Afghanistan advocated the independence of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to form Pashtunistan, although the region's predominant Pashtun population had voted overwhelmingly in favor of Pakistan over India in the referendum held in July 1947. 99.02% votes were cast in favor of Pakistan. Afghan nationalists pressed for an independent state to be called Pashtunistan but the idea became unpopular. The Balochistan province of Pakistan was also included in the Greater Pastunistan definition to gain access to the Arabian sea in case Pakistan failed as a state, as Afghanistan had expected. \c\cThe International border between the British Raj and Afghanistan was established after the 1893 Durand Line Agreement between British Mortimer Durand of the British Empire and Amir Abdur Rahman Khan of Afghanistan for fixing the limit of their respective spheres of influence. The single-page agreement, which contains seven short articles, was signed by Durand and Khan, agreeing not to exercise political interference beyond the frontier line between what was then the Emirate of Afghanistan and what was also then the British Indian Empire. The Durand Line was reaffirmed as the International Border between Afghanistan and British Raj in the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War after the Afghan tactical defeat. The Afghans undertook to stop interference on the British side of the line in the subsequent Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 in Rawalpindi. \c\cPakistan inherited the Durand Line agreement after its independence in 1947, but the Afghan Government has always refused to accept the Durand Line Agreement. Afghanistan has several times tried to seize Pakistan's western provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The then Afghan Prime Minister, Muhammad Hashim, said "if an independent Pashtunistan cannot be set up, the frontier province should join Afghanistan. Our neighbor Pakistan will realize that our country, with its population and trade, needs an outlet to the sea, which is very essential", in an interview with the Statesman. In 1949, Pakistan Air Force bombed the Afghan sponsored militant camps in border areas including an Afghan village to curb an unrest led by Ipi Faqir propagating independent Pashtunistan. Border clashes were reported in 1949–50 for the first time. On 30 September 1950, Pakistan claimed that Afghan troops and tribesmen had crossed into Pakistan's Balochistan, but the low-scale invasion was repelled after six days of fighting. The Afghan government denied its involvement and claimed that they were pro-Pashtunistan Pashtun tribesmen. \c\cTensions soared with the Pakistani One Unit program, and both countries withdrew ambassadors and diplomatic staff in 1955. The Pakistani Embassy in Kabul and consulates in Kandhar and Jalalabad were attacked by mobs. In 1960, major skirmishes broke with the Afghan Forces massing out on the Afghan side of the border with tanks. These skirmishes saw the Pakistan Air Force bombarding Afghan forces. This bombardment led to a brief hiatus in the skirmishes. On 6 September 1961, Kabul formally severed diplomatic relations with Pakistan. In 1950 the House of Commons of the United Kingdom held its view on the Afghan-Pakistan dispute over the Durand Line by stating:\c\cAt the 1956 SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) Ministerial Council Meeting held at Karachi, capital of Pakistan at the time, it was stated:\c\cThe Afghan government, having secured a treaty in December 1978 that allowed them to call on Soviet forces, repeatedly requested the introduction of troops in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 1979. The 1979 Soviet–Afghan War forced millions of Afghans to take refuge inside Pakistan. Pakistani officials feared that the Soviet Union began some kind of military show down and that Pakistan or at least its Balochistan province was next on the Soviet agenda. During the early 1980s, multi-national mujahideen forces (consisting of about 100,000 fighters from forty different Muslim countries in addition to 150,000 local fighters) found support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Iran in the context of the Cold War. They were trained by Pakistani military in its frontier region around the Durand Line. The Soviet Union decided to withdraw in 1989 and when aid dried up on Afghanistan in 1992, a civil war began. This was followed by the rise and fall of the Taliban government. Since late 2001, as high as 140,000 NATO-led troops were stationed in Afghanistan to train Afghans and rebuild their war-torn country. In the meantime, the Taliban insurgency began around 2004. To counter the insurgency and bring stability in Afghanistan, the United States built bases and garrisons for the Afghan National Security Forces, and is using unmanned aerial vehicles to carry out drone attacks in Pakistan, mainly the Haqqani network in and around the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). \c\cIn September 2017, Brad Sherman, a US lawmaker, suggested conditioning US aid to Afghanistan to the recognition of Durand Line. He added:\c\cThe following is an incomplete list of recent events relating to the Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes. Most of these events cannot be independently verified because news journalists usually have very limited access to reaching the areas where the fighting take place. \c\c13 May 2007 – An armed clash broke out between Pakistan Army and Afghan National Army. According to Afghan sources, clashes erupted when Pakistan Army established a border military post inside Afghan territory in Zazai district. While according to Pakistani officials, clashes erupted when Afghan soldiers opened firing on five to six border posts in Kurram tribal region in North-West Pakistan. Governor of Paktika province, Rahmatullah Rahmat, said that as many as 41 Afghans were either killed or injured in the clash. Other Afghans sources state that 13 Afghans (9 Afghan soldiers and 4 civilians) were killed. 3 soldiers of Pakistan Army were also injured in the clash. \c\c3 February 2011 – One Pakistani and 7 Afghan soldiers were killed and three others injured after a clash broke out along the border between Pakistani and Afghan forces including an Afghan Colonel. 3 Afghan Soldiers were also arrested by Pakistani Forces which were later returned.

However, a Pakistani military official in Peshawar said that the Afghan troops fired on an Pakistan army check post in Ghulam Khan, North Waziristan and that the fire emanated from Afghan territory first. "We are responding with artillery and mortars," he added. \c\cJune 2011 – Afghanistan blamed Pakistan for killing dozens of Afghan civilians in cross-border shelling conducted for several months.

In Kabul, around 200 people gathered to protest and condemn cross-border shelling and bombardment of eastern Afghanistan's provinces. However, Pakistan rejected Afghan government accusations, saying a "few accidental rounds may have been fired when it chased unknown militants who had crossed from Afghanistan and attacked its security installments". Moreover, Afghan Border Police officials also acknowledged the presence of terrorist belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban (Pakistan) in areas where shelling took place. Afghan border police officials stated that after NATO forces had withdrawn from Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, terrorist belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban (Pakistan) moved in behind fleeing Afghan civilians. \c\c19 July 2011 – Pakistani officials stated that over 20 mortar shells were fired from Afghanistan which killed 4 Pakistani soldiers and wounded another 2.

The protestors said they would stand against insurgents if their region was attacked in the future and blamed the Afghan government, insisting that Afghan authorities and NATO forces were failing to contain Afghanistan-based militants. The protestors also urged the need to increase the presence of border forces and called on the federal government to take up the issue with the Afghan government to avoid future incidents. \c\c25 September 2011 – Afghan authorities claimed that more than 340 rockets had been fired over the course of four days from Pakistani territory. The rockets damaged a few buildings, resulted in the death of a child and also forced hundreds to flee their homes.

The Jihadist insurgency in Burkina Faso (French: Insurrection djihadiste au Burkina Faso) is an ongoing war and civil conflict between the Government of Burkina Faso and Islamist rebels. \c\cThe war have been interpreted as being the Burkinabè theatre of the insurgency in the Maghreb.   \c\cBlaise Compaoré, president of Burkina Faso from 1987 to 2014, treated Islamists somewhat better than French colonial officials did. Compaore's Mauritanian advisor, Moustapha Ould Limam Chafi and General Gilbert Diendéré both contacted several Islamist leaders in order to free hostages held by these groups. \c\cBurkina Faso acted as a mediator during the Mali War between rebels and the government. Burkina Faso led an intervention into the country in 2013. However, in November 2014, Compaoré was overthrown, marking the end of his rule and creating a scenario of instability. \c\cOn 23 August 2015, the insurgency in the Maghreb spread to Burkina Faso, beginning with a attack on a gendarmerie by alleged Boko Haram members. Between August 2015 and October 2016, seven different posts were attacked across the country, slaying 15 and injuring 11. On 9 October, three gendarmes, one rebel, and one civilian were slain during a battle in Samorougan, Hauts-Bassins. On 31 May 2016, three police officers were shot dead in Intangom. On 1 September 2016, a team of two to four jihadists murdered a customs officer and a civilian in Markoye, injuring three others. Two days later, Sahrawi terrorist Adnane Abou Walid Al-Sahraoui accepted responsibility for the attack. \c\cOn 15 January 2016, terrorists attacked the capital city of Ouagadougou, killing 30 people.  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al-Mourabitoune both took responsibility. \c\cIn 2016, the amount of attacks spiked after a new group was founded : Ansarul Islam, led by imam Ibrahim Malam Dicko. The group is particularly active at the border territories of Mali and Burkina Faso. A large proportion of attacks have been focused on Soum province. On 16 December, Ansarul Islam killed dozens of people in the attack on Nassoumbou. On the first of January 2017,  an Imam and defect from Asarul Islam was assassinated in Tongomayel. Two months later, a teacher was murdered in the village of Kourfayel, Soum province. On 22 March, the leader of Ansarul Islam, Harouna Dicko, was shot dead in Pétéga by security forces. By this point, a total of 70 people, the majority of them soldiers, gendarmes and police officers, had been killed in a series of 20 attacks. \c\cBetween 27 March – 10 April 2017, the governments of Mali, France, and Burkina Faso launched a joint operation name "Operation Panga," composed of 1,300 soldiers from the three countries, in Fhero forest, near the Burkina Faso-Mali border, considered a sanctuary for Ansarul Islam. On 5 April, Jama\'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin detonated an improvised explosive device on a French military vehicle, injuring two people. An allied detachment found them during a searching operation, but were attacked by the armed Islamist group again, slaying a soldier. During the ensuing twelve days of searching, two jihadists were killed, 8 taken prisoner, and up to 200 suspects arrested. The French forces quickly returned to the offensive, leading several successful raids against military targets. \c\cOn 27 May, in Pétéga, a retired policeman was assassinated by a group of armed men, but one of them was killed during the operation. On the night between 2 and 3 June, at least five people, including a couple and their child, were murdered in targeted attacks across Soum province. On 9 June, military forces rounded up 74 villagers in the town of Djibo accused of collaborating with Ansarul Islam. Several of the villagers were tortured, two fatally. On 12 July, a shootout between authorities and jihadists took place, with no casualties. \c\cThe head of Ansarul Islam, Ibrahim Malam Dicko was killed in June 2017. The group announced a new leader, Jafar Dicko. On the night of 24 to 25 July, five members of Ansarul Islam were assassinated in the villages of Ndidja, Sibé and Neyba, Soum province, possibly by the new leadership. \c\cOn 14 August 2017, a pair of armed men entered a restaurant in Ouagadougou, murdering 18 people before they were shot dead by Burkinabè authorities. \c\cOn 17 August, a Burkinabè army vehicle rolled over an explosive in Touronata, killing three people and injuring two more. This is the first such incident in the country's history. On 15 September, three men, including an imam and the local village chief, were slain by armed men in Soum province. On 23 September, seven soldiers were killed in a mine explosion. Three days later, two gendarmes were killed in an ambush by jihadists. On 9 November, the Burkina Faso Armed Forces successfully  neutralized 12 jihadists in the village of Ariel. \c\cOn 2 March 2018, Jama\'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin attacked the French embassy in Ouagadougou as well as the general staff of the Burkinabè army. Eight soldiers and eight attackers were killed, and a further 61 soldiers and 24 civilians were injured . \c\cIn 2018, the insurgency expanded to the east of the country. The jihadists launched three attacks on 13 June : in Tindangou, against a police checkpoint, and on the police station and gendarmerie brigade of Comin-Yanga. During the last attack security forces managed to shoot an assailant. On 12 August, six people were killed by rebels in a bomb attack in Boungou, near Fada N\'Gourma.

A few weeks later, rebels kidnapped three employees in a gold mine – an Indian, a South-African and a Burkinabé, slaying three gendarmes in the process.  On 4 October, six soldiers died after their military convoy ran over an explosive device. That night, an army of forty Islamists launched an attack against local gendarmes in Inata.

On 3 December, gendarmes successfully repelled an ambush at Bougui, ten kilometres from Fada N\'Gourma, killing six assailants and injuring another. \c\cOn 1 January 2019, armed men murdered six people in the village of Yirgou, Barsalogho department. The villagers, mostly ethnic Mossis, (who form 52% of Burkina Faso's population) responded by massacring the Fulani members of the town, in what is now known as the Yirgou massacre [fr].  72 people died and over 6,000 were displaced during the incident. \c\cOn 10 January, a group of 36 jihadists slew twelve civilians in Gasseliki. 17 days later, ten more civilians were killed in Sikiré, near Arbinda.

Four Burkinabés and a Spanish priest were killed at a customs post in Nohao, close to the border with Togo. \c\cAccording to Human Rights Watch, between mid-2018 to February 2019, at least 42 people were murdered by jihadists and a minimum of 116 mostly Fulani civilians were killed by military forces without trial. From 31 March to 2 April, ethnic clashes between Fulani, Kurumbas, and Mossis killed 62 people in Arbinda. \c\cIn 2019, Jihadist groups began to start a persecution campaign against Christians.

On 12 May, six more people, including one priest, died in a Catholic church in Dablo after it was raided by Islamists. The next day, a Catholic procession was targeted near Kayon and Singa-Rimaïbé, in Zimtanga department. Four people were murdered and a statue of the Virgin Mary was destroyed. \c\cOn the night of 9–10 May, French forces attacked a jihadist encampment near Gorom-Gorom, freeing four hostages — two French, one South-Korean and one American. Four jihadists and two French soldiers died. \c\cDespite this success, massacres have continued to grow more common. On 9 June 19 civilians died in an attack on Arbinda. On 18 June, armed men murdered 17–18 people in the village of Béléhédé. On 22 June 15 villagers in Sagho and Toekédogo, Barsalogho department, were killed, and on the night of 25–26 July, 22 other villagers died in a massacre in Dibilou, nearby the city of Kaya. \c\cAccording to the NGO, Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, armed violence in Burkina Faso jumped by 174 % in 2019, with nearly 1,300 civilians dead and 860,000 deplaced. \c\cOn 4 January 2020, a bus carrying mainly middle school students blew up after it ran over an explosive device between Toéni and Tougan, resulting in fourteen deaths. On 20 January, jihadists attacked the villages of Nagraogo and Alamou, inside Barsalogho, Sanmatenga, and massacred 36 civilians. The day later, the Parliament of Burkina Faso adopted a law permitting the recruitment of civilian militias called Koglweogo to fight the jihadists. The idea was initially proposed by president Roch Marc Christian Kaboré in November 2019. \c\cOn 25 January, the village of Silgadji was attacked again, this time with a death toll of 39 civilians. Three days after, six soldiers were killed between Madjoari and Pama, in Kompienga province. On 12 February, two civilians were killed by jihadists in Tanwalbougou. \c\cOn Sunday, 16 February, a Protestant church in Pansi was attacked by armed jihadists, who murdered 24 people (including the pastor) and wounding 20 more.

In a separate incident during that month, Islamists killed 41 people in an ambush, including the popular vigilante leader Ladji Yoro. Yoro was a central figure in the Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland, or VDP for short, a pro-government militia that has taken a leading role in the country's struggle against Islamists. \c\cOn 15 January, at least 10 civilians were killed in an attack blamed on jihadists in northern Burkina Faso, in the village of Namssiguian in Bam province. \c\cOn 23 January, military officials overthrew Kabore's ruling government. Government failures to quell the Islamist insurgency has been described as a possible motive for the coup, which received unusual popularity. The junta's leader, Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, is well-known for his widely popular military operations against Islamists. \c\cAllegations have arisen in the aftermath of the coup that the Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration may hire mercenaries from the Wagner Group in the future. Damiba had called earlier to hire Russian mercenaries against the Islamists, but was forbidden to do so by Kabore. \c\cOn 27 January, France confirmed that from 15 to 23 January 2022, more than sixty recorded jihadists had been "neutralized" in four separate incidents by Burkinabé soldiers working together with French units. \c\cTen member of Ansarul Islam died during a battle with French forces on February 10 near Ouahigouya. Four civilians died in the crossfire. French authorities expressed regret for the civilian casualties, which they assured was accidental. \c\cA humanitarian crisis has erupted in the aftermath of the conflict, with thousands of people killed by both sides. The UNHCR estimates that six in ten displaced people in the Sahel are from Burkina Faso. \c\cGovernment forces have summarily executed countless of civilians, disproportionately targeting ethnic Fulani. In October 2019, 14 men had their turbans ripped off by government forces, then forced into a truck and executed. Fulanis have also been subject to violence by pro-government civilians, such as during the 2019 Yirgou massacre, in which hundreds of civilians were murdered by ethnic Mossis. \c\cIn 2020, a mass grave of over 180 civilians was found near Djibo, killed by government forces. Summary executions and war crimes by the military have become an ordinary incident in the town. In one separate incident, 10 civilians were killed in a market place in Petagoli, three of them Dogon foreigners from Mali. \c\cJihadists have also been guilty of human rights abuses. Villagers have been terrorized during their everyday lives, often prohibited from holding baptisms or marriages; the assassination of local elders has become a common occurrence. From April 2019 to January 2020, Human Rights Watch recorded the killing of at least 256 civilians in a series of 20 different attacks. \c\cIslamists have also targeted schools, the most famous example happening on 12 November 2018, when six Islamists broke into a primary school, mugged the principal, and attacked several students. This was one of the few local cases in which the people responsible for such an attack were arrested. Rebels have justified attacks on schools by painting them as French and Western-style indoctrination programs. Numerous schools have been shut down, leading to an estimated 300,000 children without access to education.
The Houthi–Saudi Arabian conflict is an ongoing armed conflict between the Royal Saudi Armed Forces and Yemeni Houthi forces that has been taking place in the Arabian Peninsula, including the southern Saudi regions of Asir, Jizan, and Najran, and northern Yemeni governorates of Saada, Al Jawf, and Hajjah, since the onset of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in 2015. \c\cOver the course of the conflict the Houthis have carried out attacks on military bases and outposts in Saudi Arabia. \c\cIn their 2004 conflict against the government of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Houthis accused Saudi Arabia of pressuring Saleh to crack down on their community, and of funding him with US$25 billion. This accusation was denied by Saleh, and was not acknowledged by Saudi Arabia. The Houthis and pro-Houthi Yemen army units were deploying effective tactics. Usually, they would first deploy teams equipped with anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs)—like Russian made 9M113 Konkurs, 9M113 Kornet-Es and a few BGM-71 TOWs—to take out specific vehicles or bunkers. BM-21s and BM-27s would then target nearest military bases and lay landmines along routes connecting with the Saudi Arabia–Yemen border. Meanwhile, pro-Houthi special forces would start assaulting the border outposts, while motorcycle mounted teams armed with RPG-7s and US-made M47 Dragons would infiltrate into the Saudi rear. Columns of Saudi Arabian Army (RSLF) forces would thus drive into unknown minefields, or rush into ambushes at places not directly hit by the fighting. Some raiding parties deployed into Saudi Arabia were armed with man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS), as well as M167 Vulcan towed anti-aircraft cannons. Although exact details of the effectiveness of either remain evasive, during the first year of the war they damaged numerous attack helicopters of the RSLF and the Royal Saudi Navy Forces (RSNF), thus forcing their crews to keep their distance. \c\cAs a result of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, the city of Najran was shelled by the Houthis on 5 May. The Saudi authorities temporarily closed local educational institutions and the Najran Domestic Airport. \c\cAhrar al-Najran troops attacked a military base in Najran on 9 July, seizing a number of weapons and electronic equipment belonging to Saudi Arabia's security services, and destroying an armored vehicle and a mortar-launching vehicle, both belonging to the Saudi Army. Two Ahrar al-Najran fighters and 15 Saudi soldiers were killed in the clashes. \c\cOn 31 January 2016, according to Iran's Fars News Agency, Yemeni forces allied with the Houthis fired 70 missiles and mortar shells at the Al-Qawiya and Jbal al-Dokhan military bases in Jizan province, killing at least 10 Saudi troops. \c\cOn 20 June 2016, Ahrar al-Najran reportedly seized a lookout outpost near the border. Saudi interior sources later announced on 25 July 2016 that the clashes resulted in the deaths of 5 Saudi border guards. \c\cOn 11 August 2016, after a one-year border ceasefire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia expired, clashes resumed and the Houthis gained entrance into the west side of the city of Najran. \c\cOn 16 August 2016, Houthi shelling killed 7 civilians, including 4 Saudis and 3 foreigners, in an industrial zone in Najran. \c\cOn 18 August 2016, Houthi fighters advanced 15 km into Najran, according to a pro-Houthi source. \c\cOn 21 August 2016, a Saudi encampment in Najran was hit by a Houthi-fired Tochka ballistic missile, resulting in the deaths of at least 50 Saudi soldiers. \c\cOn 26 August 2016, a power station near the border was hit by a Houthi-fired rocket.

The sources also said that scores of Saudi soldiers were killed and injured and six Saudi armored vehicles and 2 combat tanks destroyed. Saudi army helicopters had bombarded the Al-Khubah area in response. However, the claim cannot be independently verified by Saudi authorities. Also earlier on that day, Saudi authorities said at least 14 people had been injured in Dharan al-Janoub governorate, in the southwest near the Yemeni border, by projectiles fired from Yemen. \c\cOn 15 November 2016, the Royal Saudi Air Defense Forces intercepted and destroyed the missile targeting Najran "without any damage", Saudi Press Agency reported. \c\cOn 19 November 2016, a Saudi soldier was killed by a missile fired by the Houthis across the border into Asir province, the Saudi interior ministry said.

However, the Saudi-owned Alarabiya satellite TV reported that the Saudi defense forces intercepted and destroyed the missile in the air before it reached the city. \c\cOn 1 December 2016, 3 Saudi soldiers were shot dead by the Yemeni Army and Houthis at the al-Dhabra military base in Jizan, while another was killed in attack on a base in the al-Rabu\'ah town of Asir. \c\cOn 8 December 2016, The Rocket Battalion of Yemeni Army shelled Al-Hajir military Base in Asir, causing damage to the military installation.

The Jihadist insurgency in Burkina Faso (French: Insurrection djihadiste au Burkina Faso) is an ongoing war and civil conflict between the Government of Burkina Faso and Islamist rebels. \c\cThe war have been interpreted as being the Burkinabè theatre of the insurgency in the Maghreb.   \c\cBlaise Compaoré, president of Burkina Faso from 1987 to 2014, treated Islamists somewhat better than French colonial officials did. Compaore's Mauritanian advisor, Moustapha Ould Limam Chafi and General Gilbert Diendéré both contacted several Islamist leaders in order to free hostages held by these groups. \c\cBurkina Faso acted as a mediator during the Mali War between rebels and the government. Burkina Faso led an intervention into the country in 2013. However, in November 2014, Compaoré was overthrown, marking the end of his rule and creating a scenario of instability. \c\cOn 23 August 2015, the insurgency in the Maghreb spread to Burkina Faso, beginning with a attack on a gendarmerie by alleged Boko Haram members. Between August 2015 and October 2016, seven different posts were attacked across the country, slaying 15 and injuring 11. On 9 October, three gendarmes, one rebel, and one civilian were slain during a battle in Samorougan, Hauts-Bassins. On 31 May 2016, three police officers were shot dead in Intangom. On 1 September 2016, a team of two to four jihadists murdered a customs officer and a civilian in Markoye, injuring three others. Two days later, Sahrawi terrorist Adnane Abou Walid Al-Sahraoui accepted responsibility for the attack. \c\cOn 15 January 2016, terrorists attacked the capital city of Ouagadougou, killing 30 people.  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al-Mourabitoune both took responsibility. \c\cIn 2016, the amount of attacks spiked after a new group was founded : Ansarul Islam, led by imam Ibrahim Malam Dicko. The group is particularly active at the border territories of Mali and Burkina Faso. A large proportion of attacks have been focused on Soum province. On 16 December, Ansarul Islam killed dozens of people in the attack on Nassoumbou. On the first of January 2017,  an Imam and defect from Asarul Islam was assassinated in Tongomayel. Two months later, a teacher was murdered in the village of Kourfayel, Soum province. On 22 March, the leader of Ansarul Islam, Harouna Dicko, was shot dead in Pétéga by security forces. By this point, a total of 70 people, the majority of them soldiers, gendarmes and police officers, had been killed in a series of 20 attacks. \c\cBetween 27 March – 10 April 2017, the governments of Mali, France, and Burkina Faso launched a joint operation name "Operation Panga," composed of 1,300 soldiers from the three countries, in Fhero forest, near the Burkina Faso-Mali border, considered a sanctuary for Ansarul Islam. On 5 April, Jama\'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin detonated an improvised explosive device on a French military vehicle, injuring two people. An allied detachment found them during a searching operation, but were attacked by the armed Islamist group again, slaying a soldier. During the ensuing twelve days of searching, two jihadists were killed, 8 taken prisoner, and up to 200 suspects arrested. The French forces quickly returned to the offensive, leading several successful raids against military targets. \c\cOn 27 May, in Pétéga, a retired policeman was assassinated by a group of armed men, but one of them was killed during the operation. On the night between 2 and 3 June, at least five people, including a couple and their child, were murdered in targeted attacks across Soum province. On 9 June, military forces rounded up 74 villagers in the town of Djibo accused of collaborating with Ansarul Islam. Several of the villagers were tortured, two fatally. On 12 July, a shootout between authorities and jihadists took place, with no casualties. \c\cThe head of Ansarul Islam, Ibrahim Malam Dicko was killed in June 2017. The group announced a new leader, Jafar Dicko. On the night of 24 to 25 July, five members of Ansarul Islam were assassinated in the villages of Ndidja, Sibé and Neyba, Soum province, possibly by the new leadership. \c\cOn 14 August 2017, a pair of armed men entered a restaurant in Ouagadougou, murdering 18 people before they were shot dead by Burkinabè authorities. \c\cOn 17 August, a Burkinabè army vehicle rolled over an explosive in Touronata, killing three people and injuring two more. This is the first such incident in the country's history. On 15 September, three men, including an imam and the local village chief, were slain by armed men in Soum province. On 23 September, seven soldiers were killed in a mine explosion. Three days later, two gendarmes were killed in an ambush by jihadists. On 9 November, the Burkina Faso Armed Forces successfully  neutralized 12 jihadists in the village of Ariel. \c\cOn 2 March 2018, Jama\'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin attacked the French embassy in Ouagadougou as well as the general staff of the Burkinabè army. Eight soldiers and eight attackers were killed, and a further 61 soldiers and 24 civilians were injured . \c\cIn 2018, the insurgency expanded to the east of the country. The jihadists launched three attacks on 13 June : in Tindangou, against a police checkpoint, and on the police station and gendarmerie brigade of Comin-Yanga. During the last attack security forces managed to shoot an assailant. On 12 August, six people were killed by rebels in a bomb attack in Boungou, near Fada N\'Gourma. On the night of 27–28 August, eight soldiers died after an explosive device detonated near Pama.

On 4 October, six soldiers died after their military convoy ran over an explosive device. That night, an army of forty Islamists launched an attack against local gendarmes in Inata. The following day, six policemen died in a mine bombing near Sollé. \c\cIn early October, the Armed Forces of Burkina Faso unrolled a major military operation in the country's East, supported by French forces. On 3 December, gendarmes successfully repelled an ambush at Bougui, ten kilometres from Fada N\'Gourma, killing six assailants and injuring another. \c\cOn 1 January 2019, armed men murdered six people in the village of Yirgou, Barsalogho department. The villagers, mostly ethnic Mossis, (who form 52% of Burkina Faso's population) responded by massacring the Fulani members of the town, in what is now known as the Yirgou massacre [fr].  72 people died and over 6,000 were displaced during the incident. \c\cOn 10 January, a group of 36 jihadists slew twelve civilians in Gasseliki. 17 days later, ten more civilians were killed in Sikiré, near Arbinda. On 28 January, four Burkinabé soldiers were killed and five others wounded in Nassoumbou. From 3–4 February, jihadists are reported to have massacred 14 civilians in  Kaïn, 80 kilometres from Ouahigouya. On 4 February, the army reportedly neutralized 146 jihadists in the departments of Kaïn, Banh and Bomborokuy. Human Rights Watch alleged that the military had carried out several summary executions in the process. The Burkinabé Movement for Human and Peoples\' Rights reported that no evidence was found of an attack carried out by terrorists in Kain on that date, and that about sixty civilians were executed without trial by the soldiers. \c\cOn 15 February, the Centre-Est region experienced its first attack. Four Burkinabés and a Spanish priest were killed at a customs post in Nohao, close to the border with Togo. \c\cAccording to Human Rights Watch, between mid-2018 to February 2019, at least 42 people were murdered by jihadists and a minimum of 116 mostly Fulani civilians were killed by military forces without trial. From 31 March to 2 April, ethnic clashes between Fulani, Kurumbas, and Mossis killed 62 people in Arbinda. \c\cIn 2019, Jihadist groups began to start a persecution campaign against Christians. The campaign began on 28 April 2019, when six people, including a pastor, were killed by a group of 10 to 20 people inside a Protestant church in Silgadji. On 12 May, six more people, including one priest, died in a Catholic church in Dablo after it was raided by Islamists. The next day, a Catholic procession was targeted near Kayon and Singa-Rimaïbé, in Zimtanga department. Four people were murdered and a statue of the Virgin Mary was destroyed. \c\cOn the night of 9–10 May, French forces attacked a jihadist encampment near Gorom-Gorom, freeing four hostages — two French, one South-Korean and one American.

On 18 June, armed men murdered 17–18 people in the village of Béléhédé. On 22 June 15 villagers in Sagho and Toekédogo, Barsalogho department, were killed, and on the night of 25–26 July, 22 other villagers died in a massacre in Dibilou, nearby the city of Kaya. \c\cAccording to the NGO, Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, armed violence in Burkina Faso jumped by 174 % in 2019, with nearly 1,300 civilians dead and 860,000 deplaced. \c\cOn 4 January 2020, a bus carrying mainly middle school students blew up after it ran over an explosive device between Toéni and Tougan, resulting in fourteen deaths. On 20 January, jihadists attacked the villages of Nagraogo and Alamou, inside Barsalogho, Sanmatenga, and massacred 36 civilians. The day later, the Parliament of Burkina Faso adopted a law permitting the recruitment of civilian militias called Koglweogo to fight the jihadists. The idea was initially proposed by president Roch Marc Christian Kaboré in November 2019. \c\cOn 25 January, the village of Silgadji was attacked again, this time with a death toll of 39 civilians. Three days after, six soldiers were killed between Madjoari and Pama, in Kompienga province. On 12 February, two civilians were killed by jihadists in Tanwalbougou. \c\cOn Sunday, 16 February, a Protestant church in Pansi was attacked by armed jihadists, who murdered 24 people (including the pastor) and wounding 20 more. This was a week before five people (also including a pastor) were slain in a church in the neighbouring town of Sebba. \c\cOn 29 February, Sebba was attacked again, leaving ten policemen dead. \c\cOn 8 March, the Fulani villages of Barga-Peulh and Dinguila-Peulh, Barga department, were raided by pro-government militias, leaving forty civilians dead. \c\cIn October, around fifty refugees who had fled elsewhere tried to return to their home region, thinking that the violence had decreased. Their convoy was ambushed in the middle of the night, ten kilometers from Pissila. 25 male refugees, approximately half of the convoy, were murdered by the attackers. All women and children were spared. \c\cFrom 4–5 June, unknown militants massacred over 170 people in the villages of Solhan and Tadaryat. \c\cOn 20 August, jihadists killed 80 people in Gorgadji, including 59 civilians. \c\cNovember became one of the year's bloodiest months for Burkina Faso.  On 14 November, the Jama\'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin attacked a gendarmerie in Soum province, killing 53 soldiers. On 21 November, an attack in Foubé resulted in nine soldiers dead and ten civilians killed. \c\cIn December, a group of civilians stopped a French convoy in Kaya Department, alleging that France was secretly working with the jihadists. In a separate incident during that month, Islamists killed 41 people in an ambush, including the popular vigilante leader Ladji Yoro. Yoro was a central figure in the Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland, or VDP for short, a pro-government militia that has taken a leading role in the country's struggle against Islamists. \c\cOn 15 January, at least 10 civilians were killed in an attack blamed on jihadists in northern Burkina Faso, in the village of Namssiguian in Bam province. \c\cOn 23 January, military officials overthrew Kabore's ruling government. Government failures to quell the Islamist insurgency has been described as a possible motive for the coup, which received unusual popularity. The junta's leader, Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, is well-known for his widely popular military operations against Islamists. Damiba has also replaced government ministers (such as Gilbert Noël Ouédraogo) perceived to have handled the insurgency poorly with more popular figures. \c\cAllegations have arisen in the aftermath of the coup that the Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration may hire mercenaries from the Wagner Group in the future. Damiba had called earlier to hire Russian mercenaries against the Islamists, but was forbidden to do so by Kabore. \c\cOn 27 January, France confirmed that from 15 to 23 January 2022, more than sixty recorded jihadists had been "neutralized" in four separate incidents by Burkinabé soldiers working together with French units. \c\cTen members of Ansarul Islam died during a battle with French forces on February 10 near Ouahigouya in return for the killing of five officers in the previous year. Four civilians died in the crossfire. French authorities expressed regret for the civilian casualties, which they assured was accidental. \c\cOn February 8-9, insurgents attacked the W National Park in Benin, killing nine people. On February 12, French forces retaliated by launching a major airstrike on an Islamist camp in Burkina Faso, killing forty rebels. \c\cA humanitarian crisis has erupted in the aftermath of the conflict, with thousands of people killed by both sides. The UNHCR estimates that six in ten displaced people in the Sahel are from Burkina Faso. \c\cGovernment forces have summarily executed countless of civilians, disproportionately targeting ethnic Fulani. In October 2019, 14 men had their turbans ripped off by government forces, then forced into a truck and executed. Fulanis have also been subject to violence by pro-government civilians, such as during the 2019 Yirgou massacre, in which hundreds of civilians were murdered by ethnic Mossis. \c\cIn 2020, a mass grave of over 180 civilians was found near Djibo, killed by government forces. Summary executions and war crimes by the military have become an ordinary incident in the town. In one separate incident, 10 civilians were killed in a market place in Petagoli, three of them Dogon foreigners from Mali. \c\cJihadists have also been guilty of human rights abuses. Villagers have been terrorized during their everyday lives, often prohibited from holding baptisms or marriages; the assassination of local elders has become a common occurrence. From April 2019 to January 2020, Human Rights Watch recorded the killing of at least 256 civilians in a series of 20 different attacks. \c\cIslamists have also targeted schools, the most famous example happening on 12 November 2018, when six Islamists broke into a primary school, mugged the principal, and attacked several students. This was one of the few local cases in which the people responsible for such an attack were arrested. Rebels have justified attacks on schools by painting them as French and Western-style indoctrination programs. Numerous schools have been shut down, leading to an estimated 300,000 children without access to education.
Many states, international organizations and civil society groups have reacted to the crisis between Russia and Ukraine that began in March 2021, ongoing as of February 2022[update]. \c\cIn an interview with the French newspaper Libération in April 2021, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that provocations by Russia with the relocation of troops to the border with Ukraine and the aggravation of the situation in the east are the most serious since the attack on Ukrainian sailors in the Kerch Strait in November 2018. At the same time, the current threat from Russia was more dangerous. In an interview with the Spanish news agency EFE, Kuleba said that Ukraine did not want a war with Russia and was not preparing for any escalation in Donbas at the time. In particular, it was not preparing any offensives or military operations. During renewed tensions in January 2022, Kuleba stated that any reckless step of the Russian Federation or a new round of violence on its part would cost it dearly. Kuleba said that Russia continued to increase its military presence along the Ukrainian-Russian border, in the occupied territories and in the seas of Ukraine. According to him, Russia was gathering troops in three directions, including in the northeast of Ukraine, in the Crimea, in the south, and in the Donbas, in the east. Kuleba also added that in recent weeks, Russia had significantly intensified its propaganda, which dehumanizes Ukrainians and sows hatred for Ukraine. On 22 January 2022, Kuleba accused Germany of "undermining" unity among the country's allies and of "encouraging" Russian President Putin to attack Ukraine by refusing to deliver weapons to Ukraine. \c\cOleksii Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, stated that Ukraine seeks to resolve the conflict in the east of the country primarily through political and diplomatic means. "Ukraine currently has no plan to return the temporarily occupied territories by military means, our task is to resolve the conflict exclusively through political and diplomatic means," he said. "Everything else is a pure information war of the Russian Federation, which they are waging not only on our territory but throughout Europe."\c\cIn September 2021, Ukraine's Naftogaz CEO Yuriy Vitrenko accused Russia of using natural gas as a "geopolitical weapon". Vitrenko stated that "A joint statement from the United States and Germany said that if the Kremlin used gas as a weapon, there would be an appropriate response. We are now waiting for the imposition of sanctions on a 100% subsidiary of Gazprom, the operator of Nord Stream 2."\c\cIn November 2021, Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine's Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence, said that Russia was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February 2022. \c\cOn 4 November, a new defence minister was approved — former Deputy Prime Minister – Minister for the Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Oleksii Reznikov, who participated in the meetings of the Trilateral Contact Group on behalf of Ukraine. \c\cIn January 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video message that the country's citizens should not panic and appealed to the media to be "methods of mass information and not mass hysteria."\c\cFormer leader of the "Right Sector", Dmytro Yarosh said on Facebook on January 24 that in the event of a Russian strike on Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, Ukrainian fighters will turn their lives into hell:\c\cOn 24 January 2022, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said that the movement of Russian troops near Ukraine's border was "not news" and "we don\'t see any grounds for statements about a full-scale offensive on our country."\c\cOn 25 January 2022, Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said he saw no threat of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar stated the variety of Russian troops massed on Ukraine's borders "are not enough for a full-scale invasion."\c\cIn late January 2022, Zelensky went on to accuse Ukraine's western allies of "sowing unrest with predictions of imminent war."\c\cThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied that it has any plans to invade Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed such fears as "alarmist". The Russian embassy in Washington, D.C. called the movements of Russian troops a "sovereign right" and said in a Facebook post: "Once again we emphasize: Russia is not going to attack anyone." Sergei Naryshkin, director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, dismissed reports of a possible invasion of Ukraine asserting that it was "malicious propaganda by the US State Department". Putin's foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov dismissed fears of a military escalation as "nonsense", saying "We have the right to move the troops on our territory."\c\cRussian Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov said "information about Russia's alleged impending invasion of Ukraine is a lie." According to Gerasimov, "Kyiv is not fulfilling the Minsk Agreements. The Ukrainian armed forces are touting that they have started to employ US-supplied Javelin anti-tank missile systems in Donbass and are also using Turkish reconnaissance/strike drones. As a result, the already tense situation in the east of that country is further deteriorating."\c\cOn 12 July 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote an article on Kremlin.ru, claiming that "Russians and Ukrainians were one people – a single whole" and wrote a long dissertation on the common origins of Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians in medieval Kievan Rus\' and their history through the century, concluding that "true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia". He also argued that the Ukrainian leadership had "wasted and frittered away the achievements of many generations", accusing them of imposing a nationalist, anti-Russian sentiment against the will of the Ukrainian people. The article received a detailed response from British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace on Gov.uk on 17 January 2022. \c\cOn 30 November 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that an expansion of NATO's presence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long-range missiles capable of striking Russian cities or missile defense systems similar to those in Romania and Poland, would be a "red line" issue for Russia. Putin asked U.S. President Joe Biden for legal guarantees that NATO wouldn\'t expand eastward or put "weapons systems that threaten us in close vicinity to Russian territory." According to Putin, "If some kind of strike systems appear on the territory of Ukraine, the flight time to Moscow will be seven to 10 minutes, and five minutes in the case of a hypersonic weapon being deployed."\c\cDmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said that the security of Russians, including in the occupied Donbas is a priority for Vladimir Putin. Peskov denied allegations that Russia is preparing for a possible invasion of Ukraine. \c\cDmitry Kozak, Deputy Head of the Russian Presidential Administration and a parliamentarian at the level of political advisers, said that the intensification of hostilities in Donbas could be the beginning of the end of Ukraine. The same applies to Ukraine's accession to NATO. \c\cDeputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said: "They talk about the high price, but never call it. What they have done so far, we have, firstly, studied well, and secondly, adapted. We do not think that at all can the following terminology should be used: price, retribution, etc. We are simply defending our interests and the interests of our citizens, the Russian-speaking population, we will continue to defend them". Ryabkov said Russia has "no intention of attacking, staging an offensive on or invading Ukraine." Asked about the possibility of Russian military deployment to Cuba and Venezuela, Ryabkov said "it all depends on the actions by our US counterparts". Dmitry Medvedev, a deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, told Russian media that "Cuba and Venezuela are aiming to come out of isolation and restore normal relations with the U.S. to a certain extent, so there can’t be any talk about setting up a base there as happened during the Soviet times."\c\cIn December 2021, a Levada Center poll found that 48% of Russians believed that the U.S. and NATO were responsible for the Russo-Ukrainian crisis, while 16% blamed Ukraine and just 4% blamed Russia. \c\cOn 13 January 2022, Russian political journalist Anton Krasovsky, director of broadcasting in Russian on the RT channel, threatened to burn the Constitution of Ukraine on Khreshchatyk because of the course prescribed in it for joining NATO. \c\cRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny wrote in several letters to Time magazine that the West keeps falling into Putin's traps and "Instead of ignoring this nonsense, the U.S. accepts Putin’s agenda and scrambles to organize some meetings."\c\cOn 24 January 2022, Russia began its naval exercise in the Baltic Sea involving communications, air defense, anti-submarine defense and combat exercises. Anti-terror groups are also participating from the Baltic Fleet. \c\cNikolay Zhuravlev, Vice Speaker of the Federation Council, warned that Europe will not be able to receive natural gas, petroleum and metals from Russia in case Russia is disconnected from the SWIFT (SWIFT). \c\cIn late January 2022, during a visit to mark the anniversary of the end of the Siege of Leningrad during the Second World War, Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council, said, "We don\'t want war. We don\'t need that at all."\c\cIn February 2022, Putin warned that Ukraine's accession to NATO could embolden Ukraine to reclaim control over Russian-annexed Crimea or areas ruled by pro-Russian separatists in Donbas, saying "Imagine that Ukraine is a NATO member and a military operation [to regain Crimea] begins. What - are we going to fight with NATO? Has anyone thought about this?"\c\cOn 7 February 2022, Putin said at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron that "A number of [Macron's] ideas, proposals ... are possible as a basis for further steps. We will do everything to find compromises that suit everyone." Putin promised not to carry out new military initiatives near Ukraine. \c\cThe President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, has stated that his country "does not want war", but if someone "pulls it, imposes sanctions or intimidates it", it will "almost give up" because, in his words, they are invincible. He also stated that he would send "a whole contingent of the Belarusian army" to the border with Ukraine, because "Ukrainians allegedly began to draw troops there."\c\cOn January 18, the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council expert group published a review of the arrival of Russian troops in the Republic of Belarus. In particular, it was about unloading Russian Hurricane multiple rocket launchers at the Rechitsa station in the Gomel region north of Kyiv. \c\cUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the aggravation of the situation in Donbas. Blinken reaffirmed U.S. unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.[citation needed]\c\cIn late March 2021, the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley spoke with the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Ruslan Khomchak to discuss the current security environment in Eastern Europe. On the same day, Milley had a conversation with the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Valery Gerasimov. Ukraine's then-defense minister Andriy Taran had a telephone conversation with U.S. defense secretary Lloyd Austin to discuss specific areas of strengthening cooperation in the field of security and defense. Lloyd Austin expressed concern over the recent actions of Russia and assured Taran of his readiness to support Ukraine in the context of Russia's ongoing aggression in the Donbas and Crimea. Austin stressed that in the event of an escalation of Russian aggression, the U.S. would not leave Ukraine alone. \c\cOn 2 April 2021, President Joe Biden had his first telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On 13 April, Biden had a telephone call with Russian president Putin; Biden "emphasized the United States\' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"; Biden also voiced U.S. concern "over the sudden Russian military build-up in occupied Crimea and on Ukraine's borders, and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions." Biden and Putin agreed to meet in a "third country" in the coming months to discuss the subject. \c\cIn mid-April 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, along with the EU, UK, Australia, and Canada, sanctioned eight individuals and entities "associated with Russia's ongoing occupation and repression in Crimea."\c\cAdam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that it was "very likely" that Russia would invade Ukraine. According to Schiff, the occupation of Ukraine would see "more NATO assets closer to Russia. [It] will have the opposite impact of what Putin is trying to achieve". Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, proposed the idea of severe sanctions "at the maximum end of the spectrum", and reiterated the possibility of cutting out Russia from the SWIFT international payment system. \c\cOn 19 January 2022, President Biden said that he believed Russia would invade Ukraine. Biden said a full-scale invasion of Ukraine would be "the most consequential thing that's happened in the world in terms of war and peace" since World War Two. In January 2022, the Biden administration approved deliveries of U.S.-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. \c\cU.S. officials began talks with Qatar and other natural gas exporters over supplying European countries with liquefied natural gas (LNG). The EU member states receive about 40% of its natural gas supply from Russia and possible US sanctions could heavily impact Russia's supplies to Europe during the winter season. \c\cOn 22 January 2022, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv requested the evacuation of non-essential personnel along with their families by the United States Department of State. The State Department issued an advisory not to travel to Ukraine or Russia, citing ongoing tension along the Russia–Ukraine border and COVID-19. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko called the U.S. move as "premature" and a "display of excessive caution." The source close to President Zelensky characterized the U.S. move as "utterly ridiculous". \c\cA Pentagon spokesman John Kirby on January 24 related that “Brigade combat teams, logistics personnel, medical support, aviation support intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance as well as transportation...” military units within the United States have been alerted for potential use in Eastern Europe. President Joe Biden is considering deploying up to 50,000 U.S. troops to Eastern Europe. \c\cThe United States has threatened to halt the opening of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would send Russian natural gas to Germany, "if Russia invades Ukraine one way or another." \c\cWhite House National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said that "President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February." Biden and Ukrainian President Zelensky disagreed on how imminent the threat was. \c\cOn 2 February 2022, The Pentagon has officially confirmed the deployment of additional US troops to strengthen NATO's eastern flank. The details of the operation were presented at the press conference by Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. 2,000 soldiers are to arrive on the Old Continent in the next few days. Of the US troops stationed in Germany, 1,000 soldiers will go to Romania, where they will support the 900-strong contingent already present in the country. Approx. 1,700 soldiers from the 18th Airborne Corps will go to Poland. \c\cOn 11 February 2022, Biden's national security advisor Jake Sullivan publicly warned about the likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine prior to the end the 2022 Winter Olympics, urging all Americans to leave Ukraine immediately and indicating that there may be "no prospect of a U.S. military evacuation" once the invasion commences. \c\cNATO became a flash point in the Russo-Ukrainian crisis. The Russian government demanded that NATO stop admitting any new members, and strongly opposed the potential accession to NATO of Georgia or Ukraine. \c\cAs of 2022[update], Ukraine is not a NATO member, but affirmed its goal of eventually joining NATO. Ukraine participates in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, including the annual Sea Breeze and Rapid Trident military exercises. NATO repeatedly called upon Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and has condemned Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and the Russia-backed separatists in eastern Donbas, calling for a resolution to the Donbas conflict via the Minsk agreements. In December 2021, as Russia continued a military buildup on Ukraine's borders, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly met with Ukrainian leaders to reaffirm the alliance's support for Ukraine, to call upon NATO members to enhance delivery of defensive weapon systems to Ukraine, and to counter Russian disinformation. NATO indicated it would not defend Ukraine if Russia attacked it. \c\cTalks in January 2022 between the U.S. and Russia impassed over Russia's demand. The lead Russian negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, said that it was "absolutely mandatory" that Ukraine "never, never, ever" join NATO.  By contrast NATO and the U.S. have affirmed NATO's "open door" policy, maintaining that countries should freely choose whether to join NATO or not. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that: "No one else has the right to try to veto or interfere in that process. And this is about fundamental principles for European security. It's about the right for every nation to choose their own path."\c\cDuring the crisis, Stoltenberg urged Russia to turn away from belligerency, participate in diplomatic talks, and cooperate with NATO. In a January 2021 interview, reaffirmed NATO's "dual track" approach to Russia, saying, "We are ready to engage in dialogue with Russia, but we will never compromise on core principles for European security....Russia has a choice to either engage in dialogue with NATO and Western allies or choose confrontation. We need to be clear-eyed about the prospect that Russia will — once again — use military force against Ukraine. We will provide support to Ukraine to enable them to strengthen their ability to defend themselves."\c\cSpanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares stated that Spain wanted "dialogue, but if does not bear fruit, of course, Spain will stand with its European partners and its NATO allies united in deterrence". \c\cOn 24 January NATO announced it would send additional military forces to its Eastern members, due to the "deteriorating security situation...NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the alliance". Deployments included four Danish F-16 fighter jets being sent to Lithuania, in addition to a frigate travelling to the Baltic Sea. Two Dutch F-35 fighter jets will also be deployed to Bulgaria. The chief of staff of the Belgian army also stated that the country was ready to send more forces to NATO's eastern allies. Russia's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko condemned the deployments, saying that the military alliance was "demonising Russia" in order to "justify military activity on [NATO’s] eastern flank". \c\cThe decentralised Anonymous hacker group had dedicated some of their defacements of websites such as those of belonging to the United Nations and the Polar Research Institute of China, to promote proposals in order to defuse the crisis, including by calling for the creation of a "neutral grouping" of countries "wedged between NATO and Russia" that would include Ukraine, Finland, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova. Anonymous argued that the so-called "neutral security belt" could serve as an alliance similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) or the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) that acts as a cordon sanitaire between NATO and CSTO countries in order to "assuage Russia's fears without NATO losing its face". \c\cFurthermore, they embedded Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft senior fellow Anatol Lieven's paper "Ending the Threat of War in Ukraine" at the defacement page and called for a referendum on whether to presumably follow the existing Minsk Protocol or hand over the separatist-controlled territories to a UN peacekeeping administration. Later, a second referendum in the separatist regions would then ask voters to choose to reunite with Ukraine, gain independence, or join Russia. \c\cIn addition to that, they announced the launch of "Operation Samantha Smith" or #OpSamanthaSmith, a reference to the 1980s child peace activist. The operation was presumably dedicated into resolving this crisis. They threatened to take hostage of industrial control systems if the tensions continues to worsen and in an apparent warning meant for Russia, Anonymous wrote that the "sole party to be blamed if we escalate on that, will be the same one who started it in the very first place with troop buildups, childish threats, and waves of unreasonable ultimatums." The hacking collective also urged the United Nations to immediately deploy peacekeepers on "at least the Ukrainian side of the frontline in Donbass" under the basis of UN Resolution 337 (V) to "prevent any further provocations" by any side. \c\cOn 24 January, Belarusian opposition hacktivists stated that they had disrupted Belarusian Railway "servers, databases and workstations" using ransomware, while leaving automation and security systems in place. They promised to decrypt the systems provided that 50 political prisoners were released and that Russian soldiers were prevented from entering Belarus. \c\cDmytro Bondarenko, coordinator of the European Belarus civil campaign, told Charter 97 on 26 January 2021, that he believed that in the event of Russian aggression, tens of thousands of Belarusians would fight against the Russian Federation on Ukraine's side and defend their country's independence. He interpreted Russian actions as the desire of Putin and Russian generals to threaten Ukraine and other countries as a result of "weakness". \c\cRepresentants of the Romanian Orthodox Metropolis of Bessarabia in Moldova declared that this institution was closely looking at the situation at Ukraine's borders. The metropolis also issued a statement asking for peace in the region and saying that it was praying for this to be the case. \c\cOn 30 January, 90 Russian intellectuals, including Lev Ponomaryov, Valery Borshchev [ru] Svetlana Gannushkina, Leonid Gozman, Liya Akhedzhakova and Andrey Makarevich issued a public statement in Echo of Moscow opposing the Russian government's threats of a full invasion of Ukraine. They stated that the authorities had not consulted the public and that state media was uniquely pro-war. They objected to presenting war as being inevitable. Ponomaryov, Gannushkina and their co-signees strongly objected to an attack on Ukraine as unjustified and immoral. They predicted the development of a Russian mass anti-war movement and promised to do their best to prevent the war. More intellectuals and activists signed the anti-war statement. As of 1 February 2022[update], the statement had been signed by 2000 Russian intellectuals. \c\cOn 5 February 2021, from two to five thousand people in Kharkiv marched through the city with banners stating "Kharkiv is Ukraine" and "stop Russian aggression". Participants stated that there was anger at the prospect of a Russian invasion, rather than panic as in 2014 when the War in Donbas started. Interviewees judged that the Ukrainian army and citizens would make a Russian invasion difficult, with the Russian forces "suffer[ing] intolerable losses", and that Kharkhiv residents "[knew] how to survive" after year of living under the threat of invasion. \c\cOn 12 February 2021 several thousand Ukrainians took part in a "Unity March" in Kyiv's city centre. They chanted "Glory to Ukraine" and carried Ukrainian flags and banners stating "Ukrainians will resist" and "Invaders must die". \c\cIn January 2022, the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau stated that Canada would provide Ukraine with a CDN$120 million loan, but will not transfer military equipment. The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. The President informed Trudeau about the constant violations of the ceasefire in Donbas, leading to growing losses among the Ukrainian military, as well as the increasing military threat to Ukraine from Russia. \c\cThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba had a telephone conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France Jean-Yves Le Drian. Dmytro Kuleba informed his interlocutor in detail about the latest actions of the Russian Federation aimed at destabilizing the security situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. The Minister drew attention to the threatening withdrawal of Russian troops to the border of our state and the intensification of Russian propaganda that threatens Ukraine with war. He assured that Ukraine does not seek war and remains committed to a political and diplomatic settlement of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Jean-Yves Le Drian noted that France, like Ukraine, is anxiously monitoring the withdrawal of Russian troops to the borders of our country and the temporarily occupied territories. He assured of France's continued support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The head of French diplomacy especially noted Ukraine's prudent and wise actions in the current situation. \c\cOn 13 January 2022, due to what it regarded as Russia's aggressive behaviour, Denmark sent four F-16 fighter jets and a frigate with a crew of 160 people to the Baltic states to reinforce the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence and patrol the sea. On January 24, Belgian Chief Head of Defense Michel Hofman stated that Belgian forces are on standby in the Baltic, and prepared "to intervene within a certain amount of time, but today it is too early to say where and how" should the situation escalate. \c\cOn 19 January 2022, Croatia's prime minister Andrej Plenković told Sabor: "Croatia doesn\'t want escalation and will react clearly and decisively to avoid any kind of instabilities". On 25 January 2022, Croatia′s president Zoran Milanović, who has no executive powers in the country′s political system, noting what he called NATO′s military build-up in the region and the Biden administration′s "inconsistent and dangerous conduct" in international security affairs and stressing his role as Croatia′s commander-in-chief, told the press, "We do not have any bearing on this and we will not have anything to do with this. I guarantee this. Croatia will not send any troops in case of an escalation. On the contrary, it will recall all troops, to the last Croatian soldier." Milanović went on to say that an "arrangement to meet Russia′s security interests" ought to be found and that the acute crisis over Ukraine was "primarily determined by the dynamics of the U.S. domestic politics". On the same day, prime minister Andrej Plenković reacted to the president′s remarks by saying that on hearing those he thought it was being said "by some Russian official"; he also offered apologies to Ukraine and its government for Milanović′s accusation of Ukraine as "one of the most corrupt states" and reiterated that Croatia supported Ukraine′s territorial integrity and no Croat troops were in Ukraine, while the president′s statement "had nothing whatsoever to do with the policy of the government of the Republic of Croatia". \c\cThe Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia, Ivan Korčok, stated that the ceasefire and the announcement of an increase in Russia's military power on the border with Ukraine are a matter of concern and call for de-escalation of tensions. \c\cAlbanian Armed Forces Colonel Ardian Lulaj and Kosovar Head of Strategic Communication Colonel Sefer Isufi both stated in early December 2021 that their respective countries would be willing to deploy Albanian Armed Forces and Kosovo Security Forces in a putative future mission in Ukraine should the US decide to lead such an endeavor. \c\cIn early January, Bulgarian Minister of Defense Stefan Yanev responded to a parliamentary question on the deployment of additional military units in Bulgarian territory that Bulgaria opposes "escalation of military measures before all other diplomatic means are used" and that Bulgaria had as of yet "no national position" on the situation. In December, Yanev's perceived dismissal and "snub" to the idea of increased NATO troops had caused agreement and some condemnation within parliament. On January 20, Bulgaria began receiving new deployments of aircraft, ships and NATO forces from Spain. As of January 21, Bulgaria's prior stance that it was not interested in any immediate new submarine purchases was reported to have "shifted", with the Bulgarian government now in negotiations to purchase two new submarines, with Yanev remarking that "the Bulgarian army must retain readiness... to react to the development of a negative scenario in relation to Ukraine and Russia", while continuing to reiterate his earlier calls for de-escalation. The same day, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kiril Petkov condemned the Russian call for Bulgaria to leave NATO and for NATO troops to be withdrawn from Bulgaria and Romania, while President Roumen Radev called the statement "unacceptable". \c\cAlso on 21 January 2022, during an interview, President of Moldova Maia Sandu declared that the Moldovan authorities were looking closely into the tensions in Ukraine and that certain preemptive measures were being adopted to prepare for possible outcomes of the crisis. Sandu also demanded the withdrawal of the Russian troops in Transnistria, a breakaway territory legally and internationally considered as part of Moldova. \c\cOn 23 January 2022, Pope Francis said, "I am following with concern the rising tensions that threaten to inflict a new blow to peace in Ukraine, and call into question the security of the European continent, with even wider repercussions". \c\cOn 24 January 2022, due to the conflict, the European Commission proposed €1.2 billion financial aid for Ukraine in grants and loans. Due to Russian naval exercises 240 km off Ireland's south-west coast, Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney said that Russia is not welcome. On the same day, commenting on the departure of family members of U.S. Government employees at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said there is no need "to dramatize as far as the negotiations are going on."\c\cOn 2 February 2022, President of Romania Klaus Iohannis asked the Romanian Armed Forces to be prepared for any aggression in the region and said that the tensions in Ukraine showed that measures of modernization and preparation of the Romanian military were necessary. Furthermore, Iohannis called for a greater presence of NATO, the United States and other allies in the region of the Black Sea as a result of the crisis between Russia and Ukraine. Previously, the Minister of National Defence of Romania Vasile Dîncu had said that Romania would not military involve itself in the event of a new Russian–Ukrainian war. \c\cOn 10 January 2022, Lithuanian State Defense Council was convened to discuss the Russian-Ukrainian tensions. In response to the aggressive Russian military behaviour, the council decided to increase the number of troops and speed up military modernization plans. On January 17, Latvia increased the military presence in the eastern part of the country. On 19 January, Kaja Kallas, the Prime Minister of Estonia, announced an extraordinary increase of defense spending by €380 million for the current fiscal year. The Baltic states also decided to accelerate their own acquisition of arms, including the joint rocket artillery system. \c\cEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania have also requested to increase the military deployments of NATO and American troops in the Baltics in order to deter the aggressive Russian behaviour. \c\cOn 21 January 2022, Polish President Andrzej Duda announced that Ukraine can count on Polish support if Russia attacks, and called for a unified stance in Europe. As of 24 January, Pawel Soloch, the head of Poland's National Security Bureau stated there was no talk of Polish troops entering Ukraine as the Ukrainian government had not requested it, but that "what matters most is military and humanitarian aid" and "building a uniform message". On the 21st, Soloch stated that "supporting Ukraine is one of the key priorities of President Andrzej Duda's policy", while Duda and Zelenskiy discussed the possibility of further Polish and NATO defensive equipment deliveries. \c\cOn February 1, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Ukraine began talks to form a "trilateral pact" to counter potential threats from Russia to tighten cooperation "on various fields".  Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki pledged help from Warsaw for Ukraine in terms of both gas, humanitarian and economic aid, and arms, including artillery ammunation, mortars, portable air-defense systems, and surveillance drones, saying that "living close to a neighbour like Russia we have the feeling of living at the foot of a volcano". He also called on Germany to not start the Nord Stream 2 pipeline because "through launching this pipeline, Berlin is loading Putin's pistol, which he can then use to blackmail the whole of Europe", and that it was important not just for Ukraine but for all of Europe and NATO to stand up to Russia. \c\cOn February 3, it was announced that Polish President Andrzej Duda, the only elected EU head of state attending the Beijing Winter Olympics ceremony, would use the visit to present the "European case" to Beijing regarding its view on the conflict. \c\cRussian proposals that NATO would not accept new members received strong criticism by Sweden and Finland who have been maintaining neutrality. In January 2022, both President of Finland Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin insisted on Finland's right to decide what alliances it can join. Sweden expressed the same position that it is only up to the Swedish people to decide whether Sweden should join NATO. Russian threats have sparked the debate in both countries whether they should apply for NATO membership. \c\cOn 13 January, Swedish Armed Forces announced that they were deploying troops to the strategic island of Gotland, as a response to unusual Russian military activity. \c\cIn April 2021, During a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded that the Kremlin head reduce its military presence near Ukraine's borders. \c\cIn December 2021, German chancellor Olaf Scholz warned of "consequences" for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Russian natural gas pipeline project operated by Gazprom, Russia's state-owned energy company, which delivers natural gas to Germany. In January 2022, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned that "any further escalation would carry a high price for the Russian regime — economic, political and strategic". \c\cGermany has been maintaining the policy of not providing Ukraine with lethal weapons. German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said that Germany wants to "de-escalate" tensions and that supplying weapons would "not be helpful". Ukraine also claimed that the German administration blocks the supply of arms though NATO. On 21 January 2022, it was reported that Germany blocked Estonia from exporting weapons of German-origin. \c\cGerman policy has been criticized by Ukrainians as well as domestically. Following pressure and criticism that Germany was not supplying weapons to Ukraine, Germany agreed to send 5,000 helmets. \c\cThe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, said that his country was concerned about Russia's activities in the occupied Crimea and on the border with Ukraine. He said this during a telephone conversation with President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky. Johnson launched a warning to Russian mothers, saying that their sons were not likely to return home if President Putin chose to invade Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said that "there is a very significant risk Russia will invade Ukraine" and urged Putin to "step back from the brink". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss wrote on Twitter that the UK "will not tolerate Kremlin plot to install pro-Russian leadership in Ukraine."\c\cAdmiral Sir Tony Radakin, the Chief of the Defence Staff, warned that "a full invasion of Ukraine would be on a scale not seen in Europe since World War Two."\c\cThe Labour leader Keir Starmer said Russia should be hit with "widespread and hard-hitting sanctions". \c\cOn February 1, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Ukraine began talks to form a "trilateral pact" to counter potential threats from Russia to tighten cooperation "on various fields". \c\cOn 7 February 2022, Johnson said Britain would not "flinch" as he prepared to deploy Royal Marines, RAF aircrafts, and Royal Navy warships to eastern Europe. \c\cOn 10 February 2022, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss met with her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Lavrov described the discussion as "turning out like the conversation of a mute and a deaf person". He dismissed "demands to remove Russian troops from Russian territory" as "regrettable" and asked Truss if she recognized Russia’s sovereignty over the Voronezh and Rostov regions, two Russian provinces where Russian troops are deployed. She mistakenly thought Lavrov was referring to areas of Ukraine and replied that "\u200b\u200bthe U.K. will never recognize Russian sovereignty over these regions." Later that day, the Foreign Office prepared legislation to allow for more sanctions on Russian organisations and individuals. \c\cPrime Minister of Japan Kishida Fumio said he and Biden would work closely to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine and "keep close contact with other allies and partners and continue communicating on the point that any attack will be met with strong action. "In a tweet, Biden said it was "an honor to meet with Prime Minister Kishida to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan Alliance — the cornerstone of peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the world."\c\cChinese leader and CCP general secretary Xi Jinping supported Russia's demand that Ukraine should not join NATO. On 14 January 2022, a spokesman  of China's Foreign Ministry emphasized that all countries should observe a traditional UN Olympic Truce resolution "from seven days before the start of the Olympic Games until seven days after the end of the Paralympic Games", referring to both the upcoming 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games taking place from 4 February 2022 to 20 February 2022 as well as the upcoming 2022 Beijing Winter Paralympic Games taking place from 4 March 2022 to 13 March 2022. Under this timeframe, the proposed truce resolution would thusly begin on 28 January 2022 and conclude on 20 March 2022. \c\cOn 24 January, the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne offered assistance to Ukraine in combating Russian cyber attacks. She also called on Russia to "de-escalate" tensions and urged Australians living in Ukraine to evacuate. The Australian Embassy also evacuated the families of diplomats stationed in Kiev. Similar sentiments were expressed by Minister for Finance Simon Birmingham, who warned that Australia would tighten existing financial sanctions against Russia in the event of hostilities. Between 2014 and 2015, Canberra had imposed sanctions on allies of Vladimir Putin who had supported the Russian annexation of the disputed territory of Crimea. \c\cNew Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs Nanaia Mahuta stated that the New Zealand Government was concerned about the Russian military buildup on the Ukrainian border and supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity; urging Moscow to reduce tensions in accordance with international law. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern reiterated New Zealand's support for Ukrainian sovereignty, adding that New Zealand was considering applying targeted sanctions against Russia.
In March and April 2021, Russia started to mass thousands of soldiers and military equipment near its border with Ukraine, representing the highest force mobilization since the country's annexation of Crimea in 2014. This precipitated an international crisis and generated concerns over a potential invasion. Satellite imagery showed movements of armor, missiles, and other heavy weaponry. The troops were partially removed by June. The crisis was renewed in October and November 2021, when over 100,000 Russian troops were again massed near the border by December. \c\cThe ongoing crisis stems from the protracted Russo-Ukrainian War that began in early 2014. In December 2021, Russia advanced two draft treaties that contained requests of what it referred to as "security guarantees" including a legally binding promise that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as well as a reduction in NATO troops and military hardware stationed in Eastern Europe and threatened unspecified military response if those demands were not met in full. NATO has rejected these requests, and the United States warned Russia of "swift and severe" economic sanctions should it further invade Ukraine. \c\cThe crisis has been described by some commentators as one of the most intense since the Cold War. \c\cFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, both Ukraine and Russia continued to retain close ties. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to abandon its nuclear arsenal and signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances on the condition that Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States would issue an assurance against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. Five years later, Russia was one of the signatories of the Charter for European Security, where it "reaffirmed the inherent right of each and every participating State to be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, as they evolve". \c\cDespite being a recognized independent country since 1991, as a former USSR constituent republic, Ukraine had been perceived by the leadership of Russia as being part of its sphere of influence. Romanian analyst Iulian Chifu and his co-authors in 2009 opined that in regards to Ukraine, Russia has pursued an updated version of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which dictates that the sovereignty of Ukraine cannot be larger than that of the Warsaw Pact's member states prior to the collapse of the Soviet sphere of influence during the late-1980s and early-1990s. \c\cFollowing weeks of protests as part of the Euromaidan movement (2013–2014), pro-Russian Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych and the leaders of the Ukrainian parliamentary opposition on 21 February 2014 signed a settlement agreement that called for an early election. The following day, Yanukovych fled from Kyiv ahead of an impeachment vote that stripped him of his powers as president. Leaders of the Russian-speaking eastern regions of Ukraine declared continuing loyalty to Yanukovych, causing the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. The unrest was followed by War in Donbas in April 2014 with the creation of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, both heavily supported by Russia, as well as the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia. \c\cIn July 2021, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, published an essay titled On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians, in which he re-affirmed his view that Russians and Ukrainians were "one people". American Historian Timothy Snyder has described Putin's ideas as imperialism. British journalist Edward Lucas described it as revisionist. Other observers have noted that the Russian leadership has a distorted view of modern Ukraine and its history. \c\cRussia has said that a possible Ukrainian accession to NATO and the NATO enlargement in general threaten its national security. In turn, Ukraine and other European countries neighboring Russia have accused Putin of attempting to restore the Soviet Empire and of pursuing aggressive militaristic policies. \c\cAccording to Time magazine's analysis published in early February 2022, Russia's military build-up along the Ukrainian border in 2021 goes back to the Russian Defense Ministry announcing on 21 February the deployment of 3,000 paratroopers to the border with Ukraine for “large-scale exercises”, which followed the Ukrainian government's crackdown earlier that month on Viktor Medvedchuk, Ukraine′s leading pro-Russian opposition politician and a tycoon with close personal ties to Russia′s president Vladimir Putin. \c\cOn 3 March 2021, separatists from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic reported they had been granted permission to use "preemptive fire for destruction" on Ukrainian military positions. Leonid Kravchuk, leader of the Ukrainian delegation of the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine (TCG), condemned the statements as a breach of the Minsk agreements.[failed verification] On 16 March, the SBGS border patrol in the Sumy Oblast spotted a Mil Mi-8 helicopter flying from Russia trespassing approximately 50 metres (160 ft) into Ukrainian territory before heading back to Russian airspace. 10 days later, Russian troops fired mortars at Ukrainian positions near the village of Shumy, killing 4 Ukrainian servicemen. Russia has refused to renew the ceasefire in Donbas on 1 April. \c\cBy 30 March, Colonel general Ruslan Khomchak, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine revealed intelligence reports suggesting a military buildup by the Russian Armed Forces at the outskirts of Ukraine in preparations for the Zapad 2021 exercise. 28 Russian battalion tactical groups were situated along the Russo-Ukrainian border and at Russian-occupied territories (primarily Crimea, Rostov, Bryansk and Voronezh). According to Komchak, the buildup posed "a threat" to the military security of Ukraine. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Vladimir Putin, disagreed the Ukrainian statements, claiming the military movements \'are not of any concern\' for neighboring countries. Instead, the decisions were made to deal on matters of \'national security\'. \c\cBetween late March and early April, the Russian military moved significant quantities of arms and equipment from various regions of Russia, including as far away as Siberia, towards Ukraine′s northern and eastern boders and into Crimea. Unofficial Russian sources, notably in the pro-Russian Telegram channel Military Observer, published a video of the flight of a group of Russian Kamov Ka-52 and Mil Mi-28 attack helicopters. It was emphasized by the original sources that the flight had allegedly taken place on the Russo-Ukrainian border. \c\cRussian and pro-Kremlin media made allegations on 3 April accusing a Ukrainian drone attack of causing the death of a child in the Russian-occupied part of Donbas. However, no further details were given surrounding the incident. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Russian State Duma believed that Ukrainian leaders should be "held responsible for the death", while proposing to exclude Ukraine from the Council of Europe. On 5 April, Ukrainian representatives of the Joint Centre of Control and Coordination (JCCC) sent a note to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine regarding pro-Russian intentions to falsify the accusations. The next day, the mission confirmed the death of a child in Russian-occupied Donbas, but failed to establish a link between the purported "Ukrainian drone strike" and the child's death. \c\cOn 6 April, a Ukrainian serviceman was killed as a result of shelling of Ukrainian positions near the town of Nevelske in Donetsk Oblast. Another soldier was killed near Stepne by an unknown explosive device. As a result of the shelling, the water pumping station located in the "gray-zone" between the villages of Vasylivka and Kruta Balka at South Donbas was de-energized, causing the suspension of water supplies at over 50 settlements. Shortly after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine blocked the flow of the Northern Crimean Canal, which had supplied 85-percent of Crimea's water. Crimea's reservoirs were subsequently depleted and water shortages ensued, with water reportedly only being available for three to five hours a day in 2021. The New York Times has cited senior American officials mentioning securing Crimea's water supply could be an objective of a possible incursion by Russia. \c\cRussia has transferred ships between the Caspian Sea and Black Sea. The transfer had involved several landing craft and artillery boats. Interfax has reported on 8 April that the crews and ships of the Caspian Flotilla will pass the final naval exercises in cooperation with the Black Sea Fleet. \c\cOn 10 April, Ukraine invoked Paragraph 16 of the Vienna Document and initiated a meeting in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on the surge of Russian troops at regions near the Russo-Ukrainian border and Russian-occupied Crimea. Ukraine's initiative was supported by several countries, but the Russian delegation failed to appear at the meeting and refused to provide explanations. \c\cOn 13 April, Ukrainian consul Oleksandr Sosoniuk was detained in Saint Petersburg by the Federal Security Service (FSB), allegedly while "receiving confidential information" during a meeting with a Russian citizen. Sosoniuk was later expelled from Russia. In response, Yevhen Chernikov, a senior Russian diplomat of the Russian embassy in Kyiv, was declared a persona non grata in 19 April in Ukraine and was forced to leave the country within 72 hours. \c\cOn 14 April, in a meeting in Crimea, Nikolay Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council of Russia (SCRF) accused Ukrainian special services of trying to organize "terrorist attacks and sabotage" on the peninsula. \c\cOn the night between 14 and 15 April, a naval confrontation took place in the Sea of Azov, 40 kilometres (25 mi) from the Kerch Strait, between three Ukrainian Gyurza-M-class artillery boats and six vessels from the Coast Guard of the Border Service of the FSB. The Ukrainian artillery boats were escorting civilian ships when the incident occurred. It was reported that Ukrainian ships threatened to use airborne weapons to deter provocations from FSB vessels. The incident ended without any casualties. \c\cThe following day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine reported that Russia had announced the closure of parts of the Black Sea from warships and vessels of other countries until October under the pretext of military exercises. The Ministry has condemned the decision as a "gross violation of the right of navigational freedoms" guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. According to the convention, Russia must not "obstruct maritime passages of the International strait to ports" in the Sea of Azov. \c\cAccording to John Kirby, Pentagon Press Secretary, Russia had concentrated more troops near the border with Ukraine than in 2014. Russia reportedly imposed temporary restrictions on flights over parts of Crimea and the Black Sea from 20 to 24 April 2021, as stated in an international report for pilots. \c\cOn 22 April 2021, Russian Minister of Defence Sergey Shoygu announced a drawdown of military exercises with troops from the 58th and 41st Army, and the 7th, 76th, and 98th Guards Airborne Division returning to their permanent bases by 1 May after inspections in the Southern and Western military districts. Equipment at the Pogonovo training facility were to remain for the annual military exercise with Belarus scheduled in September 2021. \c\cOn 11 October 2021, Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia, published an article on Kommersant, in which he argued that Ukraine was a "vassal" of the West and that, therefore, it was pointless for Russia to attempt to hold a dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities, whom he described as "weak", "ignorant" and "unreliable". Medvedev concluded that Russia should do nothing in regards to Ukraine and wait until a Ukrainian government comes to power that is genuinely interested in improving relations with Russia, adding "Russia knows how to wait. We are patient people." The Kremlin later specified that Medvedev's article "runs in unison" with Russia's view of the current Ukrainian government. \c\cIn November 2021, the Russian Defense Ministry described the deployment of the U.S. warships to the Black Sea as a "threat to regional security and strategic stability." The ministry said in a statement, "The real goal behind the U.S. activities in the Black Sea region is exploring the theatre of operations in case Kyiv attempts to settle the conflict in the southeast by force."\c\cSenior officials of the Biden administration reported that Russia had only withdrawn a few thousand troops since the previous military buildup. The New York Times estimated over 80,000 Russian troops still remain at the Russo-Ukrainian border by September 2021. In early November, reports of Russian military buildups prompted American officials to warn the European Union that Russia could be planning a potential invasion of Ukraine. On 13 November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Russia has again amassed 100,000 troops in the border area, higher than an American assessment of approximately 70,000. \c\cOn 21 November, the head of the HUR MOU, Kyrylo Budanov, reported that Russia had concentrated more than 92,000 troops and deployed several Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) systems near the Russo-Ukrainian border. Budanov accused Russia of conspiring protests against vaccination against COVID-19 in Kyiv and other protest rallies in Ukraine to destabilize the country in preparations for a large-scale military invasion. According to Budanov, active Russian military actions should be expected between late-January and early-February 2022. \c\cOn 1 December, Russia accused Ukraine of deploying 125,000 troops (half of the capacity of the Armed Forces of Ukraine) at Donbas to confront pro-Russian separatists. Between November and December, Kremlin officials claimed that Ukraine had violated the Minsk Protocol. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any "unusual" military activity and refuted claims of a possible invasion of Ukraine, while accusing Ukraine of planning "aggressive actions" against Donbas. Peskov urged NATO to stop "concentrating a military fist" near the Russo-Ukrainian border and arming Ukraine with modern weapons. Putin criticized Ukraine for using Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAV) against pro-Russian separatists at Donbas. Russia accused Ukraine of creating "provocations", moving heavy artillery weapons towards the front lines where separatists were fighting with Ukrainian forces. \c\cOn 3 December, the Ukrainian Minister of Defense, Oleksii Reznikov, spoke of the possibility of a "large-scale escalation" by Russia during the end of January 2022, during a session at the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's national parliament). In early December 2021, an analysis conducted by Janes concluded that major elements of the Russian 41st Army (headquartered at Novosibirsk) and the 1st Guards Tank Army (normally deployed around Moscow) had been re-positioned to the west, reinforcing the Russian 20th and 8th Guards that were already positioned closer to the Russo-Ukrainian border. Additional Russian forces were reported to have moved to Crimea, reinforcing Russian naval and ground units that were already deployed there. American intelligence officials warned that Russia was planning an upcoming major military offensive into Ukraine scheduled to take place in January 2022. \c\cRussia began a slow evacuation of its embassy staff at Kyiv beginning in January 2022. The motives of the evacuation remain unknown and were subjected to multiple speculations. By mid-January, an intelligence assessment produced by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence estimated that Russia were in its final stages of completing a military buildup at the Russo-Ukrainian border, amassing 127,000 troops at the region. Among the troops, 106,000 were land forces and the remainder being navals and air forces. Furthermore, there were 35,000 more Russian-backed separatist forces and another 3,000 Russian forces in rebel-held eastern Ukraine. The assessment estimated that Russia had deployed 36 Iskander SRBM systems near the border, many stationed within striking distance of Kyiv. The assessment also reported intensified Russian intelligence and combat sustainment units, such as movements of ammunition and field hospitals. \c\cIn the last week of January 2022, major Russian forces were relocated and deployed to Belarus under the auspices of the planned joint military exercises to be held in February that year. Namely, the headquarters of the Eastern Military District was deployed to Belarus along with combat units drawn from the District's 5th Combined Arms Army, 29th Combined Arms Army, 35th Combined Arms Army, 36th Combined Arms Army, as well as the Pacific Fleet's 155th Naval Infantry Brigade. Ukrainian and American officials believed that Russia's decision was to use Belarus for an attack on Ukraine from the north due to the close proximity of the Belarusian–Ukrainian border with the city of Kyiv. \c\cOn 19 January, U.S. president Joe Biden said his "guess" was that Russia "will move in" to Ukraine but Putin would pay "a serious and dear price" for an invasion and "would regret it". Biden added, "It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do. But if they actually do what they\'re capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine." Biden's comment implied that NATO allies were split on the question of responding to a possible "minor incursion" into Ukraine. The remark was criticized by Ukrainian officials, several world leaders and members of the US Congress, as it would imply that low-level Russian aggression would not be met with a forceful response. As a result, Zelensky wrote, "We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones." The Biden administration later clarified Biden's comments, mentioning, "...he has been \'absolutely clear\' with President Putin. He has no misunderstanding. If any – any – assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion... It would be met with severe and coordinated economic response."\c\cOn 20 January, Russia announced plans to hold major naval drills involving all of its naval fleets containing 140 vessels, 60 planes and 10,000 soldiers. \c\cIn an interview to The Washington Post in January 2022, Zelensky warned that Russian forces could invade and take control of regions in eastern Ukraine, such as the Kharkiv Oblast. He also argued that an invasion would lead to a large-scale war between Ukraine and Russia. On January 28, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), General Philip M. Breedlove, gave an assessment of Russian military capabilities and strategic aims. \c\cOn 28 January, Reuters reported that Russia had added blood supplies and other medical materials "within recent weeks", according to 3 U.S officials, adding to fears of conflict. \c\cOn 5 February, two U.S. officials said that Russia had assembled about 70% of the military believed it would be needed for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and that the number of battalion tactical groups in the border region has risen from 60 to 83 in the previous two weeks. \c\cOn 10 February, six Russian warships capable of landing tanks and troops ashore, assigned to Russia's Baltic and Northern Fleets, arrived at the Sevastopol Naval Base in Crimea. On the same day, Russia announced naval exercises to be held in the Black Sea. Meanwhile, Ukraine "strongly protested" against "the decision of the Russian Federation to block parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait under the pretext of holding regular naval exercises". Separately, north of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus began joint military exercises, Allied Resolve 2022, close to the Belarusian border with Ukraine, with about 30,000 Russian troops, as well as almost all of the Belarusian armed forces, participating in the drills scheduled to last for 10 days. \c\cOn 11 February, US intelligence made an assessment that the Russian invasion could be imminent and predicted that it might begin before the end of the 2022 Winter Olympics on 20 February. As a result, US ordered evacuation of most its diplomatic staff and all military instructors in Ukraine. US, UK, Japan and many EU countries also urged their citizens to leave Ukraine immediately. Next day, Dutch KLM suspended its flights to Ukraine, while other airlines reduced their exposure to the country. \c\cOn 26 November 2021, Zelensky accused the Russian government and Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov of backing a plan to overthrow the Ukrainian government. Russia has subsequently denied the claims. \c\cOn 10 January 2022, the SBU announced that it had arrested an alleged Russian military intelligence agent who was attempting to recruit operatives to conduct attacks at Odessa. 3 days later, Ukraine was struck by a cyberattack that affected the official websites of several Ukrainian ministries. It was later suspected that Russian hackers might be responsible in the incident. \c\cUkrainian military intelligence stated that Russian special services were preparing "provocations" against Russian soldiers stationed at Transnistria (a breakaway unrecognized state internationally considered to be part of Moldova) to create a pretext for a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration later revealed that the Russian government had deployed saboteurs to eastern Ukraine to stage a fabricated attack against Russian proxy separatists at eastern Donetsk and Luhansk to provide Russia with another pretext for an invasion. The administration stated the Russian operatives were trained in urban warfare and explosives. The Russian government has denied the claims. \c\cOn 22 January, the British government said Russia was preparing a plan to supplant Ukraine's government via military force and install a pro-Russian puppet administration in the country, potentially led by Yevheniy Murayev, a former member of the Ukrainian parliament. Both Murayev and the Russian government denied the allegations, with the latter blaming "NATO countries led by the Anglo-Saxons" for the Russo-Ukrainian crisis. On 3 February, the US Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer claimed to have information that Russia was planning to use a fabricated video showing a Ukrainian fake attack, that Russia would use to justify an invasion. Subsequently, Associated Press confronted the State Department spokesperson to produce clear evidence in support of these allegations, but the journalist was clearly rebuffed under the pretext of "protected sources & methods". \c\cIn preparation of a possible renewed Russian invasion, the Ukrainian Ground Forces announced a meeting in April 2021 regarding territorial defenses to strengthen and protect the nation's borders and critical facilities, and to combat sabotage and reconnaissance groups at southern Ukraine. During the same month, Zelensky visited Ukrainian defensive positions at Donbas. \c\cThe United States estimated in December 2021 that Russia could assemble over 175,000 troops to invade Ukraine. Oleksii Reznikov, Ukrainian Minister of Defense, stated, "...we have 250,000 official members of our army. Plus, I said 400,000 veterans and 200,000 reservists. 175,000 (is) not enough to go to Ukraine." Reznikov claimed that Russia could launch a large-scale attack on Ukraine in late-January 2022. \c\cUkraine's Territorial Defense Forces (the reserve component of the Ground Forces established after the 2014 war) recruited additional citizens and trained them in urban guerrilla tactics and firearms use. Such insurgency tactics, as reported by The New York Times, could support a resistance movement if the Russian military is able to overwhelm the Ukrainian military. Andrii Zahorodniuk, former Ukrainian Minister of Defense, wrote in January 2022 that in the case of a Russian invasion, the Russian forces would likely destroy "key elements of the country's military infrastructure" and will be able to "advance deep into Ukrainian territory", but would face difficulty in securing it. Zahorodniuk further stated, "Russian occupation forces will face highly motivated opponents fighting in familiar surroundings. By combining serving military units with combat veterans, reservists, territorial defense units, and large numbers of volunteers, Ukraine can create tens of thousands of small and highly mobile groups capable of attacking Russian forces. This will make it virtually impossible for the Kremlin to establish any kind of administration over occupied areas or secure its lines of supply."\c\cIn response to expectations of a renewed invasion following the military buildup about 100,000 Russian troops near the Russo-Ukrainian border, some of the NATO member nations in January 2022 began providing military aid, including lethal weapons, to Ukraine, with the U.S. giving approval to its NATO allies to ship anti-armor missiles and other U.S.-made weapons to Ukraine. The first U.S. shipment of some 90 tonnes (200,000 lb) of lethal weapons arrived in Ukraine on 22 January 2022. The US provided Ukraine FGM-148 Javelin antitank missiles, anti-armor artillery, heavy machine guns, small arms and ammunition, secure radio systems, medical equipment and spare parts. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley threatened US support for an anti-Russian insurgency within Ukraine, similar to the CIA's assistance to anti-Soviet mujahideen rebels in Afghanistan in the 1980s. According to James Stavridis, the former Supreme Allied Commander Europe at NATO, "The level of military support" for anti-Russian guerrilla fighters in Ukraine "would make our efforts in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union look puny by comparison."\c\cIn December, the US administration approved an additional defense aid of US$200 million to Ukraine. This was an addition to previous aids to Ukraine, making the total defense aid in 2021 worth US$650 million. Deliveries of lethal weapons from the US started the following month and included .50 BMG caliber ammunition, M141 Bunker Defeat Munition (BDM) and Javelin systems. The US also intends to transfer Mil Mi-17 helicopters to Ukraine, previously flown by the Afghan Air Force. The Biden administration approved deliveries of American-made FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. In January 2022, the Biden administration granted permission to the Baltic nations (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) to transfer American-made equipment to Ukraine. Estonia donated Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, while Latvia and Lithuania provided Stinger air defense systems and associated equipments. \c\cOther NATO members also provided aid to Ukraine. Pre-existing British and Canadian military training programs were bolstered in January 2022. The British deployed additional military trainers and provided light anti-armor defense systems, while the Canadians deployed a small special forces delegation to aid Ukraine. On 17 January, British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced that Britain had supplied Ukraine with 1,100 short-range anti-tank missiles. On 20 January, Sky News reported that 2,000 short-range anti-tank MBT LAW missiles had been delivered via numerous Royal Air Force C-17 transport aircraft between the UK and Ukraine. \c\cOn 16 January, the Danish government decided to provide a €22 million (US$24.8 million) defense package for Ukraine. On 21 January, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wopke Hoekstra, said that the Netherlands was ready to deliver "defensive military support" to Ukraine. He explained that Ukraine had asked the Netherlands for arms assistance on 20 January. A parliamentary majority supported sending weapons to the country. \c\cOn 31 January 2021, Poland announced the decision to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine. It intends to provide significant quantities of light ammunition, artillery shells, light mortar systems, reconnaissance drones, and Polish-made Grom surface-to-air missiles. \c\cThe Dutch and Spanish governments also deployed forces to the region in support of NATO. On 20 January 2022, Spanish Defence Minister, Margarita Robles announced that the Spanish Navy was being deployed to the Black Sea. A Meteoro ship acting as a minesweeper was already en route and the frigate Blas de Lezo departed on 22 January. She also announced that the Spanish government was considering deploying the Spanish Air Force (SAF) to Bulgaria. Four Eurofighters were deployed in February 12, 2022. The Netherlands said it would send two F-35s to Bulgaria as part of NATO's expanded air surveillance mission. \c\cOn 5 February 2022, the first of 2,000 newly deployed US soldiers to Europe arrived in Germany and Poland, as part of the US attempt to bolster NATO's eastern flank as Russia deploys more forces along Ukraine's borders. \c\cOn 7 February 2022, Johnson said Britain would not "flinch" as he prepared to deploy Royal Marines, RAF aircrafts, and Royal Navy warships to eastern Europe. \c\cOn 11 February 2022, the US announced additional deployment of 3,000 troops to Poland and sent F-15 jets to Romania. \c\cBetween 2 and 3 November 2021, CIA director William Burns met with senior Russian intelligence officials at Moscow to convey to the Kremlin regarding Biden's concern about the situation on the Russo-Ukrainian border. It was reported by CNN that Burns spoke by phone with Zelensky following the meeting at Moscow in a bid to ease Russian and Ukrainian tensions. Simultaneously, a high-ranking US Department of State official was dispatched to Ukraine. \c\cOn 15 November, acting German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian expressed concern in a joint communique about "the movements of Russian forces and military equipment near Ukraine," calling both sides to "show restraint". At the same time, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby confirmed that the United States continues to observe "unusual military activity" by Russia near the Russo-Ukrainian border.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed reports of "Russian military activity" in the area with Le Drian. On 16 November, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on the West to send Russia "a clear signal calling for reducing tension, avoiding any escalation in and around Ukraine." Stoltenberg added that the alliance records an "unusual concentration" of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border. \c\cIn early November 2021, Ukrainian intelligence assessed the information about the transfer of additional Russian troops to the Ukrainian borders to be "an element of psychological pressure." A week later, the Office of the President of Ukraine acknowledged that Russia was building up "specific groups of troops" near the border. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the French and German governments to prepare for a possible military scenario of Russia's actions against Ukraine. \c\cUkraine has intensified diplomatic efforts. On 15 November, Zelensky and the head of the European Council (EUCO) Charles Michel discussed "the security situation along the borders of Ukraine." On the same day, Kuleba held talks on the same issues in Brussels. The new Ukrainian defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, went to Washington D.C., where on 18 November he met with US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin. On 16 November, British defence secretary Ben Wallace visited Kyiv. \c\cIsrael maintains strong relationship with both Ukraine and Russia, and has sometimes acted as an interlocutor between the two nations. In April 2021, Zelensky asked the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to mediate the situation between himself and Putin. Israel raised the idea with Russia, who declined the request. In a meeting at Kyiv in October with Zelensky, Israeli President Isaac Herzog told Zelensky that the new Israeli government under Prime Minister Naftali Bennett was willing to resume efforts at Ukrainian-Russian mediation. Bennett raised the idea in a meeting with Putin two weeks later at Sochi, but Putin declined. \c\cOn 21 January 2022, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) announced in Pravda that its deputies would introduce a resolution in the State Duma to ask President Putin to officially recognize the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. \c\cIn late January, the United States was again discussing sanctions with European allies in case of a Russian invasion. Biden said the sanctions would be "swift and severe, including a "game over" strategy of targeting Russian banks, bond markets and the assets of elites close to Putin. Such an approach has also been criticized, and the proposed cut-off of Russian banks from the Visa, Mastercard and SWIFT payment systems was withdrawn. The challenge for US and NATO vis-à-vis Russia is the creation of credible deterrence with a plan for a de-escalatory sequence, including reductions in inflammatory rhetorics by the West, Russian troop withdrawals from the Russo-Ukrainian border, renewed Donbas peace talks, as well as a temporary halt on military exercises at the Black and Baltic Seas by the US, NATO or Russia. \c\cA Normandy Format meeting was planned between Russian, Ukrainian, German and French senior officials at Paris on 26 January 2022, with a followup phone call between the French President Emmanuel Macron and Putin on 28 January. Ukraine fulfilled Russia's condition for a meeting at Paris and decided to withdraw a  controversial draft law on the reintegration of Crimea and Donbas from the Ukrainian parliament, as it was viewed that the law had contradicted the Minsk peace agreements. \c\cOn 7 February, French President Emmanuel Macron met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, with mixed outcomes: Macron said that Putin told him that Russia will not further escalate the crisis; Putin scoffed at assertions  that NATO is a "defensive alliance" and warned the Western countries that if Ukraine joined NATO, European countries would "automatically" be at war with Russia. \c\cOn 7 December 2021, U.S. president Joe Biden and president Putin talked by videoconference. One of the topics discussed was the crisis over Ukraine, the Russian side issuing a statement that said Putin highlighted the fact that it was "NATO that was undertaking dangerous attempts to develop Ukrainian territory and increase its potential along [Russia's] borders"; he demanded "reliable, legal guarantees" that would preclude NATO from expanding its territory toward Russia or deploying its strike weapon systems in countries bordering Russia. \c\cOn 15 December 2021, Russia formally handed over to the U.S. its two draft treaties on security guarantees whereby the U.S. as well as NATO would, among other things, undertake not to deploy troops in ex-Soviet states that were not NATO members, rule out any further expansion of the Alliance eastward, undertake not to deploy any forces in other countries in addition to that which were deployed as of 27 May 1997, and refrain from conducting any military activity in Ukraine as well as in other states in eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and Central Asia. \c\cBiden and Putin had a 50-minute phone call on 30 December 2021. According to a White House statement released afterwards, on the call, Biden urged Putin "de-escalate tensions with Ukraine". According to Putin's aide, Biden told Putin that the U.S. did not plan to deploy offensive weapon in Ukraine. Biden also warned that if Russia continued aggression against Ukraine, it would lead to "serious costs and consequences" such as the U.S. imposing additional economic sanctions on Russia, increasing U.S. military presence in the eastern members of NATO, and increased assistance to Ukraine. According to Putin's aide, Putin responded by saying that it would "cause a total severance of relations" between Russia and the US as well as the West at large. The following day, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov addressed the question about what Russia expected in response to its "security guarantees" proposals by saying, "...we will not allow anyone to drag out our initiatives in endless discussions. If a constructive response does not follow within a reasonable time and the West continues its aggressive course, Russia will be forced to take every necessary action to ensure a strategic balance and to eliminate unacceptable threats to our security."\c\cOn 10 January 2022, the U.S. and Russia held bilateral talks in Geneva, whose purpose had been defined by the two sides as "to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and confront rising tensions over Ukraine". The talks were led by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, and US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. \c\cThe Geneva meeting was followed by a meeting of the NATO–Russia Council in Brussels on 12 January that involved delegations from all thirty NATO countries and one from Russia to discuss (according to the official statement issued by NATO), "the situation in and around Ukraine, and the implications for European security". The Russian MoD statement following the meeting stated, "...[Russia] brought Russian assessments of the current state in the field of Euro-security, and also gave explanations on the military aspects of the Russian draft agreement on security guarantees." The talks were judged by Russia to be unsuccessful. Following the meeting, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that, with respect to Ukraine's potential accession to NATO, all NATO Allies were "united on the core principle that each and every nation has the right to choose his own path" and "Russia doesn\'t have a veto on whether Ukraine can become a NATO member. ... at the end of the day, it has to be NATO Allies and Ukraine that decides on membership."\c\cOn 21 January, Lavrov and Blinken met at Geneva. Blinken noted afterwards that the meeting "was not a negotiation but a candid exchange of concerns and ideas". Following the meeting, Blinken said that the U.S. had made clear to Russia that its renewed invasion would "be met with swift, severe and a united response from the United States and our partners and allies."\c\cThe U.S. delivered a formal written response to Russia's security demands on 26 January. The response rejected Moscow's demand that NATO renounce its promise that Ukraine would be able to join NATO. Commenting on the content of the U.S. response, Blinken said that the document "include[d] concerns of the United States and our allies and partners about Russia's actions that undermine security, a principled and pragmatic evaluation of the concerns that Russia has raised, and our own proposals for areas where we may be able to find common ground." On 1 February, Putin said the U.S. response had  failed to address Moscow's "three key demands", namely the non-expansion of the Alliance, refusal to deploy offensive weapon systems close to the Russian borders, and bringing back the Alliance's military infrastructure to the status quo of 1997. \c\cA UN Security Council meeting was convened on 31 January to discuss the ongoing crisis. Russia tried to block the meeting, but the request was rejected with ten votes for the meeting to go ahead, two against and three abstentions. During the debate, the US and Russia exchanged accusations among themselves. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, accused Russia of "aggressive behavior", and posing a "clear threat to international peace and security". She said Russia had made the "largest military mobilization for decades in Europe", and was trying "to paint Ukraine and Western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for attack". Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the West of "hysterics" and of "whipping up tensions" over Ukraine. He accused the US of "stoking the conflict" and the UNSC meeting was "an attempt to drive a wedge between Russia and Ukraine". According to him, Ukraine was not abiding the Minsk Protocols of 2014 and 2015 to end the conflict with the separatists, and Western nations were "pumping Ukraine full of weapons" contrary to the Minsk Protocols. Nebenzya added that Ukraine's violation of the Minsk Protocols could end in the ‘worst way’. \c\cUkrainian permanent representative at the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said Russia had deployed 112,000 troops near Ukraine's borders and in Crimea, with 18,000 deployed at sea off Ukraine's coast. China's permanent representative, Zhang Jun, said the meeting was counterproductive and "quiet diplomacy, not megaphone diplomacy" was needed. \c\cNo resolution was agreed at the meeting. \c\cOn 15 December 2021, Russia proposed documents that it referred to as "draft treaties", which referred to multiple international agreements, including the Charter for European Security and the NATO–Russia Council (NRC). Responses from NATO and the US in January 2022 referred to NRC, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), the United States–Russia Strategic Stability Dialogue (SSD), the Helsinki Final Act, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Normandy Format and other treaties and forums. \c\cOn 11 February 2022, Ukraine invoked Chapter III (risk reduction) of the Vienna Document 2011, requesting Russia to provide "detailed explanations on military activities in the areas adjacent to the territory of Ukraine and in the temporarily occupied Crimea."\c\cIn an interview with the French newspaper Libération in April 2021, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that Russian troops\' build-up near the border with Ukraine and the deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine were the gravest since the attack on Ukrainian sailors in the Kerch Strait in November 2018. \c\cIn November 2021, Kyrylo Budanov, the chief of Ukraine's military intelligence, said that Russia was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February 2022. On 25 January 2022, defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said he saw no immediate threat of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine; he insisted that the threat had not significantly increased in eight years as "the Russian army ha[d] not formed a strike group that would be able to carry out an invasion". On 28 January 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the West not to create a "panic" in his country over a potential Russian invasion, adding that constant warnings of an "imminent" threat of invasion are putting the economy of Ukraine at risk. Zelensky said that "we do not see a bigger escalation" than in early 2021 when Russian military build-up started. On 2 February, the U.S. White House said it would no longer describe a potential invasion as "imminent". \c\cThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied that it has any plans to invade Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed such fears as "alarmist". Sergei Naryshkin, director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, dismissed reports of a possible invasion of Ukraine asserting that it was "malicious propaganda by the US State Department". On 30 November 2021, Putin stated that an expansion of NATO's presence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long-range missiles capable of striking Russian cities or missile defense systems similar to those in Romania and Poland, would be a "red line" issue for Russia. In January 2022, Nikolay Zhuravlev, Vice Speaker of the Federation Council, warned that Europe would not receive natural gas, petroleum and metals from Russia in the event that Russia was disconnected from the SWIFT international payment system, moreover such move could not be feasible as it would require consent of all the countries participating in this system. In late January 2022, Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council, said that the idea that Russia is “threatening Ukraine” was “absolutely ridiculous” and added: "We don\'t want war. We don\'t need that at all." Russia's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko condemned the deployment of NATO troops, warships, and fighter jets in Eastern Europe, saying that the military alliance was "demonising Russia" in order to "justify military activity on [NATO's] eastern flank". Russia accused Ukraine of not implementing Minsk agreements reached in 2015 with the aim of establishing peace in Donbas. \c\c Albania and  Kosovo – Albanian Armed Forces Colonel Ardian Lulaj and Kosovar Head of Strategic Communication Colonel Sefer Isufi both stated in early December 2021 that their respective countries would be willing to deploy Albanian Armed Forces and Kosovo Security Forces in a putative future mission in Ukraine should the US decide to lead such an endeavor. \c\c Australia – On 24 January, the Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne offered assistance to Ukraine in combating Russian cyber attacks. She also called on Russia to "de-escalate" tensions and urged Australians living in Ukraine to evacuate. Similar sentiments were expressed by Finance Minister Simon Birmingham, who warned that Australia would raise financial sanctions against Russia in the event of hostilities. \c\c Belarus – The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, has stated that his country "does not want war", but if someone "pulls it, imposes sanctions or intimidates it", it will "almost give up" because, in his words, they are "invincible". He also stated that he would send "a whole contingent of the Belarusian army" to the border with Ukraine, because "Ukrainians allegedly began to draw troops there." On 18 January 2022, the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council expert group published a review of the arrival of Russian troops in the Republic of Belarus. In particular, it was about unloading Russian BM-27 Uragan multiple rocket launchers at the Rechytsa station in the Gomel Oblast north of Kyiv. \c\c Belgium – On 24 January 2022, Belgian Chief Head of Defense Michel Hofman said that Belgian forces were on standby in the Baltic, and prepared "to intervene within a certain amount of time, but today it is too early to say where and how" should the situation escalate. \c\c Bulgaria – In early January, Bulgarian Minister of Defense Stefan Yanev responded to a parliamentary question on the deployment of additional military units in Bulgarian territory that Bulgaria opposes "escalation of military measures before all other diplomatic means are used" and that Bulgaria had as of yet "no national position" on the situation. On 21 January, Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov condemned the Russian call for Bulgaria to leave NATO and for NATO troops to be withdrawn from Bulgaria and Romania, while President Rumen Radev called the statement "unacceptable". \c\c Canada – In January 2022, the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau stated that Canada would provide Ukraine with a CDN$120 million loan, but will not transfer military equipment. \c\c China – Chinese leader and CCP general secretary Xi Jinping supported Russia's demand that Ukraine must never join NATO. On 14 January 2022, a spokesman  of China's Foreign Ministry emphasized that all countries should observe a traditional UN Olympic Truce resolution "from seven days before the start of the Olympic Games until seven days after the end of the Paralympic Games". Under this timeframe, the proposed truce resolution would thusly begin on 28 January 2022 and conclude on 20 March 2022. \c\c Croatia – On 19 January 2022, Croatia's prime minister Andrej Plenković, speaking to the Sabor, said that the situation in the east of Ukraine was very worrying and the most tense since 2014 and told: "Croatia does not want the situation to escalate and it will react clearly and resolutely to prevent any instability". On 25 January 2022, Croatia's president Zoran Milanović, noting what he called NATO's military build-up in the region and the Biden administration's "inconsistent and dangerous conduct" in international security affairs and stressing his role as Croatia's commander-in-chief, told the press, "We do not have any bearing on this and we will not have anything to do with this. I guarantee this. Croatia will not send any troops in case of an escalation. On the contrary, it will recall all troops, to the last Croatian soldier." Milanović went on to say that an "arrangement to meet Russia's security interests" ought to be found and that the acute crisis over Ukraine was "primarily determined by the dynamics of the U.S. domestic politics". On the same day, prime minister Andrej Plenković reacted to the president's remarks by saying that on hearing those he thought it was being said "by some Russian official"; he also offered apologies to Ukraine and its government for Milanović's accusation of Ukraine as "one of the most corrupt states" and reiterated that Croatia supported Ukraine's territorial integrity and no Croat troops were in Ukraine, while the president's statement "had nothing whatsoever to do with the policy of the government of the Republic of Croatia". \c\c Czech Republic – On 26 January 2022, the Czech government decided to donate 4,006 152-mm artillery shells (used by the Czech Army for self-propelled DANA howitzers), worth 36.6 million korunas, to Ukraine. \c\c Denmark – On 13 January 2022, Denmark sent four F-16 fighter jets and a frigate with a crew of 160 people to the Baltic states to reinforce the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence and patrol the sea. \c\c Estonia,  Latvia and  Lithuania – On 10 January 2022, Lithuanian State Defense Council was convened to discuss the Russian-Ukrainian tensions. In response to the aggressive Russian military behaviour, the council decided to increase the number of troops and speed up military modernization plans. On 17 January, Latvia increased the military presence in the eastern part of the country. On 19 January, the Prime Minister of Estonia announced an extraordinary increase of defense spending by €380 million for the current fiscal year. The Baltic states also decided to accelerate their own acquisition of arms, including the joint rocket artillery system. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have also requested to increase the military deployments of NATO and American troops in the Baltics in order to deter the aggressive Russian behaviour. \c\c European Union – On 24 January 2022, due to the conflict, the European Commission proposed €1.2 billion financial aid for Ukraine in grants and loans. The European Union is negotiating possible liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies with the United States, Qatar and Azerbaijan in case Russia stops gas exports to Europe. \c\c Finland and  Sweden – Russian proposals that NATO would not accept new members received strong criticism by Sweden and Finland who have been maintaining neutrality. In January 2022, both President of Finland Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin insisted on Finland's right to decide what alliances it can join. Sweden expressed the same position that it is only up to the Swedish people to decide whether Sweden should join NATO. Russian threats have sparked the debate in both countries whether they should apply for NATO membership. On 13 January, Swedish Armed Forces announced that they were deploying troops to the strategic island of Gotland, as a response to unusual Russian military activity. \c\c France – In April 2021, French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian, during a phone conversation with Ukrainian Minister for Foreign Affairs  Dmytro Kuleba, noted that France was anxiously monitoring the withdrawal of Russian troops to the borders of Ukraine and the temporarily occupied territories. He assured of France's continued support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The head of French diplomacy especially noted Ukraine's prudent and wise actions in the current situation. \c\c Germany – In April 2021, during a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded that the Kremlin head reduce its military presence near Ukraine's borders. In December 2021, German chancellor Olaf Scholz warned of "consequences" for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Russian natural gas pipeline project operated by Gazprom, which delivers natural gas to Germany. In January 2022, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned that "any further escalation would carry a high price for the Russian regime — economic, political and strategic". Germany has been maintaining the policy of not providing Ukraine with lethal weapons. German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said that Germany wants to "de-escalate" tensions and that supplying weapons would "not be helpful". Ukraine also claimed that the German administration blocks the supply of arms though NATO. On 21 January 2022, it was reported that Germany blocked Estonia from exporting weapons of German-origin. Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks has called Germany's relationship with Russia (and China) as "immoral and hypocritical". On 26 January, Germany announced that it was going to ship 5,000 helmets to Ukraine, while reaffirming that it wasn\'t going to supply any lethal weapon. The mayor of Kyiv and former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko described this offer as "a joke". \c\c Hungary – Hungarian Defence Minister Tibor Benkő declared that there is no need for NATO to deploy its troops in Hungary. \c\c India – On 19 January 2022, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman called up Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and the two discussed “Russia’s concerning military build-up on Ukraine’s borders”. On 28 January, official spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs Arindam Bagchi stated that the situation in Ukraine and the high-level discussions between Russia and the US were being closely monitored. The statement called "for a peaceful resolution of the situation through sustained diplomatic efforts for long term peace and stability in the region and beyond". On 29 January it was reported that the Indian Embassy in Ukraine had asked all Indians living there – mostly students in medical colleges – to register themselves so that it could provide information in a swift manner. Unlike other states, India did not evacuate its diplomats. The Indian Express highlighted the Indian Government's difficult situation: on one hand, it was concerned about Russia's "muscle-flexing", but with almost 60 per cent of India's military supplies being Russian-manufactured and with the ongoing military stand-off with China, it did not want to jeopardise its close military ties with Moscow; on the other hand, the US and Europe were also important strategic partners. Indian media outlets noted how hostility and sanctions against Russia would create problems for the country's S-400 missile deal and likely "push Moscow in the direction of Beijing, hence strengthening the Chinese". \c\c Israel – In late January 2022, Israel considered airlifting thousands of Jews out of Ukraine. On 11 February 2022, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement urging Israeli citizens and diplomats to consider leaving the country. \c\c Italy – On 11 February 2022, in Riga to meet his Latvian counterpart, Artis Pabriks, the Italian defence minister Lorenzo Guerini called for "a constructive dialogue" with Russia to ease tensions. \c\c Japan – Prime Minister of Japan Kishida Fumio said he and Biden would work closely to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine and "keep close contact with other allies and partners and continue communicating on the point that any attack will be met with strong action." In a tweet, Biden said it was "an honor to meet with Prime Minister Kishida to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan Alliance — the cornerstone of peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the world." On 11 February 2022, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised its travel warning for Ukraine to the highest level, advising Japanese citizens to leave Ukraine immediately and avoid travelling there under any circumstance. \c\c Moldova – President of Moldova Maia Sandu declared on an interview that the Moldovan authorities were looking closely into the situation in Ukraine and that certain measures were being taken to prepare for potential outcomes of the crisis. She also demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from Transnistria, a breakaway territory legally and internationally considered as part of Moldova. Sandu also called for calm to the citizens of Moldova in the face of the developments in Ukraine and expressed her confidence in the possibility of a diplomatic solution. Later, Sandu met with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte and discussed with him the tensions in the Russia–Ukraine border. During the meeting, Rutte expressed his support for Moldova's territorial integrity in regards to Transnistria. \c\c NATO – One of the Russian government's security demands forwarded to the United States and NATO in December 2021 was that NATO stop expanding eastwards, specifically never admit Georgia as well as Ukraine. NATO had repeatedly called upon Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and condemned Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and support of separatists in eastern Donbas, calling for a resolution of the Donbas conflict via the Minsk agreements. In December 2021, as Russia continued a military buildup on Ukraine's borders, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly met with Ukrainian leaders to reaffirm the alliance's support for Ukraine, to call upon NATO members to enhance delivery of defensive weapon systems to Ukraine, and to counter Russian disinformation. NATO and the U.S. have re-affirmed NATO's "open door" policy, maintaining that countries should freely choose whether to join NATO or not. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on 13 January 2022 said: "No one else has the right to try to veto or interfere in that process. And this is about fundamental principles for European security. It's about the right for every nation to choose their own path." In an interview, Stoltenberg re-affirmed NATO's "dual track" approach to Russia, saying, "We are ready to engage in dialogue with Russia, but we will never compromise on core principles for European security....Russia has a choice to either engage in dialogue with NATO and Western allies or choose confrontation. We need to be clear-eyed about the prospect that Russia will — once again — use military force against Ukraine. We will provide support to Ukraine to enable them to strengthen their ability to defend themselves." On 24 January 2022, Jens Stoltenberg, noting a number of NATO countries′ announcements regarding ongoing or upcoming deployments, said, "I welcome Allies contributing additional forces to NATO. NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance."\c\c New Zealand – On 12 February 2022, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nanaia Mahuta stated that the New Zealand Government was concerned about the Russian military buildup on the Ukrainian border and supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. She urged New Zealand citizens in Ukraine to evacuate while commercial means were still available. She called on Russia to reduce tensions in accordance with international law. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern echoed Mahuta's remarks, stating that New Zealand was considering applying targeted sanctions against Moscow. \c\c Poland – Polish President Andrzej Duda announced that Ukraine can count on Polish support if Russia attacks, and called for a unified stance in Europe. On 21 January, the head of National Security Bureau Paweł Soloch stated that "supporting Ukraine is one of the key priorities of President Andrzej Duda's policy", while Duda and Zelensky discussed the possibility of further Polish and NATO defensive equipment deliveries. \c\c Romania – The Minister of National Defence of Romania, Vasile Dîncu, said that, in the event of a new Russian–Ukrainian war, Romania would not be militarily involved and that it would remain in a strategic relationship with NATO and react together with the alliance in the face of such a hypothetical case. Furthermore, the President of Romania Klaus Iohannis urged the Romanian Armed Forces to be prepared for any aggression in the region, stating that the situation in Ukraine showed that measures of modernization and preparation of the Romanian military were necessary. Iohannis also called for a greater presence of NATO, the United States and other allies in the Black Sea region as a result of the tensions between Russia and Ukraine. \c\c Slovakia – The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia, Ivan Korčok, stated that the ceasefire and the announcement of an increase in Russia's military power on the border with Ukraine are a matter of concern and call for de-escalation of tensions. \c\c Spain – On 20 January 2022, Spain started deploying aircraft, ships and NATO forces to Bulgaria. \c\c  Switzerland – On 21 January 2022, Switzerland continued to facilitate direct negotiations between Russia and the United States to avert an armed confrontation in Eastern Europe. Swiss President Ignazio Cassis explained during a press conference in Geneva "Switzerland is concerned over growing tensions. We are totally convinced that dialogue is the only way to reinforce security in Europe". \c\c Taiwan – On 28 January 2022, President Tsai Ing-Wen instructed the National Security Council to establish a task force monitoring events in Ukraine. She compared Russia's military buildup to China's repeated invasion of Taiwan's ADIZ, stating that "Taiwan has faced military threats and intimidation from China for a long time. Therefore, we empathize with Ukraine's situation, and we also support the efforts of all parties to maintain regional security," and pleading for peaceful dialogue. \c\c United Kingdom – The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, during a telephone conversation with President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that his country was concerned about Russia's activities in the occupied Crimea and on the border with Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said that "there is a very significant risk Russia will invade Ukraine" and urged Putin to "step back from the brink". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss wrote on Twitter that the UK "will not tolerate Kremlin plot to install pro-Russian leadership in Ukraine." Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the Chief of the Defence Staff, warned that "a full invasion of Ukraine would be on a scale not seen in Europe since World War Two." On 7 February 2022, Johnson said Britain would not "flinch" as he prepared to deploy Royal Marines, RAF aircrafts, and Royal Navy warships to eastern Europe. British citizens were being told by the Foreign Office to evacuate while commercial means were still available. \c\c United States – On 2 April 2021, President Biden had his first telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On 13 April, Biden had a telephone call with Russian president Putin; Biden "emphasized the United States\' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"; Biden also voiced U.S. concern "over the sudden Russian military build-up in occupied Crimea and on Ukraine's borders, and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions." In mid-April 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, along with the EU, UK, Australia, and Canada, sanctioned eight individuals and entities "associated with Russia's ongoing occupation and repression in Crimea." On 19 January 2022, President Biden said that he believed Russia would invade Ukraine. Biden said a full-scale invasion of Ukraine would be "the most consequential thing that's happened in the world in terms of war and peace" since World War II. On 22 January 2022, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv requested the evacuation of non-essential personnel along with their families by the United States Department of State. The State Department issued an advisory not to travel to Ukraine or Russia, citing ongoing tension along the Russia–Ukraine border and COVID-19. On 10 February 2022, Joe Biden urged all American citizens in Ukraine to leave immediately and ruled out the option of  sending U.S. troops to rescue Americans in the country, the State Department issuing an advisory that the U.S. “will not be able to evacuate U.S. citizens in the event of Russian military action anywhere in Ukraine”. \c\c  Vatican City – On 23 January 2022, Pope Francis said, "I am following with concern the rising tensions that threaten to inflict a new blow to peace in Ukraine, and call into question the security of the European continent, with even wider repercussions". \c\cInternational Energy Agency – IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said that conflict between Russia and Ukraine "would [have] major implications" on the natural gas prices, "if not leading to turmoil". \c\cAnonymous (hacker group) – The decentralised hacking group had dedicated some of their defacements of websites such as those of belonging to the United Nations and the Polar Research Institute of China, to promote proposals in order to defuse the crisis, including by calling for the creation of a "neutral grouping" of countries "wedged between NATO and Russia" that would include Ukraine, Finland, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova. Anonymous argued that the so-called "neutral security belt" could serve as an alliance similar to NATO or the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) that acts as a cordon sanitaire between NATO and CSTO countries in order to "assuage Russia's fears without NATO losing its face". Furthermore, they embedded Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft senior fellow Anatol Lieven's paper "Ending the Threat of War in Ukraine" at the defacement page and called for a referendum on whether to presumably follow the existing Minsk Protocol or hand over the separatist-controlled territories to a UN peacekeeping administration. Later, a second referendum in the separatist regions would then ask voters to choose to reunite with Ukraine, gain independence, or join Russia. \c\c Belarusian opposition – On 24 January, Belarusian hacktivists stated that they had disrupted Belarusian Railway "servers, databases and workstations" using ransomware, while leaving automation and security systems in place. They promised to decrypt the systems provided that 50 political prisoners were released and that Russian soldiers were prevented from entering Belarus. Dzmitry Bandarenka, coordinator of the European Belarus civil campaign, told Charter 97 on 26 January 2022, that he believed that in the event of Russian aggression, tens of thousands of Belarusians would fight against the Russian Federation on Ukraine's side and defend their country's independence. \c\cMetropolis of Bessarabia – Representants of the Romanian Orthodox Metropolis of Bessarabia in Moldova announced that this institution was closely looking at the situation at the borders of Ukraine.

On 12 February, two thousand people protested in Kyiv to show unity in opposition to the threat of a further Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Operation Unifier, also known as Canadian Armed Forces Joint Task Force-Ukraine, is the Canadian Armed Forces contribution to the security of Ukraine in coordination with the Ukrainian Armed Forces. It also includes a small Swedish contingent. It was begun in light of fomentation by the of separatist sentiments in the Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimean regions of Ukraine after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. \c\cThe operation is part of Multinational Joint Commission, a larger body composed of the U.S., UK, Canada, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and Denmark aimed at reforming Ukraine's military. The first Canadian troops to participate in the operation come from the 1st Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment. The Canadian contribution of training is provided by about 200 Canadian soldiers, rotating every 6 months, increased to 260 in January 2022. As of November 2018 there have been 230 course sessions and more than 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained under Operation Unifier. Since 2018, a small Swedish contingent also operates within the framework. In December 2021, three Swedish officers were in Ukraine within the framework of Operation Unifier. \c\cCanada made its first delivery of non-lethal military equipment to Ukraine on November 28, 2014. This equipment mainly included cold protective clothing and was delivered to Boryspil International Airport by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). On December 8, 2015, the Minister of National Defence of Canada, Harjit Sajjan, announced that his country has signed an agreement with Ukraine for joint military training and for strengthening its military capabilities.[citation needed] On January 10, 2015, the first shipment of non-lethal military equipment to Ukraine by sea arrived at the port of Odessa. On April 14, 2015, Canada announced the deployment of a CAF task force, known as Joint Task Force Ukraine or Operation Unifier, with nearly 200 Canadian Armed Forces stationed in Ukraine until March 31, 2017. The military training mission officially began on 14 September 2015 at the International Center for Security and Peacekeeping in Starychi and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense Demining Center in Kamianets-Podilskyi. \c\cOn February 13, 2022, the Canadian Armed Forces announced that the operation would be temporarily suspended due to the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis, with most of the units involved being sent to Poland. Canada has assured Ukraine that the withdrawal is only temporary. \c\cOn March 6, 2017, the Government of Canada announced the extension of Operation Unifier until the end of March 2019. \c\cOn March 18, 2019, the Government of Canada announced the extension of Operation Unifier until the end of March 2022. \c\cOn January 26, 2022, the Government of Canada announced the extension of Operation Unifier until the end of March 2025, and increased the complement of 200 by another 60. \c\cAccording to lobbyists from the NATO Association of Canada, Operation Unifier's broader mission includes:\c\cHelping the development of the region\c\cMaintaining Security\c\cMaintaining Democracy\c\cProviding Humanitarian Aid\c\cPromoting economic stability and growth\c\cLieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Troop (October 2019-28 April 2020)\c\cLieutenant Colonel Ryan Simpson (28 April 2020-)\c\cLieutenant Colonel Sarah Heer (since 6 October 2020)\c\cMembers of the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada positively welcomed the Canadian government's contribution to reform the Ukrainian military. A number of community appreciation events were held in Toronto, Edmonton and Winnipeg for CAF members who have served in Operation Unifier. On July 1, 2018, the Band of the Ceremonial Guard performed during its daily guard mounting ceremony on Parliament Hill, a Ukrainian military march known as "Shchob shabli ne braly, shchob Kuli mynaly" (Щоб шаблі не брали, щоб кулі минали) in front of members of the Ukrainian diaspora during the ceremony, as a sort of response to the operation.
Freedom Convoy (French: Convoi de la Liberté) is a series of ongoing protests and blockades in Canada against COVID-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions. The convoy was originally created to protest vaccine mandates for crossing the United States border, but later evolved into a protest about COVID-19 restrictions in general. Beginning January 22, hundreds of vehicles formed convoys from several points and traversed Canadian provinces before converging on Ottawa on January 29, 2022, with a rally at Parliament Hill. The vehicular convoys were then joined by thousands of pedestrian protesters. Several offshoot protests have blockaded provincial capitals and border crossings with the United States. \c\cThe protests are ongoing as of February 13, 2022[update], and protesters have stated that they will not leave until all COVID-19 restrictions and mandates have been repealed. Officials have expressed concern about the economic impact of border blockades. On February 11, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency, introducing new legal sanctions on the impediment of trade routes, highways, airports, ports, bridges and railways. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and United States President Joe Biden spoke on February 11 to discuss ending blockades at the border. \c\cIn the fall of 2021, both Canada and the United States accommodated unvaccinated cross-border truckers exempting them from COVID-19 vaccine requirements, to prevent exacerbating existing supply chain disruptions. The exemptions for Canadian truckers ended on January 15, 2022, and the United States exemption ended on January 22, 2022. Of the 120,000 Canadian licensed truck drivers who regularly serve cross-border routes, approximately 85 per cent were already vaccinated against COVID-19 by January.  An estimated 12,000 to 16,000 of these Canadian truckers who are unvaccinated will not be able to work cross-border routes but they can continue to run routes within Canada, as these new mandates do not impact domestic trucking. \c\cThe convoy has been condemned by trucking industry and labour groups. The Canadian Trucking Alliance (CTA) stated that most protesters had no connection to trucking. Protesters were seen drinking and dancing on the National War Memorial and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and a Terry Fox statue was defaced and later cleaned. Officials have raised concerns of some protesters\' involvement with far-right extremist groups, including those who promote violence; some have called for the federal government of Canada to be overthrown. Some sources have called the ongoing protests an occupation or a siege. \c\cThe January 15 enforcement of the vaccination requirement applies to truckers who are entering Canada at international border crossings. Since January 15, unvaccinated American cross-border truckers have been denied entry into Canada. Canadian truckers who are not fully vaccinated "have to show proof of a negative PCR test collected within 72 hours of arriving at the border"; they also "need to quarantine after arrival". \c\cUnvaccinated Canadian truckers can still work in Canada, unless their individual employer requires vaccination. As of January 5, the federal government had announced plans for a vaccine mandate for federally-regulated domestic fleets that cross provincial borders. At that time no final date was set for those rules. \c\cA reciprocal vaccination requirement for the cross-border trucking industry has been in place since January 22, when the United States enforced theirs, affecting unvaccinated American truckers returning to the United States. Unvaccinated Canadian truckers are denied entry to the United States. \c\cOf the total number of 160,000 licensed truck drivers who serve cross-border routes, 120,000 are Canadian and 40,000 are American. Of the 120,000 Canadian truckers,  Canadian Trucking Alliance (CTA) estimates that 85% are already vaccinated against COVID-19, and that "as many as 12,000 to 16,000" Canadian truckers may not may not be able to work those cross-border routes because they are unvaccinated. In total, including the potential American cross-border truckers, these mandates could result in 26,000 of the 160,000 drivers in both countries who have been regularly running cross-border routes, losing that privilege. \c\cAmanda Lang, said in her February 11, Bloomberg News, interview with Canadian Labour Minister, Seamus O\'Regan, that "a lot of the mandates being protested here are [not federal but] provincial mandates".  O\'Regan clarified that " jurisdiction is clearly laid out in our Constitution" which describes the separation of powers and jurisdictional mandates and authority at federal, provincial and territorial levels. \c\cIn late November 2021 during the fifth wave of the global COVID-19 pandemic—the highly-contagious Omicron variant doubled in less than two days, resulting in an extremely high number of patients (mainly the unvaccinated) requiring hospital care.  In his Bloomberg News interview, O\'Regan said that Canadians were already tired after two years of the pandemic,  with some even struggling; Christmas lockdowns prevented many family reunions, yet most Canadians followed health protocols. There were only 13% of Canadians who were unvaccinated as of January 12. In the province of Quebec, the unvaccinated accounted for 50% of hospitalizations by February 7. Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, reported that the average daily case count had increased by 65% since the previous week, "with a daily average of 42,000 new cases". Some provincial and territorial governments imposed "tougher lockdowns" to attempt to slow the spread. By the time cases began to decline in late January, an estimated 20% to 25% of Canadians had been infected.  In January, the number of new Omicron infections had peaked, according to a February 4 Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) announcement. In a February 11 update, federal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos alongside Dr. Tam, said that the worst was behind us, most new cases were community-driven, and cross-border restrictions were less effective. Duclos said there will be an update on health restrictions next week. \c\cA January 27, 2022 CTV News explainer provided an update on current "vaccine mandates and public health restrictions" across Canada as background for the convoy. These mandates and restrictions "fall under provincial and territorial jurisdiction" and most are "not federal responsibilities". Regulations regarding international borders are reciprocal; they are enacted and enforced by both countries who share the border, involving federal agencies including Transport Canada, and in the United States, Homeland Security and CDC. \c\cUnder the Constitution Act, health is the responsibility of the provinces and territories; the federal government transfers public funds to the provinces and territories to ensure Medicare is universally accessible. COVID-19-related responses, including those related to vaccinations, like all healthcare in Canada under the Canada Health Act, are the responsibility of provinces and territories who provide free health services in their own jurisdictions. There were no mandates or passports until the fourth wave when the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spread rapidly across Canada. By mid-August 2021 there was an emerging patchwork of vaccine mandates, including those implemented by private facilities. As most of the deaths caused by COVID-19 at that time were among seniors, private long-term care facilities began to mandate vaccinations for staff by late August. In the first lawsuit against an employer who mandated vaccinations, on November 9, 2021, the Arbitrator, Von Veh, upheld the company's mandatory vaccination policy, and dismissed the grievance.  At the federal level, dialogues were undertaken with other Group of Seven nations, the World Health Organization, and the International Civil Aviation Organization regarding passports—"reliable and secure" "proof of vaccination credentials". \c\cThe organizers of the original mid-January crowdsourced fundraising campaign, "Freedom Convoy", on GoFundMe—first, Tamara Lich, and later Benjamin (Ben). J. Dichter, who are not long-haul truckers— described the goal of the truck convoy from all across Canada to the nation's capital, as a demonstration against the newly implemented January 15 federal cross-border COVID-19 vaccine mandate, targeting long-haul truck drivers, according to a January 28, 2022 CTV News article. \c\cThese new United States Department of Homeland Security regulations, released in October 2021, were regarding cross-border travel between the Canada and the United States and were based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To prevent supply chain disruptions, the DHS allowed for a window of four months—until January 22, 2022—for Canadian truckers to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19. On November 19, 2021, the Public Health Agency of Canada announced upcoming adjustments to Canada's border measures. This would include the requirement for essential service providers, including truck drivers, to be fully vaccinated after January 15, 2022. The announcement clarified that unvaccinated or partially vaccinated foreign national truck drivers would be prohibited from entering Canada after that date. Unvaccinated Canadian truck drivers could enter Canada but would have to quarantine for two weeks. According to the Canadian Press and CBC, as of January 22, the mandates would impact an estimated 26,000 unvaccinated truckers of the 160,000 truck drivers  who regularly cross the border in both the United States and Canada. When asked in the House of Commons to produce data linking truckers to COVID-19 infections in Canada, neither the minister of health Jean-Yves Duclos nor the chief public health officer Theresa Tam were able to do so. \c\cA October 21, 2021, federal briefing said that the provinces and territories—who hold all of the vaccination information—are responsible for providing the vaccine passport that Canadians needed to travel internationally, using "existing provincial proof of vaccination systems". By 2022, all provinces and territories had "vaccine passports with the QR code that meets the recommended Canadian standard for domestic and international travel". There is no federal mandate for COVID-19 vaccines in Canada. With healthcare capacity spread "too thin" during the "rising fifth wave driven by the Omicron variant" in early January 2022, federal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos's suggestion of mandatory COVID-19 vaccines was rejected by Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, whose government had removed the "power of mandatory vaccination from the province's Public Health Act, to ensure there could not be a vaccine mandate. \c\cSince October 29, proof of vaccination has been mandatory for employees of federal public services and federally-regulated industries including banking. By early January, in these public sectors, those "without proof, or an exemption on medical or religious grounds, has been put on unpaid leave". Since the end of October, Canadians who wish to travel domestically on cruise ships or by VIA Rail trains have been required to prove they are fully vaccinated or have a negative COVID-19 tests. \c\cThe protest calls for the end of vaccine mandates in Canada during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Freedom Convoy's spokesperson Ben Dichter stated on Fox News that "We want to get rid of the vaccine mandates and the (vaccine) passports. And that passport, that's the really concerning one". \c\cAs the convoy reached Ontario, it began to expand from its original goals. Several protesters voiced opposition to perceived authoritarianism and corruption by Justin Trudeau, stating they wanted him "out of office", while others said: "This is not an anti-vaccination movement, this is a freedom movement". Jason LaFace, Canada Unity's Ontario organizer for the convoy, has stated that the intent of the protest is to dissolve the government. Many of the restrictions that the protesters object to are provincial jurisdiction. \c\cOne of the main organizers behind the convoy, Canada Unity (CU), acknowledged that they had planned to submit their signed "memorandum of understanding" (MoU) to the Senate of Canada and Governor General Mary Simon, described in the MoU as the "SCGGC". The MoU which was signed by James and Sandra Bauder and Martin Brodmann, was posted on the Canada Unity website in mid-December 2021 and publicly available until its February 8 retraction. Bauder, whose name is at the top of a CTV News\' list of "major players" in the convoy, is the founder of Canada Unity. CTV cited Bauder saying that he hoped the signed MoU would convince Elections Canada to trigger an election, which is not constitutionally possible. In this pseudolegal document, CU called on the "SCGGC" to cease all vaccine mandates, reemploy all employees terminated due to vaccination status, and rescind all fines imposed for non-compliance with public health orders. If this failed, the MoU called on the "SCGGC" to dissolve the government, and name members of the CU to form a Canadian Citizens Committee (CCC), which is beyond the constitutional powers of either the Governor General or the Senate. The original MoU contained no specific mention of cross-border truckers as it had originally been drafted and delivered over a month earlier, but then was reissued for the protest. By February 8, there were 320,089 of the 1,000,000 signatures on the MoU Canada Unity had hoped for. A February 8 article in The Guardian, on how the convoy was the result of an "unrivaled coordination" between QAnon, conspiracy theorists, anti-vax, anti-government organizations", including Bauder's vow that the protesters would remain until all their demands were met. Organizers felt a groundswell of fresh support for the MoU could trigger a new federal election, and investigations into Prime Minister Trudeau. When questioned in a February 3 Power & Politics interview by a CBC reporter, on whether he would negotiate with the core organizers knowing purpose as stated in the MoU, Conservative MP Kevin Waugh dismissed the MoU as "nonsense" saying the organizers are "frustrated like many Canadians in this country". It did not mention truckers, and was initially sent to the Senate and Simon on Dec. 11. Canada Unity now says it is immediately withdrawing the memo, adding it firmly supports the Constitution and democratic processes. \c\cTom Marazzo, a self-declared spokesperson for the protest and an ex-military officer, held a press conference on February 7, proposing the formation of a coalition with the Conservatives, NDP, and Bloc Quebecois. He described Trudeau as having "a 22-calibre mind and a 357 world". \c\cOn February 10, leaders of the Freedom Convoy declared February 11 an "orange shirt day" and called for student walkouts to end COVID-19 restrictions in schools. Indigenous leaders condemned this announcement as appropriation. \c\cOn Day 15, February 11, Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in Ontario as protesters continued to occupy the Ambassador Bridge, while Ford referred to the situation in downtown Ottawa as a "siege". By February 12, police had cleared trucks from the bridge, with busloads of police, some with heavy weapons, and an armoured vehicle. \c\cThe first convoy departed Prince Rupert on January 22, arriving in Prince George in the evening. The following day, another convoy left from Delta with supporters gathering along Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway. \c\cOn January 24, a convoy drove through Regina, Saskatchewan, and was greeted by supporters. According to police in Regina, about 1,200 vehicles reached the city. On January 25, another convoy passed through Kenora, Ontario, where Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) in contact with the convoy stated that 200–300 vehicles would be passing through Kenora. The convoys consisted of three main routes across Canada, which would converge for the Ottawa protest on the weekend. The Ottawa Police Service estimated up to 2,000 demonstrators in the city on the weekend. \c\cAs of January 26, the OPP estimated approximately 400 vehicles had entered Ontario from the Manitoba border as part of the eastbound convoy. The Kingston Police estimated approximately 300 vehicles (17 full tractor-trailers, 104 tractors without trailers, 424 passenger vehicles and six RVs) to go through Kingston. \c\cOn January 27, winter weather closed a portion of Highway 17, (the main route of the Trans-Canada) in northern Ontario, causing the eastbound convoy to be divided. Some of the truckers continued on to Sault Ste. Marie, while others diverted to Highway 11 (a northern branch of the TCH) and drove toward Cochrane. \c\cTruckers from the Maritime provinces planned to meet in Moncton before departing for Ottawa. On the morning of January 27, supporters gathered in Enfield, Nova Scotia where fireworks were set off as 10 to 15 trucks departed for the New Brunswick border. RCMP in PEI reported that approximately 70 trucks and supporters\' vehicles crossed the Confederation Bridge into New Brunswick, but that most immediately turned around and returned to the island. About 24 trucks reportedly passed through Fredericton in the afternoon, bound for Ottawa. On January 27, one convoy group passed through the Greater Toronto Area. Hundreds of protesters gathered at highway overpasses in support of the convoy. \c\cOn January 28, a convoy was seen passing through Quebec. About 600 convoy vehicles were expected to stay the night in Arnprior before heading to Parliament Hill the following morning. \c\cOn January 28, the province of Nova Scotia banned gatherings along highways, specifically on the Trans-Canada (Highway 104) between the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick border, in relation to protests related to the freedom convoy. \c\cVarious images of specific acts during January 29 received wide condemnation. Protesters were seen drinking and dancing on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the National War Memorial. Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre described it as a desecration, and the Royal Canadian Legion condemned the actions. A statue of cancer fundraiser Terry Fox was decorated with an upside-down Canadian flag and a protest sign. The Terry Fox Foundation said Fox "believed in science and gave his life to help others". Images of a Canadian flag marked with a swastika were seen, as were two Confederate flags. The statue was cleaned later by other protesters. The man with the Confederate flag was later forced out by other protesters, who said "Now he's going. Now he's gone. We called him out. He knows. He's gonna hold his head in shame now". Some protesters harassed volunteers at a local soup kitchen, the Shepherds of Good Hope, demanding free food intended for Ottawa's homeless population. The kitchen tweeted: "One member of our shelter community was assaulted by protesters. A security guard went to his aid and was threatened and called racial slurs." Its press release said trucks were towed after blocking its ambulance drop-off zone for around half a day. \c\cA video circulated showing protesters appropriating First Nations drumming while dancing, drinking beer, and chanting "yabba dabba doo" and "fuck Trudeau". Senator and Mi\'kmaq leader Brian Francis tweeted: "I am disgusted, appalled and saddened. This blatant act of racism must be vehemently condemned by all. Drumming is sacred to all First Nations. Our ways of life should never be mimicked, mocked and appropriated for political or other gain." The Algonquins of Pikwàkanagàn First Nation, whose traditional unceded territory includes the city of Ottawa, issued a statement condemning protesters who held an Indigenous pipe ceremony and set up a tepee in the city's Confederation Park without the First Nation's permission on February 2. \c\cA Globe and Mail article entitled "Officials condemn \'desecration\' of monuments, hateful signs on display at trucker convoy protest" also described the January 29 protest as having a "party-like atmosphere" with some handing out coffee, cookies, "drinking beer and smoking marijuana". Ottawa Police reported de-escalating multiple "high-risk situations" making no arrests. \c\cThe Canadian Trucking Alliance commented on January 29 that many of the supporters at the protest in Ottawa had no direct connection to the trucking industry. \c\cOn January 30, Ottawa Police launched a criminal investigation into the desecration of the National War Memorial and statue of Terry Fox. They will also be investigating "threatening/illegal/intimidating behaviour" toward police officers, workers and other private citizens. Also on January 30, OPS Chief of Police Peter Sloly said: "I think the only thing we can say for sure we\'re still going to be dealing with some level of traffic disruption and demonstration over the next 24 hours."\c\cA press conference was held at an undisclosed location, open only to invited right-wing outlets. \c\cThe House of Commons resumed on January 31, after the holiday break. \c\cOn January 31, Ottawa Paramedics announced that protesters had thrown rocks at an ambulance over the course of the weekend and called paramedics racial slurs. Paramedics had treated 19 people over the course of the weekend, mostly due to alcohol-related intoxication. \c\cOn the afternoon of January 31, Sloly said that "The situation of the demonstration has scaled down over the last 12 hours" and that "We want that trend to continue until this demonstration comes to a complete end. I cannot guarantee you that right now but I can guarantee that every effort at negotiation, coordination, de-escalation, has continued throughout the last four days and will continue until the complete end of this demonstration."\c\cOn February 1, large downtown Ottawa amenities like Rideau Centre and the National Arts Centre continued to stay closed due to security concerns. Ottawa police set up a hotline for hate-motivated crimes to be reported. On the night of February 1, Ottawa Police said that about 250 protesters remained around and on Parliament Hill. \c\cOn February 2, organizers of the protest said that they would not leave Ottawa until governments across Canada "end all mandates associated with COVID-19" and will stay "as long as it takes for freedom to be restored". \c\cOn February 3, the protesters started building a wooden structure in Confederation Park and gathering fuel supplies. Social media reports suggested that the structure is intended to serve as a community kitchen for the protesters. \c\cSome Ottawa residents planned a counter-protest on February 5. \c\cOn February 6, Ottawa Police promised to increase enforcement on protesters, including handing out tickets and arresting anyone who attempts to bring material aid, such as fuel, to protesters. A state of emergency was declared by the City of Ottawa on the same day. In a statement, the city said that its declaration "reflects the serious danger and threat to the safety and security of residents posed by the ongoing demonstrations and highlights the need for support from other jurisdictions and levels of government". Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson described the situation as "the most serious emergency our city has ever faced". \c\cOn the evening of February 6, Police performed a raid on a stockpile hub of supplies for protesters, seizing fuel and making two arrests for mischief. \c\cAn emergency debate of the House of Commons was held on the night of February 7, at the request of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. Trudeau stated that the convoy is "trying to blockade our economy, our democracy and our fellow citizens\' daily lives. It has to stop." Transport minister Omar Alghabra used the debate to encourage Ontario Premier Doug Ford to use regulatory powers to discourage the occupation, such as suspending commercial licenses or insurance of the truckers. \c\cAs of February 7, the Children's Aid Society (CAS) was working with the OPS to ensure the welfare and safety of the children who are living in about 25% of the 418 convoy trucks, according to Ottawa Police Deputy Chief Steve Bell. Concerns were raised about sanitation, noise levels, and fumes. \c\cBy February 9, people with police, military and survivalist experiennce had helped the protesters set up camp with tents and wooden kitchens, creating a supply chain to ensure continued protest. The logistic centre at the Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Park (RCGP) baseball stadium includes trailers of food, tents, toilets and distribution points for gasoline and propane. The Freedom Convoy's head of security and spokesman is Daniel Bulford, a former RCMP officer who served on Prime Minister Trudeau's security detail. Police on Guard, a Facebook group of about 100 police officers, mainly retired, and 50 soldiers endorse the convoy.  Two serving members of the Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2) are under investigation for alleged involvement. \c\cBy day 14, February 10, the newest tactic was "convoy circles". Ottawa-Centre MPP Joel Harden noted that a "convoy organizer" had been encouraging protesters to form them around public schools in Ottawa. A group of about 60 convoy vehicles headed to the Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport at 8 a.m., slow-circling it, honking and blocking traffic until about 10 a.m., then returned to their Coventry Road, one of  three Ottawa protest encampments. Chief Stoly said many "vexatious calls" from the United States to 911 flooded the system and endangered lives. \c\cIn counter-protests on February 12, thousands of people joined the "Community Solidarity March" through Ottawa. On February 13, hundreds of counter-protesters successfully kettled the eastern artery of the "Blue Collar Convoy" for eight hours at the intersection of Riverside Drive and Bank Street, preventing them from reaching downtown. The convoy vehicles left one at a time under a heavy police escort after the vehicle owners took down their signs and flags. \c\cMayor Watson sent a letter to Tamara Lich and Keith Wilson to negotiate terms with protesters. On February 13 afternoon, Mayor Watson's Office said that they had reached an agreement with protesters limiting the protest perimeter to "Wellington Street, between Elgin Street and the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway" to "reduce pressure on residents and businesses". Truckers will leave residential neighbourhoods. \c\cOn February 14, Trudeau met with his Liberal caucus and discussed invoking the Emergencies Act, which would give police extraordinary powers to handle the ongoing protests. The Emergencies Act replaced the former War Measures Act, which was famously invoked by Trudeau's father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, to quell the 1970 October Crisis. \c\cOn January 29, the date that the Freedom Convoy arrived in Ottawa, a group of truckers blockaded the Sweetgrass–Coutts Border Crossing—one of the busiest ports of entry west of the Great Lakes which connects Sweet Grass, Montana, via U.S. Interstate 15 with the village of Coutts, Alberta, via Alberta Highway 4. The United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is located at this crossing, making it the principal port of entry for Alberta's large meat industry, and one of three main points where all meat products from the rest of western Canada cross the border, according to the Canadian Meat Council. The group of around 100 protesters demanded an end to all COVID-19 restrictions. The blockade, which extended about 2 km (1.2 mi) into Canada, also blocked public and emergency vehicle access to the village of Coutts, prompting condemnation from the town's mayor. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney called the blockade illegal, and threatened that protesters would face penalties under the province's Critical Infrastructure Defence Act. \c\cAlberta RCMP initially negotiated with protesters for a peaceful end to the blockade, and protesters agreed to release about 50 vehicles trapped on Highway 4 and U.S. Interstate 15. On February 1, police ceased negotiations and demanded that protesters leave the highway, and set up a police roadblock on Highway 4 about 20 km (12 mi) north of Coutts. A few vehicles left, most remained, and several incidents of violence against police and civilians were reported, including protesters ramming RCMP vehicles. Some vehicles wanting to join the blockade evaded the RCMP roadblock by driving through a ditch and drove south in the highway's northbound lanes, resulting in a head-on collision. \c\cOn February 12, due to ongoing protests, CBSA suspended all travel at the Coutts border crossing. \c\cProtesters at the Ambassador Bridge, connecting Windsor, Ontario, with Detroit, Michigan, and one of the busiest international border crossings in North America, blockaded the border crossing on February 7. On the evening of February 7, movement at the bridge came to a complete halt. The blockade continued into February 8. On the morning of February 8, officials declared the bridge reopened, but the blockade resumed, pushing trips to the Blue Water Bridge between Sarnia and Port Huron. \c\cSupply shortages caused by the blockade led to work shortages at Ford Motor Company's assembly plants in Oakville and in Lansing, Michigan, and shut down its Windsor plant. Parts manufacturers for Chrysler were also shut down, and on February 10, Toyota revealed that its three Ontario plants could not produce vehicles for the rest of the week. The Bank of Canada warned that the blockade could have a "measurable impact" on the Canadian economy. \c\cThe Windsor-Essex Children's Aid Society condemned protesters for using children as human shields during the protest. \c\cOn February 11, the Ontario Superior Court granted an injunction to remove protesters from the Ambassador Bridge. The injunction was sought by multiple industry groups affected by the blockade including the Automotive Parts Manufacturers\' Association. The same day, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in the province. \c\cA young girl was struck by a car near the scene of the blockades on the evening of February 11. \c\cOn the morning of February 12, aided by Ontario Provincial Police and the RCMP, Windsor Police began to clear out the blockade using new powers. Despite the heavy police presence, by the end of the day on February 12, most protesters remained, although had been pushed much further from the bridge. Police arrested two individuals, towed 7 vehicles and issued 11 tickets. \c\cOn the morning of February 13, joint police forces took control of the area and arrested 12 individuals. 25-30 people had been arrested in total as a result of the blockade. In the late evening of February 13, the Ambassador Bridge had fully reopened. \c\cAn article in The New York Times described the Ottawa Police Service as "vastly outnumbered", and "unprepared for the sophisticated tactics, discipline and logistical abilities of the protesters".  The Ottawa Police Service has 1,500 officers to serve the million residents of the city of Ottawa. During the three weeks of the protest and occupation, only 150 officers were on the streets in "three of the most affected neighborhoods over the course of a day".  Chief Sloly requested an additional 1,800 early on, but by February 13, they had not arrived.  Police experts said that  Sloly, who has been criticized for his response to the protests, had a legitimate problem of "lack of resources...given the unprecedented situation facing Ottawa."[full citation needed] Some officers were "swarmed" while attempting to make an arrest. On the first weekend crowds were estimated at 8,000 to 18,000. On weekdays the number of protesters decreased somewhat. On the weekend of February 11 and 12, there were about 4,000 or 5,000 protesters and partyers in the city's core, on Parliament Hill. Even after a state of emergency was declared by the mayor, officers were outnumbered and unable to enforce injunctions or regulations. The Times said that many analysts have cautioned that some  convoy’s leaders with military or policing backgrounds helped demonstrators strategize and plan under the guidance of people like Tom Quiggin, "proclaimed head of protective intelligence", who had formerly served as an "intelligence officer for the Canadian military, cabinet office and federal police." and has been described as "one of the country's top counter-terrorism experts."\c\cAt a January 31 press conference, Ottawa Police Service (OPS) Chief Peter Sloly described the demonstration as "unique in nature, massive in scale, polarizing in context and dangerous in literally every other aspect of the event itself". He said that starting on January 28 there was a "traffic gridlock" which turned into "traffic chaos" over the next two days as "thousands of vehicles, particularly heavy trucks" arrived in Ottawa. Security forces included police forces from the federal, provincial and municipal levels: the RCMP, Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), Gatineau Police, Sûreté du Québec, London Police Service, Hamilton Police Service, Peel Regional Police, Toronto Police Service, York Regional Police, and Durham Regional Police who worked with the OPS Incident Command System. OPS Chief Sloly advised people to avoid downtown Ottawa during the weekend protest, adding that "we are prepared to investigate, arrest if necessary, charge and prosecute anyone who acts violently or breaks the law in the demonstrations, or in association with the demonstrations". Chief Sloly said that since the scaling down of the demonstration on January 31, the crime prevention teams normally directly providing support in around the core, but who were deployed elsewhere during the height of the protests, have returned to their neighbourhoods. \c\cWith the cost of police service per day estimated at $CDN800,000 a day in policing costs, the Mayor of Ottawa is considering legal action to cover costs. \c\cPatrick McDonell, the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons and Director General of Parliamentary Protective Service (PPS) warned Members of Parliament about possible doxing attempts to discover the addresses of their residences in the Capital Region. The letter further warned MPs not to get involved in any demonstrations, to "go somewhere safe", and to keep all doors locked. McDonell told reporters that Canada has never been so divided—the thousands of people arriving on Parliament Hill in the trucker convoy represents a "symbol of the fatigue" that Canadians are experiencing after two years of COVID. PPS prepared for approximately 10,000 protesters; Wellington Street, which is in front of Parliament Hill was closed to most traffic; some lanes had been "designated specifically" for truckers; and others for emergency vehicles. \c\cOn January 29, the first day of protest at Parliament Hill, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was "moved to an undisclosed location due to security concerns". \c\cThe OPS had called in reinforcements from the RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), and were working to identify threats in the convoy. \c\cAs protesters headed to Ottawa on January 28, the OPP tweeted "OPP advises motorists to avoid travel on Highway 417 and Highway 416 in the Ottawa area, beginning Friday afternoon and on Saturday." They asked that emergency vehicle access be assured throughout. \c\cIn response, Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said that they are in constant contact with provincial and municipal authorities. Because the situation is "critical" for Canada with the "closing of our borders, the targeting on critical infrastructure, particularly our points of entry by the people behind these protests",  it poses a "significant national security threat" to Canada, and we have to "end it".  He said that, "We are prepared to use every tool available to us, including emergency powers and to make sure that we bring every resource of the federal government to bare."\c\cAs an estimated 4,000 protesters converged on Parliament Hill on February 12, the extra reinforcements requested by Chief Sloly a week earlier had not yet arrived. Plans were in place to created a new OPS, RCMP, OPP Integrated Command Centre when the reinforcements arrive next week. \c\cActive investigations are underway for a number of widely publicized incidents including those related to the Unknown Soldier's memorial and the Terry Fox statue as well as for more general incidents, including bribery, threats, assault, dangerous driving, and setting a fire in a building. An OPS hotline has been set up where victims can report crimes, including hate crimes. \c\cChief Sloly warned offenders that if they had come from elsewhere and committed a crime, including hate crime in Ottawa, there have been "intelligence officers, investigative officers, and multi-jurisdictional support" from across Canada at work in the background. He said, that "no matter where you live, no matter where your vehicles are registered ... You will be investigated ... We will look for you. We will charge you, if necessary, will arrest you, and we will pursue prosecutions against you."\c\cOn February 7, some two dozen arrests were made, and nearly 80 criminal investigations have been opened. \c\cIn response to criticism that police had been too soft on "disruptive protesters", on February 1, Chief Sloly said that it was a "measure of success" that there were "no riots, no injuries, no deaths". By February 4, Ottawa Police's response to the protests and later encampments of lingering protesters drew criticism from local residents. Complaints focused around lack of enforcement on noise due to constant horn-honking, disruption of livelihoods and continued gridlock. Police later addressed some concerns by issuing 30 tickets on February 3. \c\cCriticism has also focused on "the sharp contrast between the occupiers\' reception and the ways police forces all over Canada treat Black and Indigenous people, who are violently policed for existing in public space, let alone protesting."\c\cOn February 4, Ottawa Police hired Navigator Ltd, a crisis public relations firm to aid in handling messaging to the public. \c\cBy February 13, on Day 17, federal Minister Blair "urged the police to do their jobs, enforce the law and restore order". By February 13, on Day 17, police enforcement of "layers of laws, injunctions, and emergency orders already in effect" was minimal, which further "emboldened" protesters on Ottawa's downtown core. \c\cAs of February 10, there was general agreement by government and police that vigorous efforts to clear the blockades were dangerous, possibly leading to expanded or violent reactions. A variety of options were legally possible and some, such as issuing tickets, were employed. Tow-truck drivers in several locations declined to tow trucks. \c\cPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, on February 3, declared his reluctance to employ the military to clear the protesters, saying he had received no formal request for military assistance and added, "One has to be very, very cautious before deploying military in situations engaging Canadians," saying it's not something to "enter into lightly". In a conference on February 11, Trudeau promised U.S. President Joe Biden, "quick action."\c\cOn February 11, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in the province. Heavy fines of up to $100,000 and up to a year of imprisonment were introduced for offenses such as blocking or impeding the movement of goods, people, and services along critical roads and bridges in the province, including "international border crossings, 400-series highways, airports, ports, bridges and railways". Penalties include revoking personal and commercial drivers\' licenses. Also on February 11, Prime Minister Trudeau and United States President Joe Biden met virtually to discuss the dissolution of cross-border blockades. \c\cWindsor, Ontario, where the convoy has blocked the Ambassador Bridge, intervened in an action by automobile manufacturers in Superior Court for an injunction. Mayor Drew Dilkens declared his intention to clear the bridge with the assistance of police reinforcements. An injunction was granted February 11 effective 7 p.m. A deadline of midnight was set. Local police were to be employed to clear the bridge. At 9 a.m., police from several Ontario cities, including London, Ontario, were at the bridge in force together with buses and tow trucks, an armored personnel carrier, and a sniper. The Windsor police announced via Twitter that enforcement had begun. Some protestors, after discussion with police, had peacefully departed with their vehicles. The police, from Windsor and 5 other jurisdictions, succeeded in clearing the area of tractor-trailers, but a large crowd gathered in the area; the crowd was peaceful, even festive, singing the national anthem, but the bridge remained closed. The police maintained a strong presence in the area, but did not attempt mass arrests. In the evening one arrest was made. These protests were completely cleared by Febuary 13 at approximately 8 a.m, although the border has not immediately been opened. Some arrests were made. The opening of the bridge was delayed as it remained possible for small groups of protestors to enter and block the roadway. That problem was worked on. The bridge re-opened Sunday evening. 25 to 30 people were arrested and 12 small vehicle seized over the weekend. Concrete barriers and a substantial police presence was relied on to keep the three-mile long access road to the bridge open. \c\cFundraising started on January 14, 2022, access to the bridge. ugh the crowdsourced fundraising platform GoFundMe. Listed as organizers were Tamara Lich, secretary of the western separatist Maverick Party, and B. J. Dichter, a 2015 federal Conservative Party candidate now associated with the People's Party of Canada. The Maverick Party has denied involvement in the convoy and said it was not the recipient of any funds raised. \c\cThe convoy's GoFundMe raised over CA$5 million by January 25. On January 24, GoFundMe responded to questions by CTV News stating funds raised would not be distributed until the fundraising organizers could demonstrate how the funds would be properly distributed. On January 27, GoFundMe released the initial CA$1 million of the funds after the organizers have provided a distribution plan. \c\cOn February 2, GoFundMe flagged the fundraiser for review and paused donations, saying it was investigating to ensure the fundraiser was in compliance with the platform's terms of service. The fundraiser had raised CA$10,096,500 from approximately 120,000 donors. On February 3, a Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security voted to call on GoFundMe officials to testify before the Standing Committee, to respond to concerns about the origin of the funds raised and to ensure they would not be used to "promote extremism". Members of Parliament also called on the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), Canada's financial intelligence agency, to appear before the committee. CBC News reported that a third of the donations were anonymous or used false names, and that commenters on the fundraiser claimed to be from the United States, United Kingdom, and other countries. \c\cOn the evening of February 4, GoFundMe removed the campaign permanently for violating their terms of service. \c\cA convoy fundraiser on the fundraising website GiveSendGo, launched after the GoFundMe removal, attracted over $8.2 million as of February 10. The Attorney General of Ontario sought and was awarded an injunction against GiveSendGo to freeze the funds collected from two campaigns, and prohibit their distribution. \c\cPolitico reported that American far-right commentators Dan Bongino and Ben Shapiro were among those directing support to the Canadian movement's crowdfunding websites. Based on research by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, from January 28 to February 5, a link to the original Freedom Convoy GoFundMe campaign was posted at least two dozen times on 4chan. According to Politico, white supremacist channels on Telegram also repeatedly shared the link. \c\cThe Attorney General of Ontario was granted a Ontario Superior Court of Justice court order on February 10 that froze GiveSendGo funds raised in the two campaigns, "Freedom Convoy 2022"—$US8.4 million and "Adopt-a-Trucker"—over $686,000. The court order binds "any and all parties with possession or control over these donations". GiveSendGo funds go directly to campaign recipients such as The Freedom Convoy campaign, so Canadian banks cannot interfere. The largest donation, which was anonymous, as were six of the other top ten, was  US$215,000. The parliamentary standing committee members, who are investigating Freedom Convoy’s fundraising, voted on February 10 to include a study of the "rise of ideologically motivated extremism". The Standing Committee invited GiveSendGo to testify. \c\cMembers of the convoy have largely used Zello—a push-to-talk-styled audio communications app—to communicate with other drivers and supporters. Their voice channels have been the subject of coordinated disruption from counter-protestors, including users playing the homoerotic country rock song "Ram Ranch" to "troll" participants and listeners. \c\cAccording to the Ottawa Police Chief, crowd estimates ranged from 5,000 to 18,000 protesters on January 29, dwindling to approximately 3,000 demonstrators the following day. On January 31 they estimated a crowd of about 8,000 protesters in Ottawa city, and Ontario Provincial Police recorded 113 trucks and 276 personal vehicles coming into Thunder Bay from Winnipeg. By February 1 they had estimated as little as 250 protesters remained. \c\cVarious media claims (such as the CBC) initially estimated the crowd size on January 29 at 8,000 people. Other media claims, such as The Globe and Mail later estimated between 8,000 and 15,000 people participated in the largest event on January 29. \c\cOn February 9, CNN's Daniel Dale fact-checked numerous claims about the protests in general. Dale echoed the previous claims by police, adding that there was also an estimated 200 vehicles from the Atlantic provinces. \c\cSome Facebook posts claimed as many as 50,000 trucks would be participating in the convoys. On his blog, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity reported that the convoy was made up of 10,000 heavy trucks, and Joe Warmington of the Toronto Sun reported that the event may set a Guinness World Record for the largest truck convoy on record. These claims were grossly exaggerated. Claims that the truck convoy "made the Guinness Book of World Records" are also false; the current record is 480 trucks, set in Cairo, Egypt in 2020, and the Freedom Convoy did not submit an application for an attempt at setting a new record. \c\cIn the lead-up to the planned arrival in Ottawa, it was reported on January 25 that far-right and white supremacist groups were hoping for violence on Parliament Hill akin to the 2021 United States Capitol attack. This has caused organizer Tamara Lich to address convoy members and denounce political violence, saying that protesters should "hold a peaceful protest" instead. Organizers and leaders of the convoy condemned extremist groups, and asked that participants report law breakers to the police. They also stated that any extremists found would be "removed" from the convoy. Despite this, some protesters were photographed waving Confederate or Nazi flags at the rally. On January 28, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed concern that a small group of protesters are going to be posing a threat during the weekend. \c\cOne of the lead organizers of the convoy, James Bauder, has previously stated support for QAnon, endorsed conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and called for the arrest of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for alleged treason. On February 3, 2022, Romana Didulo arrived in Ottawa with supporters. Didulo calls herself the "Queen of Canada" and is a conspiracy theorist linked to QAnon. In November 2021, she called on her 73,000 Telegram followers to shoot healthcare workers. An episode of The Faulkner Focus, hosted by Harris Faulkner, was criticized by The Daily Beast in February 2022 for trying to normalize the protests and anti-vaccine sentiment. The episode said that the protesters were not a fringe minority, but represented the mainstream of society and had international support. The montage of protesters she showed prominently displayed imagery relating to QAnon. \c\cThe Facebook page for the convoy has shared content from and listed as an organizer Wexit co-founder and Yellow Vest Canada organizer Patrick "Pat" King, who has previously hosted counter-protests to anti-racism rallies, spread COVID-19 misinformation, and spread the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. In December 2021, while talking about COVID-19 public health measures, King said "The only way this is going to be solved is with bullets." On February 8, King falsely claimed that "50% of the Ottawa police force have all turned in their resignation today". \c\cTamara Lich, the protest's fundraiser, is Secretary for the Maverick Party, a western separatist group formerly known as Wexit Canada. Lich was previously the regional co-ordinator for Wexit in southeastern Alberta and board member for Wexit Alberta. The Maverick Party denied involvement with the convoy on January 24. \c\cAction 4 Canada, associated with the Canada Unity group inside the Freedom Convoy, is called an [Islamophobia|Islamophobic]] and anti-LGBTQ conspiracy group with webpages about the dangers of political Islam, health consequences of 5G technology and underreporting of adverse vaccine reactions. Founded by Tanya Gaw who actively supported the Yellow Vests protests of 2019. \c\cJason LaFace, Canada Unity's Ontario organizer for the Freedom Convoy is also a main organizer for No More Lockdowns Canada, an anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine mandate organization primarily associated with expelled Ontario MPP Randy Hillier which holds anti-lockdown rallies across Ontario. \c\cBenjamin Dichter, listed as an organizer on the Freedom Convoy GoFundMe page, was a speaker at the inaugural 2019 People's Party of Canada national convention, and claimed political Islam has infiltrated the Conservative Party and is "rotting away at our society like syphilis". \c\cConvoy leader Dave Steenburg and admin of the Convoy Facebook page Jason LaFace had both posted material by Soldiers of Odin, a neo-Nazi vigilante group, on their Facebook pages, LaFace even wearing a SOO jacket. \c\cThe occupation of Ottawa has received considerable attention from media commentators and politicians in the United States, who have been accused of propagating exaggerated claims about the protest, or making unfounded claims about the roles and actions of Canadian authorities and politicians with respect to the protest. \c\cThere is growing evidence that much of the funding and planning behind the protest originated in the United States, leading to speculation that it may be a "dry run" or an attempt to generate momentum for an insurrection within the United States. Ottawa's police chief, Peter Sloly, described a "significant element" of American involvement in the organization and funding of the protest. Many of the anonymous donors participating in the protest's GoFundMe campaign claimed to be from the US. The protest was endorsed by former US president Donald Trump, who, during his time in power, had regularly clashed with Trudeau over policy differences. In response to the convoy, Trump referred to Trudeau as a "far left lunatic" who "has destroyed Canada," and invited protesters to organize on his proposed social network. Various commentators have called the Freedom Convoy an example of Canadian Trumpism. \c\cIn an op-ed for The Globe and Mail, former governor of the Bank of Canada, Mark Carney, strongly criticized the foreign involvement in "the sedition in Ottawa," describing donors as "foreign funders of an insurrection" who had "interfered in our domestic affairs". \c\cSometime before February 7, American authorities arrested a man from Akron, Ohio who had made a bomb threat against the Putnam County sheriff's office in Ottawa, Ohio, as well as a false report that he had been shot. The man revealed that he believed he was calling the headquarters of the Ottawa Police Service. Both law enforcement agencies concluded that the reports were swatting attempts intended to disrupt police activity during the protest. \c\cDuring the weekend protest in Ottawa, the city's COVID-19 wastewater signal indicated a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases, suggesting a possible link between the gathering of protesters and the spread of COVID-19. \c\cJustin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, dismissed the supply chain disruption concerns as unfounded on the basis that most Canadian truckers have been vaccinated. On January 31, Trudeau called the protests an "insult to truth", saying that "we are not intimidated by those who hurl abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless" and "We won\'t give in to those who fly racist flags. We won\'t cave to those who engage in vandalism, or dishonour the memory of our veterans."\c\cOmar Alghabra, the Minister of Transport, said on January 31, that since January 15 when the truck drivers\' vaccine mandate came into effect, the traffic volumes of transport trucks crossing the Canada-U.S. border had not decreased. Compared to the fall of 2021, and based on Statistics Canada's most recent figures, even with a "massive snowstorm, even though it was a U.S. holiday, we had almost 100,000 truckers cross the border". On CTV's January 30 Question Period he said that some voices in the crowd of protestors are "really disturbing and unacceptable" and "must be condemned"; this included those carrying signs with swastikas and Confederate flags, and those who called for the overthrow of the government. On January 24, he described them as a "the small number of far-right, vocal opposition that is polluting" the debate surrounding vaccine mandates. \c\cErin O\'Toole, Leader of the Official Opposition and the Conservative Party as the convoys started, initially declined to support the protest, saying instead that the best way to maintain supply chains is for truckers to get vaccinated. O\'Toole then later said he would meet with the protesters, but would not participate in nor attend their demonstration in Ottawa. O\'Toole tweeted "I support their right to be heard, and I call on Justin Trudeau to meet with these hard-working Canadians to hear their concerns". O\'Toole, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, later condemned the protesters for desecrating the war memorials on Parliament Hill. O\'Toole was ousted on a leadership review on February 2, some party members citing his policy reversals on issues such as his support for the protest. \c\cConservative MPs Candice Bergen, Pierre Poilievre, Andrew Scheer, Garnett Genuis, Martin Shields, Warren Steinley, Jeremy Patzer, and Leslyn Lewis all expressed their support for the convoy and truckers\' movement. Damien Kurek and Michael Cooper attended the rally, serving food. Cooper was further interviewed on television. A person in behind Cooper had an upside-down Canadian flag with a swastika; Cooper says that he was unaware. Bergen, who became interim Conservative leader after Erin O\'Toole's ouster, has privately advocated against dispersing protesters, and insisted in the House that Trudeau extend an "olive branch". Before O\'Toole was removed from the Conservative leadership, Bergen had implored him to support the protestors, saying that "there were good people on both sides", an echo of the phrase made by Donald Trump in regards to the Unite the Right rally in 2017. Bergen asked protesters to go home, on February 10, calling them "patriotic," and noting that her party "will stand up for you" in trying to end pandemic restrictions. \c\cOn February 10, as a third border blockade began in Manitoba, the Conservatives reversed their position supporting the border blockades. Bergen called for the blockades to disperse, "for the sake of the economy", but vowed to continue pushing the governing Liberals to release a clear plan for ending COVID-19 restrictions. \c\cPeople's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier, Ontario Party Leader Derek Sloan, and Independent Ontario MPP Randy Hillier, all ousted Conservatives, expressed support for the convoy protests. The People's Party organized a rally in Waterloo on January 23 supporting the convoy, at which Bernier and Hillier both spoke. Bernier also attended the January 29 event at Parliament Hill, criticizing Erin O\'Toole for not attending. Hillier would later speak at the convoy, stating "this is the hill we die on."\c\cOther Canadian politicians—including Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, and Ottawa City Councillor Catherine McKenney—described the protests as extremist. Mayor of Port Coquitlam Brad West condemned the defacing of Fox's statue during the protest. Doug Ford, the Conservative Premier of Ontario, called the protest in Ottawa "an illegal occupation" and called for an end to the protests. \c\cOn January 29, Scott Moe, Conservative Premier of Saskatchewan, issued a letter in support of the protest. Although repeatedly encouraging vaccination, Moe argued that it would only reduce the chance of severe outcomes, and did not prevent infection or transmission of COVID-19—a statement that was subsequently disputed—and for that reason he did not support the cross-border vaccine mandate, and would lift proof of vaccination requirements in Saskatchewan "in the not too-distant future". \c\cVarious Republican politicians endorsed the Freedom Convoy including U.S. Senator Steve Daines, Rand Paul, U.S. Representatives Jim Banks, Dan Bishop, Lauren Boebert, Ken Buck, Madison Cawthorn, Jim Jordan, Kevin McCarthy, Chip Roy, Steve Scalise, Governor Ron DeSantis, Ted Cruz, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former U.S. President Donald Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. \c\cFormer United States Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman criticized American groups\' support and funding of the protests. \c\cIn their February 7 statement, Teamsters Canada, representing more than 55,000 professional drivers, including approximately 15,000 long-haul truck drivers, of whom 90 percent are vaccinated, said that the protest "serves to delegitimize the real concerns of most truck drivers today". The statement said that the convoy and "the despicable display of hate led by the political right and shamefully encouraged by elected conservative politicians does not reflect the values of Teamsters Canada."\c\cOn January 25, the Canadian Trucking Alliance (CTA), a truckers\' trade association and the federal government issued a formal statement reinforcing the use of vaccinations, along with other public health measures, to protect Canadian health care and to reduce COVID-19 risk. In the statement the CTA and the government committed to working together to respond to supply chain constraints. A January 29 CTA statement cautioned the public that a "great number of protestors" have no connection to the trucking industry and "have a separate agenda beyond a disagreement over cross border vaccine requirements". CTA's January 22 statement had announced that they do "not support support and strongly disapprove of any protests on public roadways, highways, and bridges" and the disruption of the "motoring public on highways and commerce at the border". CTA members can express their disagreement with government policies by holding an "organized, lawful event on Parliament Hill". Stephen Laskowski,  CTA president said the trucking industry "must adapt and comply with this mandate". \c\cThe Private Motor Truck Council of Canada noted concern about the convoy's "racist remarks", citing the comparisons to Nazis and communism. The Atlantic Provinces Trucking Association and the British Columbia Trucking Association both criticized the protest. \c\cThe Terry Fox Foundation also condemned the defacing of Fox's statue with anti-mandate signs. \c\cThe Royal Canadian Legion called protesters dancing on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier "shocking" and "strongly condemn[ed]" their actions. \c\cThe Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies denounced the use of Nazi symbols by some of the protesters. \c\cThe Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms provides legal support of the convoy and its contacts with media. \c\cThe Canadian Labour Congress called the protest in Ottawa "an occupation by an angry mob trying to disguise itself as a peaceful protest". \c\cVarious trucking companies have tried to distance themselves from the convoys, claiming that the vehicles are owner-operated, despite featuring their logos. \c\cAccording to The New York Times, "In an increasingly polarized political environment, the Canadian truckers became an instant cause célèbre."\c\cGeneral Wayne Eyre, Canada's Chief of the Defence Staff, said he was "sickened to see protesters dance on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and desecrate the National War Memorial", after video of such events surfaced online January 29. \c\cBarry Prentice, transportation economy professor at University of Manitoba, stated that the truckers should be treated differently than flight crews or passenger-train employees, and that the positive aspects of vaccine mandates should be evaluated against the disruptions they would cause to the freight industry. Elon Musk tweeted "Canadian truckers rule" and followed it up with "If you scare people enough, they will demand removal of freedom. This is the path to tyranny." English comedian Russell Brand released a video decrying the media for ignoring reporting on the protest. Brand also said in the video that "Truckers, who were previously regarded as heroes when they were delivering vital goods and working during the lockdown, are now villains as they protest vaccine mandates". Krista Haynes, daughter of Ontario Premier Doug Ford and active anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine campaigner, attended a rally in support of the truckers as they headed to Ottawa. \c\cA survey by Abacus Data of 1,410 Canadian adults, conducted between January 31 and February 2, 2022, reported that 32 per cent of respondents stated that they "had a lot in common" with the protestors and their worldview, while 68 per cent stated that they "had very little in common" with the demonstrators and their ideology. Furthermore, 43 per cent of respondents stated that they felt the protest was "respectful and appropriate", while 57 per cent viewed it as "offensive and inappropriate". \c\cA study by Vox Pop Labs among a randomly pre-selected sample of 2,339 respondents, conducted between January 4 and 10, 2022, found that around 70 per cent of Canadians were willing to support a general vaccine mandate for all non-exempt adults over the age of 18, while around 30 per cent disagreed. \c\cA routine political poll by Léger in Canada questioned respondents on the protest between February 4 and 6, 2022, and found that it was opposed by 62% of respondents, with 47% strongly opposing it. 32% supported it, while 7% were unsure. On its subsequent questionnaire, a further 65% expressed the belief that the convoy represented "a small minority of selfish Canadians," 57% viewed it as "not about vaccine mandates and pandemic restrictions" but rather "an opportunity for right wing supremacist groups to rally and voice their frustrations about society," and 52% likened it to the 2021 United States Capitol attack. Opposition to the convoy was highest among respondents living in urban areas, those vaccinated for COVID-19, and those aged 55 and up; while support for the convoy was highest among the unvaccinated, respondents aged 18 to 54, and respondents living in Alberta. \c\cA poll by Maru Public Opinion found that 64% of Canadians polled would support the aid of the Canadian Armed Forces to tow trucks from the protests and 53% of Canadians polled would support the use of force by Ottawa Police to clear out Ottawa protesters. \c\cOn February 4, 2022, Ottawa human rights lawyer Paul Champ filed a $9.8 million class action lawsuit against the organizers of the Freedom Convoy on behalf of downtown Ottawa residents over continuous air horn and train horn noise. The lawsuit is seeking $4.8 million for "private nuisance" and $5 million in punitive damages. In response to the suit, convoy organizers agreed to cease horn noise until 1:00 p.m. on February 6. Many protesters ignored the agreement. \c\cThe lawsuit went to court on the afternoon of February 5 and a hearing was adjourned to February 7. On February 6, Champ posted an ultimatum to protesters in Ottawa that they would be released from the lawsuit if they left Ottawa by 10:00 a.m. EST on February 7. \c\cOn February 7, Ontario Superior Court of Justice Hugh McLean issued a 10-day injunction on vehicles from honking their horns in downtown Ottawa. \c\cIn Ottawa, Ottawa Police claimed that every day protests were ongoing was costing $800,000. Following a request by the Mayor of Ottawa for 1,800 additional police officers, costs could increase to $2.5 million daily if granted. \c\cThe closure of the Rideau Centre was estimated to have resulted in approximately $40 million in losses. \c\cThe economic loss of the border crossing closure was estimated to be $220 million in economic loss. \c\cCanadian Manufacturers & Exporters estimates that $44 million in daily cross-border trade was affected by the blockade. \c\cDue to initial delays, economic loss was estimated at $50 million per day when border crossing was still open but at a standstill. \c\cDue to rerouting to other border crossings, the estimated total cost to industry was calculated at approximately $600 million. \c\cOn February 4, 2022, some vehicles and tractors arrived outside the Royal Ontario Museum on Avenue Road north of Queen's Park in Toronto. Also on February 4, Toronto Police started closing roads in the downtown in anticipation of a large protest and told residents to expect a larger police presence during the weekend. \c\cOn February 5, truckers, tractor drivers, and protesters arrived in Queen's Park to protest COVID-19 vaccine mandates. In response, a group of healthcare workers staged a counter-protest. Protest activity later moved north to Bloor Street and later to the intersection of Bloor Street West and Avenue Road. Hundreds of protesters and several trucks blocked the intersection for hours. Long stretches of major arterial roads, including University Avenue, College Street, and Yonge Street, were shut down. Fearing possible threats against healthcare workers, University Health Network and Sinai Health System, which operate major hospitals in the protest area, warned their employees to avoid wearing any clothing or badges that would identify them as health-care workers outside hospital premises. \c\cDuring the protest, a 22-year-old man was arrested and charged with assault with a weapon, use of a smoke bomb (administering a noxious substance), and public mischief. A second man was arrested for assault with a weapon after throwing feces at another person. \c\cOn February 5, at a related protest in downtown Winnipeg, four people were injured in a ramming incident. One was hospitalized and later released. As of \c\cFebruary 7, protests were on their fourth day. Police have yet to write tickets or lay charges against protesters, despite numerous noise complaints, fireworks without permit, and incidents of "homophobia, racism, and gender-based harassment."\c\cA protest targeting the New Brunswick Legislature in Fredericton began on Friday, February 11. Fredericton Police established checkpoints leading into the city's downtown, and refused entry to any large truck without a valid manifest. A group of about 300 protesters gathered at the New Brunswick Legislative Building, growing to a peak of 700 by Saturday. By Sunday afternoon, police reported that about 70 protesters remained in the city, and that there had been three arrests related to the protest, and numerous tickets issued for traffic and city bylaw infractions. \c\cBeginning February 5, protesters attempted to blockade the Pacific Highway Border Crossing between Blaine, Washington and Surrey, British Columbia. \c\cProtesters returned on February 12, where a police barricade was set up. A convoy led by a privately owned military-style vehicle broke through the police barricades. and the border crossing was subsequently closed. \c\cTruckers and protesters have gathered in Oakville, Mississauga, Vaughan, other parts of the Greater Toronto Area, Orangeville, Quebec City, Vancouver, Vancouver Island, Kelowna, Regina, and Victoria. A convoy in Charlottetown attracted hundreds of protesters on February 12, mostly driving personal vehicles and farm equipment. \c\cThe Freedom Convoy also inspired several Facebook and Telegram groups organizing similar protests in 34 countries including Argentina, Austria, Cyprus, New Zealand, Australia and the United States. As is the case in Canada, demonstrations were partly supported by local far-right groups; in Finland by members of neo-fascist Blue-and-Black Movement, Soldiers of Odin and Power Belongs to the People, and in Germany by the Reichsbürger movement and Alternative for Germany. \c\cIn February 2022, a solidarity protest was organized in the United Kingdom with a convoy driving from Scotland to London with stops in cities throughout the British isles. Other convoys were reported in Wales and parts of England. \c\cOfficials in Paris and Brussels banned protests relating to the Freedom Convoy, following information from organizers of a similar event opposed to France's Health Pass, le Convoi de la Liberté, that five convoys from across France are due to reach Paris between February 11 and 14.
The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation is a regulation of the European Union and Euratom, which allows the European Commission to adopt measures, including the suspension of payment of funds from the EU budget, to member states which violate the principles of rule of law enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. \c\cDemocratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland has been a major concern for the European Union since the 2010s. In December 2017, the European Commission initiated article 7 suspension proceedings against Poland, and in September 2018, the European Parliament did the same against Hungary. The proceedings have since stalled, however, as a suspension of a member state under article 7 requires unanimity, excluding the member state concerned, and Hungary and Poland are widely expected to veto each other's suspension. \c\cAs a solution to this problem, the European Commission proposed in May 2018 to link disbursements from the European Union's budget to adherence to rule of law standards by means of a regulation. The European Parliament adopted a position on the Commission's proposal in April 2019, but the Council was generally wary of confronting its members from Poland and Hungary. \c\cThis changed during the adoption of the 2021–2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery package in the summer of 2020. At the July 2020 European Council summit, the heads of state and government of the EU member states agreed that these funds should be tied to a conditionality regime regarding the rule of law. Germany, holding the presidency of the Council, suggested a compromise on the rule of law conditionality regulation proposed by the Commission and European Parliament in September 2020. After trilogue meetings between the Council, the European Parliament, and the Commission, a legislative draft of the regulation was published on 5 November 2020. \c\cAlthough the regulation could be adopted by the Council by a qualified majority, Hungary and Poland threatened to veto the Own Resources Decision, which defines how the MFF and NGEU are financed. At the European Council summit of 10 and 11 December 2020, the impasse was resolved by adopting a series of declarations on how the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation should be adopted, implemented and interpreted. This paved the way for the adoption of the regulation by the Council on 14 December 2020 and by the European Parliament on 16 December 2020. \c\cThe regulation provides for the Commission to propose measures against a member state that violates the principles of the rule of law. These measures include the suspension of payments or commitments, and a prohibition on entering into new legal commitments. \c\cIn the context of the regulation, the rule of law is understood to refer to the values enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, and include "the principles of legality implying a transparent, accountable, democratic and pluralistic law-making process; legal certainty; prohibition of arbitrariness of the executive powers; effective judicial protection, including access to justice, by independent and impartial courts, also as regards fundamental rights; separation of powers; and non-discrimination and equality before the law". \c\cArticle 4 of the regulation specifies that measures may only be taken if the violations of the rule of law "affect or seriously risk affecting the sound financial management of the Union budget or the protection of the financial interests of the Union in a sufficiently direct way". \c\cThe declaratory statements adopted at the European Council summit of 10 and 11 December 2020 address how the European Council views the regulation should be implemented. The legal value of these declaratory statements is disputed. \c\cAccording to the European Council's declaratory statements, the Commission should not only develop guidelines for the application of the regulation, but also await the outcome of legal challenges to the regulation before implementing it. Furthermore, the Commission should only apply the regulation when there are no more efficient means to protect the Union's budget. \c\cThe European Parliament adopted a resolution on 25 March 2021 in which it stressed "that the application of the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation cannot be subject to the adoption of guidelines", urging "the Commission to avoid any further delay in its application" and "to keep Parliament regularly informed about all ongoing investigations into breaches of the principles of the rule of law which could affect, or seriously risk affecting, the sound financial management of the Union budget in a sufficiently direct way". The European Parliament threatened to take legal action against the Commission if it would not provide such information to the European Parliament by 1 June 2021. \c\cOn 10 June 2021, after the deadline had passed without the Commission providing the European Parliament with the necessary information, the European Parliament adopted another resolution, calling on the Commission to fulfil its obligations under the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation within two weeks, and notifying the Commission that it would start preparations for legal action against the Commission for failure to act (article 265 TFEU). The European Commission rejected the ultimatum on 23 August 2021 with a five-page letter. \c\cOn 11 March 2021, Hungary and Poland separately launched legal proceedings with the European Court of Justice against the European Parliament and the Council for adopting the regulation, asking the court to annul the regulation as, according to Hungary and Poland, the regulation does not have an appropriate legal basis and that it serves to circumvent the punitive mechanism built in the Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union. The advocate general advised the Court to dismiss those challenges on 2 December 2021. The ECJ ultimately dismissed both countries\' complaints and ruled the regulation fully compatible with the Treaty and not exceeding the competences of the European Union.
Designated terrorist organisations in Australia are organisations that have been designated by the Australian government as terrorist organisations. A list of terrorist organisations was first created under the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, as part of the fight against terrorism worldwide. \c\cThe Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002 was passed by the Australian Parliament, "enabling Australian governments to deal with organisations involved in terrorism", and inserted a range of terrorist organisation offences into the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). For example, the Act made it an offence to materially support or be supported by a listed terrorist organisation. \c\cThe list of designated terror organisations is maintained by the Attorney-General's Department. For listing as a terrorist organisation, an organisation may be found to be such by a court as part of a prosecution for a terrorist offence or the designation may be made by regulation upon the motion of the Attorney-General of Australia under Division 102 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Listing, de-listing and re-listing follows a protocol that mainly involves the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Attorney-General's Department. Such action in general is not made with reference to designations made or proposed by other countries or multinational organisations.[citation needed]\c\cUnder Division 103 of the Criminal Code Act 1995, it is illegal to finance terrorism. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) monitors financial transactions involving listed terrorist organisations.[citation needed]\c\cAs of 14 August 2021,[update] the Australian government lists 26 foreign organisations as terrorist organisations:\c\cHamas was listed in July 2014, but was removed from the list by January 2015.[citation needed] Hamas was reinstated in 2022. \c\cThe Base and the entirety of Hezbollah were added on 24 November 2021. \c\cAustralian anti-terrorism financing laws include:\c\cCriminal Code Act 1995 (Cth):\c\csection 102.6 - getting funds to, from or for a terrorist organisation\c\csection 102.7 - providing support to a terrorist organisation\c\csection 103.1 - financing terrorism\c\csection 103.2 - financing a terrorist, and\c\csection 119.4(5) - giving or receiving goods and services to promote the commission of a foreign incursion offence. \c\cCharter of the United Nations Act 1945 (Cth):\c\csection 20 - dealing with freezable assets, and\c\csection 21 - giving an asset to a proscribed person or entity. \c\cThese offences sanction persons and entities under Australian and international law. The responsibility of prosecuting these offences in Australia rests with the Australian Federal Police, State police forces and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.
In March and April 2021, Russia started to mass thousands of military personnel and equipment near its border with Ukraine, representing the highest force mobilization since the country's annexation of Crimea in 2014. This precipitated an international crisis and generated concerns over a potential invasion. Satellite imagery showed movements of armor, missiles, and heavy weaponry. The troops were partially removed by June. The crisis was renewed in October and November 2021, when over 100,000 Russian troops were again massed near the border by December. \c\cThe ongoing crisis stems from the protracted Russo-Ukrainian War that began in early 2014. In December 2021, Russia advanced two draft treaties that contained requests of what it referred to as "security guarantees", including a legally binding promise that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as well as a reduction in NATO troops and military hardware stationed in Eastern Europe, and threatened unspecified military response if those demands were not met in full. NATO has rejected these requests, and the United States warned Russia of "swift and severe" economic sanctions should it further invade Ukraine. \c\cThe crisis has been described by some commentators as one of the most intense since the Cold War. \c\cFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine and Russia continued to retain close ties. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to abandon its nuclear arsenal and signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances on the condition that Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States would issue an assurance against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. Five years later, Russia was one of the signatories of the Charter for European Security, where it "reaffirmed the inherent right of each and every participating State to be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, as they evolve". \c\cDespite being a recognized independent country since 1991, as a former USSR constituent republic, Ukraine had been perceived by the leadership of Russia as being part of its sphere of influence. In 2008, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke out against Ukraine's membership in NATO. Romanian analyst Iulian Chifu and his co-authors in 2009 opined that in regard to Ukraine, Russia has pursued an updated version of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which dictates that the sovereignty of Ukraine cannot be larger than that of the Warsaw Pact's member states prior to the collapse of the Soviet sphere of influence during the late-1980s and early-1990s. \c\cFollowing weeks of protests as part of the Euromaidan movement (2013–2014), pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the leaders of the Ukrainian parliamentary opposition on 21 February 2014 signed a settlement agreement that called for an early election. The following day, Yanukovych fled from Kyiv ahead of an impeachment vote that stripped him of his powers as president. Leaders of the Russian-speaking eastern regions of Ukraine declared continuing loyalty to Yanukovych, causing the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. The unrest was followed by the annexation of Crimea by Russia in March 2014 and the War in Donbas, which started in April 2014 with the creation of the Russia-backed quasi-states of the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics. \c\cOn 14 September 2020, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky approved Ukraine's new National Security Strategy, "which provides for the development of the distinctive partnership with NATO with the aim of membership in NATO." On 24 March 2021, Zelensky signed the Decree No. 117/2021 approving the "strategy of de-occupation and reintegration of the temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol."\c\cIn July 2021, Vladimir Putin published an essay titled On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians, in which he re-affirmed his view that Russians and Ukrainians were "one people". American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism. British journalist Edward Lucas described it as revisionist. Other observers have noted that the Russian leadership has a distorted view of modern Ukraine and its history. \c\cRussia has said that a possible Ukrainian accession to NATO and the NATO enlargement in general threaten its national security. In turn, Ukraine and other European countries neighboring Russia have accused Putin of attempting to restore the Soviet Empire and of pursuing aggressive militaristic policies. \c\cAccording to Time's analysis published in early February 2022, Russia's military build-up along the Russo-Ukrainian border in 2021 originates from an announcement by the Russian Defense Ministry on 21 February regarding the deployment of 3,000 paratroopers to the border for “large-scale exercises”. The announcement was made following the Ukrainian government's crackdown earlier that month on Viktor Medvedchuk, a leading pro-Russian Ukrainian opposition politician and tycoon with close personal ties to Vladimir Putin. \c\cOn 3 March 2021, according to Suspilne, separatists from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic reported they had been granted permission to use "preemptive fire for destruction" on Ukrainian military positions. On 16 March, the SBGS border patrol in the Sumy Oblast spotted a Mil Mi-8 helicopter flying from Russia trespassing approximately 50 metres (160 ft) into Ukrainian territory before heading back to Russian airspace. According to the Ukrainian magazine Novoye Vremya, ten days later, "Russian troops" fired mortars at Ukrainian positions near the village of Shumy in Donbas, killing four Ukrainian servicemen. Russia refused to renew the ceasefire in Donbas on 1 April. \c\cBy 30 March, Colonel general Ruslan Khomchak, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine revealed intelligence reports suggesting a military buildup by the Russian Armed Forces at the outskirts of Ukraine in preparations for the 2021 Zapad exercise. 28 Russian battalion tactical groups were situated along the Russo-Ukrainian border and at Russian-occupied territories (primarily Crimea, Rostov, Bryansk and Voronezh). According to Komchak, the buildup posed "a threat" to the military security of Ukraine. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Vladimir Putin, disagreed the Ukrainian statements, claiming the military movements "are not of any concern" for neighboring countries. Instead, the decisions were made to deal on matters of "national security". \c\cBetween late March and early April, the Russian military moved significant quantities of arms and equipment from various regions of Russia, including as far away as Siberia, towards Ukraine's northern and eastern boders and into Crimea. Unofficial Russian sources, such as the pro-Russian Telegram channel Military Observer, published a video of the flight of a group of Russian Kamov Ka-52 and Mil Mi-28 attack helicopters. It was emphasized by the original sources that the flight had allegedly taken place on the Russo-Ukrainian border. \c\cBy mid-April 2021, Russia had a sizable troop buildup along the border with Ukraine and in the occupied Crimean Peninsula. The Ukrainian president's office estimated that more than 40,000 Russian forces were in Crimea and on Ukraine's eastern border. The German government condemned the Russia moves as a provocation. Russian officials asserted that the deployments were "combat training exercises" in response to NATO "military activities that threaten Russia," a possible reference to a DEFENDER-Europe 21 NATO-led military exercises. \c\cRussian and pro-Kremlin media made allegations on 3 April accusing a Ukrainian drone attack of causing the death of a child in the Russian-occupied part of Donbas. However, no further details were given surrounding the incident. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Russian State Duma believed that Ukrainian leaders should be "held responsible for the death", while proposing to exclude Ukraine from the Council of Europe. On 5 April, Ukrainian representatives of the Joint Centre of Control and Coordination (JCCC) sent a note to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine regarding pro-Russian intentions to falsify the accusations. The next day, the mission confirmed the death of a child in Russian-occupied Donbas, but failed to establish a link between the purported "Ukrainian drone strike" and the child's death. \c\cOn 6 April, a Ukrainian serviceman was killed as a result of shelling of Ukrainian positions near the town of Nevelske in Donetsk Oblast. Another soldier was killed near Stepne by an unknown explosive device. As a result of the shelling, the water pumping station located in the "gray-zone" between the villages of Vasylivka and Kruta Balka at South Donbas was de-energized, causing the suspension of water supplies at over 50 settlements. Shortly after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine blocked the flow of the Northern Crimean Canal, which had supplied 85-percent of Crimea's water. Crimea's reservoirs were subsequently depleted and water shortages ensued, with water reportedly only being available for three to five hours a day in 2021. The New York Times has cited senior American officials mentioning securing Crimea's water supply could be an objective of a possible incursion by Russia. \c\cRussia has transferred ships between the Caspian Sea and Black Sea. The transfer had involved several landing craft and artillery boats. Interfax has reported on 8 April that the crews and ships of the Caspian Flotilla will pass the final naval exercises in cooperation with the Black Sea Fleet. \c\cOn 10 April, Ukraine invoked Paragraph 16 of the Vienna Document and initiated a meeting in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on the surge of Russian troops at regions near the Russo-Ukrainian border and Russian-occupied Crimea. Ukraine's initiative was supported by several countries, but the Russian delegation failed to appear at the meeting and refused to provide explanations. \c\cOn 13 April, Ukrainian consul Oleksandr Sosoniuk was detained in Saint Petersburg by the Federal Security Service (FSB), allegedly while "receiving confidential information" during a meeting with a Russian citizen. Sosoniuk was later expelled from Russia. In response, Yevhen Chernikov, a senior Russian diplomat of the Russian embassy in Kyiv, was declared a persona non grata in 19 April in Ukraine and was forced to leave the country within 72 hours. \c\cOn 14 April, in a meeting in Crimea, Nikolay Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council of Russia (SCRF) accused Ukrainian special services of trying to organize "terrorist attacks and sabotage" on the peninsula. \c\cOn the night between 14 and 15 April, a naval confrontation took place in the Sea of Azov, 40 kilometres (25 mi) from the Kerch Strait, between three Ukrainian Gyurza-M-class artillery boats and six vessels from the Coast Guard of the Border Service of the FSB. The Ukrainian artillery boats were escorting civilian ships when the incident occurred. It was reported that Ukrainian ships threatened to use airborne weapons to deter provocations from FSB vessels. The incident ended without any casualties. \c\cThe following day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine reported that Russia had announced the closure of parts of the Black Sea from warships and vessels of other countries until October under the pretext of military exercises. The Ministry has condemned the decision as a "gross violation of the right of navigational freedoms" guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. According to the convention, Russia must not "obstruct maritime passages of the International strait to ports" in the Sea of Azov. \c\cAccording to John Kirby, Pentagon Press Secretary, Russia had concentrated more troops near the Russo-Ukrainian border than in 2014. Russia reportedly imposed temporary restrictions on flights over parts of Crimea and the Black Sea from 20 to 24 April 2021, as stated in an international report for pilots. \c\cOn 22 April 2021, Russian Minister of Defence Sergey Shoygu announced a drawdown of military exercises with troops from the 58th and 41st Army, and the 7th, 76th, and 98th Guards Airborne Division returning to their permanent bases by 1 May after inspections in the Southern and Western military districts. Equipment at the Pogonovo training facility were to remain for the annual military exercise with Belarus scheduled in September 2021. \c\cOn 11 October 2021, Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia, published an article on Kommersant, in which he argued that Ukraine was a "vassal" of the West and that, therefore, it was pointless for Russia to attempt to hold a dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities, whom he described as "weak", "ignorant" and "unreliable". Medvedev concluded that Russia should do nothing in regard to Ukraine and wait until a Ukrainian government comes to power that is genuinely interested in improving relations with Russia, adding "Russia knows how to wait. We are patient people." The Kremlin later specified that Medvedev's article "runs in unison" with Russia's view of the current Ukrainian government. \c\cIn November 2021, the Russian Defense Ministry described the deployment of the US warships to the Black Sea as a "threat to regional security and strategic stability." The ministry said in a statement, "The real goal behind the US activities in the Black Sea region is exploring the theater of operations in case Kyiv attempts to settle the conflict in the southeast by force."\c\cSenior officials of the Biden administration reported that Russia had only withdrawn a few thousand troops since the previous military buildup. The New York Times estimated over 80,000 Russian troops still remained at the Russo-Ukrainian border by September 2021. In early November, reports of Russian military buildups prompted American officials to warn the European Union that Russia could be planning a potential invasion of Ukraine.[failed verification] On 13 November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Russia has again amassed 100,000 troops near the Russo-Ukrainian border, higher than an American assessment of approximately 70,000. \c\cOn 21 November, the head of the HUR MOU, Kyrylo Budanov, reported that Russia had concentrated more than 92,000 troops and deployed several Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) systems near the Russo-Ukrainian border. Budanov accused Russia of conspiring protests against vaccination against COVID-19 in Kyiv and other protest rallies in Ukraine to destabilize the country in preparations for a large-scale military invasion. According to Budanov, active Russian military actions should be expected between late-January and early-February 2022. \c\cOn 1 December, Russia accused Ukraine of deploying 125,000 troops (half of the capacity of the Armed Forces of Ukraine) at Donbas to confront pro-Russian separatists. Between November and December, Kremlin officials claimed that Ukraine had violated the Minsk Protocol.[failed verification] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any "unusual" military activity and refuted claims of a possible invasion of Ukraine, while accusing Ukraine of planning "aggressive actions" against Donbas. Peskov urged NATO to stop "concentrating a military fist" near the Russo-Ukrainian border and arming Ukraine with modern weapons. Putin criticized Ukraine for using Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAV) against pro-Russian separatists at Donbas. Russia accused Ukraine of creating "provocations", moving heavy artillery weapons towards the front lines where separatists were fighting with Ukrainian forces. \c\cOn 3 December, the Ukrainian Minister of Defense, Oleksii Reznikov, spoke of the possibility of a "large-scale escalation" by Russia during the end of January 2022, during a session at the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's national parliament). In early December 2021, an analysis conducted by Janes concluded that major elements of the Russian 41st Army (headquartered at Novosibirsk) and the 1st Guards Tank Army (normally deployed around Moscow) had been re-positioned to the west, reinforcing the Russian 20th and 8th Guards that were already positioned closer to the Russo-Ukrainian border. Additional Russian forces were reported to have moved to Crimea, reinforcing Russian naval and ground units that were already deployed there. American intelligence officials warned that Russia was planning an upcoming major military offensive into Ukraine scheduled to take place in January 2022. \c\cRussia began a slow evacuation of its embassy staff at Kyiv beginning in January 2022. The motives of the evacuation remain unknown and were subjected to multiple speculations. By mid-January, an intelligence assessment produced by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence estimated that Russia were in its final stages of completing a military buildup at the Russo-Ukrainian border, amassing 127,000 troops at the region. Among the troops, 106,000 were land forces and the remainder being navals and air forces. Furthermore, there were 35,000 more Russian-backed separatist forces and another 3,000 Russian forces in rebel-held eastern Ukraine. The assessment estimated that Russia had deployed 36 Iskander SRBM systems near the border, many stationed within striking distance of Kyiv. The assessment also reported intensified Russian intelligence activity. An analysis conducted by the Atlantic Council in 20 January concluded that Russia had deployed additional critical combat capabilities to the region. \c\cIn late-January 2022, major Russian forces were relocated and deployed to Belarus under the auspices of the planned joint military exercises to be held in February that year. Namely, the headquarters of the Eastern Military District was deployed to Belarus along with combat units drawn from the District's 5th Combined Arms Army, 29th Combined Arms Army, 35th Combined Arms Army, 36th Combined Arms Army, 68th Army Corps, as well as the Pacific Fleet's 155th Naval Infantry Brigade. Ukrainian and American officials believed that Russia's decision was to use Belarus for an attack on Ukraine from the north due to the close proximity of the Belarusian–Ukrainian border with the city of Kyiv. \c\cOn 19 January, US President Joe Biden said his "guess" was that Russia "will move in" to Ukraine but Putin would pay "a serious and dear price" for an invasion and "would regret it". Biden added: "It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do. But if they actually do what they\'re capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine." Biden's comment implied that NATO allies were split on the question of responding to a possible "minor incursion" into Ukraine. The remark was criticized by Ukrainian officials, several world leaders and members of the US Congress, as it would imply that low-level Russian aggression would not be met with a forceful response. As a result, Zelensky wrote: "We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones." The Biden administration later clarified Biden's comments, mentioning, "he has been \'absolutely clear\' with President Putin. He has no misunderstanding. If any – any – assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion... It would be met with severe and coordinated economic response."\c\cOn 20 January, Russia announced plans to hold major naval drills later that month that would involve all of its naval fleets containing 140 vessels, 60 planes and 10,000 soldiers, in the seas adjacent to Russia as well as in the Mediterranean, the northeast Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific. \c\cIn an interview for The Washington Post in January 2022, Zelensky warned that Russian forces could invade and take control of regions in eastern Ukraine, such as the Kharkiv Oblast. He also argued that an invasion would lead to a large-scale war between Ukraine and Russia. On January 28, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), General Philip M. Breedlove, gave an assessment of Russian military capabilities and strategic aims. \c\cOn 28 January, Reuters reported that Russia had added blood supplies and other medical materials "within recent weeks", according to 3 U.S officials, adding to fears of conflict. \c\cOn 5 February, two US officials said that Russia had assembled about 70% of the military believed it would be needed for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and that the number of battalion tactical groups in the border region has risen from 60 to 83 in the previous two weeks. \c\cOn 10 February, six Russian warships capable of landing tanks and troops ashore, assigned to Russia's Baltic and Northern Fleets, arrived at the Sevastopol Naval Base in Crimea. On the same day, Russia announced naval exercises to be held in the Black Sea. Meanwhile, Ukraine "strongly protested" against "the decision of the Russian Federation to block parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait under the pretext of holding regular naval exercises". Separately, north of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus began joint military exercises, Allied Resolve 2022, close to the Belarusian border with Ukraine, with about 30,000 Russian troops, as well as almost all of the Belarusian armed forces, participating in the drills scheduled to last for 10 days. \c\cOn 11 February, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, referring to unspecified intelligence the US government had, said that while a decision to invade might not have been made yet, the attack could begin at any moment prior to the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing scheduled for 20 February. Separately, the media published reports based on the information from the officials of several countries saying that the US intelligence briefing that was provided to its allies included a specific reference to 16 February as a potential start date for the ground invasion that could be carried out across the border from Belarus, accompanied by cyber attacks and missile strikes. Following these announcements, the US ordered evacuation of most of its diplomatic staff and all military instructors in Ukraine. The US, the UK, Japan, a number of European and other countries also urged their citizens to leave Ukraine immediately. Next day, Dutch KLM suspended its flights to Ukraine, while other airlines reduced their exposure to the country. \c\cOn 10 February 2022, the Baltic states invoked the provisions of the Vienna Document 2011 requesting an explanation from Belarus regarding the unusual military activities. On 11 February 2022, Ukraine too invoked Chapter III (risk reduction) of the Vienna Document, requesting that Russia provide "detailed explanations on military activities in the areas adjacent to the territory of Ukraine and in the temporarily occupied Crimea." According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, no response had been received from Russian authorities within the required 48-hour deadline. On 13 February, Ukraine requested that an emergency meeting within the OSCE be held within the following 48 hours, at which Russia was expected to provide a response. On 14 February, the Ukrainian and Belarusian Defence Ministers, Oleksii Reznikov and Viktor Khrenin, agreed on mutual confidence-building and transparency measures, including visits by Reznikov to the Russian–Belarusian Allied Resolve 2022 exercise and by Khrenin to the Ukrainian Zametil 2022 exercise. The OSCE Vienna Document emergency meeting requested by Ukraine was held on 15 February. The Russian OSCE representative was absent from the meeting. \c\cOn 14 February 2022, Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu said units from Russia's Southern and Western military districts had begun returning to barracks following the completion of exercises close to Ukraine’s border. US President Joe Biden said they could not verify such report and, on 16 February, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that Russia continued the military buildup. On 17 February, both US and NATO top officials stated that Russia was actively looking for casus belli, with attempts being made to conduct a false flag operation, i.e. a staged attack against the Russian people, and that the threat of invasion of Ukraine remained, in US President Biden’s words, "very high". Biden added, "My sense is it will happen in the next several days."\c\cOn 17 February 2022, the Ukrainian government accused Russian separatists of shelling a kindergarten at Stanytsia Luhanska using artillery, injuring three civilians. The Luhansk People's Republic said that its forces were attacked by the Ukrainian government with mortars, grenade launchers and machine gun fire. \c\cOn 26 November 2021, Zelensky accused the Russian government and Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov of backing a plan to overthrow the Ukrainian government. Russia has subsequently denied the claims. \c\cOn 10 January 2022, the SBU announced that it had arrested an alleged Russian military intelligence agent who was attempting to recruit operatives to conduct attacks at Odessa. 3 days later, Ukraine was struck by a cyberattack that affected the official websites of several Ukrainian ministries. It was later suspected that Russian hackers might be responsible in the incident. \c\cUkrainian military intelligence stated that Russian special services were preparing "provocations" against Russian soldiers stationed at Transnistria (a breakaway unrecognized state internationally considered to be part of Moldova) to create a pretext for a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration later revealed that the Russian government had deployed saboteurs to eastern Ukraine to stage a fabricated attack against Russian proxy separatists at eastern Donetsk and Luhansk to provide Russia with another pretext for an invasion. The administration stated the Russian operatives were trained in urban warfare and explosives. The Russian government has denied the claims. \c\cOn 22 January, the British government said Russia was preparing a plan to supplant Ukraine's government via military force and install a pro-Russian puppet administration in the country, potentially led by Yevheniy Murayev, a former member of the Ukrainian parliament. Both Murayev and the Russian government denied the allegations, with the latter blaming "NATO countries led by the Anglo-Saxons" for the Russo-Ukrainian crisis. On 3 February, the US said that Russia was planning to use a fabricated video showing a staged Ukrainian "attack" as a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine. The Russian government denied any plans to orchastrate a pretext for an invasion. \c\cIn preparation of a possible renewed Russian invasion, the Ukrainian Ground Forces announced a meeting in April 2021 regarding territorial defenses to strengthen and protect the nation's borders and critical facilities, and to combat sabotage and reconnaissance groups at southern Ukraine. During the same month, Zelensky visited Ukrainian defensive positions at Donbas. According to Russia, Ukraine deployed 125,000 troops to the Donbas conflict zone in December 2021. \c\cThe United States estimated in December 2021 that Russia could assemble over 175,000 troops to invade Ukraine. Oleksii Reznikov, Ukrainian Minister of Defense, stated that "we have 250,000 official ... members of our army. Plus, I said 400,000 veterans and 200,000 reservists. 175,000 (is) not enough to go to Ukraine." Reznikov claimed that Russia could launch a large-scale attack on Ukraine in late-January 2022. \c\cUkraine's Territorial Defense Forces (the reserve component of the Ground Forces established after the 2014 war) recruited additional citizens and trained them in urban guerrilla tactics and firearms use. Such insurgency tactics, as reported by The New York Times, could support a resistance movement if the Russian military is able to overwhelm the Ukrainian military. Andrii Zahorodniuk, former Ukrainian Minister of Defense, wrote in January 2022 that in the case of a Russian invasion, the Russian forces would likely destroy "key elements of the country's military infrastructure" and will be able to "advance deep into Ukrainian territory", but would face difficulty in securing it. Zahorodniuk further stated, "Russian occupation forces will face highly motivated opponents fighting in familiar surroundings. By combining serving military units with combat veterans, reservists, territorial defense units, and large numbers of volunteers, Ukraine can create tens of thousands of small and highly mobile groups capable of attacking Russian forces. This will make it virtually impossible for the Kremlin to establish any kind of administration over occupied areas or secure its lines of supply."\c\cIn response to expectations of a renewed invasion following the military buildup of over 100,000 Russian troops near the Russo-Ukrainian border, some of the NATO member nations in January 2022 began providing military aid, including lethal weapons, with the US giving approval to its NATO allies to send anti-armor missiles and other US-made weapons. The first US shipment of some 90 tonnes (200,000 lb) of lethal weapons arrived in Ukraine on 22 January 2022. The US provided FGM-148 Javelin antitank missiles, anti-armor artillery, heavy machine guns, small arms and ammunition, secure radio systems, medical equipment and spare parts. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley threatened US support for an anti-Russian insurgency within Ukraine, similar to the CIA's assistance to anti-Soviet mujahideen rebels in Afghanistan in the 1980s. According to James Stavridis, the former Supreme Allied Commander Europe at NATO, "The level of military support" for anti-Russian guerrilla fighters "would make our efforts in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union look puny by comparison."\c\cIn December, the US administration approved an additional defense aid of US$200 million to Ukraine. This was an addition to previous aids to Ukraine, making the total defense aid in 2021 worth US$650 million. Deliveries of lethal weapons from the US started the following month and included .50 BMG caliber ammunition, M141 Bunker Defeat Munition (BDM) and Javelin systems. The US also intends to transfer Mil Mi-17 helicopters to Ukraine, previously flown by the Afghan Air Force. The Biden administration approved deliveries of American-made FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. In January 2022, the Biden administration granted permission to the Baltic nations (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) to transfer American-made equipment to Ukraine. Estonia donated Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, while Latvia and Lithuania provided Stinger air defense systems and associated equipments. \c\cOther NATO members also provided aid to Ukraine. Pre-existing British and Canadian military training programs were bolstered in January 2022. The British deployed additional military trainers and provided light anti-armor defense systems, while the Canadians deployed a small special forces delegation to aid Ukraine. On 17 January, British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced that Britain had supplied Ukraine with 1,100 short-range anti-tank missiles. On 20 January, Sky News reported that 2,000 short-range anti-tank MBT LAW missiles had been delivered via numerous Royal Air Force C-17 transport aircraft between the UK and Ukraine. On 21 January, the UK Defence Journal reported that there had been an increase in Royal Air Force RC-135W Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft being deployed to monitor Russian forces on the Russo-Ukrainian border. \c\cOn 16 January, the Danish government announced they would provide Ukraine with a €22 million (US$24.8 million) defense package. On 21 January, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wopke Hoekstra, said that the Netherlands was ready to deliver "defensive military support". He explained that Ukraine had asked the Netherlands for arms assistance on 20 January, and a parliamentary majority supported it. \c\cOn 31 January 2022, Poland announced the decision to supply Ukraine with lethal weapons. It intends to provide significant quantities of light ammunition, artillery shells, light mortar systems, reconnaissance drones, and Polish-made Grom surface-to-air missiles. \c\cThe Dutch and Spanish governments also deployed forces to the region in support of NATO. On 20 January 2022, Spanish Defence Minister, Margarita Robles announced that the Spanish Navy was being deployed to the Black Sea. The patrol vessel Meteoro, acting as a minesweeper, was already en route and the frigate Blas de Lezo departed on 22 January. She also announced that the Spanish government was considering deploying the Spanish Air Force (SAF) to Bulgaria. Four Eurofighters were deployed on February 12, 2022. The Netherlands said it would send two F-35s to Bulgaria as part of NATO's expanded air surveillance mission. \c\cOn 5 February 2022, the first of 2,000 newly deployed US soldiers to Europe arrived in Germany and Poland, as part of the US attempt to bolster NATO's eastern flank as Russia deploys more forces along Ukraine's borders. \c\cOn 7 February 2022, Johnson said Britain would not "flinch" as he prepared to deploy Royal Marines, RAF aircraft, and Royal Navy warships to eastern Europe. \c\cOn 11 February 2022, the US announced additional deployment of 3,000 troops to Poland and sent F-15 jets to Romania. \c\cBetween 2 and 3 November 2021, CIA director William Burns met with senior Russian intelligence officials at Moscow to convey to the Kremlin regarding Biden's concern about the situation on the Russo-Ukrainian border. It was reported by CNN that Burns spoke by phone with Zelensky following the meeting at Moscow in a bid to ease Russian and Ukrainian tensions. Simultaneously, a high-ranking US Department of State official was dispatched to Ukraine. \c\cOn 15 November, acting German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian expressed concern in a joint communique about "Russian movements of troops and hardware near Ukraine", calling both sides to adopt and maintain "a posture of restraint". At the same time, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby confirmed that the United States continues to observe "unusual military activity" by Russia near the Russo-Ukrainian border. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed reports of "Russian military activity" in the area with Le Drian. On 16 November, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the reporters that it’s important NATO "doesn’t increase tensions, but we have to be clear-eyed, we need to be realistic about the challenges we face". Stoltenberg added that the alliance records an "unusual concentration" of Russian forces, which Russia might be willing to use "to conduct aggressive actions against Ukraine". \c\cIn early November 2021, Ukrainian intelligence assessed the information about the transfer of additional Russian troops to the Ukrainian borders to be "an element of psychological pressure." A week later, the Office of the President of Ukraine acknowledged that Russia was building up "specific groups of troops" near the border. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the French and German governments to prepare for a possible military scenario of Russia's actions against Ukraine. \c\cUkraine has intensified diplomatic efforts. On 15 November, Zelensky and the head of the European Council (EUCO) Charles Michel discussed "the security situation along the borders of Ukraine." On the same day, Kuleba held talks on the same issues in Brussels. The new Ukrainian defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, went to Washington D.C., where on 18 November he met with US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin. On 16 November, British defence secretary Ben Wallace visited Kyiv. \c\cIsrael maintains strong relationship with both Ukraine and Russia, and has sometimes acted as an interlocutor between the two nations. In April 2021, Zelensky asked the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to mediate the situation between himself and Putin. Israel raised the idea with Russia, who declined the request. In a meeting at Kyiv in October with Zelensky, Israeli President Isaac Herzog told Zelensky that the new Israeli government under Prime Minister Naftali Bennett was willing to resume efforts at Ukrainian-Russian mediation. Bennett raised the idea in a meeting with Putin two weeks later at Sochi, but Putin declined. \c\cOn 21 January 2022, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) announced in Pravda that its deputies would introduce a resolution in the State Duma to ask President Putin to officially recognize the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. \c\cIn late January, the United States was again discussing sanctions with European allies in case of a Russian invasion. Biden said the sanctions would be "swift and severe, including a "game over" strategy of targeting Russian banks, bond markets and the assets of elites close to Putin. Such an approach has also been criticized, and the proposed cut-off of Russian banks from the Visa, Mastercard and SWIFT payment systems was withdrawn. The challenge for US and NATO vis-à-vis Russia is the creation of credible deterrence with a plan for a de-escalatory sequence, including a reduction in inflammatory rhetoric, Russian troop withdrawals from the Russo-Ukrainian border, renewed Donbas peace talks, as well as a temporary halt on military exercises at the Black and Baltic Seas by the US, NATO or Russia. \c\cA Normandy Format meeting was planned between Russian, Ukrainian, German and French senior officials at Paris on 26 January 2022, with a followup phone call between the French President Emmanuel Macron and Putin on 28 January. Ukraine fulfilled Russia's condition for a meeting at Paris and decided to withdraw a  controversial draft law on the reintegration of Crimea and Donbas from the Ukrainian parliament, as it was viewed that the law had contradicted the Minsk peace agreements. \c\cOn 7 February, French President Emmanuel Macron met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, with mixed outcomes: Macron said that Putin told him that Russia will not further escalate the crisis; Putin scoffed at assertions that NATO is a "defensive alliance" and warned the Western countries that if Ukraine joined NATO and "decided to take back Crimea using military means, European countries will automatically be in a military conflict with Russia." Putin promised Macron not to carry out new military initiatives near Ukraine. \c\cOn 7 December 2021, US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked by videoconference. One of the topics discussed was the crisis over Ukraine, the Russian side issuing a statement that said Putin highlighted the fact that it was "NATO that was undertaking dangerous attempts to develop Ukrainian territory and increase its potential along [Russia's] borders"; he demanded "reliable, legal guarantees" that would preclude NATO from expanding its territory toward Russia or deploying its strike weapon systems in countries bordering Russia. \c\cOn 15 December 2021, Russia formally handed over to the US its two draft treaties on security guarantees whereby the US as well as NATO would, among other things, undertake not to deploy troops in ex-Soviet states that were not NATO members, rule out any further expansion of the Alliance eastward, undertake not to deploy any forces in other countries in addition to that which were deployed as of 27 May 1997, and refrain from conducting any military activity in Ukraine as well as in other states in eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and Central Asia. \c\cBiden and Putin had a 50-minute phone call on 30 December 2021. According to a White House statement released afterwards, on the call, Biden urged Putin "de-escalate tensions with Ukraine". According to Putin's aide, Biden told Putin that the US did not plan to deploy offensive weapon in Ukraine. Biden also warned that if Russia continued aggression against Ukraine, it would lead to "serious costs and consequences" such as the US imposing additional economic sanctions on Russia, increasing US military presence in the eastern members of NATO, and increased assistance to Ukraine. According to Putin's aide, Putin responded by saying that it would "cause a total severance of relations" between Russia and the US as well as the West at large. The following day, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov addressed the question about what Russia expected in response to its "security guarantees" proposals by saying, "...we will not allow anyone to drag out our initiatives in endless discussions. If a constructive response does not follow within a reasonable time and the West continues its aggressive course, Russia will be forced to take every necessary action to ensure a strategic balance and to eliminate unacceptable threats to our security."\c\cOn 10 January 2022, the US and Russia held bilateral talks in Geneva, whose purpose had been defined by the two sides as "to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and confront rising tensions over Ukraine". The talks were led by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, and US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. \c\cThe Geneva meeting was followed by a meeting of the NATO–Russia Council in Brussels on 12 January that involved delegations from all thirty NATO countries and one from Russia to discuss (according to the official statement issued by NATO), "the situation in and around Ukraine, and the implications for European security". The Russian MoD statement following the meeting stated that Russia "brought Russian assessments of the current state in the field of Euro-security, and also gave explanations on the military aspects of the Russian draft agreement on security guarantees." The talks were judged by Russia to be unsuccessful. Following the meeting, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that, with respect to Ukraine's potential accession to NATO, all NATO Allies were "united on the core principle that each and every nation has the right to choose his own path" and "Russia doesn\'t have a veto on whether Ukraine can become a NATO member. ... at the end of the day, it has to be NATO Allies and Ukraine that decides on membership."\c\cOn 21 January, Lavrov and Blinken met at Geneva. Blinken noted afterwards that the meeting "was not a negotiation but a candid exchange of concerns and ideas". Following the meeting, Blinken said that the US had made clear to Russia that its renewed invasion would "be met with swift, severe and a united response from the United States and our partners and allies."\c\cThe US delivered a formal written response to Russia's security demands on 26 January. The response rejected Moscow's demand that NATO renounce its promise that Ukraine would be able to join NATO. Commenting on the content of the US response, Blinken said that the document "include[d] concerns of the United States and our allies and partners about Russia's actions that undermine security, a principled and pragmatic evaluation of the concerns that Russia has raised, and our own proposals for areas where we may be able to find common ground." On 1 February, Putin said the US response had  failed to address Moscow's "three key demands", namely the non-expansion of the Alliance, refusal to deploy offensive weapon systems close to the Russian borders, and bringing back the Alliance's military infrastructure to the status quo of 1997. On 17 February, as the risk of Russian invasion of Ukraine was being assessed by the US and NATO as very high, Russia handed a letter to the US ambassador that blamed Washington for having ignored its main security demands. \c\cA UN Security Council meeting was convened on 31 January to discuss the ongoing crisis. Russia tried to block the meeting, but the request was rejected with ten votes for the meeting to go ahead, two against and three abstentions. During the debate, the US and Russia exchanged accusations among themselves. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, accused Russia of "aggressive behavior", and posing a "clear threat to international peace and security". She said Russia had made the "largest military mobilization for decades in Europe", and was trying "to paint Ukraine and Western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for attack". Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the West of "hysterics" and of "whipping up tensions" over Ukraine. He accused the US of "stoking the conflict" and the UNSC meeting was "an attempt to drive a wedge between Russia and Ukraine". According to him, Ukraine was not abiding the Minsk Protocols of 2014 and 2015 to end the conflict with the separatists, and Western nations were "pumping Ukraine full of weapons" contrary to the Minsk Protocols. Nebenzya added that Ukraine's violation of the Minsk Protocols could end in the ‘worst way’. \c\cUkrainian permanent representative at the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said Russia had deployed 112,000 troops near Ukraine's borders and in Crimea, with 18,000 deployed at sea off Ukraine's coast. China's permanent representative, Zhang Jun, said the meeting was counterproductive and "quiet diplomacy, not megaphone diplomacy" was needed. \c\cNo resolution was agreed at the meeting. \c\cOn 15 December 2021, Russia proposed documents that it referred to as "draft treaties", which referred to multiple international agreements, including the Charter for European Security and the NATO–Russia Council (NRC). Responses from NATO and the US in January 2022 referred to NRC, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), the United States–Russia Strategic Stability Dialogue (SSD), the Helsinki Final Act, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Normandy Format and other treaties and forums. \c\cIn an interview with the French newspaper Libération in April 2021, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that Russian troops\' build-up near the border with Ukraine and the deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine were the gravest since the attack on Ukrainian sailors in the Kerch Strait in November 2018. \c\cIn November 2021, Kyrylo Budanov, the chief of Ukraine's military intelligence, said that Russia was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February 2022. On 25 January 2022, defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said he saw no immediate threat of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine; he insisted that the threat had not significantly increased in eight years as "the Russian army ha[d] not formed a strike group that would be able to carry out an invasion". On 28 January 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the West not to create a "panic" in his country over a potential Russian invasion, adding that constant warnings of an "imminent" threat of invasion are putting the economy of Ukraine at risk. Zelensky said that "we do not see a bigger escalation" than in early 2021 when Russian military build-up started. On 2 February, the US White House said it would no longer describe a potential invasion as "imminent". On 12 February 2022, Zelensky said of the White House's warnings about the "imminent" threat of the Russian invasion that "the best friend of our enemies is panic in our country. And all this information only causes panic and does not help us." Davyd Arakhamia, the head of the faction of Zelensky's Servant of the People party in the Verkhovna Rada, said the constant warnings of a possible imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine "costs the country $2-3 billion every month."\c\cThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied that it has any plans to invade Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed such fears as "alarmist". Sergei Naryshkin, director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, dismissed reports of a possible invasion of Ukraine asserting that it was "malicious propaganda by the US State Department". On 30 November 2021, Putin stated that an expansion of NATO's presence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long-range missiles capable of striking Russian cities or missile defense systems similar to those in Romania and Poland, would be a "red line" issue for Russia. In January 2022, Nikolay Zhuravlev, Vice Speaker of the Federation Council, warned that Europe would not receive natural gas, petroleum and metals from Russia in the event that Russia was disconnected from the SWIFT international payment system, moreover such a move could not be feasible as it would require consent of all the countries participating in this system. In late January 2022, Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council, said that the idea that Russia is “threatening Ukraine” was “absolutely ridiculous” and added: "We don\'t want war. We don\'t need that at all." Russia's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko condemned the deployment of NATO troops, warships, and fighter jets in Eastern Europe, saying that the military alliance was "demonising Russia" in order to "justify military activity on [NATO's] eastern flank". Russia accused Ukraine of not implementing Minsk agreements reached in 2015 with the aim of establishing peace in Donbas. \c\cOn 7 February 2022, Putin said at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron that "A number of [Macron's] ideas, proposals ... are possible as a basis for further steps. We will do everything to find compromises that suit everyone." On 12 February 2022, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the United States and its allies of waging a "propaganda campaign" about Russian invasion of Ukraine. He described Western "demands to remove Russian troops from Russian territory" as "regrettable". \c\c Albania and  Kosovo – Albanian Armed Forces Colonel Ardian Lulaj and Kosovar Head of Strategic Communication Colonel Sefer Isufi both stated in early December 2021 that their respective countries would be willing to deploy Albanian Armed Forces and Kosovo Security Forces in a putative future mission in Ukraine should the US decide to lead such an endeavor. \c\c Australia – On 24 January, the Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne offered assistance to Ukraine in combating Russian cyber attacks. She also called on Russia to "de-escalate" tensions and urged Australians living in Ukraine to evacuate. Similar sentiments were expressed by Finance Minister Simon Birmingham, who warned that Australia would raise financial sanctions against Russia in the event of hostilities. \c\c Belarus – President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said the Union State "d[id] not want war", but all those who threatend sanctions against Russia and Belarus would find themselves in difficulty. He also stated that he would send "a whole contingent of the Belarusian army" to the border with Ukraine, because "Ukrainians allegedly began to draw troops there." On 18 January 2022, the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council expert group published a review of the arrival of Russian troops in the Republic of Belarus. In particular, it was about unloading Russian BM-27 Uragan multiple rocket launchers at the Rechytsa station in the Gomel Oblast north of Kyiv. \c\c Belgium – On 24 January 2022, Belgian Chief of Defence Michel Hofman said that Belgian forces were on standby in the Baltic, and prepared "to intervene within a certain amount of time, but today it is too early to say where and how" should the situation escalate. \c\c Brazil – Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro arrived in Moscow for trade talks with Putin on 16 February 2022. Bolsonaro said: "We pray for peace and respect all who act in that way."\c\c Bulgaria – In early January, Bulgarian Minister of Defense Stefan Yanev responded to a parliamentary question on the deployment of additional military units in Bulgarian territory that Bulgaria opposes "escalation of military measures before all other diplomatic means are used" and that Bulgaria had as of yet "no national position" on the situation. On 21 January, Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov condemned the Russian call for Bulgaria to leave NATO and for NATO troops to be withdrawn from Bulgaria and Romania, while President Rumen Radev called the statement "unacceptable". \c\c Canada – In January 2022, the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau stated that Canada would provide Ukraine with a CDN$120 million loan, but will not transfer military equipment. On February 14, 2022, Trudeau announced that Canada would provide a $500 million loan and send $7.8 million in lethal equipment to Ukraine. \c\c China – Chinese leader and CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping supported Russia's demand that Ukraine must never join NATO. On 14 January 2022, a spokesman  of China's Foreign Ministry emphasized that all countries should observe a traditional UN Olympic Truce resolution "from seven days before the start of the Olympic Games until seven days after the end of the Paralympic Games". Under this timeframe, the proposed truce resolution would thusly begin on 28 January 2022 and conclude on 20 March 2022. \c\c Colombia – On 13 February 2022, Colombia's President Ivan Duque instructed its Chancellery to contact all Colombians registered as residing in Ukraine to offer them repatriation assistance. Duque has rejected any attempt to use force to limit any country from deciding whether or not to join NATO. \c\c Croatia – On 19 January 2022, Croatia's Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, speaking to the Sabor, said that the situation in the east of Ukraine was very worrying and the most tense since 2014 and told: "Croatia does not want the situation to escalate and it will react clearly and resolutely to prevent any instability". On 25 January 2022, Croatia's President Zoran Milanović, noting what he called NATO's military build-up in the region and the Biden administration's "inconsistent and dangerous conduct" in international security affairs and stressing his role as Croatia's commander-in-chief, told the press, "We do not have any bearing on this and we will not have anything to do with this. I guarantee this. Croatia will not send any troops in case of an escalation. On the contrary, it will recall all troops, to the last Croatian soldier." Milanović went on to say that an "arrangement to meet Russia's security interests" ought to be found and that the acute crisis over Ukraine was "primarily determined by the dynamics of the US domestic politics". On the same day, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković reacted to the president's remarks by saying that on hearing those he thought it was being said "by some Russian official"; he also offered apologies to Ukraine and its government for Milanović's accusation of Ukraine as "one of the most corrupt states" and reiterated that Croatia supported Ukraine's territorial integrity and no Croat troops were in Ukraine, while the president's statement "had nothing whatsoever to do with the policy of the government of the Republic of Croatia". \c\c Czech Republic – On 26 January 2022, the Czech government decided to donate 4,006 152-mm artillery shells, for DANA howitzers, worth 36.6 million korunas, to Ukraine. \c\c Denmark – On 13 January 2022, Denmark sent four F-16 fighter jets and a frigate with a crew of 160 people to the Baltic states to reinforce the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence and patrol the sea. \c\c Estonia,  Latvia and  Lithuania – On 10 January 2022, Lithuania′s State Defense Council was convened to discuss the Russian-Ukrainian tensions. In response to the aggressive Russian military behaviour, the council decided to increase the number of troops and speed up military modernization plans. On 17 January, Latvia increased the military presence in the eastern part of the country. On 19 January, the Prime Minister of Estonia announced an extraordinary increase of defense spending by €380 million for the current fiscal year. The Baltic states also decided to accelerate their own acquisition of arms, including the joint rocket artillery system. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have also requested to increase the military deployments of NATO and American troops in the Baltics in order to deter the aggressive Russian behaviour. \c\c Finland and  Sweden – Russian proposals that NATO would not accept new members received strong criticism by Sweden and Finland who have been maintaining neutrality. In January 2022, both President of Finland Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin insisted on Finland's right to decide what alliances it can join. Sweden expressed the same position that it is only up to the Swedish people to decide whether Sweden should join NATO. Russian threats have sparked the debate in both countries whether they should apply for NATO membership. On 13 January, Swedish Armed Forces announced that they were deploying troops to the strategic island of Gotland, as a response to unusual Russian military activity. \c\c France – In April 2021, French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian, during a phone conversation with Ukrainian Minister for Foreign Affairs  Dmytro Kuleba, noted that France was anxiously monitoring the withdrawal of Russian troops to the borders of Ukraine and the temporarily occupied territories. He assured of France's continued support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The head of French diplomacy especially noted Ukraine's prudent and wise actions in the current situation. \c\c Germany – In April 2021, during a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded that Russia reduce its military presence near Ukraine's borders. In December 2021, German chancellor Olaf Scholz warned of "consequences" for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Russian natural gas pipeline project operated by Gazprom, which delivers natural gas to Germany. In January 2022, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned that "any further escalation would carry a high price for the Russian regime — economic, political and strategic". Germany has been maintaining the policy of not providing Ukraine with lethal weapons. German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said that Germany wants to "de-escalate" tensions and that supplying weapons would "not be helpful". Ukraine also claimed that the German administration blocks the supply of arms though NATO. On 21 January 2022, it was reported that Germany blocked Estonia from exporting weapons of German-origin. Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks has called Germany's relationship with Russia (and China) as "immoral and hypocritical". On 26 January, Germany announced that it was going to ship 5,000 helmets to Ukraine, while reaffirming that it wasn\'t going to supply any lethal weapon. The mayor of Kyiv and former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko described this offer as "a joke". \c\c Hungary – Hungarian Defence Minister Tibor Benkő declared that there is no need for NATO to deploy its troops in Hungary. \c\c India – On 28 January 2022, the spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs Arindam Bagchi stated that the situation in Ukraine and the high-level discussions between Russia and the US were being closely monitored. The statement called "for a peaceful resolution of the situation through sustained diplomatic efforts for long term peace and stability in the region and beyond". On 29 January it was reported that the Indian Embassy in Ukraine had asked all Indians living there – mostly students in medical colleges – to register themselves so that it could provide information in a swift manner. Unlike other states, India did not evacuate its diplomats. The Indian Express highlighted the Indian Government's difficult situation: on one hand, it was concerned about Russia's "muscle-flexing", but with almost 60 per cent of India's military supplies being Russian-manufactured and with the ongoing military stand-off with China, it did not want to jeopardise its close military ties with Moscow; on the other hand, the US and Europe were also important strategic partners. Indian media outlets noted how hostility and sanctions against Russia would create problems for the country's S-400 missile deal and likely "push Moscow in the direction of Beijing, hence strengthening the Chinese". \c\c Israel – In late January 2022, Israel considered airlifting thousands of Jews out of Ukraine. On 11 February 2022, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement urging Israeli citizens and diplomats to consider leaving the country. In February 2022, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel claimed Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid "reiterates rhetoric of Russian propaganda", after Lapid said that Israeli officials "don’t see a violent confrontation soon" between Ukraine and Russia. The Israeli Foreign Ministry subsequently summoned the Ukrainian Ambassador for an official reprimand. On 13 February 2022, The Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs has stated that Israel's official policy in the crisis is in support of Ukraine and the West. Israel refused to provide Ukraine with batteries for its Iron Dome's missile-defense system over worries it would damage Israel–Russia relations. \c\c Italy – On 3 February, during his second inauguration speech, President of Italy Sergio Mattarella said he could not accept "the winds of confrontation once again blowing across a continent that ha[d] experienced the tragedies of the First and Second World Wars". Prime Minister Mario Draghi underlined the importance of working towards a de-escalation of tensions, in light of the serious consequences that an aggravation of the crisis would have. On 11 February 2022, in Riga to meet his Latvian counterpart, Artis Pabriks, the Italian Defence Minister Lorenzo Guerini called for "a constructive dialogue" with Russia to ease tensions. On 13 February, the Italian government declared to be ready to deploy 1,000 soldiers on NATO's Eastern border. Italy's foreign affairs minister Luigi Di Maio travelled to Kyiv on 15 February 2022 to meet his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, while on 17 February, he had a bilateral meeting with the Russian foreign affairs minister Sergey Lavrov. In Moscow, Di Maio stated that "Italy has always been committed to the front row for a diplomatic solution. [...] Russia and Ukraine can count on Italy to reach a diplomatic solution". \c\c Japan – Prime Minister of Japan Kishida Fumio said he and Biden would work closely to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine and "keep close contact with other allies and partners and continue communicating on the point that any attack will be met with strong action." In a tweet, Biden said it was "an honor to meet with Prime Minister Kishida to further strengthen the US-Japan Alliance — the cornerstone of peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the world."
