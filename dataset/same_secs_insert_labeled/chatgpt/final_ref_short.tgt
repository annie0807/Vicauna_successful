[KEEP] Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions.

[KEEP] Schools were also shut starting in April. [KEEP] Remengesau eventually suspended travel to Palau. [KEEP] <Timeline> \c\c [KEEP] The order also quarantined all non-citizens who recently entered the country for fourteen days. [KEEP] <Timeline> \c\cOn 1 April 2021 Palau and Taiwan established a "travel bubble", allowing people to travel between the two countries, with restrictions. [KEEP] <Timeline> \c\cPalau registered its first case of COVID-19 on 31 May 2021. [KEEP] Whipps Jr. also highlighted that the majority of the population had been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. [KEEP] <Timeline> \c\cOn 11 June 2021, a second case is reported. [KEEP] <Timeline> \c\cPalauans began receiving COVID-19 vaccines in 2021. [KEEP] As a member of the Compact of Free Association with the United States, Palau has received vaccines from Operation Warp Speed. [KEEP] According to the Ministry of Health, vaccination started on 3 January and as of 12 April 40% of the population was fully vaccinated. [KEEP] By 26 May, an estimated 96% of adults (18 and over) in the country had been fully vaccinated. [KEEP] By the time the first case was detected, 97% of the adult population was vaccinated, about 70% of all Palauans. [KEEP] Plans were also announced to start vaccinating adolescents from 12 to 17. [ADD] <Vaccination> \c\cBy early August, 65% of 12 to 17 year olds had at least one dose of the vaccine, resulting in 80% of the eligible population being fully vaccinated.
[KEEP] Egypt—Russia relations (Russian: Российско-египетские отношения) refer to bilateral relations between Egypt and Russia. [KEEP] Diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Egypt were established on August 26, 1943. [KEEP] Egypt has an embassy in Moscow, while Russia has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate-general in Alexandria. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cRelations between Russia and Egypt have a long history, dating back to before the 16th century. [KEEP] Early on, they were centered on the Russian government's and the Russian Church's support for the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. [KEEP] As early as in 1556, Patriarch Joachim of Alexandria sent a letter to the Russian Tzar Ivan IV,  asking the Orthodox monarch to provide some material assistance for the Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, which had suffered from the Turks. [KEEP] In 1558, the Czar sent to Egypt a delegation led by archdeacon Gennady, who, however, died in Constantinople before he could reach Egypt. [KEEP] From then on, the embassy was headed by a Smolensk merchant, Vasily Poznyakov. [KEEP] Poznyakov's delegation visited Alexandria, Cairo, and Sinai, brought the patriarch a fur coat and an icon sent by the Tzar. [KEEP] Poznyakov's  account of its two and half years\' travels, which may have  been the first ever Russian first-hand African trip report,  became popular among Russian readers for centuries to follow. [KEEP] <History> \c\cRussia continued to provide support to Egyptian Christians for centuries to come. [KEEP] <History> \c\cIn the 1950s, Gamal Abdel Nasser's independent and anti-imperialist policy earned him enthusiastic support from the Communist government of the USSR. [KEEP] In 1955, Egypt  made a major arms deal with Soviet Union, and from then, teams of Egyptian officers were trained in Eastern Bloc countries. [KEEP] Czechoslovak instructors also came in 1956, to train Egyptian personnel in the use of Soviet weapons. [KEEP] When France attacked Egypt during Suez Crisis, USSR threatened to use destructive weapons i.e. nuclear weapons for the defense of Egypt. [KEEP] The degree of the Soviet approval of the Egyptian leader's policies culminated, rather controversially, in the award of the highest Soviet decoration, the star of the Hero of the Soviet Union with the Order of Lenin  to Nasser during Nikita Khrushchev's visit to the country in 1964. [KEEP] <History> \c\cDuring the Nasser years, many young Egyptians studied in Soviet universities and military schools. [KEEP] Among them was the future president, Hosni Mubarak, who went for training in a military pilot school in Kyrgyzstan. [KEEP] During the War of Attrition, USSR sent 10-15000 servicemen to operate the air defense of Egypt against Israeli air attacks. [KEEP] <History> \c\c [KEEP] The relationship went sour within years after the death of Nasser, when the new president, Anwar Sadat, started re-orienting the country toward the West. [KEEP] On May 27, 1971, a friendship treaty was signed between the two countries, but relations were nevertheless declining. [KEEP] In July 1972, it was claimed the Egyptian government expelled Soviet military advisors from Egypt, (however new research indicates that this was disinformation to hide Egypt's offensive plans), and captured Egyptian documents demonstrate that Soviet advisors continued in their previous roles of training Egyptian troops, and were certainly present during the war in 1973. [KEEP] During the Yom Kippur War , Soviet Union sent several thousands of tonnes of aid to Egypt. [KEEP] Brezhnev threatened to intervene on behalf of Egypt if Israel broke the ceasefire. [KEEP] Lieutenant General Anatoly Pushkin claimed that 1500 Soviet pilots and air defense experts engaged in combat for Egypt during the war. [KEEP] In March 1976 Egypt abrogated the friendship treaty, and relations between the two countries were damaged once again when Egypt supported the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan when the USSR invaded in 1979. [KEEP] In September 1981, these relations were severed by the Egyptian government, accusing Soviet leadership of trying to undermine Sadat's leadership in retaliation to the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. [KEEP] Relations were reestablished under president Hosni Mubarak in 1984, and Alexander Belonogov became the Ambassador. [KEEP] In February 1989, Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Shevardnadze visited Egypt. [KEEP] <History> \c\cIntergovernmental relations improved after the fall of Communism in the USSR, and Russia's appearance as an independent political actor. [KEEP] <History> \c\cIn April 2005, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, visited Egypt, and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak visited Russia in April 2008. [KEEP] Both countries agreed to work together to help Egypt create a nuclear program which is mostly for civilian purposes. [KEEP] In May 2013, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi visited Russia. [KEEP] <History> \c\cRelations between the two countries improved even further following the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office in July 2013. [KEEP] From 2009 to 2018, Russia accounted for 31% of Egypt's imports of major weapons. [KEEP] <History - [KEEP] After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cIn November 2013, Egypt's then Defense Minister Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy met with their Russian counterparts, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov who were on a visit to Cairo. [KEEP] It was the first meeting of its kind since the Soviet era. [KEEP] <History - [KEEP] After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cSince then, Egyptian and Russian leaders have exchanged two rounds of four-way visits in both Cairo and Moscow. [KEEP] Sisi went to Russia twice in 2014: in February, when he was still Egypt's defense minister, and in August after his election as president. [KEEP] The February meeting was Sisi's first visit abroad following Mohamed Morsi's removal, during which Russian president Vladimir Putin offered him Russia's backing in his race for the presidency of Egypt before Sisi even officially announced his campaign. [KEEP] <History - After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cSisi made his second visit on August 12 at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, and it was his first to a non-Arab or African country since his inauguration as President two months earlier. [KEEP] During the visit, both him and Putin agreed on boosting bilateral cooperation between the two countries. [KEEP] Putin promised to speed up arms sales to Egypt. [KEEP] "We are actively developing our military and technological cooperation," Putin told Sisi. [KEEP] He added that a corresponding protocol was signed in March and that weapons are being delivered to Egypt. [KEEP] Additionally, both leaders have discussed plans to establish a Russian industrial zone in the New Suez Canal project that was recently inaugurated by Sisi, as well as another plan to renew and redevelop important projects that were established by the former Soviet Union. [KEEP] <History - [KEEP] After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cIn September 2014, a preliminary deal was reached between both countries to buy arms worth $3.5 billion from Russia, despite Western sanctions on Moscow as a result of its involvement in the war in Donbass. [KEEP] <History - [KEEP] After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cAs a result of the Metrojet Flight 9268 crash on October 31, 2015, which carried 224 passengers on board toward Russia, both countries were planning investigating the crash. [KEEP] <History - [KEEP] After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cOn [KEEP] November 28, 2015, Egypt and Russia signed a deal which would allow Russian and Egyptian warplanes to use each other's airbases and airspace. [KEEP] On 11 December 2017, during President Vladimir Putin's visit to Cairo, the two countries signed agreements in which Russia would build Egypt's first nuclear reactor, and supply nuclear fuel for the same. [KEEP] It was also agreed that a "Russian Industrial Zone" would be built along the Suez Canal, explained by Putin as being "the biggest regional center for producing Russian products onto the markets of the Middle-East and North Africa." [KEEP] <History - After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cRussia supports Syrian government in the Syrian civil war, and intervened militarily in its favor in 2015. [KEEP] Egypt also supports the Syrian government in the Civil War. [KEEP] In 2020, Egypt has reportedly dispatched 150 troops to help Syrian government. [KEEP] Egypt is openly backing House of Representatives in the ongoing Libyan Civil War, while the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group is assisting the House of Representatives\' forces. [KEEP] <History - International collaborations> \c\cIn summer 2020, Egypt received five Su-35 jets, despite the American threatening with sanctions. [KEEP] However, the Russian journalist, Ivan Safronov, who revealed the transaction was detained for disclosing a state secret. [KEEP] As of 2015[update] Egypt is the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroad—a basic vacation package including flight, hotel and meals can be purchased for as little as US$1,000. [ADD] <Tourism> \c\cIn August 2021, direct commercial flights between Russia and Egypt resumed for the first time since the Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing in 2015, which killed 224 people, most of whom were Russian tourists. [ADD] A Rossiya Airlines passenger plane landed in Sharm El Sheikh carrying 518 passengers, and was welcomed with a water cannon salute, roses and flags.
[KEEP] The 2021 Algeria wildfires are multiple wildfires happening in Algeria since 9 August 2021, and have killed 65 people (37 civilians and 28 soldiers). [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cOn [KEEP] 9 August 2021, many fires started up in the Kabyle region and elsewhere, and Algerian authorities sent soldiers to help citizens with the blazes and evacuations. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cOn [KEEP] 10 August 2021, multiple fires have burned Mediterranean trees, destroying olive trees and killing cattle and chickens. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cMany distant villages have very limited water. [KEEP] Some villagers fled, while others tried to hold back the flames themselves, using buckets, branches and rudimentary tools. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\c [KEEP] The firefighting aircraft were not available. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\c
[KEEP] The Lebanese liquidity crisis is an ongoing financial crisis affecting the nation of Lebanon, starting in August 2019, which was further exacerbated by both the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon (which began in 2020) and the 2020 Beirut port explosion. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cSince 1997, the Lebanese pound has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1,507.5 LBP per USD. [KEEP] In August 2019, due to various financial hardships, especially the growing probability that the Lebanese government will default on maturing debt obligations, the black market exchange rate started diverging from the official exchange rate. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the black market exchange rate reached 1,600 LBP per USD, and increased to 3,000 LBP per USD in April 2020, 14,000 LBP per USD in March 2021 and 15,200 LBP per USD in June 2021. [KEEP] The USD black market exchange rate continues to fluctuate substantially due to devaluation of the Lebanese pound caused by acute USD shortages within Lebanon. [KEEP] Consumer goods prices have increased by 580% since October resulting from the worst economic crisis in decades. [KEEP] This economic crisis made Lebanon's gross domestic product fall to about 44 billion USD from about 55 billion USD the year before. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cThe fall of the exchange rate caused the 2019–2021 Lebanese protests, which ultimately resulted in the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet. [KEEP] <Consequences> \c\cPrime minister Hassan Diab stated that the country would default on its Eurobond debt and seek out restructuring agreements amid a spiraling financial crisis that has affected foreign currency reserves. [KEEP] Lebanon was due to pay a US$1.2 billion Eurobond on 9 March 2020, with another 700 million USD expected to mature in April and a further 600 million USD in June. [KEEP] Due to the lack of foreign currencies, the prime minister said that the reserves had fallen to "a worrying and dangerous level which pushes the Lebanese government to suspend payment of the 9 March Eurobond maturity because of a need for these funds." [KEEP] <Consequences> \c\c [KEEP] The head of research at Bank Audi stated that Lebanese banks owned 12.7 billion USD of the country's outstanding 30 billion USD Eurobonds as of January 2020. [KEEP] The central bank held 5.7 billion USD and the remainder was owned by foreign creditors. [KEEP] <Consequences> \c\c [KEEP] The debt to GDP ratio sits at 170% as of April 2020. [KEEP] The default is the first one in the history of the country. [KEEP] Foreign currency inflows have slowed and Lebanon's pound has dropped in value compared to the dollar and other currencies. [KEEP] The nation's commercial banks have imposed tough restrictions on dollar withdrawals and transfers to maintain reserves. [KEEP] Due to this Lebanon's sovereign debt became junk rated. [KEEP] <Consequences> \c\c [KEEP] The Lebanese pound was pegged at around 1,500 per US$1; since October 2019, it has dropped to a third of this value, reaching 4,500 per US$1 on black markets on 28 April 2020. [KEEP] Two weeks before that, the currency sat at around 3,000 to US$1. [KEEP] Official valuations are different from the ones on the black market. [KEEP] One bank allowed depositors to withdraw Lebanese pounds from their dollar account at 2,000 to US$1. [KEEP] This caused significant anger towards the banks. [KEEP] The prime minister has sharply criticized the governor of the central bank Riad Salameh over its performance. [KEEP] <Consequences> \c\c [KEEP] The shortage of U.S. dollars, which are used in everyday transactions in Lebanon, and the crash in the value of the pound have undercut the country's ability to pay for imports, including essentials such as wheat and oil. [KEEP] Banks have stopped giving short-term loans to businesses and no longer provide them with U.S. dollars for imports, forcing people to turn to the black markets. [KEEP] There is also significant inflation, which caused a massive loss of purchasing power and an increase in poverty. [KEEP] The price of foule or ful, a fava bean common in the region, was up 550% in March 2020 over a year earlier. [KEEP] Sugar has seen an increase of 670%, while wheat, tea, rice, and cigarettes have all gone up nearly 1000% over the same period. [KEEP] <Consequences> \c\cThis liquidity crisis also created a barrier to every single person who had accounts in Lebanese banks; as they are unable to access their deposits. [KEEP] Not only are they unable to access their deposits, but they are unable to withdraw any USD directly. [KEEP] They can withdraw them in the national currency. [KEEP] These depositors needed to preserve the value of their savings, especially following press reports about restructuring of the banking sector. [KEEP] They therefore turned to buying real estate. [KEEP] For example, revenues from land sales of the major real estate developer, Solidere company, soared from nearly $1.3 million to $234.5 million. [KEEP] Also, these depositors turned to buying shares in Solidere company, which lead to a rise of 500% in it between the start of the liquidity crisis and April 2021. [KEEP] <Consequences> \c\cOn 1 June 2021, the World Bank released a report which warned that the economic crisis in Lebanon would risk becoming one of the three most severe since the mid-19th century, if its "bankrupt economic system, which benefited a few for so long" weren\'t reformed. [ADD] <Consequences> \c\cOn 11 August 2021, the Central Bank of Lebanon ended fuel subsidies, announcing that they would instead offer "credit lines for fuel imports based on the market price for the Lebanese pound".
[KEEP] A federal election will take place on Sepetmber 20, 2021, to elect members of the House of Commons to the 44th Canadian Parliament. [KEEP] The latest possible date of the vote is determined by the fixed-date provisions of the Canada Elections Act, which requires federal elections to be held on the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year after the polling day of the previous election. [KEEP] Since the current government is a minority government, the election has been before the scheduled date if Parliament is dissolved by the Governor General of Canada due to a motion of no confidence in the government or at the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada for a snap election. [KEEP] A by-election in Haldimand-Norfolk was cancelled because of the election call. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cThe 2019 federal election resulted in the Liberals, led by incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, losing their majority but winning the most seats. [KEEP] The Conservatives continued as the Official Opposition with Andrew Scheer temporarily remaining as Leader of the Opposition until announcing his resignation, triggering a leadership election. [KEEP] The Bloc Québécois became the third party. [KEEP] The New Democrats lost seats but maintained official party status and, although the Greens increased their seats in the House of Commons, they ultimately failed to achieve the required number of MPs—twelve—for official party status. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cAll leaders initially announced that they would continue as the heads of their respective parties into the next session of Parliament. [KEEP] However, Elizabeth May said that she may not lead the Greens into the 44th election, and she ultimately resigned as Green Party leader on November 4, 2019. [KEEP] On November 6, 2019, the Conservative caucus decided to not adopt a measure which would have given them the ability to remove Andrew Scheer as leader. [KEEP] His leadership would still have been reviewed during the party's April 2020 convention However, on December 12, Scheer announced his intention to resign as leader. [KEEP] He stayed on until his successor, Erin O\'Toole, was chosen and remains as the MP for Regina—Qu\'Appelle. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn [KEEP] August 15, 2021, Prime Minister Trudeau asked Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve parliament and call an election for September 20, 2021.

[KEEP] The Panjshir conflict[citation needed] is a political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban which began following the Fall of Kabul (2021). [KEEP] As of August 2021, no military conflict had occurred in Panjshir Province and a negotiated end to the political impasse has been discussed. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\c [KEEP] The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is a state that is the notional continuation of the regime that previously governed Afghanistan. [KEEP] It exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". [KEEP] <Background> \c\cPrior to the Fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. [KEEP] There, they were joined by commanders of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. [KEEP] <History> \c\cOn [KEEP] 17 August 2021, Amrullah Saleh — citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan — declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there.

[KEEP] The attacks have left 439 people dead and more than 100 others injured. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cSeveral major attacks occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020. [KEEP] However, this is the first time that over 100 civilians were killed in single incidents, marking the January attack and 21 March attack as the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. [KEEP] It is the first year in which attacks were carried out with frequency in the country. [KEEP] As of August, attacks were carried out every month of 2021. [KEEP] The previous biggest attack in Niger against civilians was [KEEP] the 12 December 2020 [KEEP] Toumour attack, which resulted in 28 people killed. [KEEP] Both the December 2020 and January 2021 attacks were carried out during Niger's municipal and regional elections, while the February bombing specifically targeted members of the electoral commission. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn the same day as the January attacks, two Algerian soldiers were killed in a shooting in Algeria and two French soldiers were killed in a bombing in Mali. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cThe January attacks occurred in two villages, Tchombangou (at 14°49′48′′N 01°48′45′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.83000°N 1.81250°E\ufeff / 14.83000; 1.81250) and Zaroumdareye (at 14°54′21′′N 01°46′36′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.90583°N 1.77667°E\ufeff / 14.90583; 1.77667), which are seven kilometres apart, and initially left 79 people dead and 75 wounded.

[KEEP] A day after the attack, 21 more people were found dead and others succumbed to their injuries on Tchombangou, bringing the total death toll to 100. [KEEP] On 8 January UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman said that 73 people had been killed in the village of Tchouma Bangou and 32 in Zaroumdareye, making the total death toll 105. [KEEP] The government of Niger dispatched soldiers to the border after the attacks. [KEEP] The attackers are Islamist militants who arrived in the villages while crossing the border from Mali; however, the exact terrorist organization who carried out the attacks is not clear so far. [KEEP] <Attacks - January> \c\cSome time before the massacre, two militants who were seen in the area were killed by the local villagers. [KEEP] Those attacks are suspected to be in retaliation for those killings, according to the country's interior minister. [KEEP] <Attacks - January> \c\cOn [KEEP] 21 February, seven members of the electoral commission were killed and three others wounded in a landmine explosion in Tillabéri.

[KEEP] The Panjshir conflict is a conflict between the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (controlled by the Taliban) on the other. [KEEP] It began on 17 August 2021 following the Fall of Kabul. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\c [KEEP] The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". [KEEP] <Background> \c\cThe population of the Panjshir valley consists of a majority of ethnic Tajik people, as opposed to the majority of the Taliban, who are Pashtuns. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cThe valley is well known for its natural defences. [KEEP] Surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, Panjshir never fell to the Soviets during the invasion of the 1980's nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990's. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Amrullah Saleh—citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan—declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. [KEEP] His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi along with the Afghan Embassy in Dushanbe. [KEEP] At around the same time, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud. [KEEP] Local civilians also responded to his mobilization calls. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cPrior to the Fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. [KEEP] There, they were joined by commanders and soldiers of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. [KEEP] Most of them regrouped at Baghlan Province's Andarab District before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from  Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan. [KEEP] According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid August 2021. [KEEP] Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms. [KEEP] By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a "handful of armoured humvees" in the valley. [KEEP] <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and Anti-Taliban militias> \c\cThere are difference between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan which was supportive of the Taliban. [KEEP] As a result, Massoud was more willing to negiotiate with the Taliban. [KEEP] By 22 August, the resistance also confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban on their own, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. [KEEP] <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and Anti-Taliban militias> \c\cAccording to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. [KEEP] <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and Anti-Taliban militias> \c\cAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy made prior to the Fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars. [KEEP] Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial material of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. [KEEP] <Disposition of forces - Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan> \c\cAs of 17 August, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—"under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. [KEEP] On 18 August, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anabah in Panjshir. [KEEP] By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training. [ADD] <Timeline - Panjshir Province> \c\cOn 22 August In response, the IEA announced "hundreds" of its forces had been dispatched to the Panjshir Valley. [ADD] , the Islamic Emirate gave the opposition forces a four hour ultimatum to surrender. [ADD] In a statement to Al Arabiya, Massoud rejected the ultimatum. [KEEP] The three districts had reportedly experienced a revolt, led by a local police chief, after Taliban had conducted unpopular house-to-house searches. [KEEP] Bismillah Khan Mohammadi announced the operational success of the districts being recaptured via Twitter. [KEEP] <Timeline - Baghlan Province> \c\cAudiovisual reports of the events circulated on social media and were reported by Pajhwok Afghan News. [KEEP] Later on the 20th, it was reported that the forces, led by Abdul Hamid Dadgar, had recaptured Andarab, though the Taliban had not yet commented. [KEEP] <Timeline - Baghlan Province> \c\cA source within the Panjshir resistance consequently confirmed their involvement in the operations in Baghlan Province, and stated that they planned on seizing a northern highway which could allow them to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. [KEEP] Taliban social media accounts called the counteroffensive a "betrayal" of the amnesty the Taliban had offered. [KEEP] It was reported on 22 August 2021 that Taliban fighters have been sent to the Keshnabad area of Andarab in order to kidnap the children whose parents are a part of anti-Taliban forces. [KEEP] <Timeline - Baghlan Province> \c\cAs of August 2021, a negotiated end to the political impasse has been attempted, with Saleh calling for a "peace deal" with the Taliban. [KEEP] On 18 August, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, indicated the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government as a means of diffusing the stalemate. [KEEP] <Resolution> \c\cOn 21 August 2021, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to "discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans". [KEEP] <Resolution> \c\cOn [KEEP] 22 August 2021, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possible mediate. [KEEP] Meanwhile, resistance spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary informed the Agence France-Presse that Ahmad Massoud's group would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implemented a system of "decentralisation" and "equal rights" across the country. [KEEP] <Resolution> \c\cThe USA and Western forces are commented as lowly supportive of this movement due to ongoing evacuation of Kabul depending fully on Talibans\' benevolence. [KEEP] Massoud Washington Post op-ed requesting Western support have been analysed as an evidence of the absence of direct communication and support between the resistance and the US government.

[KEEP] The Panjshir conflict is a conflict between the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (controlled by the Taliban). [KEEP] It began on 17 August 2021 following the Fall of Kabul and Amrullah Saleh assuming the Afghan presidency and declaring the resistance. [KEEP] Ten days later, both sides declared a ceasefire and agreed to solve all problems through dialogue. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\c [KEEP] The former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". [KEEP] <Background> \c\cThe population of the Panjshir valley consists of a majority of ethnic Tajik people, while the majority of the Taliban are Pashtuns. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cThe valley is well known for its natural defences. [KEEP] Surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, Panjshir never fell to the Soviets during the invasion of the 1980s nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990s. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Saleh—citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan—declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. [KEEP] His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi along with the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Dushanbe. [KEEP] On 23 August 2021, Massoud made contact with unnamed American lawmakers. [KEEP] <Saleh and Massoud announcements> \c\cPrior to the fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. [KEEP] There, they were joined by Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, including commandos, ex-Mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and other anti-Taliban activists. [KEEP] Most of them regrouped at Baghlan Province's Andarab District before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from  Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan. [KEEP] According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid August 2021. [KEEP] Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms. [KEEP] By 22 August 2021, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a "handful of armoured humvees" in the valley. [KEEP] <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and anti-Taliban militias> \c\cThere are difference between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan which was supportive of the Taliban. [KEEP] As a result, Massoud was more willing to negiotiate with the Taliban. [KEEP] By 22 August 2021, the resistance also confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban on their own, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. [KEEP] According to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to five helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. [KEEP] <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and anti-Taliban militias> \c\cOn 23 [KEEP] August 2021, it was reported that BM-21 Grads were acquired as a part of its arsenal. [KEEP] <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and anti-Taliban militias> \c\cAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the US Military Academy made prior to the Fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars. [KEEP] Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial materiel of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. [KEEP] <Disposition of forces - Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan> \c\cAround 17 August 2021, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud, along with local civilians who had responded to his mobilization calls. [KEEP] At the time, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—"under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. [KEEP] On 18 August 2021, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anabah in Panjshir. [KEEP] By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training.

[KEEP] <Timeline> \c\cA source within the Panjshir resistance consequently confirmed their involvement in the operations in Baghlan Province, and stated that they planned on seizing a northern highway which could allow them to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. [KEEP] Taliban social media accounts called the counteroffensive a "betrayal" of the amnesty the Taliban had offered. [KEEP] It was reported on 22 August 2021 that Taliban fighters had been sent to the Keshnabad area of Andarab in order to kidnap the children of anti-Taliban forces. [KEEP] <Timeline> \c\cAlso, the Islamic Emirate gave the opposition forces a four hour ultimatum to surrender. [KEEP] In a statement to Al Arabiya, Massoud rejected the ultimatum. [KEEP] In response, the IEA announced "hundreds" of its forces had been dispatched to the Panjshir Valley. [KEEP] It was reported on 23 August 2021 that talks between Taliban representatives and Panjshir leaders did not work. [KEEP] Ali Maisam Nazary, spokesman for the resistance, said that the Taliban made demands for Massoud to accept no elections with a centralized government, which Massoud rejected as he wanted a future government to be decentralized, which respect civil and semi-autonomy rights. [KEEP] <Timeline> \c\cAn unidentified Taliban spokesperson proclaimed in a statement that "hundreds of Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate are heading towards the state of Panjshir to control it, after local state officials refused to hand it over peacefully".

[KEEP] On 24 August 2021, according to Deccan Herald, Panjshir resistance fighters retook control of Banu and Dih Salah districts, while Puli Hisar remained under Taliban control. [KEEP] Saleh publicly warned via Twitter that Taliban fighters in Andarab were blocking humanitarian assistance for civilians trying to escape from the fighting and called it a "humanitarian disaster". [KEEP] On the following day, Massoud's forces claimed to have ambushed a Taliban convoy in Andarab, destroying a critical bridge and inflicting heavy losses on the Islamists. [KEEP] <Timeline> \c\cOn 24 August 2021, Major Wazir Akbar, an ex-Afghan commando who has joined the Panjshir-based resistance fighters, reported an attempted Taliban incursion at Anjuman Pass through Badakhshan province, which was repelled with heavy Taliban casualties.

[KEEP] On 18 August, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, indicated the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government as a means of ending the stalemate. [KEEP] <Resolution> \c\cOn 21 August 2021, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to "discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans". [KEEP] <Resolution> \c\cOn [KEEP] 22 August 2021, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possibly mediate.

[KEEP] On 23 August 2021, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that while Taliban fighters are being sent to Panjshir, the Taliban are willing to seek peaceful means to end the conflict. [KEEP] <Resolution> \c\cAs of 23 August, there has been no public support from the international community, as the US and other potential allies focus on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul, and seek the Taliban's cooperation to do so. [KEEP] Massoud's op-ed in The Washington Post requesting Western support may be evidence of a lack of enthusiasm (for the resistance) in the US government. [KEEP] <Reactions> \c\cJournalists Carlotta Gall and Adam Nossiter wrote in The New York Times that the international community would be in a bind if they showed some form of support for the resistance because of the airlift operations. [KEEP] Abdul Matin Beyk suggested that other anti-Taliban forces are waiting to see if the Panjshir-based fighters will either resist to the end or keep considering negotiations from Taliban representatives.

[KEEP] An air ambulance landed on a nearby playing field at 2:13 p.m. to take Amess to hospital; the medical team already in attendance decided that his condition was not stable enough to transport Amess and continued to work at the scene instead. [KEEP] He died just before 3:00 p.m., at the age of 69. [KEEP] <Attack> \c\c [KEEP] The motivations of the attacker are unknown. [KEEP] Counter-terrorist police officers are involved in the early stages of the investigation. [KEEP] Essex Police said a "25-year-old man was quickly arrested after officers arrived at the scene on suspicion of murder and a knife was recovered".

[KEEP] A series of protests by the Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government began on 20 September 2021, triggered by the government's decision to ban Serbian license plates, and ended on 2 October 2021. [KEEP] The protests had mostly consisted of blocking traffic near border crossings. [KEEP] The ban meant that people who owned vehicles with Serbian license plates in Kosovo would have had to switch for Kosovar license plates at a government vehicle registration center. [KEEP] The ban intended to mirror the former ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia. [KEEP] The Republic of Serbia does not recognise the Republic of Kosovo and considers the Kosovo–Serbia border only temporary. [KEEP] The protests have led the relations between Serbia and Kosovo, which had been improving, to worsen. [KEEP] The Serbian Armed Forces are on heightened combat readiness as a result. [KEEP] Both sides have accused each other of great overreach. [KEEP] International powers have called for de–escalation, with Russia criticising Kosovo. [KEEP] On 30 September 2021, an agreement was reached to end the ban starting 4 October 2021, according to which the protests also ended on 2 October 2021. [KEEP] Kosovar license plates in Serbia and Serbian license plates in Kosovo now have their national symbols and country codes covered with a sticker. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cNorth Kosovo is majority Serb and has been a region largely opposed to an independent Kosovo, with frequent protests since Kosovo declared independence. [KEEP] It has not recognised the Government of Kosovo and has acted independently of it until the 2013 Brussels Agreement. [KEEP] According to the Brussels Agreement, by 2016 the Community of Serb Municipalities was to be formed. [KEEP] The Community would be a self–governing association of municipalities with a Serbian majority in Kosovo. [KEEP] As of 2021, it has not yet formed, because of the Government of Kosovo freezing the Brussels Agreement and its Constitutional Court declaring some parts of the agreement to be unconstitutional. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cUp until 2011, Serbia issued Serbian license plates for towns in North Kosovo. [KEEP] In 2011, Serbia agreed to stop issuing these license plates and that they should be changed for Republic of Kosovo (RKS) or the neutral Kosovo (KS) license plates. [KEEP] The KS license plates do not bear any state symbols. [KEEP] Serbia has allowed the KS license plates on its territory, but not the RKS license plates. [KEEP] The agreement lasted 5 years until 2016, when it was expected a better solution would be found. [KEEP] The same terms were renewed on 14 September 2016 and were valid until 14 September 2021. [KEEP] After 14 September 2021 the conditions remained the same, but a ban on Serbian license plates was issued in Kosovo on 20 September 2021. [KEEP] The KS license plates were also declared invalid by the Government of Kosovo which were used by some vehicles in Kosovo, including by owners who often had to travel across the Kosovo–Serbia border. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cThe motive of the Kosovan government in the ban had been to mirror the former, similar policy of the Serbian Government by which Republic of Kosovo(RKS) license plates had been banned since Kosovo declared independence, and vehicles with RKS license plates in Serbia had to switch them for temporary Serbian plates. [KEEP] Vehicles with Serbian license plates in Kosovo were supposed to, up to the 30 September 2021 Agreement in Brussels, have their Serbian license plates taken off and switched for Kosovar license plates at a government vehicle registration center. [KEEP] Drivers who had visited the country with Serbian license plates had to get temporary plates. [KEEP] The temporary plates costed a 5 euro (2021 value) tax and were valid for 60 days. [KEEP] The ban would have reportedly impacted around 9,500 vehicles with Serbian license plates in North Kosovo which were to have to wear permanent Kosovar license plates. [KEEP] This was originally supposed to be done after the 2011 agreement, but no attempts were made to enforce it. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cThe protests organised by the Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government began on 20 September 2021. [KEEP] On the same day, over 20 vehicles of the Kosovo Police, of which over 10 were armoured, came to the site of the protests. [KEEP] Hundreds of local ethnic Serbs had been protesting daily. [KEEP] They were blocking the roads leading to the two border crossings with Serbia in North Kosovo, near Jarinje and Brnjak, with vehicles and barricades reinforced by gravel. [KEEP] On 23 September 2021 the traffic block consisting of vehicles became 3 kilometres long on the Mitrovica–Raška road in Jarinje. [KEEP] Protesters were sleeping next to the protest sites in improvised tents. [KEEP] Representatives of the Serb List also attended the protests. [KEEP] <Protests> \c\c [KEEP] The protests had been mostly calm. [KEEP] However, on 25 September 2021, two government vehicle registration centers in Zvečan and Zubin Potok were attacked by arson, and allegedly with hand grenades that failed to explode. [KEEP] On 23 September 2021, the Kosovo Police was accused of injuring three people unrelated to the protests, two seriously, who are now in hospital. [KEEP] Kosovo has denied involvement and says that it's "disinformation". [KEEP] <Protests> \c\cAccording to the agreement between Kosovo and Serbia mediated by the European Union (EU) Representative for the Balkan–Pristina Dialogue Miroslav Lajčák in Brussels, reached on 30 September 2021, the Kosovar special police withdrew by 16:00 local time on 2 October 2021. [KEEP] Along with this, the barricades set up by the protesters were removed by local Serbs and the traffic blocks ended, leading to border traffic resuming. [KEEP] KFOR troops replaced the police units and will be present for the next two weeks. [KEEP] <Government responses - Serbia> \c\c [KEEP] The decision to ban Serbian license plates and the ongoing protests prompted Serbian authorities to raise the combat readiness of the Serbian Armed Forces on the border with Kosovo. [KEEP] The army started transporting military equipment to the border area, including its fighter jets and helicopters, and tanks, on 26 September 2021. [KEEP] The President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić has described Kosovo's license plate ban as a "criminal action". [KEEP] He made the withdrawal of Kosovar special police ROSU a condition for starting EU-mediated negotiations to resolve the dispute. [KEEP] <Government responses - Kosovo> \c\c [KEEP] The Prime Minister of Kosovo Albin Kurti has accused Serbia of "inciting and supporting" the attacks on government buildings. [KEEP] He also accused Serbia of "exploiting Kosovo citizens to provoke a serious international conflict." [KEEP] The attacks were described by the Interior Ministry of Kosovo as "having terrorist elements". [KEEP] The mayors of majority Serbian municipalities on 27 September also requested a withdrawal of the units and more KFOR prsence, citing the incident on 23 September 2021 when 3 Serbs were injured as a concern. [KEEP] The special police units withdrew as part of the 30 September 2021 Agreement in Brussels on 2 October 2021. [KEEP] <Agreement to end the ban> \c\cOn 30 September 2021, an agreement was reached in Brussels that effectively ended the ban on Serbian license plates, starting 08:00 local time, 4 October 2021. [KEEP] The agreement also effectively ended the ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia. [KEEP] The agreement is intended as a temporary solution. [KEEP] The solution is to cover the national symbols of Kosovo on Kosovar RKS license plates in Serbia, as well as to cover the national symbols of Serbia on Serbian license plates in Kosovo and [KEEP] their country codes RKS and SRB with a sticker. [ADD] Miroslav Lajčák said that "he trusts they will present concrete findings in 6 months", when negotiators and delegations will present their proposals for the permanent solution. [KEEP] Rudnica is a few kilometres away from the Kosovo–Serbia border. [KEEP] Russia will deploy air defense forces to Serbia for joint military exercises which will be held in October. [KEEP] On 27 September 2021, the NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, the Kosovo Force, stepped up the amount and duration of its patrols. [KEEP] <Reactions> \c\c
[KEEP] On 15 October 2021, Sir David Amess, a British Conservative Party politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for Southend West, died after being stabbed multiple times during a political surgery at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. [KEEP] Ali Harbi Ali, a 25-year-old male British citizen, was arrested at the scene and was later charged with murder and the preparation of terrorist acts. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cAmess was a long-serving politician who entered Parliament in 1983 as MP for Basildon. [KEEP] He had held no senior positions but was described by Nick Paton Walsh as an "instantly recognisable" member of the Conservative Party and had been knighted for his political and public service. [KEEP] He was a devout Catholic and a socially conservative politician who opposed abortion, supported capital punishment, and campaigned in favour of Brexit. [KEEP] He was a supporter of animal welfare and was one of the few Conservative MPs to support a ban on fox hunting. [KEEP] He also supported a campaign to award city status to Southend-on-Sea, Essex. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cFollowing the murder of MP Jo Cox on her way to a constituency surgery in 2016, Amess wrote in his 2020 autobiography that fears of similar attacks "rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians" and that he had faced harassment and insecurity at his home. [KEEP] MPs are protected by armed police when inside Parliament, with security tightened after the 2017 Westminster attack. [KEEP] They are generally not given police protection during surgeries, and they are normally accompanied by one member of staff only. [KEEP] After Cox's murder, parliamentary spending on MPs\' personal security rose from under £200,000 to £4.5 million in two years. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn 15 October 2021, Amess was at a one-to-one constituency meeting at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall on Eastwood Road North in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, where he was scheduled to meet with constituents from 10 am to 1 pm. [KEEP] He first met with constituents on the steps of the church and entered the hall at around 12:05 pm to speak with people who had arrived earlier. [KEEP] While inside the church hall, a man armed with a knife emerged from the group of constituents and stabbed him multiple times. [KEEP] <Attack> \c\cArmed units and medical and police helicopters arrived at the scene within minutes. [KEEP] The suspect waited inside the church hall, where he was arrested and a police cordon was set up. [KEEP] An air ambulance landed on Belfairs Sports Ground at 2:13 pm to take Amess to hospital, but the medical team decided that his condition was not stable enough to transport him and so continued to work on him at the scene. [KEEP] He was declared dead just before 3 pm. [KEEP] <Attack> \c\cCounter-terrorist police officers were involved in the early stages of the investigation. [KEEP] Essex Police said that a "25-year-old man was quickly arrested after officers arrived at the scene on suspicion of murder and a knife was recovered". [KEEP] At approximately 6:32 pm on 15 October 2021, Essex Police announced that the investigation had been handed over to the Counter Terrorism Command of London's Metropolitan Police Service. [KEEP] <Investigation> \c\cOn the evening of 16 October, the Metropolitan Police Service confirmed the suspect had been detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000, and that magistrates had extended the period the suspect could be held in custody for questioning until 22 October 2021. [KEEP] Just after midnight, police identified the stabbing as a terrorist incident potentially motivated by Islamic extremism. [KEEP] Police searched three addresses in London over the weekend following the stabbing. [RM] <Investigation> \c\cOn 21 October 2021, Ali Harbi Ali, a British-born national of Somali heritage was charged with the murder of Amess and the preparation of terrorist acts. [KEEP] In 2014, as a teenager, Ali was referred to the Prevent programme, Britain's voluntary programme for those thought at risk of radicalisation, from which he was referred on to the Channel Programme. [KEEP] He is believed to not have spent long in the programme, and he was not a "subject of interest" to MI5. [ADD] North London. [ADD] He lived in Kentish Town. <Investigation - Accused> \c\cOn [ADD] 21 October 2021, Ali Harbi Ali, a British-born national of Somali heritage was charged with the murder of Amess and the preparation of terrorist acts. [ADD] On 22 October, he appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from Belmarsh, during which he was remanded in custody. [KEEP] The safety of MPs during open, public constituency surgeries was debated by politicians. [KEEP] Calls to enact a law to crack down on online targeting of MPs and end anonymity were made. [KEEP] The Conservatives suspended political campaigning. [KEEP] <Reactions> \c\cA Catholic priest reported he was not allowed to enter the crime scene to administer the last rites for Amess. [KEEP] Following Amess's killing, British Catholic policymakers issued statements affirming Amess's commitment to his faith and lauding his achievements. [KEEP] Labour MP Mike Kane also sought to add an "Amess amendment" to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that would ensure Catholic priests access to crime scenes in order to administer the last rites. [KEEP] <Reactions> \c\cOn 16 October, Boris Johnson and the Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer, accompanied by Sir Lindsay Hoyle and the home secretary Priti Patel, laid wreaths at the church hall where Amess was killed. [KEEP] On 18 October, a minute's silence was held in the House of Commons before MPs paid tribute to Amess. [KEEP] That evening, a service of remembrance for Amess was held by MPs at St Margaret's Church, Westminster. [KEEP] The service, which included an address by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, was streamed live by the ITV News YouTube channel. [KEEP] MPs paid tribute in a book of condolence that was placed in the House of Commons Library, as well as in Westminster Hall and Portcullis House. [KEEP] Tributes were also laid at Belfairs Methodist Church Hall, where Amess was killed. [KEEP] <Reactions> \c\cIn the days following Amess's death, a number of MPs, including Conservative Chris Skidmore and Labour's Charlotte Nichols, voiced their support for a campaign to give Southend-on-Sea city status as a way of honouring Amess's memory; he had frequently spoken on the topic in Parliament. [KEEP] During tributes to Amess on 18 October, the Prime Minister announced that the Queen had agreed to Southend being given city status. [KEEP] <Reactions> \c\cAs a result of Amess's death, a by-election was triggered to fill his former seat.

[KEEP] Solar cycle 25 is the current solar cycle pattern of sunspot activity. [KEEP] It began in December 2019, with a smoothed minimum sunspot number of 1.8. [KEEP] It is expected to continue until about 2030. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cWidely varying predictions regarding the strength of cycle 25 ranged from very weak with suggestions of slow slide in to a Maunder minimum like state to a weak cycle similar to previous cycle 24 and even a strong cycle. [KEEP] Upton and Hathaway have predicted that the weakness of cycle 25 would make it part of the Modern Gleissberg Minimum. [KEEP] One published prediction (of a very weak cycle) was retracted due to fundamental errors. [KEEP] <Predictions> \c\c [KEEP] The Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel predicted in December 2019 that solar cycle 25 will be similar to solar cycle 24, with the preceding solar cycle minimum in April 2020 (± 6 months), and the number of sunspots reaching a (smoothed) maximum of 115 in July 2025 (± 8 months). [KEEP] This prediction is in line with the current general agreement in the scientific literature, which holds that solar cycle 25 will be weaker than average (i.e. weaker than during the exceptionally strong Modern Maximum). [KEEP] <Predictions> \c\cAs of April 2018, the Sun showed signs of a reverse magnetic polarity sunspot appearing and beginning this solar cycle. [KEEP] It is typical during the transition from one cycle to the next to experience a period where sunspots of both polarities exist (during the solar minimum). [KEEP] The polarward reversed polarity sunspots suggest that a transition to cycle 25 is in process. [KEEP] The first Cycle 25 sunspot may have appeared in early April 2018 or even December 2016. [KEEP] <Early signs> \c\cIn November 2019, two reversed polarity sunspots appeared, possibly signaling the onset of cycle 25. [KEEP] <Early signs> \c\cNandy et al., analyzed the polarity orientation of bipolar magnetic regions observed in December 2019 and concluded that magnetic regions with the underlying orientation of solar cycle 25 toroidal field component were brewing in the solar convection zone, representing early signs of the new cycle. [KEEP] <Early signs> \c\cSupersynoptic (time vs. solar latitude) map of the radial component of the solar magnetic field for Cycles 24-25 based on observations from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) shows magnetic activity of cycle 25 beginning November 2019 at about 30 degree latitudes in both solar hemispheres.

[KEEP] On November 5, 2021, a human crush occurred during the first night of the Astroworld Festival, a music event operated by rapper Travis Scott. [KEEP] Eight people died during the event with the cause of death still under investigation. [KEEP] A further twenty-three were hospitalized and more than 300 people were treated for injuries at the festival's field hospital. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cAstroworld Festival is an annual music festival run by American rapper Travis Scott, held in Houston, Texas. [KEEP] In 2019, three people were injured in a stampede at the Astroworld Festival. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cIn 2021, the festival had approximately 50,000 attendees. [KEEP] The Houston Fire Department had fifty-five in-service units present at the festival, including 367 police officers and 241 security officers. [KEEP] Earlier on November 5, hundreds of fans surged at the festival's perimeter in an attempt to get in, knocking over metal detectors. [KEEP] Scott's performance was live streamed on Apple Music. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn the first night of the Astroworld Festival, the appearance of Scott on the stage led people to push towards the stage en masse, leading to a crush. [KEEP] According to Houston Fire Chief Sam Peña, between 9:00 p.m. and 9:15 p.m., the crowd began "to compress toward the front of the stage". [KEEP] As people began to fall and get injured, additional panic ensued. [KEEP] Peña stated the most fatal events occurred after 9:30 p.m. [KEEP] The show's paramedics were seen performing CPR on unconscious attendees. [RM] At approximately 9:38 p.m., 17 people were transferred to hospitals. <Crush> \c\cScott, along with stage crew, paused during his 75-minute performance when he noticed attendees in distress near the stage. [ADD] At 9:38 p.m., officials declared a "mass causality event" and 17 people were transferred to hospitals. [ADD] Peña stated that medical personnel was "quickly overwhelmed" as the amount of injuries surged. [KEEP] Two members of Scott's staff approached him on stage, though he shooed them away and resumed his performance. [KEEP] A concertgoer was filmed informing a cameraman that "people are dying", but another audience member told him that the crowd would take care of it. [KEEP] <Crush> \c\cAt least eight people died, ranging from the ages of 16 to 23. [KEEP] The cause of death is still under investigation. [KEEP] <Victims> \c\cTwenty-three others were evacuated to local hospitals, including eleven people found in a state of cardiac arrest. [KEEP] Drug overdose is being investigated as a potential cause of cardiac arrest. [KEEP] In all, more than 300 people were treated for injuries in a field hospital at the festival itself. [KEEP] <Victims> \c\cAs a result, the second night on November 6 was cancelled. [KEEP] A reunification center was set up for families searching for relatives.

[KEEP] On 5 November 2021 a collision between a petrol fuel tanker and a lorry at a busy junction of Sierra Leone's capital and largest city Freetown resulted in an explosion and a fire that killed at least 101 people, and injured more than 100, overwhelming the city's medical services. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cFreetown is the capital and largest city of Sierra Leone, with a population of more than 1.2 million people. [KEEP] The accident happened at a busy intersection in the Wellington area, Freetown's main industrial district. [KEEP] The intersection where the accident happened is popularly known as "PMB", short for Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB), a defunct parastatal with its old factory buildings located adjacent the intersection. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cAt approximately 22:00 GMT on 5 November 2021, a fuel tanker carrying petrol attempted to make a turn outside Choithram Supermarket in the Freetown suburb of Wellington. [KEEP] A lorry reported to be carrying granite collided with the tanker at the junction creating a fuel leakage. [KEEP] The two drivers came out of their vehicles and warned community residents to stay off the scene, according to Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency. [KEEP] <Event> \c\cPetrol spilled from the tanker and locals, particularly the "Okada" (motorbike) taxi-riders, attempted to collect this in containers. [KEEP] An explosion led to a huge fireball that engulfed vehicles, people and passengers that were stuck in traffic created by the initial collision. [KEEP] <Event> [KEEP] <Event> \c\cMany of the victims were trapped in vehicles, including a bus full of people which was intensely burnt, killing all inside. [KEEP] Nearby shops and markets caught fire after fuel spilled onto the streets. [KEEP] Footage broadcast by local media outlets showed charred bodies surrounding the tanker. [KEEP] At least 99 people were confirmed to have died in the disaster, and more than 100 others were injured. [KEEP] The death toll rose to 101 three days after the explosion. [KEEP] <Event> \c\cMohamed Lamrane Bah, the director of the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), stated that the injured had been transferred to hospitals and the bodies were collected. [KEEP] He added that rescue efforts at the scene had ended by 16:45 GMT 6 November. [KEEP] Several people are in critical condition. [KEEP] According to a staff member of Connaught Hospital's intensive care unit, about 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive. [KEEP] President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, offered condolences and promised support to the victims\' families. [KEEP] Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals. [KEEP] The journalist Omar Fofana reported that the hospital services have been stretched. [ADD] On 8 November, the victims were buried in a mass ceremony. \c\c [KEEP] The event has been described as first of its kind in the densely populated city of about 1.2 million and follows a number of similar high-casualty fuel tanker explosions across sub-Saharan Africa where fuel spilled was viewed as wasteful in communities where many struggled to afford petrol. [KEEP] Mass casualties from similar events have occurred in the 2018 Mbuba tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo that killed 50 and the 2019 Morogoro explosion in Tanzania that killed 85. [KEEP] <Aftermath> \c\c
[KEEP] Israel's COVID-19 vaccination programme, officially named "Give a Shoulder" (Hebrew: לתת כתף), began on 19 December 2020, and has been praised for its speed, having given twenty percent of the Israeli population the first dose of the vaccines\' two dose regimen in the span of three weeks. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cAs of June 26, 2021, about 64% of eligible Israelis have received at least one dose (and a world-leading 60% with two doses), making Israel one of the populations with the highest vaccination rates in the world per capita. [KEEP] Coordinated vaccination drives by the country's health authorities, utilizing databases of personal information for Israeli patients, contributed to Israel's success in vaccinating a high proportion of its population in a short period of time, relative to the rest of the world. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cMany factors contributed to the quick distribution of vaccines in the state of Israel. [KEEP] Israel's population is younger on average than many other developed countries, with 12% of its population over the age of 65. [KEEP] (→ Demographics of Israel) <Background> \c\cIsrael is smaller in land area than many other developed nations. [KEEP] It has a comparatively small population of about 9.3 million people and a high population density (424/km2). [KEEP] <Background> \c\cIsrael's organized response in terms of attaining, storing and distributing vaccines was considered to be overall well coordinated. [KEEP] This is in part owed to the centralized nature of Israel's government system, which for example does not defer many health policy decisions to lower state-level bodies of government. [KEEP] The state purchased a substantial amount of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines relative to its population as early as December 2020. [KEEP] In May 2020, the state secured agreements with companies which were developing vaccines, such as Moderna. [KEEP] <History> \c\cEarly into the programme, Israel provided Pfizer with medical information about its citizens as part of a deal for the country to receive a supply COVID-19 vaccines from the company. [KEEP] <History> \c\c [KEEP] The initial campaign for vaccinations focused on the elderly (people over the age of 60) and other patient groups with a high risk of severe illness in the case of infection, such as those with preexisting conditions, as well as employees of the healthcare sector. [KEEP] After eight weeks, nearly 85% of health workers at a hospital in Jerusalem (Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center) were vaccinated. [KEEP] <History> \c\cIsrael started its campaign on 19 December 2020, with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu being the first person in the country to receive the vaccine, getting injected on live TV to encourage other Israelis to get vaccinated. [KEEP] In less than two weeks, over 10% of Israelis received their first dose. [KEEP] <History> \c\cMass vaccination in Israel has produced evidence that the Pfizer vaccine works to stop transmission of the virus, including asymptomatic infections. [KEEP] The vaccination programme has also curbed deaths in the country. [KEEP] <History> \c\cAs of early February 2021, at least 90% of Israelis over the age of 60 received at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and there was a 41% drop in confirmed infections in the country compared with the previous month. [KEEP] By late February, at least 4.8 million Israelis received at least one dose. [KEEP] This mass vaccination led to a drop in severe COVID-19 cases. [KEEP] Israel passed a law allowing government workers to identify and contact those who have not been vaccinated, in order to convince them to do so. [KEEP] <History> \c\cTo access certain locations such as gyms, hotels, and theatres, immunized residents show a green pass (also known as a "green badge"), which was officially introduced by the Israeli Ministry of Health on February 21. [KEEP] The green pass indicates the holder is immunized against COVID-19, either by vaccination or previous infection. [KEEP] People who have received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine are eligible to receive this certificate of vaccination. [KEEP] It expires after six months. [KEEP] <History> \c\cAs of March 2021, Israel has the highest vaccinated population per capita in the world. [KEEP] About 60% of residents in Israel received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine by March, and certain public places reopened access for those who were vaccinated. [KEEP] Only about 100,000 residents over the age of 50 remained unvaccinated. [KEEP] By March, at least 50% of the Israeli population had received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. [KEEP] <History> \c\cThe perceived success of Israel's vaccination programme has been credited to the centralized systems its health maintenance organizations maintained, especially with regard to managing the personal health data of Israelis. [KEEP] They were able to coordinate national vaccination drives, contacting residents directly using a database of contact information such as phone numbers and emails. [KEEP] Every Israeli citizen must register with one of the country's four HMOs. [ADD] <History> \c\cOn 10 November 2021, the Israeli Government approved the use of COVID-19 vaccine shots for children between the ages of 5 and 11 years. [ADD] Israeli epidemiologists and health authorities have identified vaccine hesitancy among parents as an obstacle to getting children vaccinated. [KEEP] The country expanded the availability to all Israelis over the age of 12, after five months since their second shot. [KEEP] On 29 August 2021, Israel's coronavirus czar announced that Israelis who had not received a booster shot within six months of their second dose would lose access to the country's green pass vaccine passport. [KEEP] <Distribution issues> \c\cIsraeli [KEEP] authorities faced problems with distributing their supply of COVID-19 vaccines early into vaccination drives. [KEEP] This included trouble with scheduling appointments, loosely interpreted eligibility early on which led to supply problems, and lack of sufficient distribution to less-populated villages and Arab-Israeli communities. [KEEP] <Distribution issues> \c\cDuring the first quarter of 2021, Israel had to address a moderate amount of vaccine hesitancy in its general population, and also address more intense pockets of vaccine hesitancy among young adults and religious/cultural minority groups. [KEEP] The challenges were addressed via a mix of messaging, incentives, extensions to the initial vaccine delivery system, and other measures. [KEEP] Many of the measures addressed the general population, while others were targeted at subgroups with below-average vaccination rates. [KEEP] Once the early adopters had been vaccinated, it took hard, creative work to increase population coverage from 40 to 60% and beyond. [KEEP] <Distribution issues> \c\cDistribution of vaccines to Palestinians has not been as thorough as to Israeli citizens. [KEEP] In early March, the supply of COVID-19 vaccines was not sufficient to cover all of its healthcare workers. [KEEP] Until March, when Israel began vaccinating Palestinian laborers with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the Palestinian Authority received only enough doses for about 6,000 people. [KEEP] Gaza has a population of about 2 million, by comparison. [KEEP] United Nations officials called for more support for vaccinating Palestinians, and praised Israel's assistance in this regard, while Amnesty International expressed concern that Israel had not done more for Palestinians with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. [KEEP] Some Israeli health officials urged the government to provide vaccinations to all Palestinians. [KEEP] <Distribution issues> \c\cAccording to Business Insider, Israeli citizens of any origin as well as Palestinian residents in East Jerusalem were eligible for the vaccine, with people older than 60, healthcare workers, and the "especially vulnerable" being prioritized. [KEEP] However, an estimated five million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza (which are not under Israeli control) were not eligible as their healthcare is under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority per the Oslo Accords. [KEEP] <Distribution issues> \c\cBy late March, Israel vaccinated more than 100,000 Palestinian laborers. [KEEP] In June 2021, Israel announced it would give over 1 million soon-to-expire Pfizer vaccines to the Palestinian Authority in exchange for a later reimbursement of a similar amount of vaccines which the Palestinian Authority expects to receive from Pfizer in the first quarter of 2022. [KEEP] In June 18, 100,000 of these doses had already been transferred to the West Bank's Palestinian Health Ministry. [KEEP] However, the Palestinian Authority soon pulled out of the exchange deal, saying the doses expired too fast. [KEEP] <Distribution issues> \c\cAs of March 2021, Haredi Jews and Arab-Israelis had a lower rate of vaccination, compared to other sections of the population in Israel. [KEEP] These demographics were also comparatively more likely to be hesitant or skeptical about taking the vaccine. [KEEP] Haredi Jews are about 12% of Israel's population. [KEEP] <Distribution issues> \c\c [KEEP]
[KEEP] Just before 11:00 am GMT on 14 November 2021, a taxi exploded in the car park outside the main entrance of the Liverpool Women's Hospital in Liverpool, England. [KEEP] The passenger was killed and the driver of the taxi was injured. [KEEP] The explosion was later declared as a terrorist incident. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cOn [KEEP] 14 November 2021, at approximately 10:59 am GMT, an explosion occurred inside a taxi in the car park in front of the main entrance of the Liverpool Women's Hospital. [KEEP] The explosion was caused by an improvised explosive device which was carried by the taxi's passenger, a man of Middle Eastern origin not known to MI5, who was killed in the incident probably having constructed the device himself. [KEEP] The taxi driver was admitted to hospital and described as "shaken and injured"—including an ear needing to be sewn back on—but released the following day. [KEEP] <Incident> \c\cMerseyside Police attended the scene, along with fire and ambulance crews; they were accompanied by Military Logistics and the Bomb Squad. [KEEP] <Incident> \c\cThe bomber's motivation for the attack was not immediately known, however, one theory emerged that he was intending to walk to the cathedral and detonate his device as the congregation left. [ADD] Police said he had links to both areas of Liverpool that had been raided. [KEEP] Early reports suggested that on arrival he locked the doors of his vehicle on his passenger before it went up in flames, although a Counterterrorism spokesman noted that officers had not yet spoken to Perry as of Sunday evening. [KEEP] <Investigation> \c\cThe police made three arrests under the Terrorism Act, and although they had not at that point declared the explosion to be a terrorist incident, they said the investigation was being run by counter terrorism officers, "out of caution". [KEEP] Robert Wright of The Financial Times said that any determination that the incident is considered terrorism would be made by the Counter Terrorism Command of the Metropolitan Police. [KEEP] <Investigation> \c\cLiverpool Police armed units raided a property in the Sefton Park area, although the BBC noted that they had not "confirmed whether the two incidents are related". [KEEP] Three men aged 29, 26, and 21 were arrested in the Kensington area of Liverpool under the Terrorism Act. [KEEP] Police later stated the arrests were a direct response to the attack. [KEEP] The arrests were made on Boaler Street, which is within walking distance of the hospital [KEEP] A fourth man was arrested. [KEEP] and a number of houses in the Sefton Park area had been evacuated. [KEEP] The Independent noted that this was a "usual precaution... where explosive materials are suspected or found". [KEEP] A controlled explosion was carried out in the middle of Sefton Park, "a few hundred metres" from Rut;and avenue. [KEEP] <Investigation> \c\cThe Independent questioned whether there was a "connection between the timing of the incident and the fact that it occurred on Remembrance Sunday, with the associated minute’s silence usually observed at 11am." [KEEP] The paper noted that the hospital is a short distance from Liverpool Cathedral, where the remembrance service was taking place attended by thousands of veterans and military personnel with a subsequent parade. [KEEP] On this, the police stated <Investigation - Response> \c\cThe Mayor of Liverpool, Joanne Anderson, made a statement, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated Perry, stating that "it does look as though the taxi driver in question did behave with incredible presence of mind and bravery". [KEEP] The shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth apologised on Monday evening having passed his condolences on to the family of the dead man without mentioning David Perry. [KEEP] He explained that a misreading of the news had led him to understand that the dead man had been an innocent member of the public. [KEEP] <Investigation - Response> \c\cOn 15 November 2021 the police declared the explosion a terrorist incident, and the UK terror threat level was raised from substantial to severe. [KEEP] MI5 joined the investigation on the same day of the incident in a support role for the local police, while COBRA met on Monday morning. [KEEP] The Telegraph reported that the perpetrator was unknown to MI5. [KEEP] <Investigation - Response> \c\cThe event was reported internationally, including by CNN and The New York Times and the Washington Post. [KEEP] <Investigation - Response> \c\c

[KEEP] The 2021 Solomon Islands unrest is a series of ongoing demonstrations and violent riots in the Solomon Islands, which began on 24 November 2021. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\c [KEEP] The Solomon Islands had historically been in a state of ethnic conflict until 2003, when Australia deployed a peacekeeping mission. [KEEP] In 2019, the central government under Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare withdrew recognition of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and established relations with the mainland People's Republic of China. [KEEP] Malaita Province, however, continued to be supported by Taiwan and the United States, the latter sending US$25 million of aid to the island in 2020. [KEEP] The premier of Malaita Province, Daniel Suidani, also held an independence referendum in 2020 which the national government has dismissed as illegitimate. [KEEP] <Background> \c\c [KEEP] The protests were initially peaceful, but turned violent on 24 November 2021 after buildings adjoining the Solomon Islands Parliament Building were burnt down. [KEEP] Violence escalated as Honiara's Chinatown was looted. [KEEP] Police fired upon protesters with tear gas. [KEEP] <Events> \c\cMost of the protesters came from Malaita province. [KEEP] <Events> \c\cAustralia responded to the unrest by deploying Australian Federal Police and Australian Defence Force personnel following a request from the Sogavare government under the Australia-Solomon Islands Bilateral Security Treaty. [KEEP] The Australian Government stated this deployment was to support the Solomon Islands Police Force to maintain order and protect vital infrastructure and would take no position on the internal issues of the Solomon Islands. [KEEP] Papua New Guinea agreed to send 34 peacekeepers to help staunch the violence. [KEEP] <Events> \c\cAs Australian police and soldiers deployed to secure the port, airport and other critical infrastructure, mobs once again torched buildings and looted the smouldering rubble of shops in the usually sleepy Solomons Island seaside capital of Honiara. [KEEP] Thousands of people -- some brandishing axes and knives -- rampaged through the city's Chinatown, Point Cruz and business districts, according to AFP correspondents on the scene. [KEEP] Crowds voiced their anger on Friday 26 November by setting fire to at least one building near Sogavare's home, before police fired warning shots to drive the mob back toward the centre of Honiara, AFP reporters witnessed. [KEEP] <Events> \c\cIn Chinatown, a large warehouse was set alight, causing an explosion that sent scores of people fleeing from the scene in panic. [KEEP] A tobacco warehouse was also set alight as smoke from previous days fires cast parts of the devastated city of 80,000 people in an acrid haze. [KEEP] The overrun Royal Solomon Islands Police Force said Friday they had made just two arrests, despite two police stations being among the many buildings burned. [KEEP] <Reactions - Domestic> \c\cPrime Minister Manasseh Sogavare warned the rioters would "face consequences", and resisted calls to resign, saying that if he would be removed, "it will be on the floor of Parliament". [KEEP] He also accused the protesters of being "politically motivated" and, during an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, blamed "foreign powers" for the unrest. [KEEP] <Reactions - Domestic> \c\cThe premier of Malaita Province, Daniel Suidani, criticized the Government's choices but also condemned the violence on the part of the protesters. [KEEP] The premier of Guadalcanal also strongly denounced the riots. [KEEP] <Reactions - Domestic> \c\cMatthew Wale, the Opposition Leader, said Sogavare should step down, blaming him for escalating the violence. [KEEP] <Reactions - International> \c\cThe government of the People's Republic of China expressed "concern about the attacks" and support for the Solomon Islands Government's attempts to "restore order and stability quickly". [KEEP] Deputy Director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Zhao Lijian has recently stated "Facts have proven that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Solomon Islands is in line with the fundamental and long-term development of the Solomon Islands." [KEEP] And also stating that, "Any attempt to undermine the normal development of China-Solomon Islands relations would be futile." [KEEP] <Reactions - International> \c\c

[KEEP] There has been some disparity between the outbreak's severity in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – health-care in the UK is a devolved matter. [KEEP] Each constituent country has its own publicly-funded healthcare system operated by devolved governments. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cThe virus was known to have spread to the UK by early 2020. [KEEP] The country's response included a public information campaign and certain expansions to government powers, but was otherwise slow to introduce preventative measures, increase testing or prepare for an outbreak. [KEEP] From March 2020 onwards, the government introduced restrictions across the UK on aspects of life such as people's freedom of movement, education, and leisure activities. [KEEP] Police were empowered to enforce the measures, and the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave all four governments emergency powers not used since the Second World War. [KEEP] These restrictions were eased and tightened periodically, and there was some variance in restrictions between the four countries of the UK and more localised rules were also introduced. [KEEP] In the early days of the pandemic, the health services worked to raise hospital capacity and set up temporary critical care hospitals, but faced shortages of personal protective equipment. [KEEP] In late 2020, a new more infectious variant of the virus emerged in the UK, causing another wave in infections over the winter that was deadlier than the first. [KEEP] The country's vaccination programme was the first to start in December 2020 and was in early 2021 one of the fastest in the world. [KEEP] The highly transmissible Delta variant arrived in the UK and drove a third wave of infections in mid-2021 that increased into the autumn, although high vaccination rates led to a substantially lower mortality rate than previous waves. [KEEP] In late 2021, the Omicron variant arrived in the UK and drove a further increase in cases. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cIn addition to the major strain on the UK's healthcare service and a substantial fall in life expectancy, the pandemic has had a severe impact on the UK's economy, caused major disruptions to education and had far-reaching impacts on society. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. [KEEP] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cGenetic sequencing has traced most COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom to imported cases from Italy, France, and Spain, rather than directly from China. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cThough later reporting indicated that there may have been some cases dating from late 2019, COVID-19 was confirmed to be spreading in the UK by the end of January 2020 with the first confirmed deaths in March. [KEEP] The country was initially relatively slow in implementing restrictions. [KEEP] Subsequent epidemiological analysis showed that over 1000 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 entered the UK in early 2020 from international travellers, mostly from outbreaks elsewhere in Europe, leading to numerous clusters that overwhelmed contact tracing efforts. [KEEP] A legally enforced Stay at Home Order, or lockdown, was introduced on 23 March. [KEEP] Restrictions were steadily eased across the UK in late spring and early summer that year. [KEEP] The UK's epidemic in early 2020 was at the time one of the largest and deadliest worldwide. [KEEP] <History> \c\cBy the Autumn, COVID-19 cases were again rising. [KEEP] This lead to the creation of new regulations along with the introduction of localised restrictions. [KEEP] Larger lockdowns took place in all of Wales, England and Northern Ireland later that season. [KEEP] A new variant of the virus is thought to have originated in Kent around September 2020. [KEEP] Once restrictions were lifted, the novel variant rapidly spread across the UK. [KEEP] Its increased transmissibility contributed to a continued increase in daily infections. [KEEP] The healthcare system had come under severe strain by late December which led to further restrictions being introduced across all of the UK. [KEEP] <History> \c\c [KEEP] The first COVID-19 vaccine was approved and began being deployed across the UK in early December, 15 million vaccine doses had been given to predominantly those most vulnerable to the virus by mid-February. [KEEP] 6 months later more than 75% of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. [KEEP] Quarantine rules for incoming travellers were introduced in late January. [KEEP] Restrictions began to ease from late February onwards and almost all had ended in Great Britain by August. [KEEP] A third wave of daily infections began in July 2021 due to the arrival and rapid spread of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. [KEEP] However, mass vaccination continued to keep deaths and hospitalisations at much lower levels than in previous waves. [KEEP] Infection rates remained high and hospitalisations and deaths rose into the autumn. [RM] The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was confirmed to have arrived and begun spreading in the community in early December, driving a further increase in cases. [ADD] The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was confirmed to have arrived and begun spreading in the community in early December, driving a further increase in cases that surpassed previous records. [KEEP] <History> \c\c [KEEP] The COVID-19 pandemic led to the largest fall in life expectancy in England since records began in 1981. [KEEP] On average, British COVID-19 victims lost around a decade of life; the last time deaths rose so sharply in the UK was during World War II. [KEEP] In 2020, the disease was the leading cause of death among men, and second leading cause among women. [KEEP] Research suggests over 1 million people in the UK have had Long COVID, with the majority reporting substantial impacts on day to day life. [KEEP] The pandemic's major impact on the country's healthcare system, leading to long waiting lists for medical procedures and ambulances, also led to an indirect increase in deaths from other conditions. [KEEP] The lockdown also had a major mental health impact. [KEEP] <History> \c\cIn August 2021, a report from Age UK found that 27% of people over 60 could not walk as far and 25% were living in more physical pain earlier this year compared to the start of the pandemic. [KEEP] 54% of older people felt less confident attending a hospital appointment, and 37% of older people felt less confident going to a GP surgery. [KEEP] <History> \c\c [KEEP] The pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy of the United Kingdom, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. [KEEP] Some temporary shutdowns became permanent; some people who were furloughed were later made redundant. [KEEP] The economic disruption has had a significant impact on people's mental health—with particular damage to the mental health of foreign-born men whose work hours have been reduced/eliminated. [KEEP] <History> \c\c [KEEP] The pandemic has had far-reaching consequences in the country that go beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it, including political, cultural, and social implications. [KEEP] <Responses - Government response> \c\cSophie Grégoire Trudeau, the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, tested positive for COVID-19 upon her return from WE Day events in the UK; on 12 March 2020 the Trudeau family entered two weeks of self-isolation. [KEEP] The first patient in Mauritius was a 59-year-old man who returned from the United Kingdom on 7 March 2020. [KEEP] When he arrived in Mauritius, the Mauritian had no symptoms. [KEEP] Other cases of the novel coronavirus resulting from travel to the UK were subsequently reported in India and Nigeria. [KEEP] <Responses - Government response> \c\cOn 16 June 2020, it was widely reported in British media that New Zealand's first COVID-19 cases in 24 days were diagnosed in two British women, both of whom had travelled from the UK and were given special permission to visit a dying parent. [KEEP] The women had entered the country on 7 June, after first flying into Doha and Brisbane. [KEEP] <Responses - Government response> \c\cA 2021 study suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant which was first detected in Kent is thought to have began its spread to many countries internationally from flights originating in London in late 2020. [KEEP] <Responses - Government response> \c\cReports from the Medical Research Council's Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London have been providing mathematically calculated estimates of cases and case fatality rates. [KEEP] In February 2020, the team at Imperial College, led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, estimated about two-thirds of cases in travellers from China were not detected and that some of these may have begun "chains of transmission within the countries they entered". [KEEP] They forecast that the new type of coronavirus could infect up to 60% of the UK's population, in the worst-case scenario. [KEEP] <Impacts - Health and life expectancy> \c\cIn a paper on 16 March, the Imperial College team provided detailed forecasts of the potential impacts of the epidemic in the UK and US. [KEEP] It detailed the potential outcomes of an array of \'non-pharmaceutical interventions\'. [KEEP] Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. [KEEP] Until this point, government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed. [KEEP] On 16 March, the Prime Minister announced changes to government advice, extending self-isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future. [KEEP] A paper on 30 March by the Imperial College group estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000. [KEEP] This paper and others relied on data from European countries including the UK to estimate that the combined non-pharmaceutical interventions reduced the reproduction number of the virus by 67-87%, enough to stop infections from growing. [KEEP] However, followup work concluded that the effectiveness of interventions was lower in later waves of infections. [KEEP] <Impacts - Health and life expectancy> \c\cIn April 2020, biostatistician Professor Sheila Bird said the delay in the reporting of deaths from the virus meant there was a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend. [KEEP] <Impacts - Economic> \c\cIn December 2021 scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that Omicron could cause from 25,000 to 75,000 deaths in England over the five months to April unless there are more stringent restrictions. [KEEP] Omicron will probably be the dominant  variant by the end December. [KEEP] <Impacts - Social> \c\c
[KEEP] A by-election for the House of Commons constituency of North Shropshire, in the West Midlands, was held on 16 December 2021. [KEEP] It was triggered by the resignation of the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Owen Paterson on 4 November 2021. [KEEP] In a massive upset, the Liberal Democrats candidate Helen Morgan won the election with a 34.1% swing. [RM] The swing was the 7th largest in United Kingdom by-election history. <Summary> \c\cNorth [ADD] The swing was the 7th largest in United Kingdom by-election history, and the constituency had been held by the Conservatives for nearly 200 years. [KEEP] Shropshire is the third-largest constituency by area in the West Midlands region. [KEEP] It contains five small towns: Wem, Whitchurch, Ellesmere, Oswestry and Market Drayton. [KEEP] Sixty per cent of constituents who turned out voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 EU referendum. [KEEP] <Background - Constituency> \c\c [KEEP] The last time a by-election was held in the area was the 1904 Oswestry by-election, in which there was a Liberal gain from Conservative. [KEEP] <Background - Constituency> \c\cOn [KEEP] 4 November 2021, Owen Paterson resigned as MP for the constituency. [KEEP] In October, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found that he had breached paid advocacy rules in relation to two companies which employed him as a paid consultant. [KEEP] The Commons Standards Committee considered the commissioners\' findings and recommended that Paterson be suspended from parliament for 30 days. [KEEP] In line with the established process, on 3 November a motion was proposed in the Commons inviting MPs to approve the punishment. [KEEP] If the suspension had been approved, a recall petition would have been triggered in the constituency. [KEEP] <Background - Reason> \c\cPaterson denied any wrongdoing. [KEEP] An amendment to the motion was put forward by Conservative backbencher [KEEP] Andrea Leadsom to postpone consideration of Paterson's suspension and to set up a new committee to investigate the disciplinary process for MPs. [KEEP] The government of Boris Johnson supported the amendment and issued a three-line whip. [KEEP] The amendment was passed. [KEEP] The outcome caused outrage among opposition MPs, and an angry public reaction to press reports. [KEEP] As a result, on 4 November, the government reversed its position and announced that a vote would still take place on whether Paterson should be suspended. [KEEP] Following that decision, Paterson announced his intention to resign from parliament. [KEEP] <Background - Reason> \c\cHe was appointed as Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead on 5 November, the process by which an MP's resignation is effected. [KEEP] The writ of election was moved by Conservative Chief Whip Mark Spencer on 9 November. [KEEP] The by-election took place on 16 December. [KEEP] <Background - Reason> \c\cThere were 14 candidates in the by-election. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\cOn 4 November, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party had discussions about possibly standing aside in the by-election and backing a joint independent "anti-sleaze" candidate. [KEEP] This had previously happened in the seat of Tatton at the 1997 general election where independent candidate Martin Bell beat Neil Hamilton. [KEEP] Bell was approached by the Liberal Democrats ahead of the by-election in North Shropshire, but declined to stand. [KEEP] Labour, and subsequently the Liberal Democrats, announced that they would be standing their own candidates. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\cOn [KEEP] 6 November, Reform UK announced their candidate as Kirsty Walmsley, who was previously a councillor on Shropshire Council for the Conservative Party, which her father Keith Barrow led on the Council. [KEEP] Walmsley said, "I would never had  [sic] stood against Owen Paterson. [KEEP] He is a man of integrity who had worked hard for North Shropshire." [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\cOn [KEEP] 13 November, the Conservatives picked their candidate, Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, from a three-person shortlist. [KEEP] Shastri-Hurst is a barrister, former British Army Medical Officer and honorary NHS consultant. [KEEP] His links to the constituency relate to his time training at Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital near Oswestry and a period stationed at the Tern Hill barracks near Market Drayton. [KEEP] Also on the shortlist were local Shropshire Councillor for Worfield (in Ludlow constituency), Richard Marshall and Birmingham City Councillor Charlotte Hodivala. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\c [KEEP] The Shropshire Star reported Labour's shortlist for the candidacy included David Hallam (previously Herefordshire and Shropshire MEP), Kuldip Sahota (former Telford & Wrekin Council leader, who actually did not apply) and Graeme Currie (Labour candidate for North Shropshire at the 2019 general election). [KEEP] On 14 November, the Labour Party announced their candidate to be Ben Wood from Oswestry. [KEEP] Graeme Currie, the Labour candidate in the seat in the 2019 general election, was blocked from the party's shortlist of candidates and said he would resign from the party in response. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\c [KEEP] The Shropshire Star reported on 11 November that the Liberal Democrats had approached Martin Bell to stand as their candidate. [KEEP] Bell reportedly declined citing age and the size of the Conservative majority. [KEEP] Former Ludlow MP Matthew Green and Shropshire County Councillor Alex Wagner were also reported as potential candidates. [KEEP] On 16 November, the Liberal Democrats announced that Helen Morgan, who contested the seat in the 2019 general election, had been re-selected. [KEEP] Morgan is a chartered accountant who was born and raised in the rural West Midlands and has lived in North Shropshire since 2014. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\c [KEEP] The Green candidate was Duncan Kerr, who stood in the constituency for the party in the 2015 and 2017 general elections, but not in 2019. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\cYolande Kenward stood on an anti-corruption platform as an independent, although she was shown on the ballot paper with no label. [KEEP] The other independent, Suzie Akers-Smith, is a independent councillor on Cheshire East Council and the local authority's Cycling and Walking Champion. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\cDrew Galdron, under the name Boris Been-Bunged, a Boris Johnson impersonator, stood for the Rejoin EU Party. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\cMonaco-based Russell Dean, a consultant for a yacht broker who grew up in Shropshire, stood for The Party Party. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\cHard eurosceptic minor party candidates were: UKIP's Andrea Allen, a former modern languages teacher and the party's parish councillor and chair of the Whitchurch Town Twinning Association; the Reclaim Party's Martin Daubney who represented the West Midlands in the European Parliament between 2019 and 2020 while a member of the Brexit Party; and Heritage's James Elliot, an electrical contractor.\t\t\t <Candidates> \c\c [KEEP] The Monster Raving Loony party fielded its party leader Alan "Howling Laud" Hope. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\c [KEEP] The anti-lockdown Freedom Alliance fielded Earl Jesse as its candidate. [KEEP] <Candidates> \c\cAn editorial in The Guardian newspaper suggested that tactical voting for the Liberal Democrats be employed by the electorate to try to reduce the Conservative majority in the seat, saying "Labour voters ought to set aside their tribal loyalty and back the Lib Dem candidate". [KEEP] <Candidates - Endorsements> \c\cSarah Biffen, the widow of John Biffen, the former Conservative MP for the area, endorsed the Conservative candidate, Shastri-Hurst, comparing his background in the NHS and the Army with that of her late husband, a former cabinet minister who represented the area now covered by the North Shropshire constituency from 1961 until 1997. [KEEP] <Candidates - Endorsements> \c\cWill Hutton, former editor of The Observer, endorsed the Liberal Democrats and called on Labour and Green Party supporters to "put aside their prime party affiliation and back the Lib Dem candidate". [KEEP] Martin Fletcher, former associate editor and foreign editor of The Times, endorsed the Liberal Democrats, specifically calling on Conservative voters to back Morgan with the aim of ending Boris Johnson's leadership of the Conservative Party. [KEEP] <Candidates - Endorsements> \c\cSeveral[which?] candidates are running on an anti-corruption ticket; others are using it in their campaign material, including Labour's. [KEEP] Several local issues have also featured in the campaign, including local funding. [KEEP] Katy Balls in The Spectator analysed the effect that the variety of problems currently facing the government, and impacting Boris Johnson's popularity (which include tax rises, English Channel migrant crossings and the controversy surrounding the resignation of Paterson, the former MP of the constituency), might have on the election result. [KEEP] She said that a Lib Dem source commented that "Peppa Pig has come up more than sleaze" and that local issues such as the ambulance services, and questions over the Tory candidate being based in Birmingham were being raised by electors. [KEEP] <Campaign> \c\c [KEEP] The Financial Times reported that Labour strategists regarded North Shropshire inhospitable for their party and not worth spending resources on. [KEEP] One Labour strategist suggests the Liberal Democrats stood a better chance in the seat, saying: "the Lib Dems have focused on Shropshire North and they\'ll probably end up a good second there. [KEEP] They came second in the recent local elections — from their perspective it makes sense for them to concentrate their resources there." [KEEP] Labour finished second in the constituency at the 2019 United Kingdom general election. [KEEP] Ian Dunt, writing in the i, suggested that despite standing a candidate "[Labour] seems to be standing aside for Davey so the Lib Dems can monopolise the anti-government vote" as part of an informal Labour-Lib Dem pact, where one party stands aside to give the other a higher chance of beating the Conservative candidate. [KEEP] The Guardian reported that Labour's Shadow Minister for International Development Yasmin Qureshi "effectively acknowledged the party had deliberately left the field clear for the Lib Dems", after she told Times Radio that "Labour are never going to win North Shropshire. [KEEP] The Lib Dems do have an opportunity to do so." [KEEP] <Campaign> \c\cIn the wake of the Downing Street Christmas party controversy which broke on 7 December, The Guardian reported that opinion in the constituency was divided, and voter apathy had risen. [KEEP] <Campaign> \c\cA poll of postal voters by the Liberal Democrats, reported on 2 December, put them in second place, with both the Conservative and Labour vote shares falling relative to the 2019 general election. [KEEP] A polling analyst has said that these results should be treated "with a pinch of salt" because the polling methodology was not published. [KEEP] On 11 December The Observer reported that an internal memo to Liberal Democrat staff stated that the Conservatives were only one percentage point ahead of the Liberal Democrats. [KEEP] <Campaign> \c\cIn response to comments by the Conservative Home Secretary, Priti Patel, about the expulsion of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, the Liberal Democrat candidate, Helen Morgan, compared Patel with Hitler's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels. [KEEP] Morgan later apologised for the "insensitive tweet which I have taken down". [KEEP] According to the Shropshire Star, Morgan had already apologised a few days earlier for comments from 2020 in which she "appeared to liken Channel migrants to Jews held at Auschwitz". [KEEP] <Campaign> \c\cDuring the campaign, a sitting Conservative Councillor in the constituency, Anthony Allen, announced that he was defecting from the Conservative Party, saying they "were not Conservative enough", and joined the Reclaim Party. [KEEP] A second sitting Conservative councillor defected to Reform UK. [KEEP] <Campaign> \c\cLocal newspaper the Shropshire Star reported on 8 December that bookmakers are divided over whether the Conservative or the Liberal Democrat candidate are the favourite to win the by-election, following controversy over a reported Christmas party at 10 Downing Street that may have broken the Covid-19 lockdown rules in place at the time. [KEEP] The newspaper stated that, other than the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, "No other party has been seen as a likely challenger to the seat". [KEEP] By 11 December The Independent reported that the Liberal Democrats were favourites with every major bookmaker. [KEEP] They also reported that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, and poor weather conditions may affect the turnout. [KEEP] <Campaign> \c\cOn 13 December it was reported that Reform Party candidate Kirsty Walmsley had tested positive for Coronavirus, and would therefore miss out on the last few days of the campaign as well as the vote count.

[KEEP] It is thought that a hole in the hull caused the engine room to flood, leaving the vessel vulnerable to wave action. [KEEP] At least 85 people died during the accident. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cThe Francia, a 12-metre (39 ft) -long wooden vessel, was a cargo ship that had illegally taken on 130 passengers for a journey from Antanambe (which is not registered as an official port) to Soanierana Ivongo, a journey of some 100 kilometres (62 mi). [KEEP] Including crew, 138 people were onboard. [KEEP] The vessel sank late on 20 December 2021 after its engine was flooded, leaving it exposed to the action of waves.

[KEEP] The 2021—22 Russo-Ukrainian crisis is an ongoing military confrontation and international crisis between Russia and Ukraine that started in late October 2021. [KEEP] The crisis has caused international tension, also involving the United States, NATO, the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cThe aggravation of Russian-Ukrainian relations occurred in late October – early November and was provoked by the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations. [KEEP] The message about the use of UAVs appeared almost simultaneously with the news about the occupation of the village of Staromarievka on the contact line of the parties, in which 37 Russian citizens who received passports under the simplified program live. [KEEP] According to OSCE observers, the ceasefire regime began to be violated twice as often as in 2020 (during the period from the evening of 29 October to the evening of 31 October, the ceasefire regime in the Donetsk region was violated 988 times, and in Luhansk — 471). [KEEP] OSCE SMM observers reported on the movement of military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as repeated attempts to muffle the signal of its UAVs, which are used to monitor the terrain. [KEEP] At the same time, publications appeared in the Western media that Russia was again pulling troops to the Ukrainian border. [KEEP] Satellite photos of Russian armoured vehicles were cited as evidence. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn [KEEP] 2–3 November, the head of the CIA, William Burns, came to Moscow and met with senior Russian intelligence officials there. [KEEP] According to CNN, the purpose of the trip was to convey to the Kremlin Joe Biden's concern about the situation on the border with Ukraine.

[KEEP] On 4 November, a new defence minister was approved — former Deputy Prime Minister – Minister for the Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Oleksii Reznikov, who participated in the meetings of the Trilateral Contact Group on behalf of Ukraine. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cIn November 2021, the Russian Defense Ministry described the deployment of the U.S. warships to the Black Sea as a "threat to regional security and strategic stability." [KEEP] The ministry said in a statement, "The real goal behind the U.S. activities in the Black Sea region is exploring the theatre of operations in case Kyiv attempts to settle the conflict in the southeast by force." [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn [KEEP] 13 November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Russia has again amassed 100,000 troops in the border area. [KEEP] In early November, reports of Russian military buildups prompted U.S. officials to warn the EU that Russia could be planning a potential invasion of Ukraine. [KEEP] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied allegations that Russia is preparing for a possible invasion of Ukraine. [KEEP] He accused Ukraine of "planning aggressive actions against Donbass." [KEEP] Peskov urged NATO to stop "concentrating a military fist" near Russia's borders and to stop arming Ukraine with modern weapons. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn [KEEP] 16 November, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on the West to send Russia "a clear signal calling for reducing tension, avoiding any escalation in and around Ukraine." [KEEP] Stoltenberg added that the alliance records an "unusual concentration" of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border. [KEEP] On 15 November, Acting German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian expressed concern in a joint communique about "the movements of Russian forces and military equipment near Ukraine," calling on both sides to "show restraint." [KEEP] At the same time, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby confirmed that the United States continues to observe "unusual military activity" of the Russian Federation near the borders of Ukraine, and the head of the State Department Antony Blinken discussed reports of "Russian military activity" in the area with Jean-Yves Le Drian. [KEEP] It was reported that the United States is discussing sanctions with European allies in case of further Russian invasion <Diplomatic response> \c\cBack in early November, Ukrainian intelligence stated that information about the transfer of additional Russian troops to the Ukrainian borders was nothing more than "an element of psychological pressure." [KEEP] However, a week later, the Office of the President of Ukraine recognized that the Russian Federation was strengthening "specific groups of troops" near the border. [KEEP] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Paris and Berlin to prepare for a possible military scenario of Russia's actions in the Ukrainian direction. [KEEP] <Diplomatic response> \c\cAgainst this background, Ukraine has sharply intensified diplomatic efforts. [KEEP] On 15 November, Volodymyr Zelensky and the head of the European Council Charles Michel discussed "the security situation along the borders of Ukraine." [KEEP] On the same day, Dmytro Kuleba held talks on the same issues in Brussels. [KEEP] The new head of the Defense Ministry, Oleksii Rezikov, went to Washington, where on 18 November he met with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.

[KEEP] Budanov said that Russia is behind the protests against vaccination against COVID-19 in Kyiv and other protest rallies in Ukraine – this is a preparation for a large-scale military invasion. [KEEP] According to Budanov, Russia needs the protests so that the Ukrainian population does not resist it during the military operation, believing that the Ukrainian authorities have betrayed it: "They want to organize rallies and protests to show that people are against the government," he said in an interview with Military Times. [KEEP] "They are trying to prove that our government is betraying the people." [KEEP] According to the head of Ukrainian intelligence, Russia is trying to get the Ukrainians to change power themselves, and if it doesn\'t work out, "the army will step in." [KEEP] According to Budanov, active actions should be expected in late January – early February 2022. [KEEP] <Military escalation> \c\cMoscow, in turn, accuses Ukraine of aggressive actions. [KEEP] The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said on 25 November that the Ukrainian authorities are escalating tensions in the Donbas and are conducting offensive actions there in some areas: "The hotheads of the Kiev regime, apparently feeling complete impunity, advocate a forceful solution to the internal Ukrainian crisis. [KEEP] The situation in the conflict zone is escalating. [KEEP] Information continues to be received about the use of weapons prohibited by the Minsk Package of Measures, which are supplied to Ukraine by NATO countries." [KEEP] She believes that by doing so, the Ukrainian leadership is trying to "divert attention from the degradation of the socio-economic and political situation in the country ... and switch this attention to some temporary threats from outside." [KEEP] <Military escalation> \c\cHarsh statements from Kyiv and Moscow sound against the background of a deadlock on all existing negotiating platforms. [KEEP] There are no contacts within the Normandy Format and are not expected at any level: there will be no summit, the foreign ministers have not yet been able to coordinate a meeting, and political advisers have not communicated since September. [KEEP] In the Trilateral Contact Group, negotiations are reduced to discussing whether Russia is a party to the conflict. [KEEP] On 15 November, Vladimir Putin signed a decree on providing humanitarian support to the population of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. [KEEP] <Military escalation> \c\cOn [KEEP] 1 December, Russia accused Ukraine of deploying half its army – about 125,000 troops – in Donbas to confront pro-Russian separatists.

[KEEP] The most likely time to achieve readiness for escalation will be the end of January." [KEEP] Additional Russian forces were reported to have moved into Crimea reinforcing Russian naval and ground units already deployed there. [KEEP] <Military escalation> \c\cOn [KEEP] 9 December, Russia accused Ukraine of moving heavy artillery towards the front line where separatists are fighting with Ukrainian forces.

[KEEP] Any provocations of the Ukrainian authorities by way of a forced settlement of the problems of Donbass will be suppressed." [KEEP] On 31 December 2021, after a phone call between US President Biden and Russian president Putin, Putin declared that if the US sanctioned them it would be "a fatal mistake."

[KEEP] On 10 January, the Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in favour of Djokovic, ordered his release from detention and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses. [KEEP] The reason for the ruling was that when Djokovic was in immigration holding before his visa was cancelled, Australian officials reneged on an agreement to give Djokovic sufficient time to contact his lawyers and tennis authorities before his official interview; this led the Australian government to concede that they treated Djokovic unreasonably. [KEEP] <COVID-19 vaccination and visa controversies> \c\cTwenty-five other players and staff had applied for a medical exemption and a handful of applications had been granted.

[KEEP] Singapore is currently the most-vaccinated country in the world, with more than 88% of its total population (and more than 91% of its eligible populace) having completed their vaccination regimen. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cThe Singapore Government invested more than one billion Singapore dollars to sign advanced purchase agreements and made early down payments on promising vaccine candidates, such as Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and CoronaVac. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn 5 October 2020, the Singapore Government appointed a 14-member Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, which was to advise and assess on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for use in Singapore. [KEEP] On 24 December 2020, the Expert Committee submitted its recommendations on the overall vaccination strategy of Singapore to the government. [KEEP] In its recommendations, they highlighted that two groups of people had to be priortised for vaccination: people who are at high risk of infection, the frontline healthcare workers; and people who are vulnerable of severe diseases and complications from infections, the elderly. [KEEP] The Committee continued to advise on the use of vaccines as the pandemic continues. [KEEP] It recommended booster shots for people above 60 of age as evidence of declining effacy of vaccination over time emerged, and updated recommendations for those with mild skin reactions after first dosage to continue their vaccination programme. [KEEP] <Background> \c\cOn 14 December 2020, Singapore became the first Asian country to approve Pfizer-BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine. [KEEP] The first shipment of the vaccine arrived seven days later on 21 December. [KEEP] <Background - Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination> \c\cSingapore also received its first shipment of Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac vaccine, on 22 December 2020. [KEEP] However, the vaccine was not authorised for use by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). [KEEP] On 2 June 2021, MOH approved the Sinovac vaccine for used in private healthcare settings so people, who are not suitable to take the mRNA vaccines, can take the Sinovac vaccine. [KEEP] However, since the China-made vaccine is not part of the national programme, those who choose to receive it will not be eligible for the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP) should they develop any adverse reactions. [KEEP] <Background - 2020> \c\cOn 30 December 2020, Singapore became the first country in Asia to start its COVID-19 vaccination campaign. [KEEP] The vaccine is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. [KEEP] Health workers, other frontline workers and seniors were the first inoculated with the vaccine jointly developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. [KEEP] <Background - 2020> \c\cOn [KEEP] 3 February 2021, Singapore also became the first country in Asia to approve Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, jointly developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and Moderna. [KEEP] <Background - 2020> \c\cOn [KEEP] 18 May, the Health Ministry announced that those who register for COVID-19 vaccination from 19 May onwards will have their second dose scheduled six to eight weeks after the first, instead of three to four weeks later. [KEEP] This change in strategy was aimed to have 400,000 more people in Singapore to be given at least one vaccine dose by end-July so that virtually all eligible Singapore residents will get at least one dose by early August. [KEEP] However, as vaccine supplies continue to arrive as planned and most of the population who are willing to take the vaccine will have received their first dose by the second half of July, MOH announced on 29 June that the interval between the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine would revert to four weeks. [KEEP] This was part of the efforts to ensure that more of the population will be fully vaccinated earlier. [KEEP] On 9 July, it was announced that the interval between doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would be further shortened to 3 weeks. [KEEP] It was further added that those who had previously taken a vaccine not approved under the National Vaccination Programme would be advised to take 2 doses of the approved ones. [KEEP] <Background - 2021> \c\c [KEEP] The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) also approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for children aged 12 to 15; previously, it was given only to those aged 16 years and above. [KEEP] It was granted interim authorization by the HSA under the Pandemic Special Access Route in December 2020. [KEEP] <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 24 June, the Health Ministry concluded a purchase agreement with Novavax for its non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, with shipments expected to arrive in Singapore before the end of 2021. [KEEP] <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 28 July, IHH Healthcare Singapore obtained approval to import the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine (BBIBP-CorV) via the special access route (SAR). [KEEP] The SAR was set up on 31 May to allow individuals to choose vaccines not under the national inoculation program. [KEEP] <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 2 August, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary announced in Parliament that those who suffered allergic reactions after receiving the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will be invited to receive the Sinovac CoronaVac vaccine and will be deemed as fully vaccinated individuals. [KEEP] <Background - 2021> \c\cOn [KEEP] 6 August, the Health Ministry announced it shall recognize all COVID-19 vaccines listed under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) starting from 10 August 2021. [KEEP] This means that Singapore recognizes all individuals that have been inoculated with a WHO-approved vaccine as fully vaccinated individuals and shall be accorded vaccination-differentiated safe management measures and travel concessions. [KEEP] <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 20 September, an additional 101,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine was delivered. [KEEP] <Background - 2021> \c\cOn [KEEP] 23 October, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) granted interim authorization under the Pandemic Special Access Route for the CoronaVac vaccine under a three-dose regime, following which it was included in the National Vaccination Programme. [KEEP] Those who are ineligible to take either of the approved mRNA vaccines would be invited for this vaccine and eligible for the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP). [KEEP] <Background - 2021> \c\cOn [KEEP] 10 December, the Health Sciences Authority approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 with the first shots to be given by end-2021. [KEEP] At the same time, Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is approved for full registration. [KEEP] The first shipment of the paediatric vaccine arrived seven days later on 22 December with the first shots given on 27 December.

[KEEP] The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation is a regulation of the European Union and Euratom, which allows the European Commission to adopt measures, including the suspension of payment of funds from the EU budget, to member states which violate the principles of rule of law enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. [KEEP] <Summary> \c\cDemocratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland has been a major concern for the European Union since the 2010s. [KEEP] In December 2017, the European Commission initiated article 7 suspension proceedings against Poland, and in September 2018, the European Parliament did the same against Hungary. [KEEP] The proceedings have since stalled, however, as a suspension of a member state under article 7 requires unanimity, excluding the member state concerned, and Hungary and Poland are widely expected to veto each other's suspension. [KEEP] <Legislative background> \c\cAs a solution to this problem, the European Commission proposed in May 2018 to link disbursements from the European Union's budget to adherence to rule of law standards by means of a regulation. [KEEP] The European Parliament adopted a position on the Commission's proposal in April 2019, but the Council was generally wary of confronting its members from Poland and Hungary. [KEEP] <Legislative background> \c\cThis changed during the adoption of the 2021–2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery package in the summer of 2020. [KEEP] At the July 2020 European Council summit, the heads of state and government of the EU member states agreed that these funds should be tied to a conditionality regime regarding the rule of law. [KEEP] Germany, holding the presidency of the Council, suggested a compromise on the rule of law conditionality regulation proposed by the Commission and European Parliament in September 2020. [KEEP] After trilogue meetings between the Council, the European Parliament, and the Commission, a legislative draft of the regulation was published on 5 November 2020. [KEEP] <Legislative background> \c\cAlthough the regulation could be adopted by the Council by a qualified majority, Hungary and Poland threatened to veto the Own Resources Decision, which defines how the MFF and NGEU are financed. [KEEP] At the European Council summit of 10 and 11 December 2020, the impasse was resolved by adopting a series of declarations on how the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation should be adopted, implemented and interpreted. [KEEP] This paved the way for the adoption of the regulation by the Council on 14 December 2020 and by the European Parliament on 16 December 2020. [KEEP] <Legislative background> \c\c [KEEP] The regulation provides for the Commission to propose measures against a member state that violates the principles of the rule of law. [KEEP] These measures include the suspension of payments or commitments, and a prohibition on entering into new legal commitments. [KEEP] <Provisions> \c\cIn the context of the regulation, the rule of law is understood to refer to the values enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, and include "the principles of legality implying a transparent, accountable, democratic and pluralistic law-making process; legal certainty; prohibition of arbitrariness of the executive powers; effective judicial protection, including access to justice, by independent and impartial courts, also as regards fundamental rights; separation of powers; and non-discrimination and equality before the law". [KEEP] <Provisions> \c\cArticle 4 of the regulation specifies that measures may only be taken if the violations of the rule of law "affect or seriously risk affecting the sound financial management of the Union budget or the protection of the financial interests of the Union in a sufficiently direct way". [KEEP] <Provisions> \c\c [KEEP] The declaratory statements adopted at the European Council summit of 10 and 11 December 2020 address how the European Council views the regulation should be implemented. [KEEP] The legal value of these declaratory statements is disputed. [KEEP] <Implementation> \c\cAccording to the European Council's declaratory statements, the Commission should not only develop guidelines for the application of the regulation, but also await the outcome of legal challenges to the regulation before implementing it. [KEEP] Furthermore, the Commission should only apply the regulation when there are no more efficient means to protect the Union's budget. [KEEP] <Implementation> \c\c [KEEP] The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 25 March 2021 in which it stressed "that the application of the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation cannot be subject to the adoption of guidelines", urging "the Commission to avoid any further delay in its application" and "to keep Parliament regularly informed about all ongoing investigations into breaches of the principles of the rule of law which could affect, or seriously risk affecting, the sound financial management of the Union budget in a sufficiently direct way". [KEEP] The European Parliament threatened to take legal action against the Commission if it would not provide such information to the European Parliament by 1 June 2021. [KEEP] <Implementation> \c\cOn 10 June 2021, after the deadline had passed without the Commission providing the European Parliament with the necessary information, the European Parliament adopted another resolution, calling on the Commission to fulfil its obligations under the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation within two weeks, and notifying the Commission that it would start preparations for legal action against the Commission for failure to act (article 265 TFEU). [KEEP] The European Commission rejected the ultimatum on 23 August 2021 with a five-page letter. [RM] <Implementation> \c\cOn 11 March 2021, Hungary and Poland separately launched legal proceedings with the Court of Justice of the European Union against the European Parliament and the Council for adopting the regulation, asking the court to annul the regulation as, according to Hungary and Poland, the regulation does not have an appropriate legal basis. The advocate general advised the Court to dismiss those challenges on 2 December 2021. [ADD] <Implementation> \c\cOn 11 March 2021, Hungary and Poland separately launched legal proceedings with the European Court of Justice against the European Parliament and the Council for adopting the regulation, asking the court to annul the regulation as, according to Hungary and Poland, the regulation does not have an appropriate legal basis and that it serves to circumvent the punitive mechanism built in the Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union.

[KEEP] Designated terrorist organisations in Australia are organisations that have been designated by the Australian government as terrorist organisations. [KEEP] A list of terrorist organisations was first created under the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, as part of the fight against terrorism worldwide.
