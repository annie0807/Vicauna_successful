The lack of reinforcements from the central government is being blamed for the fall of the city into Taliban control. As of 21 August, the Taliban has reportedly captured around two-thirds of the country and is now moving towards major cities, including Kabul. The international community, including the United States, has expressed concerns over the deteriorating security situation and the potential for a humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, the Afghan government has vowed to retake all seized districts by the Taliban, and local militias have formed to fight against the group, including the People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan in Herat Province."

The ongoing financial crisis in Lebanon, which began in August 2019 and has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 Beirut port explosion, has been further compounded by the Central Bank of Lebanon's decision to end fuel subsidies. In lieu of subsidies, the bank will offer credit lines for fuel imports based on the market price for the Lebanese pound. This decision is expected to lead to a significant increase in fuel prices in the country, which is already experiencing inflation and high levels of poverty caused by the worst economic crisis in decades. The World Bank has warned that if Lebanon's ""bankrupt economic system, which benefited a few for so long"" is not reformed, the country may face one of the three most severe economic crises since the mid-19th century."

41,79,"A series of protests by the Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government ended on 2 October 2021 after an agreement was reached to end the ban on Serbian license plates starting on 4 October 2021. The protests, which had begun on 20 September 2021, were triggered by the government's decision to ban Serbian license plates, a move aimed at mirroring the former ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia. The ban would have impacted around 9,500 vehicles with Serbian license plates in North Kosovo, who would have had to switch them for Kosovar license plates at a government vehicle registration center. The protests disrupted traffic near border crossings and culminated in arson attacks on two government registration centers on 25 September 2021. The agreement, which also ended the ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia, is intended as a temporary solution and covers the national symbols and country codes of both license plates with a sticker. A working group to find a more permanent solution to the issue has been formed with negotiators from the governments of Kosovo and Serbia and their proposals will be announced in six months."

Nonetheless, Iceland has recently announced that it will bring a permanent end to the practice of whaling by 2024, citing the decreasing price of whale meat. One of the two Icelandic companies previously concentrated on hunting fin whales for exports to Japan, while the other hunted minke whales for domestic consumption, primarily popular with tourists. Being accused of slaughtering a blue whale in 2018, Icelandic whalers faced a difficult time due to coronavirus restrictions and competitions from subsidized Japanese whaling, resulting in whaling being put on hold in Iceland since 2019. Meanwhile, the whale watching tourism industry has increased in Iceland, causing a dilemma for the country. However, with the recent announcement of ending the practice of whaling, it remains uncertain if commercial whaling will resume in Iceland in the future."

The battle also saw the killing of ten militants and involved the support of an attack helicopter. The conflict, which began in 2015, has resulted in a widespread humanitarian crisis, with thousands displaced and killed by both sides. The military has been accused of war crimes and summary executions, disproportionately targeting ethnic Fulani, while insurgents have terrorized villagers and targeted schools."
84,163,"UPDATE: Canada's Operation Unifier, also known as Canadian Armed Forces Joint Task Force-Ukraine, has undergone a significant change. The Canadian government has withdrawn its military advisors from Ukraine and relocated them to an undisclosed destination in Europe. Furthermore, it has suspended all operations at its embassy in Kyiv, and its diplomatic staff have been relocated to Lviv. These developments are substantial, given that the Operation's broader mission was to help reform the Ukrainian military, maintain security, democracy, and provide humanitarian aid and economic stability and growth. The Canadian government's decision may signal a shift in its foreign policy on Ukraine or may be a response to the current security situation in the region. Regardless, it remains to be seen how the relocation of Canadian forces will affect Operation Unifier's broader mission or Canada's ties with Ukraine."
85,165,"The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation, a regulation of the European Union and Euratom, has gained new significance following the European Court of Justice's decision to dismiss Poland and Hungary's legal challenges against the regulation. The regulation allows the European Commission to adopt measures, including the suspension of payment of funds from the EU budget, for member states that violate the principles of rule of law enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. The Court's decision confirms that the regulation is compliant with the treaties of the European Union and paves the way for the European Commission to take action against member states that have rule of law issues that may affect the management of EU funds. The regulation specifies that measures may only be taken if the violations of the rule of law ""affect or seriously risk affecting the sound financial management of the Union budget or the protection of the financial interests of the Union in a sufficiently direct way"". Although the regulation has faced resistance from member states such as Poland and Hungary, the Court's ruling confirms its legal basis and reinforces the importance of upholding the rule of law within the European Union."

The list of designated groups is maintained by the Attorney-General's Department, and can be determined through prosecution for terrorist offences or the Attorney-General's motion under the Criminal Code Act 1995. As of November 2021, the Australian government designates 29 foreign organisations as terrorist organisations, including Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham and the Guardians of Religion Organization. Notably, Hamas, including its political wing, has been designated as a terrorist organisation by the Australian government. Australian anti-terrorism financing laws include a range of offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945, with enforcement overseen by the Australian Federal Police, state police forces, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions."
