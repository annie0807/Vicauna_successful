Wildfires continue to ravage Greece, with the situation worsening in the northern suburbs of Athens, prompting mass evacuations. Since August 2021, the wildfires have claimed the lives of three people, including a volunteer firefighter who was killed by a fallen electricity pylon, and another man who died in a factory. Twenty more people have been injured, adding to the already high toll of two deaths and at least 20 injuries. The wildfires have burned dozens of homes and prompted evacuations of several villages and towns. The historical heatwave for the country has only worsened the situation, and authorities are working tirelessly to contain the blazes.
The Taliban's offensive in Afghanistan continues to intensify, with the capture of the capitals of Kunduz, Takhar, and Sar-e Pol provinces. In Kunduz, the Taliban has seized control of key government buildings, leaving the government forces in control of only the airport. In Takhar, heavy fighting was reported as the Taliban seized Taloqan, and in Sar-e Pol, the Taliban forced government forces out of the main military base. The capture of Kunduz is particularly significant as it is one of Afghanistan's largest settlements, well-connected to other major locations in the country, including the capital city Kabul, and is considered part of a major Asian drug smuggling route. As the Taliban continues to make gains, Afghan politician and former mujahideen Ismail Khan has declared the formation of the People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight against the Taliban in Herat Province. The situation in Afghanistan remains tense, with President Ghani blaming the rapid Taliban advance on the sudden withdrawal of US troops, while the Taliban denies these claims.
As the COVID-19 situation in Queensland remains volatile, Cairns and Yarrabah have entered a snap three-day lockdown following the discovery of an "unexpected" case of COVID-19. The case involves a taxi driver from Kanimbla who was infectious in Far North Queensland for 10 days, prompting health authorities to impose the lockdown. This comes after the South-east Queensland lockdown was extended until 4:00 pm on 8 August (Sunday) due to 15 new cases of COVID-19, 2 of which were acquired overseas. As a result of the extension, the Ekka agricultural show was cancelled for the second year, five days before it was set to open to the public from 7 August (Saturday). Queensland authorities continue to monitor the situation closely and take necessary measures to curb the spread of the virus.

Palau has achieved herd immunity with 80% of its population aged 12 and over vaccinated against COVID-19. The Ministry of Health had previously announced plans to vaccinate adolescents aged 12 to 17. As a member of the Compact of Free Association with the United States, Palau received vaccines from Operation Warp Speed, and by May 26, an estimated 96% of adults in the country had been fully vaccinated. The high vaccination rate contributed to the country's success in detecting and controlling the virus, with the first case detected only after 97% of the adult population was vaccinated. With the reopening of tourism in Palau, vaccination efforts are expected to continue. <Vaccination>
In the summer of 2020, Egypt received five Su-35 jets from Russia, despite American threats of sanctions. However, the journalist who revealed the transaction, Ivan Safronov, was later detained for disclosing a state secret. As of 2015, Egypt has been the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroad, with a basic vacation package costing as little as $1,000. Now, in 2023, direct commercial flights between Russia and Egypt have resumed for the first time since the Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing in 2015, which killed 224 people, mostly Russian tourists. Rossiya Airlines operated the first flight, which carried 518 passengers and landed in Sharm El Sheikh to a warm welcome of a water cannon salute, roses, and flags. This is a significant development for Egypt's tourism industry and marks a new chapter in its relationship with Russia.

The resumption of flights is expected to boost tourism in Egypt, which has been struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges. The move also highlights the improving security situation in the country and the measures taken to ensure the safety of tourists.
In August 2021, the Taliban captured several cities in Afghanistan, including Kunduz and Sar-e Pol, after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces. Mass desertions were reported among the Afghan National Army soldiers who had been demotivated by the rapid rebel advance and Taliban propaganda. While pro-government forces were only able to hold onto Kunduz's military base and airport, the Taliban continued to make gains, with the capture of Taloqan and Samangan. The capture of Samangan, the provincial capital of Samangan Province, marked the sixth provincial capital to fall to the Islamist group in just four days. These developments were described as significant gains for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May, with the cities being among Afghanistan's largest settlements and considered part of a major Central Asian drug smuggling route. This timeline reflects the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and the challenges faced by the Afghan government and security forces in maintaining control of the country.
In August 2021, the Taliban continued to make gains in Afghanistan, with the capture of Aybak, the capital of Samangan province, and the defection of prominent warlord Asif Azimi and his men to the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani responded to the escalating situation by calling on local militias to fight the armed group and forming a joint command center with other political leaders to coordinate and assist with public uprising forces. However, despite these efforts, the Taliban tightened its grip on many districts and cities in northern Afghanistan. The United States, which had been conducting airstrikes against the Taliban, expressed its willingness to continue its airstrike campaign, but emphasized that it is ultimately up to the Afghan government to defend themselves, calling it "their struggle". These developments highlight the ongoing challenges faced by the Afghan government and security forces in maintaining control of the country and the growing influence of the Taliban in the region.

This brings the total number of provincial capitals under Taliban control to eight in just five days. Farah saw heavy fighting between the Taliban and government forces, resulting in the capture of the governor's compound, police headquarters, and prison. Meanwhile, in Puli Khumri, the Taliban seized control of the city without much resistance. The fall of these cities has raised concerns about the stability of the country as the Taliban tightens its grip on Afghanistan. Despite this, President Ashraf Ghani and other political leaders have agreed to form a joint command center to coordinate and assist with public uprising forces. The United States has also reiterated its willingness to continue their airstrike campaign against the Taliban but has warned that the Afghan government must take responsibility for defending itself.
The Taliban continues to make gains in Afghanistan as they capture the cities of Farah, the capital of the southwestern Farah Province, and Puli Khumri, the capital of the northern Baghlan Province. The two cities are the seventh and eighth provincial capitals to fall under Taliban control in the past five days.

President Ashraf Ghani has called on local militias to fight the armed group, and he and other political leaders have agreed to form a joint command center to coordinate and assist with public uprising forces. Fighting has also intensified around Mazar-i-Sharif, and the situation remains highly fluid and unstable.
Lebanon's economic crisis deepens as the Central Bank ends fuel subsidies, opting instead to provide credit lines for fuel imports based on market prices for the Lebanese pound. The decision is expected to result in a significant hike in fuel prices, which would further burden the crisis-hit country's citizens. This follows a World Bank report released on 1 June 2021, warning that Lebanon's economic crisis could become one of the most severe since the mid-19th century if the country's "bankrupt economic system, which benefited a few for so long," is not reformed. The latest decision by the Central Bank is likely to exacerbate the crisis, causing additional hardship for the Lebanese people. <Consequences>
The Taliban continues to make rapid gains in northern Afghanistan, capturing its ninth provincial capital in just six days. The group seized Fayzabad, the capital of Badakhshan Province, which was the former headquarters of the Northern Alliance before the US invasion of Afghanistan. The fall of Fayzabad comes as President Ashraf Ghani appeals to local warlords to confront and fight the Taliban. The Taliban also secured control over Kunduz Airport after hundreds of Afghan National Security Forces personnel in the area surrendered with all their military equipment. US intelligence officials warned that Kabul could fall in a matter of months if the Taliban's advance is not stopped. These developments raise concerns about the future of the country and the fate of its people.
In the past seven days, the Taliban has captured thirteen provincial capitals including Ghazni, Qala e Naw, Kandahar and Herat. The group's rapid advance continues to pose a significant threat to the Afghan government, prompting President Ashraf Ghani to call on local warlords to aid in the fight against the Taliban. The capture of Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and birthplace of the Taliban, is a significant blow to the government. The Taliban's surge comes as the US and NATO withdraw troops from the country, leaving the Afghan security forces to face the militant group alone. The situation is evolving rapidly, and it remains to be seen how the government will respond to the Taliban's continued advance.
The Taliban's rapid advance continues as it seizes control of the provincial capitals of Ghazni, Qala e Naw, Kandahar and Herat, bringing the total number of captured provincial capitals in the past week to thirteen. The situation in Afghanistan has triggered concerns of a humanitarian crisis and prompted the United Nations to call for a humanitarian ceasefire to prevent further violence and allow aid to reach those in need. The fall of these major cities has also raised questions about the future of the country and the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, which is set to end on August 31. Meanwhile, the hashtag #SanctionPakistan, which trended on Twitter in Afghanistan and worldwide on August 9, reflects Afghans' anger towards Pakistan for supporting the Taliban insurgency.
The Taliban's rapid advance in Afghanistan continues as it seizes control of four more provincial capitals, bringing the total number of provincial capitals taken in the past seven days to thirteen, including Kandahar, Herat, Ghazni, and Qala e Naw. As of 12 August, about two-thirds of the country was already in the hands of the Taliban, with only four cities outside their control. Reports suggest that American diplomats were requesting the Taliban not to deface the US embassy in Kabul, with sectors of the US government estimating that the city could fall within 30 days. The drug trade remains a significant part of Afghanistan's economy, accounting for half of the country's GDP.
On 12 August, the Taliban continued their rapid advance, capturing four more provincial capitals - Ghazni, Qala e Naw, Kandahar, and Herat - bringing the total number of provincial capitals taken in the past week to thirteen. Ghazni, located along the Kabul-Kandahar Highway, served as a gateway between Kabul and the southern strongholds, while Kandahar is the birthplace of the Taliban and holds significant cultural and strategic value. The Taliban had also launched an assault on Qala e Naw, capturing the city after failing to do so in July. The central government offered a proposal of "power-sharing" in lieu of ceasefire, which the Taliban has not yet responded to. In response to the rapidly deteriorating security situation, Western governments accelerated plans to evacuate their citizens and local staff from Afghanistan using charter aircraft, with the first deployment expected within the next 24-48 hours and completion by the end of the month. <Timeline - Fall of the provincial capitals>
The Taliban's rapid advance through Afghanistan continues, as they have now captured the provincial capitals of Lashkargah, Chaghcharan, Puli Alam, Qalati Ghilji, and Tarinkot, bringing the number of provincial capitals taken in the past eight days to eighteen. On 13 August, the city of Lashkar Gah, capital of Helmand Province, fell to the Taliban after several weeks of fighting in the Battle of Lashkargah. On the same day, the Taliban took control of Feruz Koh, the capital city of Afghanistan's western province of Ghor. Officials confirmed that Feruz Koh fell without any fighting, becoming the 15th provincial capital to fall within a week. Feruz Koh has a population of nearly 132,000 people. This comes as U.S. officials revised their previous six-month estimate, saying that the fall of Kabul could happen much more quickly, and that some scenarios envision the fall of Kabul within 30 to 90 days. The situation in Afghanistan remains highly volatile, with reports of violence, displacement, and humanitarian crises emerging from various parts of the country.

Singapore has recently updated its travel protocols by launching Vaccinated Travel Lanes for fully vaccinated travellers from Germany and Brunei, while also easing quarantine-free restrictions for travellers from Hong Kong, Macau, Mainland China outside of Jiangsu Province, New Zealand and Taiwan. This marks the country's first step in reopening its borders since the pandemic started. Previously, on 1 September 2020, Singapore had opened applications for "green lane" travel bubbles for visitors from New Zealand and Brunei, which required a COVID-19 test on arrival and self-isolation until a negative result was received, without the need for quarantine upon arrival. These measures were only applicable to those who had remained in their respective countries for the last consecutive 14 days prior to their visit to Singapore. The updated travel protocols aim to stimulate the tourism industry, which has been heavily impacted by the pandemic.
Singapore's plan to establish a travel bubble with Hong Kong has been put on hold indefinitely due to a surge of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. However, Singapore has begun reopening its borders with the launch of Vaccinated Travel Lanes for fully vaccinated travelers from Germany and Brunei, while quarantine-free restrictions will be eased for travelers from Hong Kong, Macau, Mainland China outside of Jiangsu Province, New Zealand, and Taiwan. This move is expected to provide a much-needed boost to the country's tourism industry, which has been severely impacted by the pandemic.
Hong Kong and Singapore have cancelled their plans to launch a quarantine-free "travel bubble" between the two cities due to differences in their COVID-19 policies. Singapore has implemented strict border controls and travel restrictions, while Hong Kong is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases. The travel bubble was initially set to launch in November 2020 but was postponed due to the pandemic. This cancellation is a setback for the tourism industries of both cities, which have been hard hit by the pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of various measures in Singapore, including the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 and its Control Order Regulations 2020, to curb the spread of the virus. These rules banned gatherings and led to fines, court charges, and even jail time for those who violated them. Some individuals on work passes have had their passes revoked and been permanently banned from working in Singapore as a result. One such measure was the establishment of a travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong, which was initially postponed from November 2020 to 2021 due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. However, the travel bubble was eventually canceled in August 2021 due to conflicting COVID-19 strategies between the two cities. <Epidemiology - Wave 6: Control of Variants (April 2021 to present)>
In November 2020, Hong Kong and Singapore agreed to launch a quarantine-free travel bubble to boost tourism and business between the two cities, but the launch date was deferred twice due to a sudden spike in new infections in Hong Kong. In April 2021, the air travel bubble was officially set to relaunch on 26 May, but after a spike in local infections triggered fresh restrictions in Singapore, the Singaporean government announced it would assess any potential changes to the travel bubble. However, in August 2021, Hong Kong and Singapore ultimately canceled plans to resume the travel bubble due to differing COVID-19 policies. As a result, restrictions on travelers from Hong Kong were eased, and tenants in shopping malls in Singapore pushed for rental rebates citing significant drops in revenue.
Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has announced a ten-day nationwide lockdown in an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19. The lockdown, which started on 10th August, was imposed due to a surge in cases and deaths. Schools, universities, and non-essential businesses have been closed, and people have been advised to stay at home as much as possible. Essential services such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and banks will remain open during the lockdown period. The Sri Lankan government has also announced plans to accelerate the country's vaccination program, with the goal of vaccinating the entire adult population by the end of September. As of August 2021, Sri Lanka has reported over 300,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 4,500 deaths.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Sri Lankan parliamentary election was held on 5 August 2020 amidst safety concerns. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party won a landslide victory, securing a two-thirds majority in parliament. The election saw a voter turnout of 71%, with over 16 million people eligible to vote. The opposition party, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), secured 54 seats while the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) won 10 seats. The election was widely praised for being free and fair, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. However, on 16 March 2021, the Court of Appeal annulled the appointment of one of the SLPP's members to parliament due to the individual holding dual citizenship at the time of nomination. The ruling has raised questions about the citizenship status of other parliamentarians and could potentially impact the SLPP's majority in parliament. Additionally, on 20 October 2021, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka dismissed all petitions challenging the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, which had been passed by parliament on 22 October 2020. The amendment grants President Rajapaksa increased powers, including the ability to dissolve parliament after two years and appoint top officials without parliamentary approval.
The 2020 Sri Lankan parliamentary election was held on 5 August 2020 during the pandemic. Initially, voter turnout had been low, primarily fueled by fears of contracting or spreading the virus. Voter turnout slowly increased into the morning, however. Authorities also made wearing face masks a compulsory requirement along with the use of hand sanitizer in the polling stations when voters were entering and leaving them. Sri Lanka was successful in handling the first wave of the pandemic, but unfortunately, the government failed to handle the second and third waves, causing a spike in COVID-19 deaths since November 2020. Sri Lanka saw a sharp spike in COVID-19 cases when the authorities relaxed health restrictions during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year in April 2021. The highly contagious delta variant has been responsible for the considerably high fatality rate in the country since August 2021. In response to the current situation, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa imposes a ten-day nationwide lockdown in Sri Lanka to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
On 27 January 2020, Sri Lanka reported its first case of COVID-19.

Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a controversial incident took place involving a self-proclaimed sorcerer named Dhammika Bandara, who claimed that goddess Kali had given him a recipe for a cure. He gained support from several politicians, including Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachi.

New South Wales continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, reporting a record 1,035 new cases in the past 24 hours. This comes as the region's lockdown has been extended through to the end of September, with officials warning that cases could continue to rise. The latest statistics show that the majority of cases are being reported in Sydney's western suburbs, with many of those infected being unvaccinated. Yesterday, the state reported the deaths of three COVID-19 patients, including a man in his 30s, a man in his 60s, and a man in his 80s, all of whom were unvaccinated.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on events worldwide, with cancellations, postponements, and changes in format or location becoming commonplace. In New South Wales, the situation remains concerning as the state reports a record 1,035 new cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours. This increase highlights the ongoing challenges faced by organizers as they attempt to navigate the ongoing pandemic and plan events in a safe and responsible manner. Many events have been cancelled or altered to comply with social distancing requirements, lockdowns, travel restrictions, and state or national border closures.

The COVID-19 situation in the Philippines worsens as the country reports a record high of 19,441 new cases in the past 24 hours, taking the nationwide total of confirmed cases to 1,935,700. The Philippines has been grappling with a surge in COVID-19 cases, which has prompted the government to impose stricter restrictions in the National Capital Region and other high-risk areas. The rising number of cases has also led to a shortage of hospital beds and oxygen supplies, further straining the country's already overwhelmed healthcare system. Authorities have urged the public to comply with health protocols, including wearing masks and social distancing, to help curb the spread of the virus.
On 27th August 2021, the United States launched an airstrike targeting a vehicle in Nangarhar Province, which resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people, including seven children. The targeted individual was an aid worker for U.S.-based Nutrition and Education International, who was bringing home water for his family. Some of those killed had previously worked for international organizations and held visas allowing them entry to the United States. The majority of the casualties were residents of the area, and there are reports of other civilians being killed too. The airstrike was carried out a day after the 2021 Kabul airport attack, which resulted in the death of more than 180 people. It is a tragic incident that highlights the human cost of military action, and investigations are ongoing to determine the circumstances surrounding the attack.
In 2021, the Saudi-led coalition reported multiple hostile incidents, including the foiling of an attack with two booby-trapped boats in the south of the Red Sea and the interception of an explosives-laden drone fired by the Houthis towards the city of Khamis Mushait. On July 4th, a drone attack against the Abha International Airport in Abha, Saudi Arabia, injured eight people. The attack highlights the ongoing conflict in the region and the threat posed by drone warfare. The situation remains tense, and efforts are ongoing to deescalate tensions and find a peaceful resolution.
On August 30, 2021, Houthi forces launched a drone attack on the Abha International Airport in Saudi Arabia, which left eight civilians wounded and one civilian aircraft damaged, according to Saudi authorities. The attack highlights the ongoing conflict in the region and the threat posed by drone warfare. This is not the first time that the airport has been targeted, and there are concerns that such attacks could escalate tensions in the region. Efforts are ongoing to deescalate the situation and find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The attack also underscores the need for increased security measures to prevent such incidents in the future.
In September 2021, the Panjshir Valley saw intense fighting as the Taliban entered the region and clashed with National Resistance Front of Afghanistan forces led by Ahmad Massoud. Both sides reported heavy casualties as the Taliban seized some territory. This comes after reports on 2nd September 2021 claimed that 13 Taliban fighters were killed in an ambush in Chikrinow district, and the Taliban spokesman stated that the valley was surrounded from all four directions and Taliban forces were seizing locations. Earlier, in August 2021, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, had suggested the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government to end the stalemate. The situation remains tense, and it is unclear how the conflict will be resolved.
White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain has announced that approximately 100 Americans remain in Afghanistan after the August 31 withdrawal deadline. Klain also mentioned that the Biden administration will continue its efforts to rescue them. This new development follows the U.S.'s announcement on 27 August 2021, where they opened military bases to provide housing and support for up to 5,000 Afghan nationals who are applying for Special Immigration Visa (SIV) or are deemed to be "at risk". These bases included Marine Corps Base Quantico, Fort Pickett, Fort Lee, Fort McCoy, Fort Bliss, Joint Base McGuire-Dix, and Holloman Air Force Base. This is part of the operational history of the Kabul airlift. The situation in Afghanistan remains uncertain, and the U.S. government continues to monitor the situation and provide assistance where possible.
White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain stated on 5 September that around 100 Americans remain in Afghanistan after the August 31 withdrawal deadline, and that the Biden administration will attempt to find ways to rescue them. In addition, the remains of another dead Afghan were found in the landing gear of an American C-17, after pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in a nearby country because they were unable to retract the landing gear. The chaos and danger at the Kabul airport continued with eleven more civilian deaths during stampedes, seven of whom died in a single incident on August 21. Additionally, the Taliban has fired crowd control shots at the Kabul airport, injuring some people. Three more people died during gun incidents, including two armed men who fired into a crowd and were killed by US troops, while the other was an Afghan guard killed during a gunfight between Afghan forces and unknown gunmen. The latest updates suggest that the situation in Afghanistan remains volatile and unstable, with the US continuing its efforts to evacuate its citizens and Afghan allies. <Casualties>
According to recent reports, anti-Taliban forces in Panjshir have accused Pakistan of directly supporting the Taliban offensive by bombing them with Pakistan Air Force drones. The resistance fighters claim that the Pakistan Air Force used smart bombs against them, and Pakistan's special forces have also reportedly assisted the Taliban in their attacks. These accusations have further strained the already tense relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, with Afghanistan accusing Pakistan of providing support to the Taliban throughout the conflict. The situation in Panjshir remains tense, with both sides claiming gains and heavy casualties.
The Philippines recorded its highest daily COVID-19 case count on September 6, with 22,415 new cases reported within 24 hours, bringing the nationwide total of confirmed cases to 2,103,331. The sharp rise in cases has been attributed to the highly contagious Delta variant, with health officials warning that hospitals in the capital region are reaching their capacity. The Philippine government has extended its strict lockdown in the capital Manila until September 15, while also imposing a travel ban on 10 countries with high COVID-19 cases, including India and Indonesia, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
A strong 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit just outside the tourist city of Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico, killing at least one person and leaving more than 1.6 million without electricity. The earthquake was a thrust faulting event located on or near the subduction zone boundary of the Caribbean Plate and Cocos Plate, occurring at the southern extent of the Guerrero Gap, a seismic gap capable of generating a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. The earthquake was first measured at a magnitude of 7.4 by the USGS, however, it was later downgraded to 7.0. The earthquake was relatively shallow, only 12 miles (20 kilometers) below the surface, which would have amplified the shaking effect. The extent of damage is still being assessed. <Damage>
In a ruling issued on September 10, 2021, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found Apple Inc. guilty of anti-competitive conduct by preventing app developers from directing users to third-party payment options. While Judge Rogers found in favor of Apple on nine of the ten counts brought up against them in the case, she ruled against the company on the final charge related to anti-steering provisions, and issued a permanent injunction that, in 90 days from the ruling, prevented Apple from preventing developers from linking app users to other storefronts from within apps to complete purchases. The ruling implies that Apple cannot stop mobile app developers from directing users to third-party payment options.
In a recent development, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney confirmed that they will not be bringing Fortnite back to iOS until Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment and pass on the savings to consumers. This statement follows the recent ruling by US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who issued a permanent injunction against Apple Inc. preventing the company from stopping mobile app developers from directing users to third-party payment options. The ruling came after Epic filed a lawsuit against Apple alleging that the company engaged in anticompetitive behavior by forcing developers to use its in-app payment system and taking a 30% cut of revenue. Judge Rogers also concluded that Apple was not a monopoly, despite enjoying a market share of over 55% and high-profit margins, stating that this type of success was not an illegal monopoly.
Apple has reacted to the ruling, with a representative stating that "Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law." The ruling comes after Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, sued Apple in August 2020, after the tech giant removed the game from its App Store for violating the store's payment guidelines. While the judge ruled against Epic in some aspects of the case, she also required Apple to pay $3.6 million in revenue that was withheld to Apple related to Epic's attempts to bypass the App Store. The decision is expected to have significant implications for the broader technology industry and could lead to further legal challenges against the App Store.
In a significant ruling, United States District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has issued a permanent injunction against Apple Inc., preventing them from preventing mobile app developers from directing users to third-party payment options. This decision is a result of the legal battle between Epic Games and Apple over Apple's App Store practices. While the judge found in favor of Apple on nine of ten counts brought up against them in the case, including Epic's charges related to Apple's 30% revenue cut and Apple's prohibition against third-party marketplaces on the iOS environment, she did rule against Apple on the final charge related to anti-steering provisions. The ruling means that Apple will not be allowed to stop developers from linking app users to other storefronts from within apps to complete purchases. In response to the ruling, a representative for Apple stated that "Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law." Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, however, stated that the decision "isn't a win for developers or for consumers", that Epic would not be bringing Fortnite back to iOS until "when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment, passing along the savings to consumers", and that they would continue to litigate on this matter.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has announced that 21 Americans have been evacuated from Afghanistan, providing some relief for the roughly 100 Americans who remain stranded in the country. The evacuation follows weeks of efforts to extract U.S. citizens and allies from Afghanistan after the Taliban took over the country in mid-August. The situation remains tense, with the Taliban asserting that all foreign troops must leave the country by September 11, 2021, and warning that any extensions could have consequences. The Biden administration has pledged to continue working to get remaining U.S. citizens and allies out of the country, but the situation on the ground remains challenging. <Operational history - Kabul airlift>

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) makes history as it installs the Rev. Dr. Megan Rohrer as Bishop of the Sierra Pacific Synod, who is the first openly transgender and non-binary Bishop in any major Christian denomination. This event represents a significant step forward for the LGBTQ+ community, particularly within the church. This installation follows the coming out of bishop Kevin Kanouse, another bishop in the ELCA, as gay in 2015. The ELCA has been at the forefront of discussions surrounding LGBTQ+ rights within the church, and this latest development could inspire other denominations to follow suit.
The Sierra Pacific Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) made history on May 8, 2021, when they elected the Reverend Doctor Megan Rohrer as the first openly transgender bishop in any major Christian denomination. Rohrer was officially installed on September 11, 2021. The ELCA has been at the forefront of LGBTQ+ inclusion, with bishop Kevin Kanouse coming out as gay in 2015. Rohrer's appointment marks a significant milestone in the fight for equality in the church. Meanwhile, the United Methodist Church has been grappling with the issue of human sexuality, with the General Conference voting in favour of a motion to defer the issue to the Council of Bishops to re-examine the Book of Discipline. In 2018, the Council of Bishops proposed allowing individual pastors and regional church bodies to decide whether to ordain LGBT clergy and perform same-sex weddings, though this proposal can only be approved by the General Conference.
The Taliban deliberately targeted civilians in Panjshir Province, according to reports by the BBC, despite promises to avoid retaliatory attacks on local civilians. One of the documented cases was that of a shopkeeper as the news agency says that up to 20 civilians were killed by Taliban fighters during their advance on the last anti-Taliban stronghold. Additionally, on 11 September, Tasnim News Agency reporters were allowed into Panjshir, where they met with a group of Red Unit Taliban fighters who claimed that all of Panjshir was captured and resistance forces may have taken shelter in nearby mountainous areas. Many civilians were seen fleeing the area fearing of renewed clashes. Reporters also interviewed a NRF supporter who blamed the Taliban for not establishing an inclusive government and claimed that the Pakistan Air Force had helped the Taliban. <Timeline - Taliban offensive and revolts in central Afghanistan>
On August 29, the U.S. military conducted a drone strike near Kabul International Airport, killing 10 civilians instead of ISIL-K militants. Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. has now acknowledged the mistake. The victims included seven children and Ahmadi, who had loaded bottles of water into his trunk for his family and neighbors. US officials initially claimed the vehicle had visited an alleged ISIS-K safe house, but it was later revealed that the location the drone had tracked Ahmadi to was the office of Nutrition and Education International. The tragic incident has raised questions about the accuracy of US intelligence and the use of drones in military operations. [ADD] <Timeline - 2021>
The United States government has faced severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused by its drone strikes, with Amnesty International USA questioning the legality of such attacks. The criticism has intensified following Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr.'s acknowledgment that the August 29 drone strike near Kabul International Airport killed 10 civilians instead of ISIL-K militants as previously claimed by the U.S. military. The Pentagon also later admitted that the targeted individual, Zemari Ahmadi, and the vehicle he was driving posed no threat and that there was no connection between Ahmadi and ISIS-K.
Activists in Italy have successfully collected enough signatures to trigger a referendum on the decriminalization of marijuana cultivation and the repeal of penalties for cannabis possession. The initiative aims to amend articles of the Presidential Decree DPR 309/90 of 1990, which concerns the discipline of narcotics and psychotropic substances, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of substance dependence, responsible for reportedly 35% of the current prison population in Italy. The campaign is supported by pro-legalization organizations such as ARCI and the Luca Coscioni Association and political parties, including Italian Radicals, +Europa, Possible, Power to the People, Communist Refoundation, and Italian Left. The signatures will need to be verified, and the referendum will be held in spring 2022 if a ballot question is deemed in line with the Constitution.
Italian activists have reportedly gathered enough signatures to trigger a referendum on the liberalization of cannabis use in the country. Cannabis inflorescences are currently classified as narcotics, and their pharmaceutical use is strictly regulated in accordance with UN Conventions of 1961 and 1971, EU regulations, and national legislation, including the DPR 309/90 of 1990. The campaign for the referendum collected 400,000 signatures within its first week of operation, which continued to increase over time. A new law approved in July 2021 allowed signatures to be collected online, and the campaign continued collecting signatures until the deadline to ensure the proposal is not rejected due to invalid signatures. The signatures must be verified by the Supreme Court of Cassation, and the Constitutional Court must verify that the ballot question is in line with the Constitution. Once verified, the President will set a date for the referendum, which could take place as early as spring 2022.
In Italy, activists have collected enough signatures to trigger a referendum on the liberalization of cannabis use, according to recent reports. The campaign was launched to decriminalize the cultivation of marijuana and repeal penalties for cannabis possession by amending several articles of the Presidential Decree DPR 309/90 of 1990. The initiative was supported by pro-legalization organizations and several political parties, and the campaign was able to collect 400,000 signatures in less than four days when it first began. The speed at which signatures were collected was made possible by a law passed in July 2021, which allowed signatures to be collected online. The required 500,000 signatures were collected well before the end of September, which means the referendum can be held as early as spring 2022. The collected signatures will need to be verified by the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Constitutional Court, and the President will set a date for the referendum once the ballot question is deemed to be in line with the Constitution.
Isko Moreno, the Mayor of Manila, has announced his candidacy for the presidency of the Philippines in the 2022 elections. Moreno, whose full name is Francisco Domagoso, made the announcement at the Manila Hotel and said that he would be running as an independent candidate with a message of "pagbabago at malasakit" (change and compassion). Moreno is known for his efforts to revitalize Manila, including cleaning up the city's streets and cracking down on illegal vendors. He is expected to face tough competition in the presidential race, with incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte endorsing his long-time aide, Christopher "Bong" Go, and several other prominent politicians also running for the position.
Victoria has recorded a grim milestone as it reports a new record of 766 daily COVID-19 cases and four deaths. The new figures come after a recent protest in Melbourne on 22 September, where up to 1,000 people gathered at the Shrine of Remembrance. The police were forced to surround the protesters, and two officers were injured by thrown bottles. Over 200 people were arrested, and an estimated 300 fines were issued for not complying with stay-at-home directives. With this new surge in cases, it remains uncertain when the lockdown in Victoria will be lifted. <Timeline - Protests>
Melbourne, Australia, continues to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic, as Victoria state reports a record 766 new cases and four deaths in the past 24 hours. As of September 23, Melbourne had set a record for the world's longest lockdown, lasting 235 days. The city is expected to remain locked down until "late October" in an effort to control the spread of the virus. The ongoing lockdown has led to the cancellation of many events and has had a significant impact on the local economy. The situation remains fluid, and authorities continue to closely monitor the situation in Victoria.
Singapore has recorded a record high of 1,504 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 82,856. This increase in cases has been attributed to the recent surge in infections among migrant workers living in dormitories. In response, the government has implemented stricter measures, such as reducing the number of people allowed to gather in public and mandating that certain businesses, such as gyms and restaurants, only serve fully vaccinated individuals. The government has also encouraged the public to get vaccinated, with vaccination rates currently at around 80% of the population being fully vaccinated.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has resulted in the country surpassing 700,000 deaths, the most of any country. Since January 2020, there have been 80,140,309 confirmed cases reported, with 982,371 deaths. As of May 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that there could be a total of 120.2 million infections in the United States. COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. U.S. life expectancy dropped by 3 years for Hispanic Americans, 2.9 years for African Americans, and 1.2 years for white Americans from 2019 to 2020. <Summary>
In late November 2019, COVID-19 infections broke out in Wuhan, China, and by January 20, 2020, China and the World Health Organization confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. The first COVID-19 case in the US was reported on January 20, although a 2021 study showed that five states already had cases weeks earlier. On January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and on February 2, the US enacted travel restrictions to and from China. By February 25, the CDC warned the American public to prepare for a local outbreak. On March 16, the United States Department of State advised US citizens to avoid all international travel. COVID-19 quickly spread throughout the US, causing 700,000 deaths as of October 2021, making it the country with the highest death toll from the pandemic.
The United States' response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was marked by a series of events. On July 6, 2020, the United States Department of State announced the country's withdrawal from WHO effective July 6, 2021. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to "shut it down now, and start over". In July and early August, requests multiplied, with a number of experts asking for lockdowns of "six to eight weeks" that they believed would restore the country by October 1, in time to reopen schools and have an in-person election. On July 10, the CDC adopted the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), "the number of individuals who die of the disease among all infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)", as a new metric for disease severity. However, as of October 2021, the United States had surpassed 700,000 deaths from COVID-19, underscoring the continued impact of the pandemic.
In August 2020, over 400,000 people attended the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, and from there, at least 300 people in more than 20 states were infected. The CDC followed up with a report on the associated 51 confirmed primary event-associated cases, 21 secondary cases, and five tertiary cases in the neighboring state of Minnesota, where one attendee died of COVID-19. Experts had been asking for lockdowns of "six to eight weeks" that they believed would restore the country by October 1, in time to reopen schools and have an in-person election. However, the United States has now surpassed 700,000 deaths from COVID-19, indicating that the pandemic has had a far-reaching impact on the country, and the situation has evolved since the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and the initial calls for lockdowns. <Timeline - December 2019 to present day>
USA Today studied the aftermath of presidential election campaigning, recognizing that causation was impossible to determine. Among their findings, cases increased 35 percent compared to 14 percent for the state after a Trump rally in Beltrami County, Minnesota. One case was traced to a Joe Biden rally in Duluth, Minnesota. In November 2020, President-elect Biden's transition team announced his COVID-19 Advisory Board. However, the devastating impact of the pandemic continued, and the United States has now surpassed 700,000 deaths from COVID-19.
In early 2020, the CDC updated its China travel recommendations to level 3, its highest alert, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. In October 2021, the United States surpassed 700,000 deaths from COVID-19. Despite efforts to contain the virus, some states like Texas and Arizona proceeded with reopening without adequate contact tracing programs in place. Health experts expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission, and funding for contact tracing was thought to be insufficient. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir for the treatment of COVID‐19 requiring hospitalization, but the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19 was revoked in June 2020 due to lack of evidence for their efficacy. Despite this, former President Trump continued to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 through late July.
From the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. During the first year, an ad-hoc organization called Stop AAPI Hate received 3,795 reports of racism against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. In terms of mortality rates, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates. American Indian or Alaska Native, Non-Hispanic persons had the highest rates of both hospitalizations and deaths, while Hispanic and Latino persons suffered the highest rates of COVID compared to White persons. However, only 61% of case reports included race and ethnicity data, which could result in inaccurate estimates of the relative risk among groups. Additionally, a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2020 revealed that the effect of stress and weathering on minority groups decreases their stamina against COVID. The United States has now surpassed 700,000 deaths from COVID-19, highlighting the devastating impact of the pandemic on all communities. <Impacts - Social>
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to take a devastating toll on the United States, as the country has now surpassed 700,000 deaths due to the virus. From the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans, with an ad-hoc organization called Stop AAPI Hate receiving 3,795 reports of racism against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders during the first year. However, as the pandemic progressed, it became clear that certain racial and ethnic groups were disproportionately affected by COVID-19. As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. In June 2021, the CDC confirmed these numbers, reporting that American Indian or Alaska Native, Non-Hispanic persons had the highest rates of both hospitalizations and deaths, while Hispanic and Latino persons suffered the highest rates of COVID compared to White persons. However, the CDC noted that only 61% of case reports included race and ethnicity data, which could result in inaccurate estimates of the relative risk among groups.

After multiple delays, Qataris have finally headed to the polls to elect 30 members of the Consultative Assembly in the country's first legislative elections. Originally scheduled for the second half of 2013, the elections were repeatedly postponed, with Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani pledging to hold the election in October 2021. The Consultative Assembly is expected to play a key role in shaping the future of Qatar, with its members empowered to propose laws and question ministers. The move towards greater democracy has been welcomed by many Qataris, although some have criticized the limited powers of the Assembly and the restrictions on who is eligible to vote.
After multiple postponements, Qataris are finally heading to the polls to elect 30 members of the Consultative Assembly in the country's first legislative elections. Originally scheduled to be held in the last six months of 2013, the elections were postponed prior to the retiring Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani transferring power to his son Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The Consultative Assembly's term was extended until 2016 and then until 2019. However, in November 2020, Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani pledged to hold the election in October 2021, and now, after much anticipation, Qataris are participating in the country's first-ever legislative elections.
Qataris are voting in the country's first legislative elections to elect 30 members of the Consultative Assembly, which were finally scheduled to take place in October 2021 after being postponed several times since 2013. The electoral law, which mandates the 30 members to be elected from single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, was approved by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in July 2021. The law requires candidates to be at least 30 years old and of Qatari origin, which limited voting to those descended from people who held citizenship in 1930, leading to protests. Political parties are banned, and all candidates ran as independents.

The limited voting system to those descended from people who held citizenship in 1930 has led to protests, barring people who had been naturalized and members of the Al Murrah tribe from contesting the election.
A commission created to investigate sexual abuse by clergy in France has revealed that since the 1950s, about 3,000 pedophiles committed sex crimes in the country. This comes after the Conference of French Bishops approved a resolution in November 2019, agreeing that every French Catholic Bishop would pay compensation for abuse that took place in the French Catholic Church. Former priest Bernard Preynat was sentenced to five years in prison in March 2020 after being convicted of sexually assaulting boy scouts, and former French nuncio Luigi Ventura received a suspended eight-month prison sentence for sexual harassment in December 2020. The commission's report has prompted calls for justice for the victims and further reforms within the Catholic Church in France.
A commission in France has released a report revealing that over 3,000 Catholic clergy members have committed sex crimes since the 1950s. The report estimates that these abusers were among the more than 115,000 priests and religious officials in the country. The report shows that around 80% of the victims were male and 20% female. This report comes after the Conference of French Bishops approved a resolution in November 2019 agreeing that every French Catholic bishop would pay compensation for abuse which took place in the French Catholic Church. The report sheds light on the extent of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church in France, and is likely to renew calls for accountability and reform.

New Zealand has abandoned its elimination strategy to tackle COVID-19 in favor of a new model that aims to keep the virus contained as vaccination rates increase. The decision was made due to the continued outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant. New Zealand has been praised for its successful elimination strategy that has kept the virus at bay, but this new approach is seen as a necessary adjustment in the face of the ongoing pandemic. As of August 2021, Australia had also abandoned its elimination strategy, conceding defeat in their efforts to eradicate the virus in New South Wales and Victoria.
Note: The statistical information in this table may vary from official reports and WHO data, and is known to inconsistently include historical and suspected cases which may have returned a positive diagnostic test result. In early October 2021, New Zealand also abandoned its elimination strategy and shifted to a new approach that prioritizes vaccination rates to control the spread of the Delta variant. The country has faced a surge in cases since the beginning of the outbreak, with a total of 4,986 confirmed cases and 30 deaths as of October 4, 2021. The New Zealand government has emphasized the importance of vaccination and has set a goal of reaching 90% vaccination rates for eligible populations.
New Zealand has recently announced a shift in its COVID-19 strategy, moving away from the previous elimination approach and towards a model that focuses on vaccination rates in the face of the ongoing Delta variant outbreak.

Tonga's recent election is a significant development in the country's democratic history. The previous article provided no information about the election, but the new update highlights the importance of Tonga's political process. The country's government consists of a monarchy and a parliament, and the election of a new government marks a crucial step in Tonga's political system. As the only Pacific Island nation never to have been colonized, Tonga's political independence is crucial for its sovereignty and international relations. The new government's priorities and policies will have implications for Tonga's economic and social development, and the election's outcome is thus of great interest to those following Pacific Island politics. This new information is highly relevant for anyone interested in Tonga's political system and the Pacific Island region as a whole.

The announcement comes amid the ongoing Tigray War, a civil war that began on 3 November 2020 in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. The local Tigray Defense Forces (TDF) are fighting the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF), the Ethiopian Federal Police, regional police, and gendarmerie forces of the neighboring Amhara and Afar regions with the involvement of the Eritrean Defense Forces (EDF). All sides, particularly the ENDF, EDF, and TDF have committed war crimes during the conflict. The Ethiopian government declared a six-month state of emergency on 2 November 2021, which allows for the arrest and detention of critics of the government without a court warrant, the imposition of curfews, censorship, restrictions on freedom of movement, and the calling of any adult person to fight in the war, with the fear of serving from three to ten years in prison. Four other regional governments also made a call to arms. On 5 November, the TPLF, OLA, and other rebel groups declared the creation of a nine-group coalition, called the United Front of Ethiopian Federalist and Confederalist Forces.

Australia reports its first cases of the Omicron variant in two people who travelled from Southern Africa and are currently in quarantine in a hotel in New South Wales. The country has responded quickly by tightening its borders and travel restrictions. The government has also announced that booster shots will be made available to all Australians from December 10th, a week earlier than initially planned. Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has urged residents to get vaccinated, stating that the state will not hesitate to introduce stricter restrictions if necessary.
Australia has reported its first cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, as two people who travelled from Southern Africa have tested positive while in quarantine in a hotel in New South Wales. The Australian government has imposed strict border measures, including mandatory testing and quarantine, for all international arrivals to prevent the spread of the new variant. The country has also ramped up its vaccination efforts and is urging people to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The news of the Omicron cases comes as Australia has been grappling with rising cases of COVID-19 in some states, with the government imposing restrictions and lockdowns in certain areas to contain the spread of the virus.
Australia, which has been cautious in imposing strict border restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19, reported its first cases of the Omicron variant on 1 December 2021. Two people who recently traveled from Southern Africa tested positive while in quarantine in a hotel in New South Wales. This development has raised concerns about the potential impact of the highly contagious Omicron variant, which has been classified by the World Health Organization as a "variant of concern." In February 2020, Australia banned the entry of foreign nationals who had been in mainland China and ordered its own returning citizens who had been in China to self-quarantine for 14 days in an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Australia has confirmed its first cases of the Omicron variant on December 1, 2021, in two individuals who had traveled from Southern Africa and were currently in quarantine in a hotel in New South Wales. The Australian government had announced that the country was prepared for the arrival of Omicron and had implemented measures such as testing and quarantine protocols for incoming travelers. As of November 5, 2021, Australia had reached its 80 percent vaccination target and had entered the consolidation phase of its COVID-19 transition plan, during which the country continued to assess the relative risk of reflected transmission through third countries and asked travelers arriving from higher-risk countries to monitor for symptoms. The largest cluster in Australia from the start of the pandemic until November 5, 2021, was the Flemington/North Melbourne public housing cluster with 310 cases.
The Australian government had entered agreements with various pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer/BioNTech, University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax, and COVAX for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines. However, the University of Queensland vaccine was abandoned in December 2020 due to false positives on HIV tests. While the Pfizer vaccine was provisionally approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in January 2021, production problems and export controls imposed by the European Union delayed its delivery schedule. The Australian government reduced its order from 3.8 million to 1.2 million doses, with the first 80,000 delivered in February 2021 and the rest expected in March 2021. [ADD] The country's vaccination program continued, with more than 11 million doses administered as of December 2021. In December 2021, Australia also began offering booster shots to eligible populations, including those aged 18 and over who have received their second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at least six months prior. However, the emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 posed new challenges to the country's efforts to control the pandemic.
Australia has been grappling with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its economy and society, and the recent detection of the Omicron variant in two travelers has raised concerns about its potential impact on the country. Prior to the pandemic, the arts industry in Australia was thriving, with 600,000 people employed in the sector and contributing around A$3.2 billion to export revenues. However, the cancellation of events such as the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in March 2020 has highlighted the devastating impact of the crisis on the industry. The Australian government has since implemented the National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response, which outlines a pathway to easing restrictions and reopening the economy as vaccination rates increase.
Australia has reported its first cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, as two individuals who traveled from Southern Africa tested positive while in quarantine at a hotel in New South Wales. This development has led to renewed concerns about the spread of the new variant, which is believed to be highly transmissible and potentially resistant to some vaccines. The Australian government has indicated that it is closely monitoring the situation and has implemented strict measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including enhanced quarantine procedures for international travelers. This new development underscores the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to impact communities around the world.

In related news, on 24 August, the Colombian government had announced its decision to ease restrictions in most of the country's main cities due to a plateau or downwards trend in new cases and deaths, which was seen as a positive step towards accelerating the economic recovery of the country. However, the impact of the Omicron variant on these plans remains to be seen, and authorities are likely to monitor the situation closely to determine the appropriate course of action.
On 24 August, President Iván Duque announced that the lockdown that was in force in the country since March would end on 1 September, and starting from that day and for at least one month, the country would enter into a new stage named "selective isolation", aimed at isolating only specific cases of people infected or suspected to be infected with the virus and their inner circle while also lifting most restrictions on mobility for the remainder of the population. However, President Duque pointed out that the health emergency which was also in place in the country would be extended until 30 November. This comes as Colombia reports its first cases of the Omicron variant, with two Colombian citizens who had traveled from the United States and a U.S. citizen who traveled from Spain testing positive. The government has yet to announce any new measures in response to this development, but health officials are closely monitoring the situation and urging the public to continue following preventative measures.

Colombia has reported its first cases of the Omicron variant, with two Colombian nationals who had travelled from the United States and a U.S. citizen who travelled from Spain testing positive for the variant. This news comes as Colombia continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, with the country having reached one million confirmed cases in October 2020. At that time, President Ivan Duque announced an extension of the selective isolation stage until 30 November, which maintained certain restrictions on mobility, including the closure of certain businesses such as amusement parks, but allowed for the lifting of other restrictions. The impact on restaurants and retail was significant, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat amid the pandemic. As the country faces the emergence of the Omicron variant, it remains to be seen what measures will be put in place to contain its spread and what the impact on the economy and employment will be.
Colombia has reported its first case of the Omicron variant, which involved two Colombian individuals who had traveled from the United States and a U.S. citizen who had traveled from Spain. This development comes after the National Health Institute (INS) released preliminary findings of its seroprevalence study aimed at determining a more accurate estimate of the percentage of Colombian population that had already had contact with the novel coronavirus. The study was being performed in 10 cities through strategies such as mass, random sampling and blood test analysis on over 20,000 people, with the first findings revealing that nearly 60% of screened people in Leticia (59%) and Barranquilla (57%) had developed coronavirus antibodies. The seroprevalence findings were higher than in other countries, indicating the country has taken steps towards potential herd immunity. However, it was also evident that the proportion of the population still susceptible to infection was still high and the containment strategies of the virus were not the best. On 2 December, former senator Juan José García Romero died of COVID-19 at age 76. [RM] <Impact - Restaurants and retail>
The Colombian government had previously announced that mass vaccination would begin in February, divided into five stages. While the country's preliminary seroprevalence study showed progress towards potential herd immunity, it also revealed that the proportion of the population still susceptible to infection was high, and containment strategies were not optimal. In terms of public order, protests erupted in various cities in November and December, leading to the imposition of curfews and restrictions on gatherings by local authorities. However, on a positive note, on 16 December, the National Food and Drug Surveillance Institute (INVIMA) authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, becoming the first vaccine to receive such approval in Colombia.
The Colombian government had announced a plan to begin mass vaccination in February, divided into five stages, with the first stage covering all front-line health and support workers as well as people over 80 years old. The second stage would cover health workers in the second and third lines of attention, as well as people aged 60 to 79, while the third stage would cover inhabitants aged 16 to 60 with comorbidities as well as all elementary and high school teachers. While these plans were being made, Colombia reported its first cases of the Omicron variant, with two Colombian people who traveled from the United States and a U.S. citizen who traveled from Spain. The impact of this new development on the government's vaccination plans and public order remains to be seen.
Colombia has reported its first cases of the Omicron variant, with two Colombian nationals who traveled from the United States and a US citizen who traveled from Spain testing positive. This development has raised concerns about the spread of the new variant, which is believed to be more transmissible than previous strains and potentially capable of evading immunity. Meanwhile, in terms of government responses, while Colombia had increased its intensive care beds from 5,539 at the beginning of 2019 to 11,905 at the beginning of 2021, the emergence of the Omicron variant highlights the importance of ongoing efforts to strengthen healthcare systems and vaccination campaigns to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Colombia has reported its first cases of the Omicron variant, with two individuals who travelled from the United States and a U.S. citizen who travelled from Spain testing positive for the variant. The announcement comes after the country had already been grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, with the government implementing a mass vaccination plan divided into five stages and increasing the number of intensive care beds to address the expected needs of COVID-19 patients. Colombia was also included in the first group of eligible countries for vaccine distribution through the COVAX strategy, with distribution likely starting from the first week of February.

Colombia has reported its first cases of the Omicron variant, with two Colombian individuals who traveled from the United States and a U.S. citizen who traveled from Spain testing positive for the variant. This development comes after the Colombian government had previously confirmed the purchase of 10 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 2.5 million doses of the vaccine by Sinovac, in addition to 10 million doses from Pfizer–BioNTech, 10 million doses from Oxford–AstraZeneca, 9 million doses from Janssen, and 10 million doses through COVAX. Despite these efforts, Colombia's response to the pandemic had previously been described as the third worst out of a group of 98 countries according to the Lowy Institute, an independent think tank in Australia, only ahead of Brazil and Mexico. In January, the detection of the new P.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2 (later to be known as "Gamma") had prompted the Colombian government to suspend passenger flights to and from Leticia for 15 days and flights between Colombia and Brazil for 30 days. <Government responses - Vaccination>

In June 2017, it was reported that Iran was responsible for a cyberattack on the British Parliament, which compromised around 90 email accounts of MPs. The motive for the attack was unknown, but experts suggested that it could be linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' alleged use of cyberwarfare to undermine the Iran nuclear deal. Recent developments show that suspected Iranian hackers have targeted the website of Israel's Jerusalem Post newspaper. The attack resulted in the replacement of the website's content with a threat aimed at the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center and an apparent reference to the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, two years earlier in Baghdad. The attack is thought to be a part of the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, which have escalated in recent years. [UPDATED]

William Bryan, who recorded the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after being convicted for his role in the murder. Bryan's lawyer had previously claimed that his client was merely a witness to the shooting and had done nothing wrong. However, prosecutors argued that Bryan was involved in chasing and "corraling" Arbery, and therefore participated in the murder. Following the release of the video, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr and Governor Brian Kemp both called for justice and answers about the incident. The shooting also sparked widespread outrage and calls for a full investigation from politicians, including then-presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who described the shooting as a lynching.

Chief of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, stated that NATO's "Deliveries of helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and aeroplanes to Ukraine are pushing the Ukrainian authorities to take sharp and dangerous steps. Any provocations of the Ukrainian authorities by way of a forced settlement of the problems of Donbass will be suppressed."

Sweden has announced that it will withdraw its troops from the French-led special forces mission in Mali later this year, in response to Mali's ruling military junta inviting private Russian military contractors to fight Islamist rebels. The Swedish contribution to Barkhane via Task Force Takuba arrived in Mali during February 2021. The Swedish troop contribution to Task Force Takuba is a 150-man strong helicopter-borne rapid-response force, centered around an SOG task unit and supported by three UH60M helicopters and one C130, ready to be deployed if something unforeseen occurs. The task force will also be used for other operations, as for example to support other countries that exercise and conduct operations with the Malian army. Barkhane began in 2014-2015 to address the growing jihadist insurgency in the Sahel region.

This decision comes after much controversy and public outrage over an unvaccinated athlete being allowed to enter the country to participate in the Australian Open while many Australians remain stranded overseas due to the pandemic. Djokovic's entry into the country was also complicated by visa controversies and an ongoing legal battle over his visa application. The decision to cancel Djokovic's visa was met with mixed reactions, with some supporting the move while others criticized it as a violation of his rights and questioned the government's handling of the situation.

On January 15, 2022, an armed man, Malik Akram, took four people hostage at Congregation Beth Israel, a Jewish synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, United States. The FBI believed that Akram acted alone, and his motive for the hostage-taking was his anger over the U.S. imprisonment of Aafia Siddiqui. President Joe Biden said Akram was armed with guns, but his claim of being armed with a bomb was not true. Matthew DeSarno, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office, said there was no indication that the man was part of any broader plan, and the FBI Shooting Incident Review Team "will conduct a thorough, factual, and objective investigation of the events." A day after the incident, Akram was shot dead by the FBI's hostage rescue team, and the four hostages were freed.

The Washington Football Team is set to be renamed the Washington Commanders for the 2022 NFL season, replacing the previous Redskins name which was deemed to be a racial slur and retired in 2020 following nationwide protests. The decision to rename the team was made to ensure that there were no ties to Native Americans, and a list of eight potential names was released in July 2021. The team president, Jason Wright, confirmed that Native American-inspired headdresses or face paint would not be allowed in the stadium, while fans were expected to continue wearing their jerseys with the previous name and logo. However, on February 2, 2022, it was announced that the team would be renamed the Washington Commanders.
The football team that shared the playing field and name with the Boston Braves baseball team moved to Fenway Park in 1933, already home to the Boston Red Sox. Co-owner George Preston Marshall changed the team's name to the Redskins, retaining Native American imagery while avoiding confusion, though the true reason behind the name change is still debated. However, it was announced in mid-2020, following nationwide protests over racial inequality after the murder of George Floyd, that the Redskins name would be retired as it was considered a racial slur. In the 2022 NFL season, the Washington Football Team will be renamed as the Washington Commanders to replace the controversial name.
The Washington Football Team has officially changed its name to the Washington Commanders, replacing the former Redskins name which was considered a racial slur and was retired in mid-2020 following the nationwide George Floyd protests. The new name was announced on February 2, 2022. However, some Native American activists like Amanda Blackhorse criticized the change as an empty gesture, pointing out that the team's owner has made no substantial effort to repair the effects of decades of insults and has not advocated for other teams with offensive mascots to also change. The team's previous logo, introduced in 1972, was modeled after the likeness on the Buffalo nickel and was proposed by Walter Wetzel, a former Blackfeet tribal chairman and past president of the National Congress of American Indians. Despite some members of the Blackfeet tribe expressing support, others remain strongly opposed to the former Redskins name based upon their personal experiences.
In mid-2020, amidst the George Floyd protests, a group of investors worth $620 billion wrote letters to major sponsors Nike, FedEx, and PepsiCo encouraging pressure on the Redskins to change their name, which was considered a racial slur. Following this, on July 2, 2020, FedEx called on the team to change its name, and the same day, Nike removed Redskins apparel from its website. On July 3, the league and the franchise announced that it was "undergoing a thorough review of the team name." On July 13, 2020, the team announced that their review would result in the retirement of the Redskins name and logo, and on July 23, 2020, the team announced that they would be called the Washington Football Team with a block "W" logo for the 2020 season. In July 2021, the team's president Jason Wright announced that the new name would not include any ties to Native Americans, including the name "Warriors," as research had shown that anything other than a clean break with the past was a slippery slope. On February 2, 2022, it was announced that the new name for the team would be the Washington Commanders, starting from the 2022 NFL season. However, Native American activist Amanda Blackhorse has criticized the team's owner for making no substantial effort to repair the effects of decades of insults, nor advocating that other teams with offensive mascots also change. For the 2021 season, while the team expected fans to continue to wear their jerseys with the former name and logo, Native American-inspired headdresses or face paint were not allowed in the stadium. There have been a number of incidents of rival high school teams displaying banners or signs referencing the Trail of Tears, which have been criticized for both insensitivity and ignorance of history.
After centuries of whaling, Iceland has announced it will end commercial whaling by 2024 due to the decreasing price of whale meat. Iceland is one of the few countries that still maintains a whaling fleet and formally objects to the International Whaling Commission's 1986 moratorium on whaling. One company focused on hunting fin whales for export to Japan, while the other previously hunted minke whales for domestic consumption until 2020. However, the industry has been temporarily paused since 2019 due to the coronavirus pandemic, competition from subsidized Japanese whaling, and increasing domestic whale watching tourism. It remains to be seen if commercial whaling will resume in Iceland before the practice is finally ended in 2024.
On December 24th, 2021, a clash occurred between Taliban forces and the Frontier Corps at several points along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

In Kyiv, on February 5, 2021, thousands of people took to the streets to protest against Russian military aggression, chanting "Glory to Ukraine" and "Ukrainians will resist". This came amidst fears of a Russian invasion, with participants stating that the Ukrainian army and citizens would make it difficult for Russian forces and that they were angry at the prospect of another invasion rather than panicked. The previous year, in February 2020, from two to five thousand people in Kharkiv marched with banners stating "Kharkiv is Ukraine" and "stop Russian aggression", with interviewees stating that Kharkiv residents knew how to survive after years of living under the threat of invasion. These protests show the ongoing tension and concern about the possibility of a Russian invasion into Ukraine. <Civil society - Russian intellectuals>
In Kyiv, thousands of people took to the streets to protest against Russian military aggression, chanting "Glory to Ukraine" and "Ukrainians will resist". The protest comes after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in January 2022 that Canada would provide Ukraine with a CDN$120 million loan, but would not transfer military equipment.

The situation in Ukraine continues to escalate, as on 10 February, six Russian warships capable of landing troops ashore arrived at the Sevastopol Naval Base in Crimea, and Russia announced naval exercises to be held in the Black Sea. In response, Ukraine protested against the decision of the Russian Federation to block parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait under the pretext of holding regular naval exercises. On 26 February, the United States ordered the evacuation of its embassy staff in Kyiv due to concerns of a possible Russian invasion. This move came as President Biden warned Russia that any aggression against Ukraine would be met with a strong response. The situation remains tense, and international leaders are closely monitoring developments in the region. <Background>
The situation in Ukraine continues to escalate as the United States orders the evacuation of its embassy staff in Kyiv amid concerns of an imminent Russian invasion. On February 11, 2022, US intelligence made an assessment that the invasion could be imminent, and predicted that it might begin before the end of the 2022 Winter Olympics on February 20. As a result, the US also ordered the evacuation of most of its diplomatic staff and all military instructors in Ukraine. Furthermore, the US, UK, Japan, and many EU countries urged their citizens to leave Ukraine immediately. The tension in the region has led to a reduction in airline exposure to the country, with Dutch KLM suspending its flights to Ukraine. The incident is suspected to be the work of Russian hackers. The situation remains tense, and further developments are expected in the coming days.

In response to the 2021-2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis, Canada has announced the temporary suspension of its military operation in Ukraine, with most of its units being relocated to Poland. The Canadian Armed Forces made this announcement on February 13, 2022. Additionally, Canada has withdrawn its military advisors from Ukraine and has relocated them to an undisclosed location in Europe.

The Canadian government has invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time since the law was passed in 1988 to deal with ongoing blockades associated with the protests. In the previous version, Mayor Watson's office had announced on February 13 that an agreement was reached with the protesters to limit the protest perimeter to "Wellington Street, between Elgin Street and the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway" to "reduce pressure on residents and businesses". However, the situation escalated, leading to the invocation of the Emergencies Act. This act grants the federal government temporary powers to respond to the situation and ensures that the protests do not significantly impact public safety and essential services. <Timeline of protests - Ottawa>
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has invoked the Emergencies Act to address ongoing blockades associated with anti-COVID-19 restriction protests. The law was last used in 1970 by his father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, to quell the October Crisis. On February 14, Trudeau met with his Liberal caucus to discuss the measure. The protesters, numbering around 100, had set up blockades at the Alberta-Montana border crossing, demanding an end to all COVID-19 restrictions. The blockade, which extended about 2 km (1.2 mi) into Canada, also blocked public and emergency vehicle access to the village of Coutts, drawing condemnation from the town's mayor. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney called the blockade illegal, and warned protesters that they would face penalties under the province's Critical Infrastructure Defence Act. The government's use of the Emergencies Act grants federal authorities temporary powers to deal with the protests.
The ongoing blockades associated with the protests have led the government of Canada to invoke the Emergencies Act for the first time since the law was passed in 1988. This act grants the federal government temporary powers to deal with the situation. Previously, Mayor Watson had sent a letter to Tamara Lich and Keith Wilson to negotiate terms with protesters, and on February 13, the Mayor's office announced an agreement had been reached with protesters limiting the protest perimeter to "Wellington Street, between Elgin Street and the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway" to "reduce pressure on residents and businesses". However, the situation has escalated to the point where the Emergencies Act was invoked, giving the federal government the authority to deal with the blockades. <Timeline of protests - Ottawa>
In a recent development, the European Court of Justice has dismissed the challenges raised by Poland and Hungary against the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation and confirmed its compliance with the treaties of the European Union. This regulation enables the European Commission to withhold funds from the EU budget to member states that violate the rule of law, which could affect the management of EU funds. The decision paves the way for the Commission to suspend funds from the EU budget for member states that do not comply with the regulation. Earlier, on 10 June 2021, the European Parliament had adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to fulfil its obligations under the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation within two weeks, followed by the Commission's rejection of the ultimatum on 23 August 2021 with a five-page letter.
In an update on the legal proceedings regarding the regulation on the rule of law conditionality mechanism, the European Court of Justice has dismissed Poland and Hungary's challenges against the regulation. The court confirmed that the regulation is in compliance with the treaties of the European Union. This will enable the European Commission to suspend funds from the EU budget to member states that have rule of law issues that may affect the management of EU funds. The legal proceedings were launched by Hungary and Poland separately on 11 March 2021 with the Court of Justice of the European Union against the European Parliament and the Council for adopting the regulation, asking the court to annul the regulation as, according to Hungary and Poland, the regulation does not have an appropriate legal basis. On 2 December 2021, the advocate general advised the Court to dismiss those challenges. This latest ruling from the European Court of Justice is seen as a victory for the European Union in its efforts to ensure the rule of law is upheld in all member states.
On 1 March 2023, the European Court of Justice dismissed the challenges made by Poland and Hungary against the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation and confirmed that the regulation is compliant with the treaties of the European Union. This decision will enable the European Commission to withhold funds from the EU budget to member states that have rule of law issues that may impact the management of EU funds. The regulation has been a controversial topic, with Poland and Hungary opposing it, and its implementation has faced several delays. The European Parliament had adopted a resolution in June 2021, calling on the Commission to fulfill its obligations under the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation within two weeks and notifying the Commission that it would start preparations for legal action against it for failing to act. With the dismissal of the challenges, the regulation is expected to be implemented soon.
Australia has updated its list of designated terrorist organizations, designating Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham, and the Guardians of Religion Organization, as well as the entirety of Hamas, including its political wing, as terrorist organizations.

Tensions continue to rise between Ukraine and Russia as the Ukrainian government accuses Russian separatists of shelling a kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska, Luhansk Oblast, injuring three civilians. The Luhansk People's Republic denies involvement and instead alleges that its forces were attacked by the Ukrainian military with mortars, grenade launchers, and machine gun fire. The incident caused power outages and damaged multiple structures, with at least 32 shells hitting the city. This comes amidst the ongoing military buildup by Russia and Ukraine's invocation of Chapter III of the Vienna Document, requesting detailed explanations on military activities in the areas adjacent to the territory of Ukraine and in the temporarily occupied Crimea. The United States and NATO have both expressed concerns over Russia's actions, with officials warning of the possibility of a false flag operation and the threat of invasion of Ukraine remaining very high.
On 17 February 2022, the Ukrainian government accused Russian separatists of shelling a kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska, Luhansk Oblast using artillery, injuring three civilians. The Luhansk People's Republic, however, denies the allegations and instead claims that its forces were attacked by the Ukrainian military with mortars, grenade launchers, and machine gun fire.

The situation in Ukraine remains tense as renewed violence and escalation continue between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Recently, the Ukrainian government has accused Russian separatists of shelling a kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska, Luhansk Oblast using artillery, which injured three civilians. The Luhansk People's Republic has claimed that their forces were attacked by the Ukrainian military with mortars, grenade launchers and machine gun fire. The exchange of fire caused power outages and significant damage to multiple structures. These events have further heightened tensions in the region as Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces continue to train citizens in urban guerrilla tactics and firearms use, preparing for a possible Russian invasion. The United States has already provided lethal weapons to Ukraine in anticipation of this threat.
Amending the previous article, in early November 2021, CIA director William Burns met with senior Russian intelligence officials in Moscow to convey President Biden's concerns about the situation on the Russo-Ukrainian border. This followed the Ukrainian government accusing Russian separatists of shelling a kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska, Luhansk Oblast using artillery, injuring three civilians. The Luhansk People's Republic says that its forces were attacked by the Ukrainian military with mortars, grenade launchers and machine gun fire. At least 32 shells hit the city, causing power outages and damaging multiple structures. It was reported by CNN that Burns spoke by phone with Zelensky following the meeting at Moscow in a bid to ease Russian and Ukrainian tensions. Simultaneously, a high-ranking US Department of State official was dispatched to Ukraine. At the same time, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby confirmed that the United States continues to observe "unusual military activity" by Russia near the Russo-Ukrainian border. <Renewed tensions (October 2021–present) - Second Russian military buildup>
In October and November of 2021, tensions between Ukraine and Russia renewed when Ukraine detected a Russian military buildup on its borders. Ukrainian intelligence initially assessed the buildup as "an element of psychological pressure," but later acknowledged that Russia was building up "specific groups of troops" near the border. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged France and Germany to prepare for a possible military scenario, and President Zelensky discussed the situation with the head of the European Council Charles Michel. On November 15, Kuleba held talks on the same issues in Brussels. The Russian military buildup continued into 2022, and in February, Ukraine accused Russian separatists of shelling a kindergarten in Luhansk Oblast, injuring three civilians. The Luhansk People's Republic, however, said that Ukrainian forces had attacked their troops with mortars, grenade launchers, and machine gun fire, causing significant damage to the city.
