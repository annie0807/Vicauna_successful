On August 2, Cairns and Yarrabah were placed under a three-day lockdown after a taxi driver from Kanimbla tested positive for the virus. The driver was infectious for ten days and had transported passengers in Far North Queensland, leading to concerns of potential community transmission. Queensland's Chief Health Officer has urged anyone with symptoms or who has been to a Queensland Health exposure site to get tested immediately. Despite this, Queensland has managed to maintain a low fatality rate throughout the pandemic, with only seven recorded deaths as of the end of July 2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Palau initially involved the implementation of strict border controls and quarantine measures, with the first case only being reported in May 2021. However, the country's vaccination efforts have yielded impressive results, with an estimated 96% of adults being fully vaccinated by May 26, and the 80% vaccination rate among the population aged 12 and above achieving herd immunity. As a result, tourism has reopened in the country, and plans are underway to vaccinate adolescents from 12 to 17. Palau's success in containing the virus can be attributed to its early and effective response, as well as its ongoing vaccination campaign."

In modern times, relations were strengthened during the Nasser era, but became strained after the reorientation of Egypt toward the West under Anwar Sadat. However, they improved significantly after the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office in 2013, with both countries working to strengthen military and trade ties. The resumption of direct commercial flights between Russia and Egypt for the first time since the 2015 Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing that killed mostly Russian tourists marks a significant milestone. In recent years, both countries have signed various agreements, including the construction of Egypt's first nuclear reactor and the establishment of a ""Russian Industrial Zone"" along the Suez Canal. Furthermore, Egypt has reportedly dispatched troops to assist the Syrian government, while Russia's Wagner Group is supporting the House of Representatives in the ongoing Libyan Civil War."

The Panjshir conflict began as a political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban following the Fall of Kabul in 2021. As of August 2021, the Panjshir Valley, largely contiguous with Panjshir Province, is the only region out of the Taliban's control. Panjshiris had been moving military equipment, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province and were joined by commanders of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. On August 17, 2021, Amrullah Saleh declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Mohammadi.

The Panjshir Valley, largely contiguous with Panjshir Province, is currently the only region out of the Taliban's control. The Panjshir resistance, consisting of anti-Taliban forces who have regrouped in the valley, has approximately 9,000 fighters and several armoured humvees at its disposal, according to Massoud. The population of the Panjshir valley consists mainly of ethnic Tajik people, and the valley is well known for its natural defences. Amid attempts to negotiate an end to the political impasse, Massoud has insisted that the Panjshir Valley will not be surrendered to the Taliban and that war is ""unavoidable"" if the Taliban refuse dialogue on the formation of a comprehensive government.

The attack occurred during a chaotic evacuation of Afghanistan after the Taliban assumed control of the country in mid-August, and concerns about security at the airport were high due to reports of increased activity by ISIL-KP. On August 27, the United States launched an airstrike against an ISIL-KP member in Nangarhar Province, killing two members and wounding a third, including a planner in Kabul. The Taliban and ISIL-KP, although both jihadist groups, have fought each other. The Taliban condemned the attack and vowed to take measures to capture ISIL-KP leader Shahab al-Muhajir.

Whaling in Iceland, which began as spear-drift hunting in the 12th century, has been largely in decline since the late 19th century due to other countries introducing modern commercial practices. Today, Iceland is one of the few countries still officially objecting to the moratorium established by the International Whaling Commission in 1986 and maintaining a whaling fleet. However, the only company that previously hunted minke whales for domestic consumption has announced the end of the practice in 2020, as the meat was no longer popular with tourists. One company still hunts fin whales, mainly for export to Japan. In 2018, Icelandic whalers faced accusations of slaughtering a blue whale. The whaling industry in Iceland has been on hold since 2019, amid coronavirus restrictions, increased competition from subsidized Japanese whaling, and rising domestic whale watching tourism that have undermined the industry. In the latest development, Iceland has announced plans to permanently end whaling by 2024, citing the declining price of whale meat as the reason behind the decision. The country's whale watching sector exists in tension with the whaling industry."

Recently, four civilians were killed during a battle between French troops and Ansar ul Islam, a jihadist group particularly active at the border territories of Mali and Burkina Faso. The clash resulted in the death of ten militants and involved support from an attack helicopter. Amidst the ongoing conflict, a humanitarian crisis has emerged with thousands of people killed and displaced by both sides, with government forces also being accused of summarily executing countless of civilians, disproportionately targeting ethnic Fulani.

The move marks a departure from Canada's long-standing involvement in Operation Unifier, which was initiated in 2015 to support Ukraine's efforts in maintaining security, democracy, and economic stability in the face of Russian-backed separatist movements. Canada's decision reflects the growing tensions between Ukraine and Russia, with NATO countries increasingly concerned about the potential for a full-scale conflict. The withdrawal of Canadian troops from Ukraine is likely to have a significant impact on the country's military capabilities and may hamper its ability to resist Russian aggression."

The regulation enables the European Commission to suspend funds from the EU budget to member states that violate the rule of law principles in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Following this decision, the Commission is now able to take measures against member states with rule of law issues that are likely to affect the management of EU funds. The European Parliament has previously urged the Commission to avoid delaying implementation and provide more information on investigations into breaches of rule of law principles."

Australia's fight against terrorism continues as the Australian government designates new organisations as terrorist organisations. The recent additions to the list of designated terrorist organisations include the entirety of Hamas, including its political wing, Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham and the Guardians of Religion Organization. The Australian Parliament passed the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, which allows the government to deal with organisations involved in terrorism and insert a range of terrorist organisation offences into the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). Financial transactions involving listed terrorist organisations are monitored by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). The list of designated terror organisations, maintained by the Attorney-General's Department, is updated regularly, and listing, de-listing, and re-listing follows a protocol primarily involving the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Attorney-General's Department. The responsibility of prosecuting offences sanctions persons and entities under Australian and international law, including new listings such as Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham, Guardians of Religion Organization, and the entirety of Hamas as a terrorist organisation."
