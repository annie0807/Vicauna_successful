The 2021 Taliban offensive is an ongoing military offensive by the Taliban and allied militant groups, including al-Qaeda, against the government of Afghanistan and its allies that began on 1 May 2021, simultaneous with the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As of 15 July, over a third of Afghanistan's 421 districts were controlled by the Taliban, and by 21 July, half of Afghanistan was under Taliban control. <Summary> \c\cDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. <Background> \c\cIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam. During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. <Timeline - May> \c\cBy the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. <Timeline - May> \c\cIn June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway of Afghanistan's capital city Kabul. In terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. <Timeline - June> \c\cAn Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month. On 16 June, Taliban militants executed 22 surrendering Afghan Army commandoes in the town of Dawlat Abad. During the month, 703 Afghan National Security Forces and 208 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,535 Taliban fighters. On 19 June, Afghan National Army chief of staff, defense and interior ministers were replaced by President Ashraf Ghani. By the end of June, all Resolute Support Mission's member countries had withdrawn their troops, except for the Britain, Turkey, and the U.S.[citation needed] <Timeline - June> \c\cOn 22 June, the Taliban captured Shir Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's main Tajikistan border crossing. 13 districts fell to the Taliban within 24 hours. On the same day, heavy fighting was also occurring in Baghlan Province after Afghan forces launched a military operation on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial capital, killing 17 Taliban militants including Qari Khalid, a Taliban divisional commander. Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri. <Timeline - June> \c\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban "were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S.", and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD's Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani's statements "read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation". <Timeline - June> \c\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban. ToloNews reported that 108 districts fell to the Taliban in the last two months and the Afghan army had only managed to re-take 10. On 29 June, the Taliban launched an offensive on Ghazni, causing violent clashes within the city. <Timeline - June> \c\cIn July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second and third largest cities of Afghanistan, Kandahar and Herat respectively. During the month, 335 Afghan National Security Forces and 189 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 3,159 Taliban fighters. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its CSTO envoy. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered into Iran to escape the Taliban. <Timeline - July> \c\cOn 2 July, Germany and Italy withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, and U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces. <Timeline - July> \c\cOn the first weekend of July, hundreds of armed women took to the streets of northern and central Afghanistan in demonstrations against the Taliban offensive, the largest one taking place in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor Province. The provincial governor Abdulzahir Faizzada reported in an interview with The Guardian that many Afghan women, some of whom recently escaped the Taliban, have been learning to use firearms in order to defend themselves, with some already having battled the Taliban themselves. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid denounced the reports as "propaganda" and declared that "women will never pick up guns against us." During the weekend, the Taliban captured nine border posts belonging to the Afghan Army in Kunar Province near the border with Pakistan, during which 39 personnel of the Afghan Army surrendered to the Taliban while another 31 fled to Pakistan. <Timeline - July> \c\cOn 5 July, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon announced the deployment of 20,000 troops on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan war into Tajikistan. On 9 July, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) announced that the Russian Federation would deploy 7,000 troops on the border as well to aid Tajikistan. On 7 July, pro-government forces defeated a Taliban attempt to capture the city of Qala e Naw. On 8 July, the Taliban captured the strategically important Karakh District in Herat Province. <Timeline - July> \c\cOn 10 July, the Taliban captured Panjwayi District in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also surrounded the city of Ghazni in central Afghanistan. The border crossings of Torghundi with Tajikistan and Islam Qala with Iran were captured by the Taliban. During the capture of the Islam Qala border crossing, some Afghan security and customs officials fled across the border with Iran to escape the Taliban. <Timeline - July> \c\cOn 11 July, Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton announced the end of its military presence in Afghanistan, with the last 80 personnel having left the country in the past weeks. On 12 July, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Austin S. Miller stepped down from his post. As of 12 July, the Taliban has seized 148 districts from the Afghan government. On 14 July, the Afghan border post at Spin Boldak was captured by the Taliban force. <Timeline - July> \c\cOn 12 July, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered the deployment of troops and heavy weapons and armour on the Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border, in order to avoid a spillover of the Afghan conflict into Turkmenistan. On 16 July, Uzbekistan hosted a conference between a number of the region's leaders and foreign diplomats, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in order to promote peace and prevent a civil war. <Timeline - July> \c\cOn 16 July, Reuters Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed while covering the fighting in Spin Boldak. <Timeline - July> \c\cOn 21 July, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reported that half of all Afghan districts were under Taliban control and that momentum was "sort of" on the side with the Taliban. On 22 July, the Pentagon confirmed that the United States Air Force had carried out four airstrikes in Afghanistan at the request of Afghan officials. Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Talibans from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar's air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD's Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District. <Timeline - July> \c\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to "curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban". <Timeline - July> \c\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban. Lyons implored both sides to protect civilians as she says that women and children are being killed. The same day around 46 Afghan troops, including 5 officers, sought refuge in Pakistan after they were unable to defend their military post. <Timeline - July> \c\cOn 28 July, a delegation from the Taliban met in Tianjin with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who pledged the People's Republic of China's support for the Taliban on the condition that they cut ties with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, vowing the "bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream" and offering to host peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. <Timeline - July> \c\cBy 31 July 2021, the Taliban had entered the provincial capitals of both Helmand and Herat provinces, capturing scores of districts in said provinces and capturing border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan. Among others, Herat's important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government's ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested. <Timeline - July> \c\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions. On 3 August, 40 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in the fighting. After capturing Lashkar Gah's radio station, the Taliban began broadcasting their Voice of Sharia programming. The rebels also began to attack the city's airport. Meanwhile, the government dispatched reinforcements to prevent the city from falling to the insurgents. <Timeline - August> \c\cOn 3 August, 13 people - including five attackers - were killed in a Taliban bombing and shootout in Kabul. The inghimasi-style operation, carried out by the Taliban's "Martyrdom Battalion", aimed at killing Defence Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi; he survived the attack. Mohammadi was described by the Long War Journal as one of the key government figures responsible for countering the Taliban offensive. <Timeline - August> \c\cAs of 5 August, 115 Afghan National Security Forces and 58 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 1,661 Taliban fighters since the start of the month. <Timeline - August> \c\cOn 6 August 2021, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul. On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital. <Timeline - August> \c\cAfghanistan: The Afghan government has vowed to retake all districts seized by the Taliban. Afghan politician and former mujahideen Ismail Khan declared the formation of People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in Herat Province. On 2 August 2021, President Ghani blamed the advance of the Taliban on the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops and said the former had not cut ties with terrorist organizations and had escalated attacks against women, which the Taliban denied. <Reactions - Domestic> \c\cTaliban: On 9 July, Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar said in Moscow that the group "was in control of 85% of the territory of Afghanistan", and pointed  out that it "was not part of the agreement" with the U.S. not to attack Afghan administrative centers. <Reactions - Domestic> \c\cChina: Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi has criticized the withdrawal of American-led NATO forces and has urged them to withdraw in a "responsible and orderly manner". <Reactions - International> \c\cIndia: Foreign Affairs Minister S.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). <Summary> \c\cOn 29 January 2020, Queensland was the first to declare a public health emergency. The legislation was strengthened on 6 February by the Public Health (Declared Public Health Emergencies) Amendment Bill 2020. In March, power was given directly to the Chief Health Officer (rather than the Health Minister on behalf of the Cabinet) to make \'Directions\', amongst other things allowing her to declare restrictions on movement, gatherings and business activities, to set social distancing or masking requirements, and to close borders.  As of the end of July 2021, Queensland had recorded the death of just 7 patients with Covid-19.  This fatality rate, of just under 1 per million residents, was the lowest not just in Australia, but of any sizeable jurisdiction with its own policing and health powers, in the world. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cKey directions made under the Public Health Act 2005 include: <Timeline - 2020> \c\c2 April – A person must not leave their principal place of residence except for essential needs including work, food, medical and exercise, outdoor gatherings only up to 2 persons or with members of household, receiving only to 2 visitors at a residence, and no gatherings in non-residences. <Timeline - 2020> \c\c9 April – "Non-essential" business, activity or undertaking must not be operated. "Non-essential" businesses include cinemas, casinos, concerts, indoor sports, gyms, playgrounds, campgrounds, libraries. Restrictions also apply to restaurants (take away or delivery only), churches, hairdressers etc. However, most construction, mining, manufacturing and retail businesses continued to operate. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cRestricted entry into Queensland was introduced, with only Queensland residents and those considered an \'exempt person\' being allowed to enter Queensland by air, sea, rail or road from another state or territory. This was introduced in stages: Stage 1 started on 26 March 2020, with stages 2 and 3 involving tightening the restrictions. Stage 4, introduced on 11 April, was the most restrictive, every person crossing the border including Queensland residents required a permit. In addition, a person who had been in a declared COVID-19 hotspot in the previous 14 days had to self-quarantine for 14 days. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cClosures of areas within Queensland included: <Timeline - 2020> \c\cAll camping areas within Queensland national parks, state forests and recreation areas were closed on 26 March.[citation needed] <Timeline - 2020> \c\cClosure of high visitation National Parks including Fraser Island as well as all day use areas and visitor centres on 9 April. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cClosure of Queensland waters to cruise ships on 6 April. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cClosure of Surfers Paradise, Coolangatta and The Spit beaches on 8 April. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cAccess to the Torres Strait Islands has been restricted to prevent COVID-19 from reaching the region, which has to date remained free of cases. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 1 February 2021, Queensland opened its border to all Australian states and territories except Western Australia. Since the border closures were implemented, 6,855,750 border passes were issued. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cOn 22 February, the first Queenslander received a COVID-19 vaccination at Gold Coast University Hospital. She was a nurse who works in that hospital's COVID-19 ward. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cOn 28 February 2021,  the "Check in Qld" QR code sign-in/contact tracing app was launched by the Minister for Health and Ambulance Services, Yvette D\'Ath.  It is based on the ACT "Check in CBR" app. Use of the app is not mandatory. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cOn 12 March, Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane went into lockdown after a doctor tested positive for COVID-19. This was the beginning of one cluster in Brisbane connected to that hospital. Queensland had gone 59 days without any locally acquired COVID-19 infections. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cDue to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, from 1am on 24 June, the Queensland government declared all of Greater Sydney was a hotspot. Border entry will be refused to anyone who lives in, or has visited: Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Wollongong or Shellharbour. Residents returning will be quarantined for 14 days. Everyone entering Queensland will have to complete a border declaration. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cOn 8 January 2021, a three-day lockdown was announced by Annastacia Palaszczuk to prevent spread of the more contagious UK strain of coronavirus that escaped from a Brisbane hotel quarantine.

By 30 March another 8 locally acquired cases were reported, for a total of 10 new cases in the preceding 24 hours, and 2 separate clusters, both UK strain were identified. As of this date Queensland had 78 active cases in hospitals. On 31 March in Queensland 34,711 coronavirus tests and 7,596 vaccinations were conducted. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns> \c\cOn 1 April, the "three-day" lockdown was lifted five hours early at midday. Though 10 new cases had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, there was only one case of community transmission, which was linked to the second cluster surrounding the infected nurse from the Princess Alexandra Hospital. This cluster now numbered 12, up from 7 on 29 March. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns> \c\cSome restrictions introduced for the lockdown were maintained temporarily: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns> \c\call Queenslanders had to carry a face-mask outside their home until 15 April, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns> \c\cpatrons at food or beverage venues had to stay seated, no dancing allowed, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns> \c\c30 person limit at private gatherings at homes statewide, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns> \c\cbusinesses and churches could open, but have only one-person-per 2-square-metres of floor area, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns> \c\cvisitors were not permitted for 2 weeks at: aged or disabled care facilities, hospitals and prisons. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns> \c\cOn 28 June Queensland recorded 3 new COVID-19 cases overnight. 2 were locally acquired, one acquired overseas.

Diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Egypt were established on August 26, 1943. Egypt has an embassy in Moscow, while Russia has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate-general in Alexandria. <Summary> \c\cRelations between Russia and Egypt have a long history, dating back to before the 16th century.  Early on, they were centered on the Russian government's and the Russian Church's support for the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria.  As early as in 1556, Patriarch Joachim of Alexandria sent a letter to the Russian Tzar Ivan IV,  asking the Orthodox monarch to provide some material assistance for the Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, which had suffered from the Turks. In 1558, the Czar sent to Egypt a delegation led by archdeacon Gennady, who, however, died in Constantinople before he could reach Egypt. From then on, the embassy was headed by a Smolensk merchant, Vasily Poznyakov. Poznyakov's delegation visited Alexandria, Cairo, and Sinai, brought the patriarch a fur coat and an icon sent by the Tzar. Poznyakov's  account of its two and half years\' travels, which may have  been the first ever Russian first-hand African trip report,  became popular among Russian readers for centuries to follow. <History> \c\cRussia continued to provide support to Egyptian Christians for centuries to come. <History> \c\cIn the 1950s, Gamal Abdel Nasser's independent and anti-imperialist policy earned him enthusiastic support from the Communist government of the USSR. In 1955, Egypt  made a major arms deal with Soviet Union, and from then, teams of Egyptian officers were trained in Eastern Bloc countries. Czechoslovak instructors also came in 1956, to train Egyptian personnel in the use of Soviet weapons. When France attacked Egypt during Suez Crisis, USSR threatened to use destructive weapons i.e. nuclear weapons for the defense of Egypt.  The degree of the Soviet approval of the Egyptian leader's policies culminated, rather controversially, in the award of the highest Soviet decoration, the star of the Hero of the Soviet Union with the Order of Lenin  to Nasser during Nikita Khrushchev's visit to the country in 1964. <History> \c\cDuring the Nasser years, many young Egyptians studied in Soviet universities and military schools. Among them was the future president, Hosni Mubarak, who went for training in a military pilot school in Kyrgyzstan. During the War of Attrition, USSR sent 10-15000 servicemen to operate the air defense of Egypt against Israeli air attacks. <History> \c\cThe relationship went sour within years after the death of Nasser, when the new president, Anwar Sadat, started re-orienting the country toward the West. On May 27, 1971, a friendship treaty was signed between the two countries, but relations were nevertheless declining. In July 1972, it was claimed the Egyptian government expelled Soviet military advisors from Egypt, (however new research indicates that this was disinformation to hide Egypt's offensive plans), and captured Egyptian documents demonstrate that Soviet advisors continued in their previous roles of training Egyptian troops, and were certainly present during the war in 1973. During the Yom Kippur War , Soviet Union sent several thousands of tonnes of aid to Egypt. Brezhnev threatened to intervene on behalf of Egypt if Israel broke the ceasefire. Lieutenant General Anatoly Pushkin claimed that 1500 Soviet pilots and air defense experts engaged in combat for Egypt during the war. In March 1976 Egypt abrogated the friendship treaty, and relations between the two countries were damaged once again when Egypt supported the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan when the USSR invaded in 1979. In September 1981, these relations were severed by the Egyptian government, accusing Soviet leadership of trying to undermine Sadat's leadership in retaliation to the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. Relations were reestablished under president Hosni Mubarak in 1984, and Alexander Belonogov became the Ambassador. In February 1989, Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Shevardnadze visited Egypt. <History> \c\cIntergovernmental relations improved after the fall of Communism in the USSR, and Russia's appearance as an independent political actor. <History> \c\cIn April 2005, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, visited Egypt, and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak visited Russia in April 2008. Both countries agreed to work together to help Egypt create a nuclear program which is mostly for civilian purposes. In May 2013, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi visited Russia. <History> \c\cRelations between the two countries improved even further following the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office in July 2013. Both countries have since then worked closely to strengthen military and trade ties, among other aspects of bilateral cooperation. From 2009 to 2018, Russia accounted for 31% of Egypt's imports of major weapons. <History - After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cIn November 2013, Egypt's then Defense Minister Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy met with their Russian counterparts, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov who were on a visit to Cairo. Fahmy stated that Egypt wished to return to Soviet-level relations with Russia, and Shoigu hinted that there may be military cooperation between the Russian and Egyptian navies and air forces.[citation needed] It was the first meeting of its kind since the Soviet era. <History - After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cSince then, Egyptian and Russian leaders have exchanged two rounds of four-way visits in both Cairo and Moscow. Sisi went to Russia twice in 2014: in February, when he was still Egypt's defense minister, and in August after his election as president. The February meeting was Sisi's first visit abroad following Mohamed Morsi's removal, during which Russian president Vladimir Putin offered him Russia's backing in his race for the presidency of Egypt before Sisi even officially announced his campaign. <History - After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cSisi made his second visit on August 12 at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, and it was his first to a non-Arab or African country since his inauguration as President two months earlier. During the visit, both him and Putin agreed on boosting bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Putin promised to speed up arms sales to Egypt. "We are actively developing our military and technological cooperation," Putin told Sisi. He added that a corresponding protocol was signed in March and that weapons are being delivered to Egypt. <History - After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cTrade and economic investment plans were also announced during the meeting, during which Putin said that Egypt was discussing a free trade zone with the Russian-led Eurasian Customs Union which also includes Belarus and Kazakhstan.[citation needed] Additionally, both leaders have discussed plans to establish a Russian industrial zone in the New Suez Canal project that was recently inaugurated by Sisi, as well as another plan to renew and redevelop important projects that were established by the former Soviet Union. <History - After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cIn September 2014, a preliminary deal was reached between both countries to buy arms worth $3.5 billion from Russia, despite Western sanctions on Moscow as a result of its involvement in the war in Donbass. <History - After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cAs a result of the Metrojet Flight 9268 crash on October 31, 2015, which carried 224 passengers on board toward Russia, both countries were planning investigating the crash. <History - After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cOn November 28, 2015, Egypt and Russia signed a deal which would allow Russian and Egyptian warplanes to use each other's airbases and airspace. Both countries could be described as "close allies" as Putin usually referred to Sisi as a "Trusted and Close Partner." On 11 December 2017, during President Vladimir Putin's visit to Cairo, the two countries signed agreements in which Russia would build Egypt's first nuclear reactor, and supply nuclear fuel for the same. It was also agreed that a "Russian Industrial Zone" would be built along the Suez Canal, explained by Putin as being "the biggest regional center for producing Russian products onto the markets of the Middle-East and North Africa." <History - After the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office> \c\cRussia supports Syrian government in the Syrian civil war, and intervened militarily in its favor in 2015. Egypt also supports the Syrian government in the Civil War. In 2020, Egypt has reportedly dispatched 150 troops to help Syrian government. Egypt is openly backing House of Representatives in the ongoing Libyan Civil War, while the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group is assisting the House of Representatives\' forces. <History - International collaborations> \c\cIn summer 2020, Egypt received five Su-35 jets, despite the American threatening with sanctions. However, the Russian journalist, Ivan Safronov, who revealed the transaction was detained for disclosing a state secret. <History - Arms deal> \c\cRussians constitute the largest group of outsiders to visit Egypt, while Russia is popular with Egyptian tourists as well.[citation needed] As of 2015[update] Egypt is the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroad—a basic vacation package including flight, hotel and meals can be purchased for as little as US$1,000. <Tourism> \c\cIn August 2021, direct commercial flights between Russia and Egypt resumed for the first time since the Metrojet Flight 9268 bombing in 2015, which killed 224 people, most of whom were Russian tourists. A Rossiya Airlines passenger plane landed in Sharm El Sheikh carrying 518 passengers, and was welcomed with a water cannon salute, roses and flags. <Tourism> \c\cIn 2006, the Egyptian Russian University was opened in Badr City, Cairo, offering training in pharmacy and engineering. <Higher education> \c\c
The 2021 Algeria wildfires are multiple wildfires happening in Algeria since 9 August 2021, and have killed 65 people (37 civilians and 28 soldiers). <Summary> \c\cOn 9 August 2021, many fires started up in the Kabyle region and elsewhere, and Algerian authorities sent soldiers to help citizens with the blazes and evacuations. <Summary> \c\cOn 10 August 2021, multiple fires have burned Mediterranean trees, destroying olive trees and killing cattle and chickens. <Summary> \c\cMany distant villages have very limited water. Some villagers fled, while others tried to hold back the flames themselves, using buckets, branches and rudimentary tools. <Summary> \c\cThe firefighting aircraft were not available. <Summary> \c\c
The Lebanese liquidity crisis is an ongoing financial crisis affecting the nation of Lebanon, starting in August 2019, which was further exacerbated by both the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon (which began in 2020) and the 2020 Beirut port explosion. <Summary> \c\cSince 1997, the Lebanese pound has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1,507.5 LBP per USD. In August 2019, due to various financial hardships, especially the growing probability that the Lebanese government will default on maturing debt obligations, the black market exchange rate started diverging from the official exchange rate. <Background> \c\cIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the black market exchange rate reached 1,600 LBP per USD, and increased to 3,000 LBP per USD in April 2020, 14,000 LBP per USD in March 2021 and 15,200 LBP per USD in June 2021. The USD black market exchange rate continues to fluctuate substantially due to devaluation of the Lebanese pound caused by acute USD shortages within Lebanon. This dollar shortage also caused 785 restaurants and cafes to close between September 2019 and February 2020 and resulted in 25,000 employees losing their jobs. Consumer goods prices have increased by 580% since October resulting from the worst economic crisis in decades. This economic crisis made Lebanon's gross domestic product fall to about 44 billion USD from about 55 billion USD the year before. <Background> \c\cThe fall of the exchange rate caused the 2019–2021 Lebanese protests, which ultimately resulted in the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet. After the resignation occurred, the COVID-19 pandemic forced additional businesses to close their doors and to lay off their employees. <Consequences> \c\cPrime minister Hassan Diab stated that the country would default on its Eurobond debt and seek out restructuring agreements amid a spiraling financial crisis that has affected foreign currency reserves. Lebanon was due to pay a US$1.2 billion Eurobond on 9 March 2020, with another 700 million USD expected to mature in April and a further 600 million USD in June. Due to the lack of foreign currencies, the prime minister said that the reserves had fallen to "a worrying and dangerous level which pushes the Lebanese government to suspend payment of the 9 March Eurobond maturity because of a need for these funds." <Consequences> \c\cThe head of research at Bank Audi stated that Lebanese banks owned 12.7 billion USD of the country's outstanding 30 billion USD Eurobonds as of January 2020. The central bank held 5.7 billion USD and the remainder was owned by foreign creditors. <Consequences> \c\cThe debt to GDP ratio sits at 170% as of April 2020. The default is the first one in the history of the country. Foreign currency inflows have slowed and Lebanon's pound has dropped in value compared to the dollar and other currencies. The nation's commercial banks have imposed tough restrictions on dollar withdrawals and transfers to maintain reserves. Due to this Lebanon's sovereign debt became junk rated. <Consequences> \c\cThe Lebanese pound was pegged at around 1,500 per US$1; since October 2019, it has dropped to a third of this value, reaching 4,500 per US$1 on black markets on 28 April 2020. Two weeks before that, the currency sat at around 3,000 to US$1. Official valuations are different from the ones on the black market. One bank allowed depositors to withdraw Lebanese pounds from their dollar account at 2,000 to US$1. This caused significant anger towards the banks. The prime minister has sharply criticized the governor of the central bank Riad Salameh over its performance. <Consequences> \c\cThe shortage of U.S. dollars, which are used in everyday transactions in Lebanon, and the crash in the value of the pound have undercut the country's ability to pay for imports, including essentials such as wheat and oil. Banks have stopped giving short-term loans to businesses and no longer provide them with U.S. dollars for imports, forcing people to turn to the black markets. There is also significant inflation, which caused a massive loss of purchasing power and an increase in poverty. The price of foule or ful, a fava bean common in the region, was up 550% in March 2020 over a year earlier. Sugar has seen an increase of 670%, while wheat, tea, rice, and cigarettes have all gone up nearly 1000% over the same period. <Consequences> \c\cThis liquidity crisis also created a barrier to every single person who had accounts in Lebanese banks; as they are unable to access their deposits. Not only are they unable to access their deposits, but they are unable to withdraw any USD directly. They can withdraw them in the national currency. These depositors needed to preserve the value of their savings, especially following press reports about restructuring of the banking sector. They therefore turned to buying real estate. For example, revenues from land sales of the major real estate developer, Solidere company, soared from nearly $1.3 million to $234.5 million. Also, these depositors turned to buying shares in Solidere company, which lead to a rise of 500% in it between the start of the liquidity crisis and April 2021. <Consequences> \c\cOn 1 June 2021, the World Bank released a report which warned that the economic crisis in Lebanon would risk becoming one of the three most severe since the mid-19th century, if its "bankrupt economic system, which benefited a few for so long" weren\'t reformed. <Consequences> \c\cOn 11 August 2021, the Central Bank of Lebanon ended fuel subsidies, announcing that they would instead offer "credit lines for fuel imports based on the market price for the Lebanese pound". The decision was likely to result in a significant increase in fuel prices amid an economic crisis in the country. <Consequences> \c\c
A federal election will take place on Sepetmber 20, 2021, to elect members of the House of Commons to the 44th Canadian Parliament. The latest possible date of the vote is determined by the fixed-date provisions of the Canada Elections Act, which requires federal elections to be held on the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year after the polling day of the previous election. Since the current government is a minority government, the election has been before the scheduled date if Parliament is dissolved by the Governor General of Canada due to a motion of no confidence in the government or at the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada for a snap election. A by-election in Haldimand-Norfolk was cancelled because of the election call. <Summary> \c\cThe 2019 federal election resulted in the Liberals, led by incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, losing their majority but winning the most seats. The Conservatives continued as the Official Opposition with Andrew Scheer temporarily remaining as Leader of the Opposition until announcing his resignation, triggering a leadership election. The Bloc Québécois became the third party. The New Democrats lost seats but maintained official party status and, although the Greens increased their seats in the House of Commons, they ultimately failed to achieve the required number of MPs—twelve—for official party status. <Background> \c\cAll leaders initially announced that they would continue as the heads of their respective parties into the next session of Parliament. However, Elizabeth May said that she may not lead the Greens into the 44th election, and she ultimately resigned as Green Party leader on November 4, 2019. On November 6, 2019, the Conservative caucus decided to not adopt a measure which would have given them the ability to remove Andrew Scheer as leader. His leadership would still have been reviewed during the party's April 2020 convention However, on December 12, Scheer announced his intention to resign as leader. He stayed on until his successor, Erin O\'Toole, was chosen and remains as the MP for Regina—Qu\'Appelle. <Background> \c\cOn August 15, 2021, Prime Minister Trudeau asked Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve parliament and call an election for September 20, 2021. <Background> \c\cThe following MPs have announced that they would not be running in the next federal election: <Background - Incumbents not running for reelection> \c\cTemplate:44th Canadian federal election <Current standings> \c\cOctober 21, 2019: In the 43rd Canadian federal election, the incumbent Liberal Party lost its majority but won the most seats in the House of Commons. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cOctober 23, 2019: The Liberals ruled out any "formal or informal" coalition government with any other party. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cOctober 29, 2019: Incumbent prime minister Justin Trudeau met with Governor General Julie Payette to officially confirm that he intended to form a government. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cOctober 30, 2019: Green Party leader Elizabeth May, MP for Saanich—Gulf Islands, announced her interest in running for Speaker of the House of Commons, a position that would necessitate stepping down from her position as party leader. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cNovember 3, 2019: The Liberals announced that Trudeau would meet with opposition leaders during the week of November 11 to see if any common ground existed. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cNovember 4, 2019: Elizabeth May resigned as leader of the Green Party effective immediately and ruled out a bid for Speaker.

The Panjshir conflict[citation needed] is a political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban which began following the Fall of Kabul (2021). As of August 2021, no military conflict had occurred in Panjshir Province and a negotiated end to the political impasse has been discussed. <Summary> \c\cThe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is a state that is the notional continuation of the regime that previously governed Afghanistan. It exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". <Background> \c\cPrior to the Fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by commanders of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. <History> \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Amrullah Saleh — citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan — declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Mohammadi. At around the same time, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Masoud. <History> \c\cAs of 17 August, the Panjshir Valley was — according to one observer — "under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. As of August 2021, no military conflict had occurred in Panjshir Province and a negotiated end to the political impasse has been discussed. <History> \c\cAccording to a Russian intelligence, Saleh's forces have captured Charikar region in Parwan Province from Taliban <History> \c\c
The 2021 Niger attacks are an ongoing series of attacks by militants on civilians and soldiers in Niger, mainly in the western region of Tillabéri. The attacks have left 439 people dead and more than 100 others injured. <Summary> \c\cSeveral major attacks occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020. However, this is the first time that over 100 civilians were killed in single incidents, marking the January attack and 21 March attack as the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. It is the first year in which attacks were carried out with frequency in the country. As of August, attacks were carried out every month of 2021. The previous biggest attack in Niger against civilians was the 12 December 2020 Toumour attack, which resulted in 28 people killed. Both the December 2020 and January 2021 attacks were carried out during Niger's municipal and regional elections, while the February bombing specifically targeted members of the electoral commission. <Background> \c\cOn the same day as the January attacks, two Algerian soldiers were killed in a shooting in Algeria and two French soldiers were killed in a bombing in Mali. <Background> \c\cThe January attacks occurred in two villages, Tchombangou (at 14°49′48′′N 01°48′45′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.83000°N 1.81250°E\ufeff / 14.83000; 1.81250) and Zaroumdareye (at 14°54′21′′N 01°46′36′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.90583°N 1.77667°E\ufeff / 14.90583; 1.77667), which are seven kilometres apart, and initially left 79 people dead and 75 wounded. Of the deceased victims, 49 were killed in Tchombangou and 30 in Zaroumdareye. A day after the attack, 21 more people were found dead and others succumbed to their injuries on Tchombangou, bringing the total death toll to 100. On 8 January UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman said that 73 people had been killed in the village of Tchouma Bangou and 32 in Zaroumdareye, making the total death toll 105. The government of Niger dispatched soldiers to the border after the attacks. The attackers are Islamist militants who arrived in the villages while crossing the border from Mali; however, the exact terrorist organization who carried out the attacks is not clear so far. <Attacks - January> \c\cSome time before the massacre, two militants who were seen in the area were killed by the local villagers. Those attacks are suspected to be in retaliation for those killings, according to the country's interior minister. <Attacks - January> \c\cOn 21 February, seven members of the electoral commission were killed and three others wounded in a landmine explosion in Tillabéri. The attack was carried out on the same day of the presidential election's second round. <Attacks - February> \c\cOn 16 March, armed men on motorcycles attacked a convoy returning from a market in Banibangou by the Malian border to a nearby village in Southwestern Niger's Tillabéri Region, killing 58 people. <Attacks - March> \c\cOn 21 March, militants riding motorbikes attacked Intazayene, Bakorat and Wistan, three villages in the Tahoua Region close to the Malian border, killing 137 people. The death toll would make the attack the deadliest committed by suspected jihadists in Niger's history. Newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum condemned the attacks and declared three days of national mourning. <Attacks - March> \c\cOn 24 March, at least 10 people were killed during attacks at two villages in the Tillabéri Region. <Attacks - March> \c\cOn 18 April, at least 19 civilians were killed and two wounded when armed men raid a village in Tillabéri Region. <Attacks - April> \c\cOn 3 May, a military patrol was ambushed in the Tahoua Region, resulting in the killing of 16 soldiers and the wounding of six more. It was the first attack against soldiers in the country[citation needed] since the beginning of the year. <Attacks - May> \c\cOn 12 May, five villagers were killed and two more wounded after militants stormed the village of Fantio, in the Tillabéri region, during Eid al-Fitr celebrations. <Attacks - May> \c\cOn 30 May, four civilians and four soldiers were killed during a raid carried out by Boko Haram militants in the town of Diffa, in the Diffa Region. The jihadists attacked the town in the late afternoon, riding in about 15 vehicles, but were pushed back by responding security forces during a long gunfight, in which six attackers were killed. <Attacks - May> \c\cOn 25 June, armed men attacked a village and nearby locations, killing a total of 19 civilians. Initially, the attackers stormed the Danga Zawne village, in the Tillabéri region, killing three people. They then attacked nearby farms, killing the other sixteen people. <Attacks - June> \c\cOn 29 June, Boko Haram fighters opened fire on a bus along the road between Diffa and Maine Soroa, killing three civilians, including the bus driver, two villagers and a village chief; two more were wounded. The fighters then moved on another road and opened fire on a group of soldiers, wounding six of them. A gunfight erupted, and thirteen terrorists were killed. <Attacks - June> \c\cOn 2 July, around 100 heavily armed “terrorists” riding motorcycles attacked the Tchoma Bangou village, killing four civilians. Security forces responded to the attack, starting a gun battle, resulting in the death of five soldiers and 40 terrorists. <Attacks - July> \c\cOn 25 July, fourteen people were killed and one more was wounded as gunmen stormed the village of Wiye. Nine of the victims are killed while working at fields. <Attacks - July> \c\cOn 28 July, 19 civilians were killed and five more wounded as militants stormed the village of Deye Koukou in the Banibangou area, near the border with Mali. <Attacks - July> \c\cOn 1 August, Islamist militants ambushed and opened fire on a group of soldiers in Torodi, Tillabéri Region. As the soldiers were escaping and carried the wounded, a bomb exploded. Fifteen soldiers were killed in the attack, while six more went missing. <Attacks - August> \c\cOn 16 August, gunmen on motorbikes stormed the village of Darey-Daye, Niger, opening fire against civilians while they were tending their fields, killing 37 people, including fourteen children. <Attacks - August> \c\cOn 20 August, gunmen opened fire against civilians who were praying at a mosque in the village of Theim, in the Tillaberi region, killing 16 people."} <Attacks - August> \c\c
Operation Allies Refuge is an ongoing United States military operation to airlift selected at-risk Afghan civilians, particularly interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan. U.S. personnel also assisted NATO and regional allies in their respective evacuation efforts at Kabul International Airport. The operation is concurrent with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan. <Summary> \c\cThe operation's name was officially unveiled on July 14 by the Biden administration. <Operational history> \c\cOn July 30, 2021, the first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants remaining in the process of being relocated. <Operational history> \c\cOn August 12, following the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to the Kabul International Airport in order to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals and SIV applicants. On August 18, U.S. defense secretary Lloyd Austin said that American troops will evacuate as many Americans and allied Afghan interpreters as they can, but also admitted that the Pentagon lacks the capacity to do so. Austin also announced that around 5,000 people have already been evacuated. <Operational history> \c\cOn August 19, The Pentagon announced that 7,000 civilians have been evacuated since August 14. On August 20, U.S. President Joe Biden announced that 18,000 people have been evacuated in the past few weeks, with 5,700 in the past 24 hours. On August 21, United States Army major general William D. Taylor announced that 17,000 people have been evacuated in the past few weeks, including 2,500 Americans. On August 22, Austin announced that the U.S. Department of Defense will activate the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for the third time and send 18 aircraft planes that will be used by the U.S. military to help evacuate American citizens. Fox News also released a statement saying that 24 people have been evacuated, including three Afghan nationals who assisted the network's coverage of the war. <Operational history> \c\cOn August 15, following the fall of Kabul, the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. U.S. military took control over the air traffic control of the airport later in the day. On August 16, a C-17 cargo plane, which usually includes less than 150 paratroopers, safely evacuated roughly 823 people to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. <Operational history - Kabul airlift> \c\cThe Pentagon confirmed the head of U.S. Central Command, General Kenneth F.

The Panjshir conflict is a conflict between the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (controlled by the Taliban) on the other. It began on 17 August 2021 following the Fall of Kabul. <Summary> \c\cThe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". <Background> \c\cThe population of the Panjshir valley consists of a majority of ethnic Tajik people, as opposed to the majority of the Taliban, who are Pashtuns. <Background> \c\cThe valley is well known for its natural defences. Surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, Panjshir never fell to the Soviets during the invasion of the 1980's nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990's. <Background> \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Amrullah Saleh—citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan—declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi along with the Afghan Embassy in Dushanbe. At around the same time, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud. Local civilians also responded to his mobilization calls. <Background> \c\cPrior to the Fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by commanders and soldiers of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. Most of them regrouped at Baghlan Province's Andarab District before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from  Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan. According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid August 2021. Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a "handful of armoured humvees" in the valley. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and Anti-Taliban militias> \c\cThere are difference between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan which was supportive of the Taliban. As a result, Massoud was more willing to negiotiate with the Taliban. By 22 August, the resistance also confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban on their own, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and Anti-Taliban militias> \c\cAccording to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and Anti-Taliban militias> \c\cAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy made prior to the Fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars. Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial material of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan> \c\cAs of 17 August, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—"under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. On 18 August, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anabah in Panjshir. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training. <Timeline - Panjshir Province> \c\cOn 22 August, the Islamic Emirate gave the opposition forces a four hour ultimatum to surrender. In a statement to Al Arabiya, Massoud rejected the ultimatum. In response, the IEA announced "hundreds" of its forces had been dispatched to the Panjshir Valley. <Timeline - Panjshir Province> \c\cOn 18 August 2021, local reports from Parwan Province reported that Saleh's forces had taken Charikar from Taliban fighters stationed in the area. In addition, there are reports of gunfights taking place near Salang Pass. On the following day, videos were released which showcased local fighters with flags of the old, anti-Taliban Northern Alliance parading through the streets of Charikar. <Timeline - Parwan Province> \c\cOn 20 August 2021, anti-Taliban fighters reportedly recaptured Andarab, Puli Hisar and Dih Salah districts in Baghlan Province with the Taliban claiming 15 of its soldiers had been killed, while other sources reported that up to 60 Taliban fighters were killed or injured, and two dozen captured. The three districts had reportedly experienced a revolt, led by a local police chief, after Taliban had conducted unpopular house-to-house searches. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi announced the operational success of the districts being recaptured via Twitter. <Timeline - Baghlan Province> \c\cAudiovisual reports of the events circulated on social media and were reported by Pajhwok Afghan News. Later on the 20th, it was reported that the forces, led by Abdul Hamid Dadgar, had recaptured Andarab, though the Taliban had not yet commented. <Timeline - Baghlan Province> \c\cA source within the Panjshir resistance consequently confirmed their involvement in the operations in Baghlan Province, and stated that they planned on seizing a northern highway which could allow them to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Taliban social media accounts called the counteroffensive a "betrayal" of the amnesty the Taliban had offered. It was reported on 22 August 2021 that Taliban fighters have been sent to the Keshnabad area of Andarab in order to kidnap the children whose parents are a part of anti-Taliban forces. <Timeline - Baghlan Province> \c\cAs of August 2021, a negotiated end to the political impasse has been attempted, with Saleh calling for a "peace deal" with the Taliban. On 18 August, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, indicated the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government as a means of diffusing the stalemate. <Resolution> \c\cOn 21 August 2021, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to "discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans". <Resolution> \c\cOn 22 August 2021, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possible mediate. Meanwhile, resistance spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary informed the Agence France-Presse that Ahmad Massoud's group would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implemented a system of "decentralisation" and "equal rights" across the country. <Resolution> \c\cThe USA and Western forces are commented as lowly supportive of this movement due to ongoing evacuation of Kabul depending fully on Talibans\' benevolence. Massoud Washington Post op-ed requesting Western support have been analysed as an evidence of the absence of direct communication and support between the resistance and the US government. <Reactions> \c\c

The 2021 Niger attacks are an ongoing series of attacks by militants on civilians and soldiers in Niger, mainly in the western region of Tillabéri. The attacks have left 508 people dead and more than 100 others injured. <Summary> \c\cSeveral major attacks occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020.

It is the first year in which attacks were carried out with frequency in the country. As of August, attacks were carried out every month of 2021. The previous biggest attack in Niger against civilians was the 12 December 2020 Toumour attack, which resulted in 28 people killed. Both the December 2020 and January 2021 attacks were carried out during Niger's municipal and regional elections, while the February bombing specifically targeted members of the electoral commission. <Background> \c\cOn the same day as the January attacks, two Algerian soldiers were killed in a shooting in Algeria and two French soldiers were killed in a bombing in Mali. <Background> \c\cOn 2 January, the villages of Tchombangou (at 14°49′48′′N 01°48′45′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.83000°N 1.81250°E\ufeff / 14.83000; 1.81250) and Zaroumdareye (at 14°54′21′′N 01°46′36′′E\ufeff / \ufeff14.90583°N 1.77667°E\ufeff / 14.90583; 1.77667), which are seven kilometres apart, were attacked by several militants. The attack initially left 79 people dead and 75 wounded. Of the deceased victims, 49 were killed in Tchombangou and 30 in Zaroumdareye. A day after the attack, 21 more people were found dead and others succumbed to their injuries on Tchombangou, bringing the total death toll to 100. On 8 January UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman said that 73 people had been killed in the village of Tchouma Bangou and 32 in Zaroumdareye, making the total death toll 105. The government of Niger dispatched soldiers to the border after the attacks. The attackers are Islamist militants who arrived in the villages while crossing the border from Mali; however, the exact terrorist organization who carried out the attacks is not clear so far. <Attacks - January> \c\cSome time before the massacre, two militants who were seen in the area were killed by the local villagers. Those attacks are suspected to be in retaliation for those killings, according to the country's interior minister. <Attacks - January> \c\cOn 21 February, seven members of the electoral commission were killed and three others wounded in a landmine explosion in Tillabéri. The attack was carried out on the same day of the presidential election's second round. <Attacks - February> \c\cOn 16 March, armed men on motorcycles attacked a convoy returning from a market in Banibangou by the Malian border to a nearby village in Southwestern Niger's Tillabéri Region, killing 58 people. <Attacks - March> \c\cOn 21 March, militants riding motorbikes attacked Intazayene, Bakorat and Wistan, three villages in the Tahoua Region close to the Malian border, killing 137 people. The death toll would make the attack the deadliest committed by suspected jihadists in Niger's history. Newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum condemned the attacks and declared three days of national mourning. <Attacks - March> \c\cOn 24 March, at least 10 people were killed during attacks at two villages in the Tillabéri Region. <Attacks - March> \c\cOn 18 April, at least 19 civilians were killed and two wounded when armed men raid a village in Tillabéri Region. <Attacks - April> \c\cOn 3 May, a military patrol was ambushed in the Tahoua Region, resulting in the killing of 16 soldiers and the wounding of six more. It was the first attack against soldiers in the country[citation needed] since the beginning of the year. <Attacks - May> \c\cOn 12 May, five villagers were killed and two more wounded after militants stormed the village of Fantio, in the Tillabéri region, during Eid al-Fitr celebrations. <Attacks - May> \c\cOn 30 May, four civilians and four soldiers were killed during a raid carried out by Boko Haram militants in the town of Diffa, in the Diffa Region. The jihadists attacked the town in the late afternoon, riding in about 15 vehicles, but were pushed back by responding security forces during a long gunfight, in which six attackers were killed. <Attacks - May> \c\cOn 25 June, armed men attacked a village and nearby locations, killing a total of 19 civilians. Initially, the attackers stormed the Danga Zawne village, in the Tillabéri region, killing three people. They then attacked nearby farms, killing the other sixteen people. <Attacks - June> \c\cOn 29 June, Boko Haram fighters opened fire on a bus along the road between Diffa and Maine Soroa, killing three civilians, including the bus driver, two villagers and a village chief; two more were wounded.

On 26 August 2021, two suicide bombings occurred near Abbey Gate at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. These attacks came hours after the United States State Department told Americans outside the airport to leave due to a terrorist threat. A second explosion was reported. At least 13 people have been killed by the attacks. <Summary> \c\cAfter Afghanistan fell to Taliban control on 15 August 2021, Hamid Karzai International Airport became the only secure way out of Afghanistan. Security concerns grew after hundreds of ISIS-K members escaped from jails at Bagram and Pul-e-Charkhi. Hours before the attack, US diplomats in Kabul warned American citizens to leave the airport due to security threats. United Kingdom Armed Forces Minister James Heappey has also warned of a highly credible threat of attack at Kabul airport by Islamic state militants. Embassies from United States, United Kingdom, and Australia have also warned about high security threats on the airport. <Background> \c\cU.S. President Joe Biden also received multiple reports of a possible attack during the week preceding the attack. <Background> \c\cThe attack was suspected to have been carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) amid the 2021 evacuation of Afghanistan. A crowd of local and foreign civilians had fled to the airport to evacuate. At Abbey Gate, one of the gates entering into the airport, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive. After the explosion, gunfire erupted and all gates at the airport were closed. At least 13 people were killed during the attack. The toll was confirmed by both Taliban officials and foreign troops. At least 60 people were injured, including a number of Taliban members and foreign soldiers. Four US Marines were among those killed, and up to five U.S. personnel were injured, including three U.S. Marines. <Attack> \c\cA second explosion also occurred at Baron Gate, named after the nearby Baron Hotel in Kabul. Baron Hotel has been used in the past as a gathering point for American citizens for rescue and evacuation. The hotel also has served as a processing center for Afghan people fleeing the country to escape Taliban control. <Attack> \c\cThe Taliban, through a tweet by their spokesperson, condemned the attack, saying "evil circles will be strictly stopped." Abdullah Abdullah, former Chief Executive of Afghanistan and current National Coalition of Afghanistan leader, also condemned the attack. <Reactions - Domestic> \c\c France: French President Emmanuel Macron has voiced full support for coordinating with "American allies" in response to the explosions. <Reactions - International> \c\c
After the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan and proclaimed intentions to re-establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan after the August 2021 fall of Kabul, there has been one known drone strike against the country. <Summary> \c\c27 August 2021: The United States launched an airstrike against an ISIL-KP member in Nangarhar Province.  The target was riding in a vehicle with one associate.  Two "high-profiled" ISIS targets were killed and a third person was injured.  The two targets killed were "ISIS-K planners and facilitators" of the 2021 Kabul airport attack. <Timeline - 2021> \c\c
A suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan took place on 26 August 2021 at 17:50 local time (13:20 UTC), during the evacuation from Afghanistan. At least 182 people were killed, including 28 members of the Taliban and 13 members of the United States military, who were the first American military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) claimed responsibility for the attack. On 27 August, the United States launched an airstrike against an ISIL-KP "planner" in Nangarhar Province. <Summary> \c\cAfter Afghanistan fell to Taliban control on 15 August 2021, Hamid Karzai International Airport became the only secure way out of Afghanistan. Security concerns grew after hundreds of members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) escaped from jails at Bagram and Pul-e-Charkhi. On 16 August, the Pentagon warned the US Congress about the increased threat of a terrorist attack from IS following the fall of Kubul the day previous. US President Joe Biden received multiple reports of a possible attack during the week preceding the attack, and warned on 22 August in remarks from the White House that the longer US troops remained in the country, the greater the threat posed by IS became to US personnel and civilians near the Hamid Karzai International Airport. <Background> \c\cHours before the attack, US diplomats in Kabul warned American citizens to leave the airport because of security threats. United Kingdom Armed Forces Minister James Heappey had also warned of a highly credible threat of attack at Kabul airport by Islamic State militants. Embassies from United States, United Kingdom, and Australia also warned about high security threats on the airport. <Background> \c\cAmid the 2021 evacuation of Afghanistan, a crowd of local and foreign civilians had fled to the airport to evacuate. At Abbey Gate, one of the gates leading into the airport, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive. After the explosion, gunfire erupted, and all gates to the airport were closed. <Attack> \c\cThe explosion occurred by a canal with American forces on one side; checking evacuees passports, visas and other documentation before allowing them inside the airport. An eyewitness stated that the explosion felt as if someone pulled the ground from under his feet, and saw other evacuees thrown in the air by the force of the blast. <Attack> \c\cInitial reports erroneously stated that a second explosion had taken place near the close-by Baron Hotel. The following day, it was confirmed that there was no such second explosion. <Attack> \c\cAt least 182 people were killed during the attack, including 169 Afghan civilians and 13 US service members. Two of the killed civilians were British dual-nationals and one was the child of a British national. It was initially reported that 28 Taliban fighters had also been killed in the attack, but this was later denied by Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The dead Americans were identified as eleven marines, one soldier, and one Navy corpsman. The US deaths were the first US service deaths in Afghanistan since February 2020 and were the largest single loss of life of US military personnel since the 2011 Afghanistan Boeing Chinook shootdown. <Victims> \c\cAt least 150 more people were injured, including 18 US military personnel and a number of Taliban members. <Victims> \c\cThe attack was carried out by ISIL-KP, which released a claim of responsibility and named the bomber as Abdul Rahman al-Logari. <Perpetrators> \c\cThe Taliban and ISIL-KP, despite both being jihadist groups, are enemies and have fought a bloody war among each other. General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., head of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), said there was no indication that the Taliban allowed the attacks to happen. <Perpetrators> \c\cThrough a tweet by their spokesperson, the Taliban condemned the attack, saying "evil circles will be strictly stopped". The Taliban later announced that they would take every possible measure to capture ISIL-KP leader Shahab al-Muhajir. <Reactions and responses> \c\cAbdullah Abdullah, former Chief Executive of Afghanistan and current National Coalition of Afghanistan leader, condemned the attack. Some civilians claimed to reporters that the attack had strengthened their resolve to evacuate from the country in fear of more attacks. <Reactions and responses> \c\cUS President Joe Biden made a public address following the attack. He honored the American service members who were killed, calling them "heroes" and saying they lost their lives "in the service of liberty", and stated that the US had evacuated more than 100,000 Americans, Afghans, and others. He expressed deep sorrow for the Afghan victims as well. Biden said to those who wished harm upon the US that "we will hunt you down and make you pay." The government of the United Kingdom also said that they will continue Operation Pitting, the evacuation from Afghanistan. <Reactions and responses> \c\cMany nations expressed condemnation for the Kabul airport attack and solidarity with the victims and troops conducting evacuations at the airport. The European Commission and the United Nations likewise condemned the attack. German Chancellor Angela Merkel cancelled an upcoming trip to Israel, and will stay in Germany to monitor the evacuation of German troops. Biden also rescheduled a meeting with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett because of the attack. The United Kingdom said civilian evacuations would continue in spite of the attack. <Reactions and responses> \c\cOn 27 August, The United States launched an airstrike against an ISIL-KP member in Nangarhar Province.  The target was riding in a vehicle with one associate.  Two "high-profiled" ISIS targets were killed and a third person was injured.  The two targets killed were "ISIS-K planners and facilitators" of the 2021 Kabul airport attack. <Reactions and responses - US airstrike> \c\c
Relations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the United States started recently, but not officially, on August 15, 2021, after the Taliban returned to power and proclaimed intentions to re-establish the Islamic Emirate after the August 2021 fall of Kabul. <Summary> \c\cThe United States does not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as a government, although the US said they could recognize a government that respected basic rights. <2021> \c\cOn August 27, The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan appointed Khalil Haqqani as head of security in Kabul. Haqqani, a veteran of the Soviet–Afghan War and war on terror, is a designated terrorist by the United States, and is currently wanted on a US$5 million bounty. <2021 - August 27> \c\cFollowing the 2021 Kabul airport attack, through a tweet by their spokesperson, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan condemned the attack, saying "evil circles will be strictly stopped". The Taliban later announced that they would take every possible measure to capture ISIS-K leader Shahab al-Muhajir. The United States also launched an airstrike on the 27th that killed two "high-profiled" ISIS targets and a third person was injured.  The two targets killed were "ISIS-K planners and facilitators". <2021 - August 27> \c\cFollowing the airstrike by the US on August 27, Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid condemned the attack saying they consider the airstrike a "clear attack on Afghan territory". <2021 - August 28> \c\c
After the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan and proclaimed intentions to re-establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan after the August 2021 fall of Kabul, there have been two known drone strikes against the country. As a result of the airstrikes, there has been at least 12 fatalities and one injury in the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. <Summary> \c\c27 August 2021: The United States launched an airstrike targeting an IS-K member in Nangarhar Province. The target was riding in a vehicle. He was killed alongside another high-profiled member, while a third militant was injured. The two killed were described as a planner and a facilitator. The airstrike was carried out a day after the 2021 Kabul airport attack, which resulted in the death of more than 180 people. <Timeline - 2021> \c\c29 August 2021: A U.S. airstrike targeted a vehicle carrying a suspected ISIS-K suicide bomber. At least 10 people were killed during the strike, including six children. Some of those killed had previously worked for international organisations and held visas allowing them entry to the United States. There are reports of other civilians being killed too. The majority of the casualties were residents of the area. <Timeline - 2021> \c\c
The Panjshir conflict is a conflict between the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (controlled by the Taliban). It began on 17 August 2021 following the Fall of Kabul and Amrullah Saleh assuming the Afghan presidency and declaring the resistance. Ten days later, both sides declared a ceasefire and agreed to solve all problems through dialogue. <Summary> \c\cThe former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan exercises de facto control over the Panjshir Valley, which is largely contiguous with Panjshir Province and according to The Week, as of August 2021 is "the only region out of [the] Taliban's hands". <Background> \c\cThe population of the Panjshir valley consists of a majority of ethnic Tajik people, while the majority of the Taliban are Pashtuns. <Background> \c\cThe valley is well known for its natural defences. Surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, Panjshir never fell to the Soviets during the invasion of the 1980s nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990s. <Background> \c\cOn 17 August 2021, Saleh—citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan—declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi along with the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Dushanbe. On 23 August 2021, Massoud made contact with unnamed American lawmakers. <Saleh and Massoud announcements> \c\cPrior to the fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province. There, they were joined by Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, including commandos, ex-Mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and other anti-Taliban activists. Most of them regrouped at Baghlan Province's Andarab District before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from  Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan. According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid August 2021. Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms. By 22 August 2021, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a "handful of armoured humvees" in the valley. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and anti-Taliban militias> \c\cThere are difference between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintained good relations with Pakistan which was supportive of the Taliban. As a result, Massoud was more willing to negiotiate with the Taliban. By 22 August 2021, the resistance also confirmed that several local militias had begun to fight the Taliban on their own, independent of the Panjshir-based forces. According to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to five helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and anti-Taliban militias> \c\cOn 23 August 2021, it was reported that BM-21 Grads were acquired as a part of its arsenal. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and anti-Taliban militias> \c\cAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the US Military Academy made prior to the Fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars. Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial materiel of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan> \c\cAround 17 August 2021, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud, along with local civilians who had responded to his mobilization calls. At the time, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—"under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. On 18 August 2021, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anabah in Panjshir. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training. <Timeline> \c\cOn 18 August 2021, local reports from Parwan Province reported that Saleh's forces had taken Charikar from Taliban fighters stationed in the area. In addition, there are reports of gunfights taking place near Salang Pass. On the following day, videos were released which showcased local fighters with flags of the old, anti-Taliban Northern Alliance parading through the streets of Charikar. <Timeline> \c\cOn 20 August 2021, anti-Taliban fighters reportedly recaptured Andarab, Puli Hisar and Dih Salah districts in Baghlan Province with the Taliban claiming 15 of its soldiers had been killed, while other sources reported that up to 60 Taliban fighters were killed or injured, and two dozen captured. The three districts had reportedly experienced a revolt, led by a local police chief, after Taliban had conducted unpopular house-to-house searches. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi announced the operational success of the districts being recaptured via Twitter. <Timeline> \c\cAudiovisual reports of the events circulated on social media and were reported by Pajhwok Afghan News. Later on the 20th, it was reported that the forces, led by Abdul Hamid Dadgar, had recaptured Andarab, though the Taliban had not yet commented. <Timeline> \c\cA source within the Panjshir resistance consequently confirmed their involvement in the operations in Baghlan Province, and stated that they planned on seizing a northern highway which could allow them to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Taliban social media accounts called the counteroffensive a "betrayal" of the amnesty the Taliban had offered. It was reported on 22 August 2021 that Taliban fighters had been sent to the Keshnabad area of Andarab in order to kidnap the children of anti-Taliban forces. <Timeline> \c\cAlso, the Islamic Emirate gave the opposition forces a four hour ultimatum to surrender. In a statement to Al Arabiya, Massoud rejected the ultimatum. In response, the IEA announced "hundreds" of its forces had been dispatched to the Panjshir Valley. It was reported on 23 August 2021 that talks between Taliban representatives and Panjshir leaders did not work. Ali Maisam Nazary, spokesman for the resistance, said that the Taliban made demands for Massoud to accept no elections with a centralized government, which Massoud rejected as he wanted a future government to be decentralized, which respect civil and semi-autonomy rights. <Timeline> \c\cAn unidentified Taliban spokesperson proclaimed in a statement that "hundreds of Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate are heading towards the state of Panjshir to control it, after local state officials refused to hand it over peacefully".  It was reported that on 23 August 2021, Taliban commmander Qari Fashihuddin was tasked to lead offensive operations in Panjshir. The Taliban reported that several of their fighters were shot and killed in ambushes in Jabal Siraj with several of them killed and others wounded. <Timeline> \c\cOn 23 August 2021, the Taliban claimed to have recaptured all 3 districts in Baghlan that fell to the resistance forces a week ago: Dih Salah District, Pul-e-Hisar and Andarab. A Taliban district chief stationed in Andarab was reported to be killed in the fighting. On 24 August 2021, according to Deccan Herald, Panjshir resistance fighters retook control of Banu and Dih Salah districts, while Puli Hisar remained under Taliban control. Saleh publicly warned via Twitter that Taliban fighters in Andarab were blocking humanitarian assistance for civilians trying to escape from the fighting and called it a "humanitarian disaster". On the following day, Massoud's forces claimed to have ambushed a Taliban convoy in Andarab, destroying a critical bridge and inflicting heavy losses on the Islamists. <Timeline> \c\cOn 24 August 2021, Major Wazir Akbar, an ex-Afghan commando who has joined the Panjshir-based resistance fighters, reported an attempted Taliban incursion at Anjuman Pass through Badakhshan province, which was repelled with heavy Taliban casualties. <Timeline> \c\cOn 26 August, 2021, a ceasefire was declared with the Taliban and the resistance entering into talks. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that he was "80 percent confident of a solution without war in the Panjshir Valley". On 29 August 2021, Panjshir representatives stated that there were no Taliban fighters trying to enter Panjshir, refuting information from Anaamullah Samangani, who is a member of the Taliban's Cultural Commission. <Timeline> \c\cOn 26 August, 2021, according to a video published by Global Defense Corp, heavy fighting broke out between anti-Taliban resistance group in Panjshir Valley and Taliban. More than 200 Taliban fighters were driven out the Panjshir Valley and some were captured by anti-Taliban resistance group. The National Resistance Front (NRF) has also captured Pol-e-Hesar, Deh Salah and Banu districts. <Timeline> \c\cOn 28 August 2021, Panjshir fighters have engaged Taliban fighters in Sanjan, Kapisa and in Khost Wa Fereng, Baghlan in response to allegations of ceasefire violations conducted by Taliban fighters in the area. <Timeline> \c\cOn 29 August 2021, internet and telecommunication services throughout Panjshir province were shut down on orders from the Taliban. <Timeline> \c\cOn 30 August 2021, Panjshir fighters ambushed Taliban fighters attempting to break into Panjshir from Andarab. On 31 August 2021, eight Taliban fighters were killed while trying to infiltrate the western part of Pansjhir with 2 NRF fighters wounded. Fahim Dashty said that the attack was likely done to test the area's defenses. Mohammadi reported that seven Taliban fighters were killed and several wounded. <Timeline> \c\cOn 17 August 2021, a negotiated end to the political impasse has been attempted, with Saleh calling for a "peace deal" with the Taliban. On 18 August, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, indicated the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government as a means of ending the stalemate. <Resolution> \c\cOn 21 August 2021, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to "discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans". <Resolution> \c\cOn 22 August 2021, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possibly mediate. Meanwhile, resistance spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary informed the Agence France-Presse that Ahmad Massoud's group would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implemented a system of "decentralisation" and "equal rights" across the country. On 23 August 2021, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that while Taliban fighters are being sent to Panjshir, the Taliban are willing to seek peaceful means to end the conflict. <Resolution> \c\cAs of 23 August, there has been no public support from the international community, as the US and other potential allies focus on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul, and seek the Taliban's cooperation to do so. Massoud's op-ed in The Washington Post requesting Western support may be evidence of a lack of enthusiasm (for the resistance) in the US government. <Reactions> \c\cJournalists Carlotta Gall and Adam Nossiter wrote in The New York Times that the international community would be in a bind if they showed some form of support for the resistance because of the airlift operations. Abdul Matin Beyk suggested that other anti-Taliban forces are waiting to see if the Panjshir-based fighters will either resist to the end or keep considering negotiations from Taliban representatives. He suggests that their successes can inspire others to do the same. <Reactions> \c\cOn 27 August 2021, Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan have volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it can be deemed illegal. <Reactions> \c\c

According to Yasin Zia, the resistance has already secured access to five helicopters formerly used by the Afghan military. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and anti-Taliban militias> \c\cOn 23 August 2021, it was reported that BM-21 Grads were acquired as a part of its arsenal. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and anti-Taliban militias> \c\cAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the US Military Academy made prior to the Fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars. Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial materiel of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. <Disposition of forces - Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan> \c\cAround 17 August 2021, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud, along with local civilians who had responded to his mobilization calls. At the time, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—"under siege on all sides" but had not come under direct attack. On 18 August 2021, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anabah in Panjshir. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training. <Timeline> \c\cOn 18 August 2021, local reports from Parwan Province reported that Saleh's forces had taken Charikar from Taliban fighters stationed in the area. In addition, there are reports of gunfights taking place near Salang Pass. On the following day, videos were released which showcased local fighters with flags of the old, anti-Taliban Northern Alliance parading through the streets of Charikar. <Timeline> \c\cOn 20 August 2021, anti-Taliban fighters reportedly recaptured Andarab, Puli Hisar and Dih Salah districts in Baghlan Province with the Taliban claiming 15 of its soldiers had been killed, while other sources reported that up to 60 Taliban fighters were killed or injured, and two dozen captured. The three districts had reportedly experienced a revolt, led by a local police chief, after Taliban had conducted unpopular house-to-house searches. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi announced the operational success of the districts being recaptured via Twitter. <Timeline> \c\cAudiovisual reports of the events circulated on social media and were reported by Pajhwok Afghan News. Later on the 20th, it was reported that the forces, led by Abdul Hamid Dadgar, had recaptured Andarab, though the Taliban had not yet commented. <Timeline> \c\cA source within the Panjshir resistance consequently confirmed their involvement in the operations in Baghlan Province, and stated that they planned on seizing a northern highway which could allow them to link up with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Taliban social media accounts called the counteroffensive a "betrayal" of the amnesty the Taliban had offered. It was reported on 22 August 2021 that Taliban fighters had been sent to the Keshnabad area of Andarab in order to kidnap the children of anti-Taliban forces. <Timeline> \c\cAlso, the Islamic Emirate gave the opposition forces a four hour ultimatum to surrender. In a statement to Al Arabiya, Massoud rejected the ultimatum. In response, the IEA announced "hundreds" of its forces had been dispatched to the Panjshir Valley. It was reported on 23 August 2021 that talks between Taliban representatives and Panjshir leaders did not work. Ali Maisam Nazary, spokesman for the resistance, said that the Taliban made demands for Massoud to accept no elections with a centralized government, which Massoud rejected as he wanted a future government to be decentralized, which respect civil and semi-autonomy rights. <Timeline> \c\cAn unidentified Taliban spokesperson proclaimed in a statement that "hundreds of Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate are heading towards the state of Panjshir to control it, after local state officials refused to hand it over peacefully".  It was reported that on 23 August 2021, Taliban commmander Qari Fashihuddin was tasked to lead offensive operations in Panjshir. The Taliban reported that several of their fighters were shot and killed in ambushes in Jabal Siraj with several of them killed and others wounded. <Timeline> \c\cOn 23 August 2021, the Taliban claimed to have recaptured all 3 districts in Baghlan that fell to the resistance forces a week ago: Dih Salah District, Pul-e-Hisar and Andarab. A Taliban district chief stationed in Andarab was reported to be killed in the fighting. On 24 August 2021, according to Deccan Herald, Panjshir resistance fighters retook control of Banu and Dih Salah districts, while Puli Hisar remained under Taliban control. Saleh publicly warned via Twitter that Taliban fighters in Andarab were blocking humanitarian assistance for civilians trying to escape from the fighting and called it a "humanitarian disaster". On the following day, Massoud's forces claimed to have ambushed a Taliban convoy in Andarab, destroying a critical bridge and inflicting heavy losses on the Islamists. <Timeline> \c\cOn 24 August 2021, Major Wazir Akbar, an ex-Afghan commando who has joined the Panjshir-based resistance fighters, reported an attempted Taliban incursion at Anjuman Pass through Badakhshan province, which was repelled with heavy Taliban casualties. <Timeline> \c\cOn 26 August, 2021, a ceasefire was declared with the Taliban and the resistance entering into talks. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that he was "80 percent confident of a solution without war in the Panjshir Valley". On 29 August 2021, Panjshir representatives stated that there were no Taliban fighters trying to enter Panjshir, refuting information from Anaamullah Samangani, who is a member of the Taliban's Cultural Commission. On 1 September 2021, it's reported that ceasefire talks failed. <Timeline> \c\cOn 26 August, 2021, according to a video published by Global Defense Corp, heavy fighting broke out between anti-Taliban resistance group in Panjshir Valley and Taliban. More than 200 Taliban fighters were driven out the Panjshir Valley and some were captured by anti-Taliban resistance group. The National Resistance Front (NRF) has also captured Pol-e-Hesar, Deh Salah and Banu districts. <Timeline> \c\cOn 28 August 2021, Panjshir fighters engaged Taliban fighters in Sanjan, Kapisa and in Khost Wa Fereng, Baghlan in response to allegations of ceasefire violations conducted by Taliban fighters in the area. <Timeline> \c\cOn 29 August 2021, internet and telecommunication services throughout Panjshir province were shut down on orders from the Taliban. <Timeline> \c\cOn 30 August 2021, Panjshir fighters ambushed Taliban fighters attempting to break into Panjshir from Andarab. On 31 August 2021, eight Taliban fighters were killed while trying to infiltrate the western part of Pansjhir with 2 NRF fighters wounded. Fahim Dashty said that the attack was likely done to test the area's defenses. <Timeline> \c\cOn 31 August 2021, Taliban fighters engaged Panjshir fighters in Panjshir province, Jabal Saraj, Parwan province, Khawak Panjshir and Andarb districts of Baghlan province. Sources report that the clash started when Taliban fighters were spotted entering Gulbahar and blocked the main road with a container. <Timeline> \c\cOn 2 September 2021, Panjshir sources claim that 13 Taliban fighters were killed in an ambush in Chikrinow district. By 2 September, Taliban spokesman said the valley was surrounded by all four directions and that Taliban forces were seizing locations. <Timeline> \c\cOn 17 August 2021, a negotiated end to the political impasse has been attempted, with Saleh calling for a "peace deal" with the Taliban. On 18 August, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's ambassador to Tajikistan, indicated the possibility of including the Taliban in a coalition government as a means of ending the stalemate. <Negotiations> \c\cOn 21 August 2021, it was reported that Panjshir representatives were meeting with Abdullah Abdullah and Hamid Karzai, members of the Coordination Council, to "discuss the current situation and ways of providing security to Afghans". <Negotiations> \c\cOn 22 August 2021, the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan was reportedly asked by a Taliban representative to reach out to Panjshir-based leaders to possibly mediate. Meanwhile, resistance spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary informed the Agence France-Presse that Ahmad Massoud's group would prefer a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implemented a system of "decentralisation" and "equal rights" across the country. On 23 August 2021, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that while Taliban fighters are being sent to Panjshir, the Taliban are willing to seek peaceful means to end the conflict. <Negotiations> \c\cOn 1 September 2021, a day after clashes at the entry points of the valley were reported, Mullah Amir Khan Motaqi, the head of Taliban’s commission for guidance & encouragement stated over a twitter audio message to the people of Panjshir that attempts at reaching a negotiated settlement were "unfortunately all in vain." He lay the blame with the leadership of the resistance in Panjshir, saying there are still some people in the valley who "don\'t want the problems to be solved peacefully." He went on to say that Taliban has selected a native of the province as their desired governor. The details discussed between the both sides are unclear. Ahmad Masoud has not reacted publicly to this statement yet. <Negotiations> \c\cAs of 23 August, there has been no public support from the international community, as the US and other potential allies focus on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul, and seek the Taliban's cooperation to do so. Massoud's op-ed in The Washington Post requesting Western support may be evidence of a lack of enthusiasm (for the resistance) in the US government. <Reactions> \c\cJournalists Carlotta Gall and Adam Nossiter wrote in The New York Times that the international community would be in a bind if they showed some form of support for the resistance because of the airlift operations. Abdul Matin Beyk suggested that other anti-Taliban forces are waiting to see if the Panjshir-based fighters will either resist to the end or keep considering negotiations from Taliban representatives. He suggests that their successes can inspire others to do the same. <Reactions> \c\cErika Simpson, president of the Canadian Peace Research Association, said that it's potentially risky for a country to publicly support the resistance from inside Afghanistan and suggested that it's better to support anti-Taliban resistance groups based overseas. <Reactions> \c\cOn 27 August 2021, Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan have volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it can be deemed illegal. <Reactions> \c\c
Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation to airlift from Afghanistan certain at-risk Afghan civilians, particularly interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants. U.S. personnel also helped NATO and regional allies in their respective evacuation efforts from Hamid Karzai International Airport in the country's capital of Kabul.

Another 1,000 Air Force and Army personnel were to deploy in Qatar to process SIV applicants. Meanwhile, U.S. embassy staff in Kabul were destroying sensitive materials and items featuring embassy logos or U.S. flags, standard procedure during a drawdown. Helicopters shuttled people between the embassy compound and Kabul International Airport. <Operational history> \c\cOn 15 August, following the fall of Kabul—in which Afghan security forces fled the capital and thousands of Afghan civilians fled to the airport in hopes of boarding flights, resulting in chaotic scenes of Afghans attempting to force themselves aboard military planes—the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops. U.S. military took control over the security and air traffic control of the airport later in the day. At this point, Operation Allies Refuge became concurrent with a new effort to airlift all SIV applicants, embassy personnel, American nationals, and eligible Afghans seeking to flee the country.[citation needed] <Operational history - Kabul airlift> \c\cOn 16 August, a C-17 cargo plane, which usually includes less than Army 150 paratroopers, safely evacuated roughly 640 people to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

Earthquakes of this size according to the U.S. Geological Survey are 40x20 km in rupture size. The earthquake occurred at the southern extent of the Guerrero Gap; a seismic gap capable generating a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. The earthquake was first measured at a magnitude of 7.4 by the USGS, however it was later downgraded to 7.0. The earthquake was relatively shallow, only 12 miles (20 kilometers) below the surface, which would have amplified the shaking effect. <Earthquake> \c\cIn Acapulco, just 3 km from the epicenter, a few buildings swayed and were damaged, there were also power outages and many gas leaks reported.

Since January 2001, multiple drone strikes have been conducted by the United States government in Afghanistan. These strikes began during the administration of the United States President George W. Bush. During the presidency of Donald Trump, it was estimated that drone strikes had multiplied at a pace of four to five times compared with previous presidency of Barack Obama.

The airstrike was carried out a day after an attack at Kabul Airport, which had resulted in the death of more than 180 people. <Timeline - 2021> \c\c29 August: A U.S. airstrike targeted a vehicle in Kabul a few kilometres from the airport, which U.S. officials falsely stated was carrying ISIS-K bombers but was actually driven by aid worker, Zemari Ahmadi who worked for U.S. based Nutrition and Education International. Ahmadi had loaded bottles of water into his trunk for his family and for his neighbors, which a New York Times investigation suggested had been mistakenly identified by the U.S. military as explosives, prompting the fatal airstrike. Water deliveries had stopped in his neighborhood following the collapse of the government. US officials initially claimed the vehicle had visited an alleged ISIS safe house and that secondary explosions had occurred after the airstrike, but no evidence of a secondary explosion was found at the site, and the location that the drone had tracked Ahmadi to, where he and three others had loaded bottles of water into his trunk, was the office of Nutrition and Education International, and not an ISIS-K safe house as the U.S. had alleged. Ten family members were killed in the airstrike at their home, including seven children and Ahmadi. Some of those killed had previously worked for international NGOs and held visas allowing them entry to the United States. The Pentagon later acknowledged that Ahmadi and vehicle he was driving posed no threat and that there was no connection between Ahmadi and ISIS-K. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cThe United States government has faced great criticism owing to the number of civilian casualties and many killed being unintended targets. Amnesty International USA has also questioned the legality of drone attacks. <Criticism> \c\c
The Justice for J6 rally was a pro-Donald Trump demonstration that occurred on September 18, 2021, in support of hundreds of people who were arrested and charged following the United States Capitol attack (which took place on January 6). The event was organized by Matt Braynard. <Summary> \c\cIn August, a rally titled "Justice for J6", organized by Look Ahead America (a nonprofit led by former Trump campaign staffer Matt Braynard), was scheduled to be held on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol starting at 12:00 p.m. ET on September 18. The rally is intended as a show of support for people charged for participating in the attack. Lawmakers and law enforcement officials expressed their concerns over possible unrest at the rally. <Background> \c\cIn response to the rally's announcement, the Metropolitan Police Department was activated for September 18. There were also discussions about restoring the fencing surrounding the Capitol, though they were initially met with bipartisan disapproval. It was unclear how many people planned to attend the event. <Background - Preparations> \c\cA counter-rally was subsequently scheduled on the same day, heightening concerns over participants of both events clashing. The Department of Homeland Security shared an intelligence briefing memo to state and local law enforcement agencies, which warned of potential violence at the rally and on the day before. The memo did not identify a specific or credible plot associated with the event, but it also warned that individuals and small groups can "mobilize to violence with little-to-no warning, particularly in response to confrontational encounters with perceived opponents or calls for escalation by key influencers." <Background - Preparations> \c\cThe protective fencing was restored around the Capitol by September 13, and multiple congressional offices were slated to close on September 17. <Background - Preparations> \c\cBraynard downplayed the estimated size of the rally and criticized the security measures established in response to the event, saying they were designed to discourage and deter participants. In response to the planned rally, Former U.S. President Donald Trump called it a "setup" for Republican voters, saying, "If people don\'t show up they\'ll say, \'Oh, it's a lack of spirit.\' And if people do show up they\'ll be harassed." Republicans have distanced themselves from the demonstration. On social media, far-right groups like the Proud Boys were urging members not to attend the event. <Reactions> \c\cAmong the small crowd of around 400 to 450 people, at least four people were arrested. One man arrested at the event was found to be in possession of a knife, while another was found to be in possession of a gun. <Arrests> \c\c
At 07:26 BST on 19 September 2021, police officers were called to a residential property on Chandos Crescent in Killamarsh, Derbyshire, an outer suburb of Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Three children and one adult were found dead inside the property, with the incident being treated as a suspected mass murder. A criminal inquiry is currently ongoing, and on 22 September, 31-year-old Damien Bendall of Killamarsh was charged with four counts of murder in connection with the incident. <Summary> \c\cKillamarsh is a former coal mining town situated in far northern Derbyshire. It is located close to the border with South Yorkshire, across which lies the city of Sheffield, of which Killamarsh has become an outer commuter suburb as Sheffield has expanded to the south and east. <Incident> \c\cPolice officers from the Derbyshire Constabulary attended to reports of a disturbance at a residential property on Chandos Crescent, close to Killamarsh town centre, at 07:26 local time on 19 September 2021. Arriving at the property, officers located the remains of three children and one adult inside. The victims were later named as siblings Lacey Bennett (aged 11) and John Paul Bennett (aged 13), their mother Terri Harris (aged 35), and Lacey's friend Connie Gent (aged 11); the two siblings and the mother lived together at the property, while Gent was staying at the property for a sleepover."} <Incident> \c\c

General elections were held in Qatar for the first time on 2 October 2021, following an announcement by the Emir of Qatar on 22 August 2021. The elections for the Consultative Assembly were originally scheduled to be held in the second half of 2013, but were postponed in June 2013 until at least 2016. In 2016 they were postponed again. Finally in November 2020 Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani pledged to hold the election in October 2021. <Summary> \c\cVoter turnout stood at 44%. <Background> \c\cThe elections were originally scheduled to be held in the last six months of 2013, but were postponed prior to the retiring Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani transferring power to his son Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The Consultative Assembly's term was extended until 2016 and then until 2019. <Background> \c\cIn October 2019 Al Thani issued an order for a committee to be formed to organise the elections, chaired by Prime Minister Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdul Aziz Al Thani. <Electoral system> \c\cMen and women aged over 18 are eligible to vote for 30 of the 45 seats in the Consultative Assembly according to the constitution, with the remainder appointed by the Emir. <Electoral system> \c\cOn 29 July 2021 Al Thani approved the electoral law, which mandated the thirty members being elected from single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting. The law requires candidates to be at least thirty years old and 'of Qatari origin' (according to the 2005 nationality law). This limited voting to those descended from people who held citizenship in 1930, barring people who had been naturalised and members of the Al Murrah tribe from contesting the election and leading to protests. <Campaign> \c\c

The Pandora Papers are 11.9 million leaked documents that were announced by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) on October 2, 2021 to be published beginning on October 3, 2021. The organisations described the document leak as their most expansive exposé of financial secrecy yet. In the Pandora Papers, the ICIJ worked on 11.9 million documents, making this the largest offshore data leak in history, surpassing the Panama Papers, which were a leak of 11.5 million confidential documents. <Summary> \c\cOver 100 billionaires, 30 current and former leaders, and 300 public officials were named in the first leaks on October 3, 2021. <Summary> \c\cThough not illegal, Tony Blair was shown in the papers to have saved £312,000 in Stamp Duty on the purchase of a £6.45million property in London by purchasing Romanstone International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company. <Summary> \c\c
The Pandora Papers are 11.9 million leaked documents (comprising 2.9 terabytes of data) that were published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) beginning on 3 October 2021. The news organisations of the ICIJ described the document leak as their most expansive exposé of financial secrecy yet, containing documents, images, emails and spreadsheets from 14 financial service companies, in nations including Panama, Switzerland and the UAE, surpassing their previous release of the Panama Papers in 2016, which had 11.5 million confidential documents. At the time of the release of the papers, the ICIJ said it is not identifying its source for the documents. <Summary> \c\cUp to an estimated US$32 trillion (excluding non-monetary valuables such as real estate, art, and jewelry) may be hidden from being taxed, according to news reports. <Summary> \c\cIn total, 35 current and former national leaders appear in the leak, alongside 400 officials from nearly 100 countries. Among those names are former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Montenegrin President Milo Đukanović, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim, Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba and Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso. More than 100 billionaires, 29,000 offshore accounts, 30 current and former leaders, and 336 politicians were named in the first leaks on 3 October 2021. <Disclosures> \c\cKing Abdullah II of Jordan is one of the main figures named in the papers, with documents showing he had invested over US$100 million in property across the UK and the US; they included houses in Cliffside Drive, Malibu, Washington, D.C., London and Ascot in the UK. A UK company controlled by Cherie Blair was shown to have acquired a £6.45 million property in London by purchasing Romanstone International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company; had the property been acquired directly, £312,000 would have been payable in stamp duty. Tony Blair's name appears in a statement of joint income for the associated mortgage. The papers also reveal how an office block owned by the Aliyev family was sold to the Crown Estate, the sovereign's public estate, for £66 million in 2018, netting the Aliyevs a £31 million profit. Another office block worth £33 million was sold to the family in 2009, and was gifted to Heyder Aliyev, son of Azerbaijan's President Aliyev. Elsewhere, a close associate[who?] of Vladimir Putin was revealed to have secret assets in Monaco, and Andrej Babiš, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, who had campaigned on promising to crack down on corruption and tax evasion, did not declare the use of an offshore investment company in the purchase of eight properties, including two villas, in Mougins on the French Riviera for £12 million. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was also mentioned, despite being quoted in 2018 as stating, "Every public servant's assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask – what is legitimate?" Kenyatta and six members of his family have been linked to 13 offshore companies. <Disclosures> \c\cOther global names mentioned include Shakira, who was incorporating new offshore entities while going on trial for tax evasion; model Claudia Schiffer; Indian cricket player Sachin Tendulkar; Alexandre Cazes, the founder of the dark web site AlphaBay, used to deal in illegal drugs; Pakistan's finance minister, Shaukat Fayaz Ahmed Tarin, and several of family members of Pakistan's top generals; and the CEO of Channel One Russia, Konstantin Ernst. Miguel Bosé, Pep Guardiola and Julio Iglesias are also named. <Disclosures> \c\cThe leaked files come from 14 offshore service providers that help clients establish companies in secrecy jurisdictions. <Data sources> \c\cAn ICIJ report focused on the Panamanian law firm of Alemán, Cordero, Galindo & Lee, or Alcogal, saying it was the "law firm of the Latin American elite" that created at least 14,000 shell companies and trusts in tax havens. Alcogal was mentioned more than any other offshore provider in the leaked documents. <Data sources> \c\cThe ICIJ worked with journalists in 117 countries including news organizations such as The Washington Post, L\'Espresso, Le Monde, El País, Süddeutsche Zeitung, PBS program Frontline, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, The Guardian, and the BBC’s Panorama. <Data sources - Alcogal law firm> \c\cIn Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan said that all citizens mentioned in the Pandora Papers would be investigated and appropriate action taken in case of wrongdoing. <Newsrooms> \c\c

An earthquake struck Pakistan's Balochistan province near the city of Harnai on 7 October 2021, killing at least 20 and injuring 300. The deadly moment magnitude 5.9 Mw  quake struck near the anniversary of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which killed 87,000 people. <Summary> \c\cPakistan is directly influenced by the ongoing oblique convergence between the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate. Along the northern margin of the India-Eurasia convergent boundary is the Main Himalayan Thrust which accommodates north-south continental collision. Thrust faulting in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya region is the direct result of the plate interaction. In the Balochistan region, the convergence is highly oblique, involving the large Chaman Fault; a strike-slip structure and many thrust faults. The 2005 Kashmir earthquake occurred near the vicinity of the Main Himalayan Thrust. The more recent and larger manitude 7.7 quake in 2013 in Balochistan was the result of oblique-slip faulting along this highly oblique boundary. That earthquake killed at least 800 and caused major damage in the province. <Tectonic setting> \c\cAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake occurred during the rupture of a thrust fault under the Sulaiman Mountains and Central Brāhui Range. It was followed by a magnitude 4.6 aftershock. It was the largest earthquake in Pakistan since the a major tremor in 2013 which occurred nearby. The earthquake was revised from an initial estimation of 5.7 at 20.8 km depth to 5.9 at 9.0 km. <Earthquake> \c\cStriking early in the morning at just after 03:00 local time, the earthquake collapsed many homed where residents were asleep. At least 20 people died, mostly women and children. An unspecified number of residents were buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings, and rescued by survivors. The number of injured people stands at 300, with many hospitals in Balochistan overwhelmed by the influx of patients. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) (PDMA), severe damage was reported in the Harnai District and Shahrag area, where at least 70 homes were affected. Damage was also reported in the cities of Sibi and Quetta. <Impact> \c\cFollowing the quake, troops from the Pakistan Army were dispatched in Harnai to aid in recsue and relief operations. At least nine injured victims in need of medical treatment were transported via helicopters from the affected region to Quetta. The Inter-Services Public Relations, army, medical personnel, response workers, and officials are working together to coordinate the rescue and relief works. A team of search and rescue individuals from Rawalpindi was sent to Harnai to find survivors among the wreckage."} <Response> \c\c
On 13 October 2021, a man shot multiple people with a bow and arrow in Kongsberg, Norway, a town about 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of the capital city Oslo. Several people have been injured and killed, and a suspected perpetrator has been taken into custody. The attacker reportedly moved through the town and targeted people at several locations before being arrested. <Summary> \c\c
On 13 October 2021, a man shot eight people with a bow and arrow at locations in Kongsberg, Viken, Norway, a town about 70 kilometres (43 mi) southwest of the capital city Oslo. Five people were killed, and three others were injured. The suspect, identified as 37-year-old Espen Andersen Bråthen, a Danish citizen born in Norway, was subsequently taken into custody. <Summary> \c\cPolice were first notified of a person walking around Kongsberg with a bow and arrows in a quiver on his shoulder at 18:12 CEST. Upon receiving the first calls, a patrol was quickly sent to the location of the attack, followed by three others. Armed officers first confronted the perpetrator six minutes after the first calls, but he fired several arrows at them and escaped. Afterwards, he launched the attack and killed his victims, according to the police chief. <Attack> \c\cThe perpetrator is said to have first started firing inside a Coop Extra supermarket in Kongsberg and then moved over a large area. Pictures have been published of arrows lodged in walls at the scene. As the attack continued, police cordoned off several parts of Kongsberg. An arrest was eventually made at 18:47. A warning shot was fired at the time of the arrest, according to the police chief. <Attack> \c\cBy the time of the suspect's arrest, the attack had spurred a large emergency response including 22 heavily-armed police patrols, more than ten ambulances, and two helicopters. The attack was the deadliest in Norway since the 2011 attacks committed by Anders Behring Breivik. <Attack> \c\cFive people were killed in the attack, and three others were injured. The five killed were four women and one man, aged 50 to 70 years. The three survivors did not sustain life-threatening injuries; one of them was an off-duty police officer. The investigation indicated that the victims were all attacked in different locations. <Victims> \c\cThe suspect was taken to a police station in Drammen, where his defence lawyer said he was questioned for more than three hours, was co-operating with authorities, and has confessed to the attack. The Norwegian Police Security Service launched a terrorism investigation. <Investigation> \c\cThe suspect is 37-year-old Espen Andersen Bråthen, who authorities believe acted alone. He was born in Norway to a Norwegian father and a Danish mother and had lived his entire life in the country. Bråthen was living in Kongsberg at the time of the attack. He has several prior criminal convictions for break-ins, cannabis possession, and threats against family members. <Suspect> \c\cBråthen was known to the police and had converted to Islam around 2016. Police had last been in contact with him in 2020, and they had been concerned about his possible extremist views. However, he did not appear on their radar in 2021. The chairman for the board of a Kongsberg mosque recalled Bråthen visiting the mosque three times years ago; according to him, Bråthen was tense and did not pray or know a lot about Islam. He considered contacting the police but did not have anything to go on. <Suspect> \c\cNorwegian police constables, who are usually unarmed, were ordered to temporarily carry firearms nationwide after the attack. However, there was no change to the national threat level in the country. Questions were raised about the inability by police to stop the attack during their first confrontation with the perpetrator; officers in Norway are trained to immediately respond to an ongoing incident without waiting for other units. On the day after the attack, flags were flown at half-mast on all public buildings and candles were lit on the steps of Kongsberg Church."} <Aftermath> \c\c
On 15 October 2021, a suicide bombing occurred at the Imam Bargah mosque, a Shia mosque during Friday prayers in Kandahar, Afghanistan, killing at least 65 people and wounding more than 70 others. The Islamic State – Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the attack according to a statement released by the group's media wing, Amaq.

Following the attack, the Taliban promised to provide security at Shia mosques."} <Summary> \c\c
Sir David Amess, the British Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Southend West, was stabbed to death on 15 October 2021. The attack occurred at a constituency meeting in Leigh-on-Sea. A 25-year-old man was arrested. <Summary> \c\cSir David Amess was a long-serving politician who entered Parliament in 1983 as the MP for Basildon. He held no senior positions but was an "instantly recognizable" member of the Conservative Party and had been knighted for his commitment to public service. He is said to have been socially conservative and held relatively centrist views, notably opposing abortion and campaigning in favour of Brexit; for stronger animal welfare protections; and to award Southend-on-Sea city status. <Background> \c\cFollowing the murder of Jo Cox whilst on her way to meet constituents at a constituency surgery in 2016, Amess said in his 2020 autobiography that fears of similar attacks "rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians" and that he had faced harassment and insecurity at his home. MPs are protected by armed police when inside Parliament, with security being tightened after the 2017 Westminster attack. However, they are generally not given police protection during surgeries and they are normally accompanied by one member of staff only. After Cox's murder, parliamentary spending on MPs\' personal security rose from under £200,000 to £4.5 million in two years. <Background> \c\cOn 15 October 2021, Amess was at a constituency surgery at Belfairs Methodist Church on Eastwood Road North, Leigh-on-Sea, where he was scheduled to meet with constituents from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. BST. He first met with constituents on the steps of the Church, and entered the building at around 12:05 p.m., to speak with people who had arrived earlier. Inside the Church, his attacker emerged from the group of people waiting to speak with Amess, and stabbed him multiple times. Police were alerted to the attack shortly after it occurred, and armed police, as well as medical and police helicopters, attended. The suspect was arrested inside the Church before being taken away; once the suspect was removed from the scene, a police cordon was set up. An air ambulance landed on a nearby playing field at 2:13 p.m. to take Amess to hospital; the medical team already in attendance decided that his condition was not stable enough to transport Amess and continued to work at the scene instead. He died just before 3:00 p.m., at the age of 69. <Attack> \c\cThe motivations of the attacker are unknown. Counter-terrorist police officers are involved in the early stages of the investigation. Essex Police said a "25-year-old man was quickly arrested after officers arrived at the scene on suspicion of murder and a knife was recovered". At around 6:32 p.m. on 15 October, Essex Police announced that the investigation had been handed over to counter-terrorist officers. Later in the day, the BBC reported that a government source said the suspect is a British national who may have Somali heritage. <Investigation> \c\cAt about 00:30 a.m. on 16 October, the police declared the stabbing a terrorist incident. <Investigation> \c\cPrime Minister Boris Johnson returned to Westminster in the wake of the attack, where flags were lowered to half-mast. Various parliamentary groups and current and former politicians from across the political spectrum expressed shock and offered condolences, as did relatives of Jo Cox. A vigil for Amess was held in his Southend West constituency at 6:00 p.m. on the day he died. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, announced that the security of MPs will be reviewed. Conservative MP and Chairman Oliver Dowden announced that, in light of Amess's death, campaigning activities on behalf of the Conservative Party would be suspended nationwide until further notice. Stéphane Dujarric,  spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, said that politicians should be able to undertake their duties without fear of attack. <Reactions> \c\cBBC One changed its evening schedule out of respect, replacing topical news satire show Have I Got News for You with a rerun of panel show Would I Lie to You?; crime scene comedy The Cleaner with a rerun of sitcom Miranda; and slasher film Halloween with romance  The Light Between Oceans. <Reactions> \c\c
A series of protests by the Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government began on 20 September 2021, triggered by the government's decision to ban Serbian license plates, and ended on 2 October 2021. The protests had mostly consisted of blocking traffic near border crossings. The ban meant that people who owned vehicles with Serbian license plates in Kosovo would have had to switch for Kosovar license plates at a government vehicle registration center. The ban intended to mirror the former ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia. The Republic of Serbia does not recognise the Republic of Kosovo and considers the Kosovo–Serbia border only temporary. The protests have led the relations between Serbia and Kosovo, which had been improving, to worsen. The Serbian Armed Forces are on heightened combat readiness as a result. Both sides have accused each other of great overreach. International powers have called for de–escalation, with Russia criticising Kosovo. On 30 September 2021, an agreement was reached to end the ban starting 4 October 2021, according to which the protests also ended on 2 October 2021. Kosovar license plates in Serbia and Serbian license plates in Kosovo now have their national symbols and country codes covered with a sticker. <Summary> \c\cNorth Kosovo is majority Serb and has been a region largely opposed to an independent Kosovo, with frequent protests since Kosovo declared independence. It has not recognised the Government of Kosovo and has acted independently of it until the 2013 Brussels Agreement. According to the Brussels Agreement, by 2016 the Community of Serb Municipalities was to be formed. The Community would be a self–governing association of municipalities with a Serbian majority in Kosovo. As of 2021, it has not yet formed, because of the Government of Kosovo freezing the Brussels Agreement and its Constitutional Court declaring some parts of the agreement to be unconstitutional. <Background> \c\cUp until 2011, Serbia issued Serbian license plates for towns in North Kosovo. In 2011, Serbia agreed to stop issuing these license plates and that they should be changed for Republic of Kosovo (RKS) or the neutral Kosovo (KS) license plates. The KS license plates do not bear any state symbols. Serbia has allowed the KS license plates on its territory, but not the RKS license plates. The agreement lasted 5 years until 2016, when it was expected a better solution would be found. The same terms were renewed on 14 September 2016 and were valid until 14 September 2021. After 14 September 2021 the conditions remained the same, but a ban on Serbian license plates was issued in Kosovo on 20 September 2021. The KS license plates were also declared invalid by the Government of Kosovo which were used by some vehicles in Kosovo, including by owners who often had to travel across the Kosovo–Serbia border. <Background> \c\cThe motive of the Kosovan government in the ban had been to mirror the former, similar policy of the Serbian Government by which Republic of Kosovo(RKS) license plates had been banned since Kosovo declared independence, and vehicles with RKS license plates in Serbia had to switch them for temporary Serbian plates. Vehicles with Serbian license plates in Kosovo were supposed to, up to the 30 September 2021 Agreement in Brussels, have their Serbian license plates taken off and switched for Kosovar license plates at a government vehicle registration center. Drivers who had visited the country with Serbian license plates had to get temporary plates. The temporary plates costed a 5 euro (2021 value) tax and were valid for 60 days. The ban would have reportedly impacted around 9,500 vehicles with Serbian license plates in North Kosovo which were to have to wear permanent Kosovar license plates. This was originally supposed to be done after the 2011 agreement, but no attempts were made to enforce it. <Background> \c\cThe protests organised by the Kosovo Serbs against the Kosovan government began on 20 September 2021. On the same day, over 20 vehicles of the Kosovo Police, of which over 10 were armoured, came to the site of the protests. Hundreds of local ethnic Serbs had been protesting daily. They were blocking the roads leading to the two border crossings with Serbia in North Kosovo, near Jarinje and Brnjak, with vehicles and barricades reinforced by gravel. On 23 September 2021 the traffic block consisting of vehicles became 3 kilometres long on the Mitrovica–Raška road in Jarinje. Protesters were sleeping next to the protest sites in improvised tents. Representatives of the Serb List also attended the protests. <Protests> \c\cThe protests had been mostly calm. However, on 25 September 2021, two government vehicle registration centers in Zvečan and Zubin Potok were attacked by arson, and allegedly with hand grenades that failed to explode. On 23 September 2021, the Kosovo Police was accused of injuring three people unrelated to the protests, two seriously, who are now in hospital. Kosovo has denied involvement and says that it's "disinformation". <Protests> \c\cAccording to the agreement between Kosovo and Serbia mediated by the European Union (EU) Representative for the Balkan–Pristina Dialogue Miroslav Lajčák in Brussels, reached on 30 September 2021, the Kosovar special police withdrew by 16:00 local time on 2 October 2021. Along with this, the barricades set up by the protesters were removed by local Serbs and the traffic blocks ended, leading to border traffic resuming. KFOR troops replaced the police units and will be present for the next two weeks. <Government responses - Serbia> \c\cThe decision to ban Serbian license plates and the ongoing protests prompted Serbian authorities to raise the combat readiness of the Serbian Armed Forces on the border with Kosovo. The army started transporting military equipment to the border area, including its fighter jets and helicopters, and tanks, on 26 September 2021. The President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić has described Kosovo's license plate ban as a "criminal action". He made the withdrawal of Kosovar special police ROSU a condition for starting EU-mediated negotiations to resolve the dispute. <Government responses - Kosovo> \c\cThe Prime Minister of Kosovo Albin Kurti has accused Serbia of "inciting and supporting" the attacks on government buildings. He also accused Serbia of "exploiting Kosovo citizens to provoke a serious international conflict." The attacks were described by the Interior Ministry of Kosovo as "having terrorist elements". The mayors of majority Serbian municipalities on 27 September also requested a withdrawal of the units and more KFOR prsence, citing the incident on 23 September 2021 when 3 Serbs were injured as a concern. The special police units withdrew as part of the 30 September 2021 Agreement in Brussels on 2 October 2021. <Agreement to end the ban> \c\cOn 30 September 2021, an agreement was reached in Brussels that effectively ended the ban on Serbian license plates, starting 08:00 local time, 4 October 2021. The agreement also effectively ended the ban on Kosovar license plates in Serbia. The agreement is intended as a temporary solution. The solution is to cover the national symbols of Kosovo on Kosovar RKS license plates in Serbia, as well as to cover the national symbols of Serbia on Serbian license plates in Kosovo and their country codes RKS and SRB with a sticker. A working group was formed and met on 21 October 2021 in Brussels for the first time, to try and find a permanent solution in accordance with EU standards. Miroslav Lajčák said that "he trusts they will present concrete findings in 6 months", when negotiators and delegations will present their proposals for the permanent solution. <Reactions> \c\cOn 26 September 2021, Russian diplomats together with the Serbian Defense Minister Nebojša Stefanović visited an inspection of Serbian forces in the military base of Rudnica. Rudnica is a few kilometres away from the Kosovo–Serbia border. Russia will deploy air defense forces to Serbia for joint military exercises which will be held in October. On 27 September 2021, the NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, the Kosovo Force, stepped up the amount and duration of its patrols. The increase is most notable near the border crossings, moving armored vehicles close to protesters\' border blocks. <Reactions> \c\c
On 15 October 2021, Sir David Amess, a British Conservative Party politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for Southend West, died after being stabbed multiple times during a political surgery at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Ali Harbi Ali, a 25-year-old male British citizen, was arrested at the scene and was later charged with murder and the preparation of terrorist acts. <Summary> \c\cAmess was a long-serving politician who entered Parliament in 1983 as MP for Basildon. He had held no senior positions but was described by Nick Paton Walsh as an "instantly recognisable" member of the Conservative Party and had been knighted for his political and public service. He was a devout Catholic and a socially conservative politician who opposed abortion, supported capital punishment, and campaigned in favour of Brexit. He was a supporter of animal welfare and was one of the few Conservative MPs to support a ban on fox hunting. He also supported a campaign to award city status to Southend-on-Sea, Essex. <Background> \c\cFollowing the murder of MP Jo Cox on her way to a constituency surgery in 2016, Amess wrote in his 2020 autobiography that fears of similar attacks "rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians" and that he had faced harassment and insecurity at his home. MPs are protected by armed police when inside Parliament, with security tightened after the 2017 Westminster attack. They are generally not given police protection during surgeries, and they are normally accompanied by one member of staff only. After Cox's murder, parliamentary spending on MPs\' personal security rose from under £200,000 to £4.5 million in two years. <Background> \c\cOn 15 October 2021, Amess was at a one-to-one constituency meeting at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall on Eastwood Road North in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, where he was scheduled to meet with constituents from 10 am to 1 pm. He first met with constituents on the steps of the church and entered the hall at around 12:05 pm to speak with people who had arrived earlier. While inside the church hall, a man armed with a knife emerged from the group of constituents and stabbed him multiple times. <Attack> \c\cArmed units and medical and police helicopters arrived at the scene within minutes. The suspect waited inside the church hall, where he was arrested and a police cordon was set up. An air ambulance landed on Belfairs Sports Ground at 2:13 pm to take Amess to hospital, but the medical team decided that his condition was not stable enough to transport him and so continued to work on him at the scene. He was declared dead just before 3 pm. <Attack> \c\cCounter-terrorist police officers were involved in the early stages of the investigation. Essex Police said that a "25-year-old man was quickly arrested after officers arrived at the scene on suspicion of murder and a knife was recovered". At approximately 6:32 pm on 15 October 2021, Essex Police announced that the investigation had been handed over to the Counter Terrorism Command of London's Metropolitan Police Service. <Investigation> \c\cOn the evening of 16 October, the Metropolitan Police Service confirmed the suspect had been detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000, and that magistrates had extended the period the suspect could be held in custody for questioning until 22 October 2021. Just after midnight, police identified the stabbing as a terrorist incident potentially motivated by Islamic extremism. Police searched three addresses in London over the weekend following the stabbing. <Investigation> \c\cAmess's close links to Qatar, which backs Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, have been examined by police. <Investigation> \c\cAli was born in 1996 in Southwark, Central London, to Somali immigrant parents. In 2014, as a teenager, Ali was referred to the Prevent programme, Britain's voluntary programme for those thought at risk of radicalisation, from which he was referred on to the Channel Programme. He is believed to not have spent long in the programme, and he was not a "subject of interest" to MI5. He lived in Kentish Town. North London. <Investigation - Accused> \c\cOn 21 October 2021, Ali Harbi Ali, a British-born national of Somali heritage was charged with the murder of Amess and the preparation of terrorist acts. On 22 October, he appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from Belmarsh, during which he was remanded in custody. <Investigation - Accused> \c\cAfter the attack, the prime minister Boris Johnson returned from a holiday, to Westminster, where flags were lowered to half-mast. Various parliamentary groups, and current and former politicians from across the political spectrum, expressed shock and offered condolences, as did members of the royal family, international politicians, and relatives of Jo Cox. A vigil for Amess was held in his Southend West constituency at 6 pm on the day of his death, with another being held the next day. <Reactions> \c\cThe Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, announced that the security of MPs will be reviewed. The safety of MPs during open, public constituency surgeries was debated by politicians. Calls to enact a law to crack down on online targeting of MPs and end anonymity were made. The Conservatives suspended political campaigning. <Reactions> \c\cA Catholic priest reported he was not allowed to enter the crime scene to administer the last rites for Amess. Following Amess's killing, British Catholic policymakers issued statements affirming Amess's commitment to his faith and lauding his achievements. Labour MP Mike Kane also sought to add an "Amess amendment" to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that would ensure Catholic priests access to crime scenes in order to administer the last rites. <Reactions> \c\cOn 16 October, Boris Johnson and the Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer, accompanied by Sir Lindsay Hoyle and the home secretary Priti Patel, laid wreaths at the church hall where Amess was killed. On 18 October, a minute's silence was held in the House of Commons before MPs paid tribute to Amess. That evening, a service of remembrance for Amess was held by MPs at St Margaret's Church, Westminster. The service, which included an address by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, was streamed live by the ITV News YouTube channel. MPs paid tribute in a book of condolence that was placed in the House of Commons Library, as well as in Westminster Hall and Portcullis House. Tributes were also laid at Belfairs Methodist Church Hall, where Amess was killed. <Reactions> \c\cIn the days following Amess's death, a number of MPs, including Conservative Chris Skidmore and Labour's Charlotte Nichols, voiced their support for a campaign to give Southend-on-Sea city status as a way of honouring Amess's memory; he had frequently spoken on the topic in Parliament. During tributes to Amess on 18 October, the Prime Minister announced that the Queen had agreed to Southend being given city status. <Reactions> \c\cAs a result of Amess's death, a by-election was triggered to fill his former seat. Major and minor parties announced they would not stand a candidate to oppose the Conservatives, as a sign of respect, following the precedent set in the 2016 Batley and Spen by-election. <Reactions> \c\c
Solar cycle 25 is the current solar cycle pattern of sunspot activity. It began in December 2019, with a smoothed minimum sunspot number of 1.8. It is expected to continue until about 2030. <Summary> \c\cWidely varying predictions regarding the strength of cycle 25 ranged from very weak with suggestions of slow slide in to a Maunder minimum like state to a weak cycle similar to previous cycle 24 and even a strong cycle. Upton and Hathaway have predicted that the weakness of cycle 25 would make it part of the Modern Gleissberg Minimum.  One published prediction (of a very weak cycle) was retracted due to fundamental errors. <Predictions> \c\cThe Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel predicted in December 2019 that solar cycle 25 will be similar to solar cycle 24, with the preceding solar cycle minimum in April 2020 (± 6 months), and the number of sunspots reaching a (smoothed) maximum of 115 in July 2025 (± 8 months). This prediction is in line with the current general agreement in the scientific literature, which holds that solar cycle 25 will be weaker than average (i.e. weaker than during the exceptionally strong Modern Maximum). <Predictions> \c\cAs of April 2018, the Sun showed signs of a reverse magnetic polarity sunspot appearing and beginning this solar cycle. It is typical during the transition from one cycle to the next to experience a period where sunspots of both polarities exist (during the solar minimum). The polarward reversed polarity sunspots suggest that a transition to cycle 25 is in process. The first Cycle 25 sunspot may have appeared in early April 2018 or even December 2016. <Early signs> \c\cIn November 2019, two reversed polarity sunspots appeared, possibly signaling the onset of cycle 25. <Early signs> \c\cNandy et al., analyzed the polarity orientation of bipolar magnetic regions observed in December 2019 and concluded that magnetic regions with the underlying orientation of solar cycle 25 toroidal field component were brewing in the solar convection zone, representing early signs of the new cycle. <Early signs> \c\cSupersynoptic (time vs. solar latitude) map of the radial component of the solar magnetic field for Cycles 24-25 based on observations from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) shows magnetic activity of cycle 25 beginning November 2019 at about 30 degree latitudes in both solar hemispheres. <Early signs> \c\cA more recent supersynoptic map is available. <Early signs> \c\cSpotless days by year (Solar cycle 25 vs 24) <Early signs> \c\c2021 : 43 (18%)  ...

Solar activity continued to increase in the following months, especially abruptly in October, with flares taking place on a near-daily basis by November. On November 29, an M4.4 flare, the strongest of the cycle to date, took place, possibly indicating the solar cycle would be more active than initially thought. <Events - 2020> \c\cOn 8 December, a small coronal mass ejection was found heading directly towards Earth shortly after a strong C-class solar flare, hitting the planet on 9/10 December and causing bright aurorae at high latitudes. <Events - 2020> \c\cThe first X-class solar flare of the cycle happened on July 3, peaking at X1.59. Although likely to create a CME, the event was not directed towards Earth. <Events - 2020> \c\cOn July 22, six sunspots were seen for the first time since September 6, 2017. <Events - 2020> \c\cOn October 9, A M1.6 class solar flare erupted sending a coronal mass ejection that hit earth on October 12 triggering a G2 Geomagnetic Storm. <Events - 2021> \c\cThe second X class flare of the solar cycle erupted on October 28, producing a CME and a S1 Solar radiation storm <Events - 2021> \c\c

On 1 November 2021, a high-rise block of flats in Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, collapsed. It was in the process of being built much higher than authorised. At least 22 people were killed. A rescue effort is ongoing and the state government is conducting an investigation. <Summary> \c\cPrior to the event,[when?] Fourscore Homes, a United Kingdom-based private development company commissioned the construction of a trio of highrise buildings at 44BCD Gerrard Road, in the Ikoyi neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria, called the "360 Degrees Towers". The company is headed by Nigerian Femi Osibona (aka Olufemi Adegoke Osibona). <Background> \c\cOne of the buildings undergoing construction was a 21 story luxury residential high-rise. In February 2020, consultancy firm Prowess Engineering Limited withdrew from the project over concerns regarding the integrity of the building. The Lagos State Building Control Agency had approved only 15 floors, but 21 had been been built. <Background> \c\cOn 1 November 2021, at 2:45 p.m. UTC+01:00, one of the three "360 Degrees Towers", the 21-story building, collapsed. Fifteen people have been confirmed dead, and an uncertain number of people are believed to be trapped in the rubble; an official estimate is that up to 40 workers were on site at the time. <Collapse> \c\cOsibona was inside the building during the collapse and is reportedly missing. <Collapse> \c\cA rescue effort is being conducted by the National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos State (NEMA), and other responders. It is being supervised by the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development. According NEMA, the military is scheduled to "take over operations". <Rescue operations> \c\cAs of 2 November, nine people have been rescued. <Rescue operations> \c\cFemi Hamzat, deputy governor of Lagos, was jeered by crowds who said authorities had been too slow to initiate rescue attempts. <Aftermath> \c\cGbolahan Oki, the general manager  of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, announced that the owner of the building has been arrested and would be prosecuted. The state government suspended the chief architect, and is conducting an investigation. <Aftermath> \c\c

On 1 November 2021, a high-rise block of flats in Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, collapsed. It was in the process of being built. At least 36 people were killed. A rescue effort is ongoing and the state government is conducting an investigation. <Summary> \c\cFourscore Homes, a United Kingdom-registered company financed and was undertaking (including having commissioned subcontractors for) the construction of a trio of highrise buildings at 44BCD (or 20) Gerrard Road, in the Ikoyi neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria, called the "360 Degrees Towers". The company is headed by an experienced Nigerian developer Femi Osibona. <Background> \c\cOne of the buildings was a 21-story luxury residential high-rise tower. In February 2020, consultancy firm Prowess Engineering Limited withdrew from the project over concerns regarding the integrity of that building. The Lagos State Building Control Agency had approved only 15 floors, but 21 had been built. <Background> \c\cOn 1 November 2021, at 2:45 p.m. UTC+01:00, one of the three "360 Degrees Towers", a 21-story building, collapsed. Thirty-six people have been confirmed dead, and many more are trapped in the rubble; an official estimate is that up to 40 workers were on site at the time. Osibona was near the building at the time of collapse. <Collapse> \c\cA rescue effort is being conducted by the National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos State (NEMA), and other responders. It is being supervised by the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development. According NEMA, the military is scheduled to "take over operations". <Collapse> \c\cAs of 2 November, nine people have been rescued. As of 3 November no new survivors have been found; governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said that the search is ongoing. <Collapse> \c\cGbolahan Oki, the general manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, announced on 2 November that the owner of the building has been arrested and would be prosecuted. The state government suspended the chief architect, and is conducting an investigation through an independent panel, which has been allotted 30 days to disclose findings. <Investigation> \c\c
On November 5, 2021 an oil tanker collided with a truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The collision resulted in an explosion that killed at least 99 and injured around 100. <Summary> \c\cFreetown is a port city with a population of over 1 million people. It has faced several disasters in the past. In March, a major fire in one of the city's slums left 80 injured and more than 5000 displaced.In 2017, heavy rains triggered mudslides that killed over 1000 people. <Background> \c\cThe collision and subsequent explosion is believed to have happened at 22:00 GMT on November 5 in the Wellington suburb at a junction outside Choithram Supermarket. Fuel spilled before igniting and mayor Yvonne Aki Sawyerr stated on Facebook that people flocked to collect the fuel from the leaking vehicle. <Event> \c\cReports state that a bus full of people were "completely" burnt and nearby shops and markets caught on fire after fuel spilled over the streets. <Event> \c\cAt least 99 people were confirmed dead in the tragedy, and more than 100 injured. <Event> \c\cMohamed Lamrane Bah, director of the NMDA, stated that the injured had been transferred to hospitals and the bodies were collected. He added that rescue efforts at the scene had ended. Several people are in critical condition. According to a staff member of Connaught Hospital's intensive care unit, about 30 severally burned victims are not expected to survive. President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, offered condolences and promised support to the victims\' families.Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals.Journalist Omar Fofana reported that the hospital services have been stretched. <Aftermath> \c\c
On November 5, 2021, a human crush occurred during the first night of the Astroworld Festival, a music event operated by rapper Travis Scott. Eight people died during the event with the cause of death still under investigation. A further twenty-three were hospitalized and more than 300 people were treated for injuries at the festival's field hospital. <Summary> \c\cAstroworld Festival is an annual music festival run by American rapper Travis Scott, held in Houston, Texas. In 2019, three people were injured in a stampede at the Astroworld Festival. <Background> \c\cIn 2021, the festival had approximately 50,000 attendees. The Houston Fire Department had fifty-five in-service units present at the festival, including 367 police officers and 241 security officers. Earlier on November 5, hundreds of fans surged at the festival's perimeter in an attempt to get in, knocking over metal detectors. Scott's performance was live streamed on Apple Music. <Background> \c\cOn the first night of the Astroworld Festival, the appearance of Scott on the stage led people to push towards the stage en masse, leading to a crush. According to Houston Fire Chief Sam Peña, between 9:00 p.m. and 9:15 p.m., the crowd began "to compress toward the front of the stage". As people began to fall and get injured, additional panic ensued. Peña stated the most fatal events occurred after 9:30 p.m.  The show's paramedics were seen performing CPR on unconscious attendees. At 9:38 p.m., officials declared a "mass causality event" and 17 people were transferred to hospitals. Peña stated that medical personnel was "quickly overwhelmed" as the amount of injuries surged. <Crush> \c\cScott, along with stage crew, paused during his 75-minute performance when he noticed attendees in distress near the stage. Music was halted for a few seconds when Scott noticed an ambulance in the crowd to ask what was happening. Two members of Scott's staff approached him on stage, though he shooed them away and resumed his performance. A concertgoer was filmed informing a cameraman that "people are dying", but another audience member told him that the crowd would take care of it. <Crush> \c\cAt least eight people died, ranging from the ages of 16 to 23. The cause of death is still under investigation. <Victims> \c\cTwenty-three others were evacuated to local hospitals, including eleven people found in a state of cardiac arrest. Drug overdose is being investigated as a potential cause of cardiac arrest. In all, more than 300 people were treated for injuries in a field hospital at the festival itself. <Victims> \c\cAs a result, the second night on November 6 was cancelled. A reunification center was set up for families searching for relatives. On November 6, Texas governor Greg Abbott stated: "What happened at Astroworld Festival last night was tragic, and our hearts are with those who lost their lives and those who were injured in the terrifying crowd surge." <Aftermath> \c\cScott stated he would support the incident's investigation and that he wants to help heal the Houston community. Kylie Jenner, Scott's girlfriend, was criticized for Instagram posts depicting the crowd, including one with an ambulance attempting to make its way through the crowd. Jenner and her sister, Kendall Jenner, were not injured during the event. <Aftermath> \c\c

On 5 November 2021 a collision between a petrol fuel tanker and a lorry at a busy junction of Sierra Leone's capital and largest city Freetown resulted in an explosion and a fire that killed at least 101 people, and injured more than 100, overwhelming the city's medical services. <Summary> \c\cFreetown is the capital and largest city of Sierra Leone, with a population of more than 1.2 million people. The accident happened at a busy intersection in the Wellington area, Freetown's main industrial district. The intersection where the accident happened is popularly known as "PMB", short for Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB), a defunct parastatal with its old factory buildings located adjacent the intersection. <Background> \c\cAt approximately 22:00 GMT on 5 November 2021, a fuel tanker carrying petrol attempted to make a turn outside Choithram Supermarket in the Freetown suburb of Wellington. A lorry reported to be carrying granite collided with the tanker at the junction creating a fuel leakage. The two drivers came out of their vehicles and warned community residents to stay off the scene, according to Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency. <Event> \c\cPetrol spilled from the tanker and locals, particularly the "Okada" (motorbike) taxi-riders, attempted to collect this in containers. An explosion led to a huge fireball that engulfed vehicles, people and passengers that were stuck in traffic created by the initial collision. <Event> \c\cThe mayor of Freetown, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, said that the damage was exacerbated by people who gathered at the lorry, scooped the leaking fuel in containers and placed them in close proximity to the crash scene. This created traffic chaos with many people, including passengers in cars and buses, very close to the scene of the accident. <Event> \c\cMany of the victims were trapped in vehicles, including a bus full of people which was intensely burnt, killing all inside. Nearby shops and markets caught fire after fuel spilled onto the streets. Footage broadcast by local media outlets showed charred bodies surrounding the tanker. At least 99 people were confirmed to have died in the disaster, and more than 100 others were injured. The death toll rose to 101 three days after the explosion. <Event> \c\cMohamed Lamrane Bah, the director of the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), stated that the injured had been transferred to hospitals and the bodies were collected. He added that rescue efforts at the scene had ended by 16:45 GMT 6 November. Several people are in critical condition. According to a staff member of Connaught Hospital's intensive care unit, about 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive. President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, offered condolences and promised support to the victims\' families. Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals. The journalist Omar Fofana reported that the hospital services have been stretched. On 8 November, the victims were buried in a mass ceremony. <Aftermath> \c\cThe event has been described as first of its kind in the densely populated city of about 1.2 million and follows a number of similar high-casualty fuel tanker explosions across sub-Saharan Africa where fuel spilled was viewed as wasteful in communities where many struggled to afford petrol. Mass casualties from similar events have occurred in the 2018 Mbuba tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo that killed 50 and the 2019 Morogoro explosion in Tanzania that killed 85. <Aftermath> \c\c
Israel's COVID-19 vaccination programme, officially named "Give a Shoulder" (Hebrew: לתת כתף), began on 19 December 2020, and has been praised for its speed, having given twenty percent of the Israeli population the first dose of the vaccines\' two dose regimen in the span of three weeks. <Summary> \c\cAs of June 26, 2021, about 64% of eligible Israelis have received at least one dose (and a world-leading 60% with two doses), making Israel one of the populations with the highest vaccination rates in the world per capita. Coordinated vaccination drives by the country's health authorities, utilizing databases of personal information for Israeli patients, contributed to Israel's success in vaccinating a high proportion of its population in a short period of time, relative to the rest of the world. <Summary> \c\cMany factors contributed to the quick distribution of vaccines in the state of Israel. Israel's population is younger on average than many other developed countries, with 12% of its population over the age of 65. (→ Demographics of Israel) <Background> \c\cIsrael is smaller in land area than many other developed nations. It has a comparatively small population of about 9.3 million people and a high population density (424/km2). <Background> \c\cIsrael's organized response in terms of attaining, storing and distributing vaccines was considered to be overall well coordinated. This is in part owed to the centralized nature of Israel's government system, which for example does not defer many health policy decisions to lower state-level bodies of government. The state purchased a substantial amount of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines relative to its population as early as December 2020. In May 2020, the state secured agreements with companies which were developing vaccines, such as Moderna. <History> \c\cEarly into the programme, Israel provided Pfizer with medical information about its citizens as part of a deal for the country to receive a supply COVID-19 vaccines from the company. <History> \c\cThe initial campaign for vaccinations focused on the elderly (people over the age of 60) and other patient groups with a high risk of severe illness in the case of infection, such as those with preexisting conditions, as well as employees of the healthcare sector. After eight weeks, nearly 85% of health workers at a hospital in Jerusalem (Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center) were vaccinated. <History> \c\cIsrael started its campaign on 19 December 2020, with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu being the first person in the country to receive the vaccine, getting injected on live TV to encourage other Israelis to get vaccinated. In less than two weeks, over 10% of Israelis received their first dose. <History> \c\cMass vaccination in Israel has produced evidence that the Pfizer vaccine works to stop transmission of the virus, including asymptomatic infections. The vaccination programme has also curbed deaths in the country. <History> \c\cAs of early February 2021, at least 90% of Israelis over the age of 60 received at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and there was a 41% drop in confirmed infections in the country compared with the previous month. By late February, at least 4.8 million Israelis received at least one dose. This mass vaccination led to a drop in severe COVID-19 cases. Israel passed a law allowing government workers to identify and contact those who have not been vaccinated, in order to convince them to do so. <History> \c\cTo access certain locations such as gyms, hotels, and theatres, immunized residents show a green pass (also known as a "green badge"), which was officially introduced by the Israeli Ministry of Health on February 21. The green pass indicates the holder is immunized against COVID-19, either by vaccination or previous infection. People who have received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine are eligible to receive this certificate of vaccination. It expires after six months. <History> \c\cAs of March 2021, Israel has the highest vaccinated population per capita in the world. About 60% of residents in Israel received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine by March, and certain public places reopened access for those who were vaccinated. Only about 100,000 residents over the age of 50 remained unvaccinated. By March, at least 50% of the Israeli population had received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. <History> \c\cThe perceived success of Israel's vaccination programme has been credited to the centralized systems its health maintenance organizations maintained, especially with regard to managing the personal health data of Israelis. They were able to coordinate national vaccination drives, contacting residents directly using a database of contact information such as phone numbers and emails. Every Israeli citizen must register with one of the country's four HMOs. <History> \c\cOn 10 November 2021, the Israeli Government approved the use of COVID-19 vaccine shots for children between the ages of 5 and 11 years. Israeli epidemiologists and health authorities have identified vaccine hesitancy among parents as an obstacle to getting children vaccinated. <History> \c\cData from the national campaign showed there to be a strong effect of waning immunity from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after 6 months. On 29 July 2021, Israel's Prime Minister announced that the country was rolling out a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to people over the age of 60, based on the data that suggested significant waning immunity from infection over time for those with two doses. The country expanded the availability to all Israelis over the age of 12, after five months since their second shot. On 29 August 2021, Israel's coronavirus czar announced that Israelis who had not received a booster shot within six months of their second dose would lose access to the country's green pass vaccine passport. <Distribution issues> \c\cIsraeli authorities faced problems with distributing their supply of COVID-19 vaccines early into vaccination drives. This included trouble with scheduling appointments, loosely interpreted eligibility early on which led to supply problems, and lack of sufficient distribution to less-populated villages and Arab-Israeli communities. <Distribution issues> \c\cDuring the first quarter of 2021, Israel had to address a moderate amount of vaccine hesitancy in its general population, and also address more intense pockets of vaccine hesitancy among young adults and religious/cultural minority groups. The challenges were addressed via a mix of messaging, incentives, extensions to the initial vaccine delivery system, and other measures. Many of the measures addressed the general population, while others were targeted at subgroups with below-average vaccination rates. Once the early adopters had been vaccinated, it took hard, creative work to increase population coverage from 40 to 60% and beyond. <Distribution issues> \c\cDistribution of vaccines to Palestinians has not been as thorough as to Israeli citizens. In early March, the supply of COVID-19 vaccines was not sufficient to cover all of its healthcare workers. Until March, when Israel began vaccinating Palestinian laborers with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the Palestinian Authority received only enough doses for about 6,000 people. Gaza has a population of about 2 million, by comparison. United Nations officials called for more support for vaccinating Palestinians, and praised Israel's assistance in this regard, while Amnesty International expressed concern that Israel had not done more for Palestinians with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some Israeli health officials urged the government to provide vaccinations to all Palestinians. <Distribution issues> \c\cAccording to Business Insider, Israeli citizens of any origin as well as Palestinian residents in East Jerusalem were eligible for the vaccine, with people older than 60, healthcare workers, and the "especially vulnerable" being prioritized. However, an estimated five million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza (which are not under Israeli control) were not eligible as their healthcare is under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority per the Oslo Accords. <Distribution issues> \c\cBy late March, Israel vaccinated more than 100,000 Palestinian laborers. In June 2021, Israel announced it would give over 1 million soon-to-expire Pfizer vaccines to the Palestinian Authority in exchange for a later reimbursement of a similar amount of vaccines which the Palestinian Authority expects to receive from Pfizer in the first quarter of 2022. In June 18, 100,000 of these doses had already been transferred to the West Bank's Palestinian Health Ministry. However, the Palestinian Authority soon pulled out of the exchange deal, saying the doses expired too fast. <Distribution issues> \c\cAs of March 2021, Haredi Jews and Arab-Israelis had a lower rate of vaccination, compared to other sections of the population in Israel. These demographics were also comparatively more likely to be hesitant or skeptical about taking the vaccine. Haredi Jews are about 12% of Israel's population. <Distribution issues> \c\c
Just before 11:00 am GMT on 14 November 2021, a taxi exploded in the car park outside the main entrance of the Liverpool Women's Hospital in Liverpool, England. The passenger was killed and the driver of the taxi was injured. The explosion was later declared as a terrorist incident. <Summary> \c\cOn 14 November 2021, at approximately 10:59 am GMT, an explosion occurred inside a taxi in the car park in front of the main entrance of the Liverpool Women's Hospital. The explosion was caused by an improvised explosive device which was carried by the taxi's passenger, a man of Middle Eastern origin not known to MI5, who was killed in the incident probably having constructed the device himself. The taxi driver was admitted to hospital and described as "shaken and injured"—including an ear needing to be sewn back on—but released the following day. <Incident> \c\cMerseyside Police attended the scene, along with fire and ambulance crews; they were accompanied by Military Logistics and the Bomb Squad. The hospital was placed under a lockdown, roads were closed and a cordon was in place around the hospital by the evening, and armed police maintained a presence. <Incident> \c\cThe bomber's motivation for the attack was not immediately known, however, one theory emerged that he was intending to walk to the cathedral and detonate his device as the congregation left. Police said he had links to both areas of Liverpool that had been raided. <Incident> \c\cIt was established that the taxi driver, David Perry, picked up the passenger in Rutland Avenue, approximately 10 minutes drive from the hospital. Early reports suggested that on arrival he locked the doors of his vehicle on his passenger before it went up in flames, although a Counterterrorism spokesman noted that officers had not yet spoken to Perry as of Sunday evening. <Investigation> \c\cThe police made three arrests under the Terrorism Act, and although they had not at that point declared the explosion to be a terrorist incident, they said the investigation was being run by counter terrorism officers, "out of caution". Robert Wright of The Financial Times said that any determination that the incident is considered terrorism would be made by the Counter Terrorism Command of the Metropolitan Police. <Investigation> \c\cLiverpool Police armed units raided a property in the Sefton Park area, although the BBC noted that they had not "confirmed whether the two incidents are related". Three men aged 29, 26, and 21 were arrested in the Kensington area of Liverpool under the Terrorism Act. Police later stated the arrests were a direct response to the attack. The arrests were made on Boaler Street, which is within walking distance of the hospital A fourth man was arrested. and a number of houses in the Sefton Park area had been evacuated. The Independent noted that this was a "usual precaution... where explosive materials are suspected or found". A controlled explosion was carried out in the middle of Sefton Park, "a few hundred metres" from Rut;and avenue. <Investigation> \c\cThe Independent questioned whether there was a "connection between the timing of the incident and the fact that it occurred on Remembrance Sunday, with the associated minute’s silence usually observed at 11am." The paper noted that the hospital is a short distance from Liverpool Cathedral, where the remembrance service was taking place attended by thousands of veterans and military personnel with a subsequent parade. On this, the police stated <Investigation - Response> \c\cThe Mayor of Liverpool, Joanne Anderson, made a statement, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated Perry, stating that "it does look as though the taxi driver in question did behave with incredible presence of mind and bravery". The shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth apologised on Monday evening having passed his condolences on to the family of the dead man without mentioning David Perry. He explained that a misreading of the news had led him to understand that the dead man had been an innocent member of the public. <Investigation - Response> \c\cOn 15 November 2021 the police declared the explosion a terrorist incident, and the UK terror threat level was raised from substantial to severe. MI5 joined the investigation on the same day of the incident in a support role for the local police, while COBRA met on Monday morning. The Telegraph reported that the perpetrator was unknown to MI5. <Investigation - Response> \c\cThe event was reported internationally, including by CNN and The New York Times and the Washington Post. <Investigation - Response> \c\c
General elections will be held in Tonga on 18 November 2021, to elect 17 of the 26 seats to the Legislative Assembly of Tonga. A final result is expected on election night at 10pm (UTC+13:00). <Summary> \c\cThe 2017 general elections results in a landslide victory for the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands, and ʻAkilisi Pōhiva was re-elected as Prime Minister, defeating former Deputy Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni 14 votes to 12. In September 2019 Pohiva died, and Pohiva Tuʻiʻonetoa was elected as Prime Minister with the support of the nobles, independent MPs, and 5 former members of the DPFI. His cabinet included three nobles, who had previously been excluded under Pohiva. <Background> \c\cIn December 2020 Democratic party leader Semisi Sika submitted a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Tuʻiʻonetoa. The motion was backed by Deputy Prime Minister Sione Vuna Fa'otusia, who subsequently resigned from Cabinet. The Legislative Assembly rejected the no-confidence motion 13-9 on 12 January 2021. <Background> \c\cThe Legislative Assembly of Tonga has up to 30 members, of which 17 are directly elected by first-past-the-post voting from single-member constituencies. The island of Tongatapu has ten constituencies, Vavaʻu three, Haʻapai two and ʻEua and Niuatoputapu/Niuafoʻou one each. Nine seats are held by members of the nobility who elect representatives amongst themselves. The Cabinet formed by a Prime Minister may include up to four members not elected to the Assembly, who then automatically become members of the legislature. <Electoral system> \c\cParliament was dissolved on 16 September. 75 candidates, including 12 women, registered to contest the election. One candidate, Sione Fonua, later withdrew, while a second one died, leaving 73 candidates in total.

The 2021 Solomon Islands unrest is a series of ongoing demonstrations and violent riots in the Solomon Islands, which began on 24 November 2021. <Summary> \c\cThe Solomon Islands had historically been in a state of ethnic conflict until 2003, when Australia deployed a peacekeeping mission. In 2019, the central government under Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare withdrew recognition of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and established relations with the mainland People's Republic of China. Malaita Province, however, continued to be supported by Taiwan and the United States, the latter sending US$25 million of aid to the island in 2020. The premier of Malaita Province, Daniel Suidani, also held an independence referendum in 2020 which the national government has dismissed as illegitimate. <Background> \c\cThe protests were initially peaceful, but turned violent on 24 November 2021 after buildings adjoining the Solomon Islands Parliament Building were burnt down. Schools and businesses were closed down as police and government forces clashed with protesters. Violence escalated as Honiara's Chinatown was looted. Police fired upon protesters with tear gas. <Events> \c\cMost of the protesters came from Malaita province. <Events> \c\cAustralia responded to the unrest by deploying Australian Federal Police and Australian Defence Force personnel following a request from the Sogavare government under the Australia-Solomon Islands Bilateral Security Treaty. The Australian Government stated this deployment was to support the Solomon Islands Police Force to maintain order and protect vital infrastructure and would take no position on the internal issues of the Solomon Islands. Papua New Guinea agreed to send 34 peacekeepers to help staunch the violence. <Events> \c\cAs Australian police and soldiers deployed to secure the port, airport and other critical infrastructure, mobs once again torched buildings and looted the smouldering rubble of shops in the usually sleepy Solomons Island seaside capital of Honiara. Thousands of people -- some brandishing axes and knives -- rampaged through the city's Chinatown, Point Cruz and business districts, according to AFP correspondents on the scene. Crowds voiced their anger on Friday 26 November by setting fire to at least one building near Sogavare's home, before police fired warning shots to drive the mob back toward the centre of Honiara, AFP reporters witnessed. <Events> \c\cIn Chinatown, a large warehouse was set alight, causing an explosion that sent scores of people fleeing from the scene in panic. A tobacco warehouse was also set alight as smoke from previous days fires cast parts of the devastated city of 80,000 people in an acrid haze. The overrun Royal Solomon Islands Police Force said Friday they had made just two arrests, despite two police stations being among the many buildings burned. <Reactions - Domestic> \c\cPrime Minister Manasseh Sogavare warned the rioters would "face consequences", and resisted calls to resign, saying that if he would be removed, "it will be on the floor of Parliament". He also accused the protesters of being "politically motivated" and, during an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, blamed "foreign powers" for the unrest. <Reactions - Domestic> \c\cThe premier of Malaita Province, Daniel Suidani, criticized the Government's choices but also condemned the violence on the part of the protesters. The premier of Guadalcanal also strongly denounced the riots. <Reactions - Domestic> \c\cMatthew Wale, the Opposition Leader, said Sogavare should step down, blaming him for escalating the violence. <Reactions - International> \c\cThe government of the People's Republic of China expressed "concern about the attacks" and support for the Solomon Islands Government's attempts to "restore order and stability quickly". Deputy Director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Zhao Lijian has recently stated "Facts have proven that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Solomon Islands is in line with the fundamental and long-term development of the Solomon Islands." And also stating that, "Any attempt to undermine the normal development of China-Solomon Islands relations would be futile."  <Reactions - International> \c\c
The 2021–2022 European windstorm season is the seventh instance of seasonal European windstorm naming in Europe. This is the third season in which the Netherlands will participate, alongside the meteorological agencies of Ireland and the United Kingdom (Western Group). The new season's storm names were released on 1 September 2021. Storms that occur up until 31 August 2022 will be included in this season. The Portuguese, Spanish, French  and Belgian meteorological agencies will again collaborate too, joined by the Luxembourguish meteorological agency (South-western Group). This is the first season when Greece, Israel and Cyprus (Eastern Mediterranean group) name storms which affect their areas. This is also the first season for Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Malta (Central Mediterranean Group). <Summary> \c\cIn 2015, the Met Office and Met Éireann announced a pilot project to name storm warnings as part of the "Name our Storms" project for wind storms and asked the public for suggestions. The meteorological offices produced a full list of names for 2015–2016 through to 2017–2018, common to both the United Kingdom and Ireland, with the Netherlands taking part from 2019 onwards. Names in the United Kingdom will be based on the National Severe Weather Warning Service, when a storm is assessed to have the potential for an Amber (\'be prepared\') or Red (\'take action (danger to life)\') warning. <Background and naming> \c\cThere are two main naming lists: one created by the national meteorological agencies of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands, and another created by the equivalent agencies from France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg. Additionally, former Atlantic hurricanes will retain their names as assigned by the National Hurricane Center of the United States. <Background and naming> \c\cAlso, some of these storms may be of tropical origins. For example, ex-Hurricane Lorenzo of 2019 made landfall in Ireland and the United Kingdom. All details on tropical storms and hurricanes can be found on the National Hurricane Centre. <Background and naming> \c\cFrom the Autumn of 2021 the names issued by other meteorological services will also be included on the charts of the Berlin Wetterkarte and Free University of Berlin using the prefix "int." under the EUMETNET umbrella. <Background and naming> \c\cThe following names were chosen for the 2021–2022 season in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cThis will be the fifth year in which the meteorological agencies of France, Spain and Portugal will be naming storms that affect their areas. This naming scheme partially overlaps that used by the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands, as storms named by the other group of agencies will be used reciprocally. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cThis will be the first year in which the meteorological agencies of Greece, Israel and Cyprus will be naming storms that affect their areas. This naming scheme partially overlaps that used by the France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg, as storms named by the other group of agencies will be used reciprocally. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cThis will be the first year in which the meteorological agencies of Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Malta will be naming storms that affect their areas. Storms named by the other group of agencies will be used reciprocally. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cAll storms named by meteorological organisation in Europe from there respected forecasting areas. As well as, Atlantic hurricanes and storms that transitioned into a European windstorm and retained its name as assigned by the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida: <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cA depression formed on October 4 in the western Mediterranean and was named Christian by the Free University of Berlin. It was named Storm Athina by Hellenic National Meteorological Service on October 6 and intensified when it arrived in southern Italy on October 8. The system then passed into the Ionian Sea before dissipating on the 9th. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cIn central Italy, Athina caused record rainfall in Liguria with 496 mm in Savona in just 6 hours, breaking the record of 472 mm of November 2011. The main roads of the island of Corfu turned into rivers, the basements were flooded, power outages occurred, small landslides occurred and firefighter interventions were required with the storm front rains preceding the system. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cStorm Ballos has been named by Hellenic National Meteorological Service on 13 October, heavy rain and floods in Athens (Αθήνα) on October 15 and some of the islands have been reported. Heavy rain is predicted for 15. October in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace and a red alert with heavy rain and severe thunderstorms in North Aegean islands (meteoalarm). <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cA storm, named Hendrik by the Free University of Berlin on October 16, developed over the northern Atlantic Ocean. Another developing low South of Ireland was called Aurore by Meteo France on 20 October. Passing over the South of England the following night, Aurore generated very strong south-westerly winds and heavy rains from Brittany to the Grand Est in France, then central Europe as it merged with Hendrik over western Europe. An orange alert for wind has been issued by meteorological services in western Europe, and even red for parts of southern and eastern Germany. The system reached northern Russia on October 22 and disappeared in northern Siberia the next day. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cAurore/Hendrik brought widespread gusts of 100 to 120 km/h (62 to 75 mph; 54 to 65 kn) from northern France to eastern Germany and beyond, reaching speeds of 175 km/h (109 mph; 94 kn; 49 m/s) in Fecamp in Normandy. Fallen trees distrupted train service in several countries. Two tornadoes touched down in the Netherlands, in Brittany (France), 3 possible tornadoes have been reported in Plozévet, Riec-sur-Belon and  Kernascléden. and in Germany, another touched down near Kiel <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cFour people have been killed in Poland. Each one death were reported in Germany. and the United Kingdom. Around 250,000 clients lost electricity in France and 275,000 in the Czech Republic. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cCyclone Apollo was a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone that affected many countries on the Mediterranean coast, especially Italy and Libya. The storm killed at least 5 people and left 2 others missing due to flooding from the cyclone, in the countries of Tunisia, Algeria, Malta, and Italy, where the worst of the effects have been felt, especially on the island of Sicily. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cAround 22 October 2021, an area of organized thunderstorms formed near the Balearic Islands, with the disturbance becoming more organized and developing an area of low pressure around 24 October. On the next day, the low started to develop a low-level circulation center, and moved into the Tyrrhenian Sea. On 28 October, the system organized even further and intensified, which prompted forecast offices in Europe to name the low. Italy's "Servizio Meteorologico" named the storm Apollo (which was then adopted by the Free University of Berlin). On 29 October 2021, a ship in the Mediterranean Sea passed through Apollo and measured a peak wind speed of 104 km/h (65 mph; 56 kn)  and a pressure of 999.4 mb (29.51 inHg), indicating that Apollo is still strengthening. After Apollo made its closest approach to Sicily during the overnight hours of October 29, Apollo appeared to have begun to weaken as its convection waned and its low-level circulation became exposed on visible satellite imagery on 30 October 2021, on 31 October 2021, Apollo made landfall near Bayda and stayed inland until emerging over the Mediterranean a few hours later. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cThen, on 2 November, it dissipated off the coast of Turkey. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cHeavy rain from the cyclone and its precursor caused heavy rainfall and flooding in Tunisia, Algeria, Southern Italy, and Malta, killing 5 people and leaving 2 other people missing. The flooding was especially severe in the provinces of Catania and Siracusa, in Eastern Sicily. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cOn November 5, the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) started tracking a low near the Balearic Islands and named it Blas. An orange alert has been issued for these islands, for coastal phenomena and rain. The north of Catalonia was declared an Orange Zone, as strong winds blew inland from the Spanish Navarre and Aragon. Météo-France has also issued a yellow alert for Aude and Pyrénées-Orientales for wind, as well as Corsica for rain. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cAs the system stalled between Sardinia and the Balearic Islands on November 8, AEMET predicted a strengthening for the next two days and maintained its alerts. At 00:00 UTC on 11 November, the system was again very close to the Balearic Islands. After striking the islands again, the storm then slowly weakened while drifting back Southeastward. On 14 November, the cyclone turned northward, moving over Sardinia and Corsica, before curving back southwestward on 15 November and moving over Sardinia again, while restrengthening in the process. On 16 November, Blas turned eastward once again, passing just south of Sardinia and moving towards Italy, before dissipating over the Tyrrhenian Sea on 18 November. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cOn November 6, gusts of 75 km/h (47 mph; 40 kn) were recorded at Es Mercadal and 95 km/h (59 mph; 51 kn) at the lighthouse of Capdepera in the Balearic Islands where waves of 8 m (26 ft) hit the coast. Menorca was cut off from the world after the closure of the ports of Mahón and Ciutadella. On November 9 and 10, Blas again brought high winds and heavy rain to the Balearic Islands, causing at least 36 incidents, mostly flooding, landslides and blackouts. A crew member had to be rescued after his sailboat's mast broke, leaving the boat adrift 80 km (50 mi) West of Soller. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cOn November 6, a waterspout was reported in Melilla, a Spanish enclave on the coast of Morocco. In France, gusts of 140 km/h (87 mph; 76 kn) were noted on November7 at Cap Béar, as well as 111 km/h (69 mph; 60 kn) in Leucate and 100 km/h (62 mph; 54 kn) in Lézignan-Corbières. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cThe storm caused severe weather on the Algerian coast with exceptional rainfall. On November 9, a building collapsed in Algiers following torrential rains on the city, causing the deaths of three people. On November 11, the heavy rain continuing on Algiers caused another landslide on houses in the Raïs Hamidou neighborhood, causing the deaths of three other persons. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cFrom November 8 to 11, convective bands associated with the storm caused 3 deaths in Sicily. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cStorm Arwen was named by the Met Office on 25 November 2021. <Background and naming - Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands)> \c\cRed warnings for wind have been issued for north-eastern parts of the UK, as well as extensive orange and yellow warnings for much of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and most of England. Dangerous waves have also been forecasted, with likely disruption to ferry services. At 5pm GMT on 26 November, Network Rail closed the rail lines north of Berwick-upon-Tweed and LNER stopped running trains north of Newcastle. <Background and naming - South-western Group (France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg)> \c\cOn 23–24 September, a storm named "Tim" by the Free University of Berlin (FUB), caused the death of two people in Germany and Poland. <Background and naming - South-western Group (France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg)> \c\cIn early November 2021, the remnants of Atlantic Tropical Storm Wanda were absorbed into the cold front of a mid-latitude storm, called "Stephane" by the FUB, moving towards the United Kingdom and Ireland. On 9 November, Stephane affected the Northern European Countries and caused heavy snowfall and rainfall. <Background and naming - South-western Group (France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg)> \c\cOn 19 November, a storm called "Volker" by FUB moved across Poland killing one and injuring two. One person remains missing. <Background and naming - South-western Group (France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg)> \c\c
On November 30, 2021, a gunman opened fire on students at Oxford High School in the Detroit exurb of Oxford Township, Michigan, killing three students and injuring eight others, including one teacher. The suspected shooter is a 15-year-old sophomore student who is in custody. <Summary> \c\cAccording to students and parents, rumors regarding threats of a mass shooting occurring at Oxford High School were circulating before the incident occurred. Earlier that month, in an act of vandalism, a deer head had been thrown off the school roof, prompting school administrators to publish a note to parents, saying they had been investigating the rumors but found no threat. <Background> \c\cThe suspect reportedly used a semiautomatic handgun for the shooting. After the shooting occurred, the school went into lockdown. Some students were evacuated to a nearby Meijer store. <Shooting> \c\cAt 12:55 p.m. EST, police arrived at the school after receiving around 100 911 calls. The shooter was arrested unharmed. At a news conference, Oakland County undersheriff Michael McCabe said the gunman "gave up without any problems." <Shooting> \c\cThree students were killed, and eight other people were injured, including a teacher. <Aftermath> \c\cOn the evening of November 30, Undersheriff McCabe said two of the wounded people were in surgery, in unknown condition, while the remaining six were in stable condition. A 9 mm SIG Sauer SP2022 semiautomatic handgun was recovered from the suspect; Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said the suspect's father had purchased the gun four days prior to the shooting. Based on recovered shell casings found in the school, authorities believe around 15 to 20 shots were fired. <Aftermath> \c\cPresident Joe Biden and Representative Elissa Slotkin, whose district includes Oxford High School, both expressed their condolences over the shooting. Governor Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that she was "devastated for the students, staff, and families" of the school, calling gun violence a "public health crisis". <Responses> \c\c
The 2021 Semeru eruption began on 4 December on the Indonesian island of Java in the East Java province. Fourteen people have been killed, at least 102 more are wounded, while 10 are unaccounted for. <Summary> \c\cSemeru is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia. At 3,676 meters in elevation, it is the highest volcano on the island. The volcano is part of a chain of volcanic mountains stretching from northern Sumatra to the Lesser Sunda Islands. Volcanism in Indonesia is mainly associated with the offshore subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath the Sunda Plate. The oldest record of an eruption was from 1818. Since then, major eruptions have occurred in 1941, 1942, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955 – 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1977, and 1978-1989. A minor eruption occurred in January 2021 with no casualties reported. The December 4 eruption is part of a series of explosive eruptions on the volcano beginning in 2014. Recent eruptions on the volcano have been accompanied by pyroclastic flows, eruption columns, and debris avalanches. <Background> \c\cThe eruption began at 14:50 local time, ejecting a cloud of volcanic ash 40,000 feet (12,000 m) into the air. The eruption is thought to have begun when a lava dome at the summit crater collapsed due to intense precipitation. The collapsed dome triggered a pyroclastic flow that traveled down the slopes of the volcano. <Eruption> \c\cIn the Malang Regency, six sub districts were affected by ashfall. Eight villages and two sub districts in the Lumajang Regency were also affected. The destruction of the Gladak Perak Bridge sealed road vehicle access to villages in the area. Power interruptions and blackouts were triggered, affecting at least 30,253 people. In the Pronojiwo District of East Java, at least 30 homes were destroyed by lahars. Many village homes and vehicles in East Java were buried under heavy volcanic ash. An estimated 300 families were evacuated. <Impact> \c\cOn December 5, volcanic ash fell in the Pronojiwo District of Lumajang, forcing many evacuees, residents and aid officials to flee. It was reported that a smaller eruption had occurred. The small eruption caused panic at nearby villages. Some 28 schools in two districts; six in Candipuro and 22 in Pronojiwo were heavily damaged by ashfall. At least 11 villages in Lumajang were submerged in ash reaching up the roofs of homes. Many vehicles were also submerged. Kampung Renteng, a village in the Candipuro District, heavily affected by ash. At another village, ash had destroyed every home. <Impact> \c\cInitial reports confirmed three people; a store owner and two miners, missing when the Gladak Perak Bridge in Lumajang collapsed due to a lahar. Later in the evening of December 4, that number was revised to 10 by CNN Indonesia. According to the Indonesian Ministry of Health, one person was killed and 45 people were injured. All of the injured suffered burns caused by pyroclastic flows. Four burn victims were taken to the intensive care unit for their serious injuries. A total of 38 people were treated at the Penanggal Health Center. Another 10 miners at a sand mine in Renteng Village were trapped and an initial attempt to rescue the miners was unsuccessful. A subsequent report indicated differently.  According to the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB), ten miners thought to be missing at a sand mine in Lumajang were rescued. However, some number of sand miners are still unaccounted for. <Impact - Casualties> \c\cA second death was confirmed on the morning of December 5 at the Dr. Haryoto Hospital due to severe burns. The total death toll was later revised to 14, with many of the victims dead from burns. Two of the fatalities were from the Supiturang and Sumberwuluh villages respectively. Five other victims were from the Curah Kobokan village. Five bodies are undergoing the identification process at the Bhayangkara Hospital. The number of burn victims was also updated to 89 from the early morning figure of 57. <Impact - Casualties> \c\cLocal authorities have urged residents to keep a distance of at least 5 km away from the main summit crater as there are concerns of large pyroclastic flows. Individuals are prohibited from approaching 1 km or closer to the crater. The head of the BNPB had warned of increased volcanic activity and the presence of pyroclastic flows in the volcano. The head also said ashfall were occurring in some villages hence residents have been urged to evacuate. Residents were also told to keep clear from rivers originating from Semeru as they are transporting volcanic debris. <Response> \c\cBy Sunday, December 5, at least 5,205 people were affected, with 1,300 residents in Lumajang displaced. The displaced residents and took refuge in multiple locations. In the Pronojiwo District, some 305 people resided in schools and village halls. 409 people were displaced in the Candipuro District, and 188 in Pasirian. Some of the evacuees later moved to other homes or buildings. A rescue operation to locate several miners unaccounted for on the afternoon of the eruption is said to begin once activity on the volcano has decreased. The Deputy Regent of Lumajang said that rescue and recovery efforts could not be carried out the night before due to difficult access to the affected areas. The BNPB provided meals ready-to-eat packs, blankets, mattresses, masks and refugee tents in an effort to assist the displaced residents. Medical supplies, water and instant food were also supplied. It is estimated that 1,14 billion Indonesian rupiah was utilised in providing aid. <Response> \c\cOperations at the Yogyakarta International Airport, Adisumarmo International Airport and Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport were unaffected by the eruption as no volcanic ash were observed. <Response> \c\cIndonesian President Joko Widodo would visit the Lumajang Regency to lead the BNPB in the post-eruption recovery efforts on December 5. Meanwhile, Khofifah Indar Parawansa, the Governor of East Java, relocated her office to the Lumajang Regency to aid in the evacuation process of residents in the danger zone. <Response> \c\c
On 4 December 2021, a unit of 21 Para Special Forces, the special forces unit of the Indian Army, killed six civilians near Oting village of Mon district in Nagaland, India. Eight more civilians and a soldier were killed in subsequent violence. According to the Indian army, the killings resulted from a "case of mistaken identity" in a failed ambush. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to probe the incident. <Summary> \c\cThe incident sparked public outrage across the state in the following days. The killings were widely condemned with many calling to repeal and revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). <Summary> \c\cOn the evening of 4 December 2021 at around 4:00–5:00 p.m. IST, a unit of the 21 Para Special Forces of Indian Army ambushed a vehicle—carrying civilians from Oting village who were returning from a coal mine at Tiru—and opened fire. Six people died, and two received serious injuries. <Incidents - Ambush> \c\cIndian Army claims to have been the victim of an intelligence failure; they had suspected the vehicle to contain Naga insurgents. They further allege to have opened fire only when instructions to stop the vehicle were not paid heed to. <Incidents - Ambush> \c\cUpon hearing gunshots, as neighboring villagers arrived at the spot, a fresh round of violence broke out. Villagers claim that the forces were unwilling to hand over the bodies and trying to take them to their base camp. Three army vehicles were torched and in retaliatory firing, seven civilians were killed alongside a soldier. Another twelve civilians were seriously injured, while eight more sustained minor injuries. <Incidents - Retrieval of bodies> \c\cIndian Army claims to have opened fire under compulsion, as multiple infantrymen were injured in the melee. <Incidents - Retrieval of bodies> \c\cPublic protests were organised across Nagaland on 5 December 2021. More than two hundred people attacked and vandalised the army camp of Assam Rifles in Mon Town during which one more civilian was killed. <Incidents - Public protest> \c\cThe following day, the Government of Nagaland imposed Section 144 in Mon District restricting public assembly and movement as well as suspending mobile internet and bulk SMS services. <Aftermath> \c\cThe Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO) which represents six tribes withdrew from the ongoing annual Hornbill Festival at Kisama near Kohima. The Nagas hoisted black flags on all its Morungs at the festival while the Konyaks decided to abstain its cultural troupe from participating at the festival which was followed by the rest of the other Naga cultural troupes on 5 December. A two minutes silence was also observed at the venue on the same day. <Aftermath> \c\cLater that evening of 5 December, the people of Kohima observed a power blackout for 30 minutes to mourn the death of the civilians. The candlelight marches were organised in Kohima, Dimapur and other towns on the same day. A six-hour shutdown was also called by Naga Students\' Federation. <Aftermath> \c\cThe incident sparked public outrage in Nagaland and was widely condemned with many calling to repeal and revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). <Aftermath> \c\cOn 7 December, the Government of Nagaland announced that it would suspend all activities at Hornbill Festival and seek for the repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. <Aftermath> \c\cOn 6 December, the Nagaland Police had registered a First information report against the 21 Para Special Forces, bringing charges of first degree murder. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) was tasked to complete the investigation in a month. The National Human Rights Commission of India has sent notices to the Central and the State governments. <Investigation> \c\c
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus reached the UK in late January 2020. As of 6 December 2021, there had been 10,523,316 confirmed cases, the most in Europe and fourth highest number worldwide,  and 165,721 deaths among people who had recently tested positive. The UK has the world's 7th highest death toll and 28th highest death rate by population. In Europe, the UK has the second-highest death toll after Russia, and the 20th highest death rate. There has been some disparity between the outbreak's severity in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – health-care in the UK is a devolved matter. Each constituent country has its own publicly-funded healthcare system operated by devolved governments. <Summary> \c\cThe virus was known to have spread to the UK by early 2020. The country's response included a public information campaign and certain expansions to government powers, but was otherwise slow to introduce preventative measures, increase testing or prepare for an outbreak.  From March 2020 onwards, the government introduced restrictions across the UK on aspects of life such as people's freedom of movement, education, and leisure activities. Police were empowered to enforce the measures, and the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave all four governments emergency powers not used since the Second World War. These restrictions were eased and tightened periodically, and there was some variance in restrictions between the four countries of the UK and more localised rules were also introduced. In the early days of the pandemic, the health services worked to raise hospital capacity and set up temporary critical care hospitals, but faced shortages of personal protective equipment. In late 2020, a new more infectious variant of the virus emerged in the UK, causing another wave in infections over the winter that was deadlier than the first. The country's vaccination programme was the first to start in December 2020 and was in early 2021 one of the fastest in the world. The highly transmissible Delta variant arrived in the UK and drove a third wave of infections in mid-2021 that increased into the autumn, although high vaccination rates led to a substantially lower mortality rate than previous waves. In late 2021, the Omicron variant arrived in the UK and drove a further increase in cases. <Summary> \c\cIn addition to the major strain on the UK's healthcare service and a substantial fall in life expectancy, the pandemic has had a severe impact on the UK's economy, caused major disruptions to education and had far-reaching impacts on society. <Summary> \c\cOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. <Background> \c\cGenetic sequencing has traced most COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom to imported cases from Italy, France, and Spain, rather than directly from China. <Background> \c\cThough later reporting indicated that there may have been some cases dating from late 2019, COVID-19 was confirmed to be spreading in the UK by the end of January 2020 with the first confirmed deaths in March. The country was initially relatively slow in implementing restrictions. Subsequent epidemiological analysis showed that over 1000 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 entered the UK in early 2020 from international travellers, mostly from outbreaks elsewhere in Europe, leading to numerous clusters that overwhelmed contact tracing efforts. A legally enforced Stay at Home Order, or lockdown, was introduced on 23 March. Restrictions were steadily eased across the UK in late spring and early summer that year. The UK's epidemic in early 2020 was at the time one of the largest and deadliest worldwide. <History> \c\cBy the Autumn, COVID-19 cases were again rising. This lead to the creation of new regulations along with the introduction of localised restrictions. Larger lockdowns took place in all of Wales, England and Northern Ireland later that season. A new variant of the virus is thought to have originated in Kent around September 2020. Once restrictions were lifted, the novel variant rapidly spread across the UK. Its increased transmissibility contributed to a continued increase in daily infections. The healthcare system had come under severe strain by late December which led to further restrictions being introduced across all of the UK. <History> \c\cThe first COVID-19 vaccine was approved and began being deployed across the UK in early December, 15 million vaccine doses had been given to predominantly those most vulnerable to the virus by mid-February. 6 months later more than 75% of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Quarantine rules for incoming travellers were introduced in late January. Restrictions began to ease from late February onwards and almost all had ended in Great Britain by August. A third wave of daily infections began in July 2021 due to the arrival and rapid spread of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. However, mass vaccination continued to keep deaths and hospitalisations at much lower levels than in previous waves. Infection rates remained high and hospitalisations and deaths rose into the autumn. The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was confirmed to have arrived and begun spreading in the community in early December, driving a further increase in cases that surpassed previous records. <History> \c\cThe COVID-19 pandemic led to the largest fall in life expectancy in England since records began in 1981. On average, British COVID-19 victims lost around a decade of life; the last time deaths rose so sharply in the UK was during World War II. In 2020, the disease was the leading cause of death among men, and second leading cause among women. Research suggests over 1 million people in the UK have had Long COVID, with the majority reporting substantial impacts on day to day life. The pandemic's major impact on the country's healthcare system, leading to long waiting lists for medical procedures and ambulances, also led to an indirect increase in deaths from other conditions. The lockdown also had a major mental health impact. <History> \c\cIn August 2021, a report from Age UK found that 27% of people over 60 could not walk as far and 25% were living in more physical pain earlier this year compared to the start of the pandemic. 54% of older people felt less confident attending a hospital appointment, and 37% of older people felt less confident going to a GP surgery. <History> \c\cThe pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy of the United Kingdom, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. Some temporary shutdowns became permanent; some people who were furloughed were later made redundant. The economic disruption has had a significant impact on people's mental health—with particular damage to the mental health of foreign-born men whose work hours have been reduced/eliminated. <History> \c\cThe pandemic has had far-reaching consequences in the country that go beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it, including political, cultural, and social implications. <Responses - Government response> \c\cSophie Grégoire Trudeau, the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, tested positive for COVID-19 upon her return from WE Day events in the UK; on 12 March 2020 the Trudeau family entered two weeks of self-isolation. The first patient in Mauritius was a 59-year-old man who returned from the United Kingdom on 7 March 2020. When he arrived in Mauritius, the Mauritian had no symptoms. Other cases of the novel coronavirus resulting from travel to the UK were subsequently reported in India and Nigeria. <Responses - Government response> \c\cOn 16 June 2020, it was widely reported in British media that New Zealand's first COVID-19 cases in 24 days were diagnosed in two British women, both of whom had travelled from the UK and were given special permission to visit a dying parent. The women had entered the country on 7 June, after first flying into Doha and Brisbane. <Responses - Government response> \c\cA 2021 study suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant which was first detected in Kent is thought to have began its spread to many countries internationally from flights originating in London in late 2020. <Responses - Government response> \c\cReports from the Medical Research Council's Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London have been providing mathematically calculated estimates of cases and case fatality rates. In February 2020, the team at Imperial College, led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, estimated about two-thirds of cases in travellers from China were not detected and that some of these may have begun "chains of transmission within the countries they entered". They forecast that the new type of coronavirus could infect up to 60% of the UK's population, in the worst-case scenario. <Impacts - Health and life expectancy> \c\cIn a paper on 16 March, the Imperial College team provided detailed forecasts of the potential impacts of the epidemic in the UK and US. It detailed the potential outcomes of an array of \'non-pharmaceutical interventions\'. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point, government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed. On 16 March, the Prime Minister announced changes to government advice, extending self-isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future. A paper on 30 March by the Imperial College group estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000. This paper and others relied on data from European countries including the UK to estimate that the combined non-pharmaceutical interventions reduced the reproduction number of the virus by 67-87%, enough to stop infections from growing. However, followup work concluded that the effectiveness of interventions was lower in later waves of infections. <Impacts - Health and life expectancy> \c\cIn April 2020, biostatistician Professor Sheila Bird said the delay in the reporting of deaths from the virus meant there was a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend. <Impacts - Economic> \c\cIn December 2021 scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that Omicron could cause from 25,000 to 75,000 deaths in England over the five months to April unless there are more stringent restrictions.  Omicron will probably be the dominant  variant by the end December. <Impacts - Social> \c\c
A by-election for the House of Commons constituency of North Shropshire, in the West Midlands, was held on 16 December 2021. It was triggered by the resignation of the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Owen Paterson on 4 November 2021. In a massive upset, the Liberal Democrats candidate Helen Morgan won the election with a 34.1% swing. The swing was the 7th largest in United Kingdom by-election history, and the constituency had been held by the Conservatives for nearly 200 years. <Summary> \c\cNorth Shropshire is the third-largest constituency by area in the West Midlands region. It contains five small towns: Wem, Whitchurch, Ellesmere, Oswestry and Market Drayton. Sixty per cent of constituents who turned out voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 EU referendum. <Background - Constituency> \c\cThe last time a by-election was held in the area was the 1904 Oswestry by-election, in which there was a Liberal gain from Conservative. <Background - Constituency> \c\cOn 4 November 2021, Owen Paterson resigned as MP for the constituency. In October, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found that he had breached paid advocacy rules in relation to two companies which employed him as a paid consultant. The Commons Standards Committee considered the commissioners\' findings and recommended that Paterson be suspended from parliament for 30 days. In line with the established process, on 3 November a motion was proposed in the Commons inviting MPs to approve the punishment. If the suspension had been approved, a recall petition would have been triggered in the constituency. <Background - Reason> \c\cPaterson denied any wrongdoing. An amendment to the motion was put forward by Conservative backbencher Andrea Leadsom to postpone consideration of Paterson's suspension and to set up a new committee to investigate the disciplinary process for MPs. The government of Boris Johnson supported the amendment and issued a three-line whip. The amendment was passed. The outcome caused outrage among opposition MPs, and an angry public reaction to press reports. As a result, on 4 November, the government reversed its position and announced that a vote would still take place on whether Paterson should be suspended. Following that decision, Paterson announced his intention to resign from parliament. <Background - Reason> \c\cHe was appointed as Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead on 5 November, the process by which an MP's resignation is effected.  The writ of election was moved by Conservative Chief Whip Mark Spencer on 9 November. The by-election took place on 16 December. <Background - Reason> \c\cThere were 14 candidates in the by-election. <Candidates> \c\cOn 4 November, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party had discussions about possibly standing aside in the by-election and backing a joint independent "anti-sleaze" candidate. This had previously happened in the seat of Tatton at the 1997 general election where independent candidate Martin Bell beat Neil Hamilton. Bell was approached by the Liberal Democrats ahead of the by-election in North Shropshire, but declined to stand. Labour, and subsequently the Liberal Democrats, announced that they would be standing their own candidates. <Candidates> \c\cOn 6 November, Reform UK announced their candidate as Kirsty Walmsley, who was previously a councillor on Shropshire Council for the Conservative Party, which her father Keith Barrow led on the Council. Walmsley said, "I would never had  [sic] stood against Owen Paterson. He is a man of integrity who had worked hard for North Shropshire." <Candidates> \c\cOn 13 November, the Conservatives picked their candidate, Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, from a three-person shortlist. Shastri-Hurst is a barrister, former British Army Medical Officer and honorary NHS consultant. His links to the constituency relate to his time training at Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital near Oswestry and a period stationed at the Tern Hill barracks near Market Drayton. Also on the shortlist were local Shropshire Councillor for Worfield (in Ludlow constituency), Richard Marshall and Birmingham City Councillor Charlotte Hodivala. <Candidates> \c\cThe Shropshire Star reported Labour's shortlist for the candidacy included David Hallam (previously Herefordshire and Shropshire MEP), Kuldip Sahota (former Telford & Wrekin Council leader, who actually did not apply) and Graeme Currie (Labour candidate for North Shropshire at the 2019 general election). On 14 November, the Labour Party announced their candidate to be Ben Wood from Oswestry. Graeme Currie, the Labour candidate in the seat in the 2019 general election, was blocked from the party's shortlist of candidates and said he would resign from the party in response. <Candidates> \c\cThe Shropshire Star reported on 11 November that the Liberal Democrats had approached Martin Bell to stand as their candidate. Bell reportedly declined citing age and the size of the Conservative majority. Former Ludlow MP Matthew Green and Shropshire County Councillor Alex Wagner were also reported as potential candidates. On 16 November, the Liberal Democrats announced that Helen Morgan, who contested the seat in the 2019 general election, had been re-selected. Morgan is a chartered accountant who was born and raised in the rural West Midlands and has lived in North Shropshire since 2014. <Candidates> \c\cThe Green candidate was Duncan Kerr, who stood in the constituency for the party in the 2015 and 2017 general elections, but not in 2019. <Candidates> \c\cYolande Kenward stood on an anti-corruption platform as an independent, although she was shown on the ballot paper with no label. The other independent, Suzie Akers-Smith, is a independent councillor on Cheshire East Council and the local authority's Cycling and Walking Champion. <Candidates> \c\cDrew Galdron, under the name Boris Been-Bunged, a Boris Johnson impersonator, stood for the Rejoin EU Party. <Candidates> \c\cMonaco-based Russell Dean, a consultant for a yacht broker who grew up in Shropshire, stood for The Party Party. <Candidates> \c\cHard eurosceptic minor party candidates were: UKIP's Andrea Allen, a former modern languages teacher and the party's parish councillor and chair of the Whitchurch Town Twinning Association; the Reclaim Party's Martin Daubney who represented the West Midlands in the European Parliament between 2019 and 2020 while a member of the Brexit Party; and Heritage's James Elliot, an electrical contractor.\t\t\t <Candidates> \c\cThe Monster Raving Loony party fielded its party leader Alan "Howling Laud" Hope. <Candidates> \c\cThe anti-lockdown Freedom Alliance fielded Earl Jesse as its candidate. <Candidates> \c\cAn editorial in The Guardian newspaper suggested that tactical voting for the Liberal Democrats be employed by the electorate to try to reduce the Conservative majority in the seat, saying "Labour voters ought to set aside their tribal loyalty and back the Lib Dem candidate". <Candidates - Endorsements> \c\cSarah Biffen, the widow of John Biffen, the former Conservative MP for the area, endorsed the Conservative candidate, Shastri-Hurst, comparing his background in the NHS and the Army with that of her late husband, a former cabinet minister who represented the area now covered by the North Shropshire constituency from 1961 until 1997. <Candidates - Endorsements> \c\cWill Hutton, former editor of The Observer, endorsed the Liberal Democrats and called on Labour and Green Party supporters to "put aside their prime party affiliation and back the Lib Dem candidate". Martin Fletcher, former associate editor and foreign editor of The Times, endorsed the Liberal Democrats, specifically calling on Conservative voters to back Morgan with the aim of ending Boris Johnson's leadership of the Conservative Party. <Candidates - Endorsements> \c\cSeveral[which?] candidates are running on an anti-corruption ticket; others are using it in their campaign material, including Labour's. Several local issues have also featured in the campaign, including local funding. Katy Balls in The Spectator analysed the effect that the variety of problems currently facing the government, and impacting Boris Johnson's popularity (which include tax rises, English Channel migrant crossings and the controversy surrounding the resignation of Paterson, the former MP of the constituency), might have on the election result. She said that a Lib Dem source commented that "Peppa Pig has come up more than sleaze" and that local issues such as the ambulance services, and questions over the Tory candidate being based in Birmingham were being raised by electors. <Campaign> \c\cThe Financial Times reported that Labour strategists regarded North Shropshire inhospitable for their party and not worth spending resources on. One Labour strategist suggests the Liberal Democrats stood a better chance in the seat, saying: "the Lib Dems have focused on Shropshire North and they\'ll probably end up a good second there. They came second in the recent local elections — from their perspective it makes sense for them to concentrate their resources there." Labour finished second in the constituency at the 2019 United Kingdom general election. Ian Dunt, writing in the i, suggested that despite standing a candidate "[Labour] seems to be standing aside for Davey so the Lib Dems can monopolise the anti-government vote" as part of an informal Labour-Lib Dem pact, where one party stands aside to give the other a higher chance of beating the Conservative candidate. The Guardian reported that Labour's Shadow Minister for International Development Yasmin Qureshi "effectively acknowledged the party had deliberately left the field clear for the Lib Dems", after she told Times Radio that "Labour are never going to win North Shropshire. The Lib Dems do have an opportunity to do so." <Campaign> \c\cIn the wake of the Downing Street Christmas party controversy which broke on 7 December, The Guardian reported that opinion in the constituency was divided, and voter apathy had risen. <Campaign> \c\cA poll of postal voters by the Liberal Democrats, reported on 2 December, put them in second place, with both the Conservative and Labour vote shares falling relative to the 2019 general election. A polling analyst has said that these results should be treated "with a pinch of salt" because the polling methodology was not published. The Liberal Democrats\' poll was contradicted by David Hallam, former Labour MEP for Herefordshire and Shropshire, who said an internal polling, reported on 7 December, put Labour in second place behind the Conservatives.[better source needed] On 11 December The Observer reported that an internal memo to Liberal Democrat staff stated that the Conservatives were only one percentage point ahead of the Liberal Democrats. <Campaign> \c\cIn response to comments by the Conservative Home Secretary, Priti Patel, about the expulsion of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, the Liberal Democrat candidate, Helen Morgan, compared Patel with Hitler's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels. Morgan later apologised for the "insensitive tweet which I have taken down". According to the Shropshire Star, Morgan had already apologised a few days earlier for comments from 2020 in which she "appeared to liken Channel migrants to Jews held at Auschwitz". <Campaign> \c\cDuring the campaign, a sitting Conservative Councillor in the constituency, Anthony Allen, announced that he was defecting from the Conservative Party, saying they "were not Conservative enough", and joined the Reclaim Party. A second sitting Conservative councillor defected to Reform UK. <Campaign> \c\cLocal newspaper the Shropshire Star reported on 8 December that bookmakers are divided over whether the Conservative or the Liberal Democrat candidate are the favourite to win the by-election, following controversy over a reported Christmas party at 10 Downing Street that may have broken the Covid-19 lockdown rules in place at the time. The newspaper stated that, other than the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, "No other party has been seen as a likely challenger to the seat". By 11 December The Independent reported that the Liberal Democrats were favourites with every major bookmaker. They also reported that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, and poor weather conditions may affect the turnout. <Campaign> \c\cOn 13 December it was reported that Reform Party candidate Kirsty Walmsley had tested positive for Coronavirus, and would therefore miss out on the last few days of the campaign as well as the vote count. <Campaign> \c\c
On 20 December 2021, a cargo ship illegally carrying 130 passengers sank off the northeast coast of Madagascar. It is thought that a hole in the hull caused the engine room to flood, leaving the vessel vulnerable to wave action. At least 85 people died during the accident. <Summary> \c\cThe Francia, a 12-metre (39 ft) -long wooden vessel, was a cargo ship that had illegally taken on 130 passengers for a journey from Antanambe (which is not registered as an official port) to Soanierana Ivongo, a journey of some 100 kilometres (62 mi).  Including crew, 138 people were onboard. The vessel sank late on 20 December 2021 after its engine was flooded, leaving it exposed to the action of waves.  The flooding was caused by a hole in the ship's hull. <Wreck> \c\cMadagascan police minister Serge Gellé was flown to the site of the shipwreck on 21 December.  His helicopter crashed and he was one of two surviving passengers (the other was Chief Warrant Officer Jimmy Laitsara).  The survivors separately reached land at Mahambo. Gellé used a seat from the helicopter as a flotation device during his twelve-hour overnight swim to safety.  Gellé swam to within 500 metres (1,600 ft) of the shore but the waves prevented him from reaching land.  He was spotted by a fisherman, whose canoe was too small to accommodate them both. The fisherman returned two hours later with a larger canoe and brought Gellé to dry land.  The body of one of the helicopter's occupants, a police colonel, was later recovered; the pilot remains missing. <Aftermath - Helicopter crash> \c\cA separate helicopter carried the prime minister, Christian Ntsay, and minister of national defence, General Léon Richard Rakotonirina, to the site of the shipwreck. <Aftermath - Helicopter crash> \c\cA force of Madagascan gendarmes was sent to the site and an investigation into the sinking started by the Madagascan government.  Three vessels from the Madagascan navy and maritime agency assisted in the search for survivors.  By 22 December, 64 bodies had been recovered, with around 24 people missing and around 50 survivors rescued.  The following day the Madagascan Maritime and Port Agency announced that the confirmed death toll had increased to 85, with three persons missing. <Aftermath - Responses> \c\cMadagascan president Andry Rajoelina paid tribute to those who died in the shipwreck and helicopter crash.  The graveyard of Soanierana-Ivongo was too small to accommodate all the bodies recovered so some were sent to nearby villages for burial."} <Aftermath - Responses> \c\c
The COVID-19 pandemic in South Australia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). <Summary> \c\cOn 11 March, the SA state government announced its A$350 million economic stimulus measures. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 15 March, a public health emergency was declared in South Australia. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 22 March, a "major emergency" was declared, giving the police power to enforce self-isolation rules. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 24 March, state borders were closed. People arriving in the state were required to sign a declaration that they would self-isolate for 14 days and provide an address to the police, with penalties for failure to comply. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 27 March, a direction was made under the Emergency Management Act 2004 to prohibit gatherings of more than 10 people, and a limit of 1 person per four square metres. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 8 November the SA government announced that in the state budget it would double it's coronavirus economic stimulus package to AU$4 billion. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 16 November, "a number of significant restrictions" were reintroduced after an outbreak of coronavirus in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 17 November, a six-day lockdown from midnight that day was announced. Afterwards there was to be another eight days of "significant restrictions" according to Police Commissioner Grant Stevens. On 21 November, Premier Steven Marshall announced that the state's "circuit breaker" restrictions would be ending three days earlier on 21 November after authorities discovered that one of the positive cases at the Woodville Pizza Bar coronavirus hotspot had misled contact tracers by concealing the fact that he worked at the shop. As part of the easing of "circuit breaker restrictions", groups of 50 people were allowed to attend private functions and funerals, ten people to attend private functions, and 100 people allowed to attend restaurants and pubs. <Timeline - Woodville outbreak> \c\cOn 12 February 2021, the World Solar Challenge (SWC) for that year was cancelled by the SA Government. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cOn 5 March 2021, the first Australian received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. A doctor in regional South Australia, she was dosed at Murray Bridge Hospital. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cOn 30 April, South Australia's first COVID-19 mass vaccination hub opened at Adelaide Showground. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cIn mid-June, sniffer dogs were deployed on a trial basis at Adelaide Airport to detect people with COVID-19 infections. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cDue to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, on 23 June South Australia "immediately" reinstated a hard border with NSW. No one who had been in NSW in the past 14 days was allowed entry to SA. A border buffer of 100 km was in place. Exemption were available for residents returning to SA, essential travellers, and special cases. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cOn 28 June, from midnight, SA pre-emptively re-introduced a number of restrictions for at least 7 days: <Timeline - 2021> \c\cmasks mandatory in high-risk settings <Timeline - 2021> \c\caged care homes, <Timeline - 2021> \c\chospitals and other "personal care settings" <Timeline - 2021> \c\cindoor entertainment venues <Timeline - 2021> \c\cnot required, but highly recommended on public transport <Timeline - 2021> \c\cIn licensed premises: <Timeline - 2021> \c\cno "communal consumption" <Timeline - 2021> \c\cno buffets <Timeline - 2021> \c\crestrictions on sheisha venues <Timeline - 2021> \c\cSome restriction on singing. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cOn 11 July, a 72-year-old woman with thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) died in Royal Adelaide Hospital.

This was after a 5 case cluster of the Delta variant emerged linked to Modbury Hospital. By this date, approximately 3,000 people were in quarantine at home. The only reasons to leave home were: <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\cessential work <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\ccare for someone <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\cpurchase essential goods-food, <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\cexercise <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\conly with people from the same household <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\cwithin 2.5 kilometres of home <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\c90 minutes per day maximum <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\chealthcare (including vaccination and COVID testing) <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\celective surgery on hold <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\cSchools to close from 21 July <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\c24-hour transition period for teachers to arrange at-home learning <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\cconstruction work to be halted. <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\cThe lockdown led to panic buying, and the cancellations of AVCon, the Royal Adelaide Show, the Adelaide Beer and Barbeque Festival, Winter Reds wine festival and the Illuminate Adelaide arts festival. The reopening of the Gawler railway line, originally set for November 2021, was also delayed to early 2022. <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\cThe lockdown ended on 27 July. <Timeline - Lockdown> \c\cOn 23 November, after the state hit 80% vaccination coverage for 16 and older, it opened its borders to the rest of the country, including New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. This signalled a change from an elimination strategy to a suppression strategy in controlling the virus. <Timeline - Suppression Phase> \c\cOn 1 December, the state recorded its first two cases of community transmission since the borders opened, two men aged in their 50s. The next day on 2 December, it recorded another 18 new cases, 16 linked to a high school reunion in Norwood, Adelaide. The cases included former premier Jay Weatherill. <Timeline - Suppression Phase> \c\cOn December 10, the Omicron variant was detected in two interstate travellers that came to South Australia. As a result, there were changes to the rules; travellers coming to SA from New South Wales and Victoria were now required to be tested on day 6 as well as on arrival. Several high-risk exposure sites were listed, where anyone who entered had to quarantine for 14 days. These restrictions were eased on December 14 and 15 respectively. <Timeline - Omicron Variant> \c\cOn December 26, after a week of exponentially rising case numbers, with over 80 percent believed to be caused by the Omicron variant, the government introduced new restrictions. These included home gathering caps reduced from 30 to 10 people, and hospitality venues would have to reduce capacity to 25% indoors and 50% outdoors. Citizens were asked to reduce travel around the state, as health authorities were concerned about the variants ability to overwhelm the health system. <Timeline - Omicron Variant> \c\cSouth Australian National Football League men's and women's games will not be held in front of a crowd from 14 March 2020. <Event cancellations> \c\cBasketball South Australia decided jointly with the National Basketball League to postpone NBL1 Central games till at least 18 April 2020. <Event cancellations> \c\cRowing South Australia cancelled the South Australian portion of Head of the River in March 2020. <Event cancellations> \c\cThe Royal Adelaide Show for 2020 was announced as cancelled in April 2020.

Beginning on 24 December 2021, record rainfall across the northeastern Brazilian state Bahia has resulted in severe floods. At least 20 people were killed, while 280 were injured and more than 35,000 were displaced. In a tweet, Rui Costa, the Governor of Bahia, has declared the floods to be "the worst disaster that has ever occurred in the history of Bahia". 72 municipalities of Bahia have declared a state of emergency. <Summary> \c\cTotal rainfall at the state capital Salvador during December has exceeded 250 millimetres (9.8 inches) on 24 December, five times the historic average. On 26 December, the Bahia state government and Brazilian federal government, along with cooperation from other state governments, have mounted a joint rescue operation to victims at the affected areas. Two dams have collapsed between 25 and 26 December, at Jussiape and Itambe respectively. The town of Vitória da Conquista was heavily affected. <Summary> \c\cSouthern Bahia had been badly flooded earlier the same month by Subtropical Storm Ubá. <Summary> \c\c
Cyberwarfare is a part of Iran's "soft war" military strategy. Being both a victim and wager of cyberwarfare, Iran is considered an emerging military power in the field. <Summary> \c\cSince November 2010, an organization called "The Cyber Defense Command" (Persian: قرارگاه دفاع سایبری; Gharargah-e Defa-e Saiberi) has been operating in Iran under the supervision of the country's "Passive Civil Defense Organization" (Persian: سازمان پدافند غیرعامل; Sazeman-e Padafand-e Gheyr-e Amel) which is itself a subdivision of the Joint Staff of Iranian Armed Forces. <Summary> \c\cAccording to a 2014 report by Institute for National Security Studies, Iran is "one of the most active players in the international cyber arena". In 2013, a Revolutionary Guards general stated that Iran has "the 4th biggest cyber power among the world's cyber armies." <Summary> \c\cAccording to a 2021 report by a cyber-security company, "Iran is running two surveillance operations in cyber-space, targeting more than 1,000 dissidents". <Summary> \c\cIranian cyber defense system - digital fortress part of national information network (national internet) - is developed for thwarting and attacks and  engage attackers. <NIN> \c\cIn June 2010, Iran was the victim of a cyber-attack when its nuclear facility in Natanz was infiltrated by the cyber-worm \'Stuxnet\'. Reportedly a combined effort by the United States and Israel, Stuxnet destroyed perhaps over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges and, according to a Business Insider article, "[set] Tehran's atomic programme back by at least two years." The worm spread beyond the plant to allegedly infect over 60,000 computers, but the government of Iran indicates it caused no significant damage. Iran crowdsourced solutions to the worm and is purportedly now better positioned in terms of cyber warfare technology. No government has claimed responsibility for the worm. The cyber-worm was also used against North Korea.[citation needed] <Attacks against Iran> \c\cIn October 2013, media reported Mojtaba Ahmadi, who served as commander of the "Cyber War Headquarters" was found dead wounded by bullets in Karaj. <Attacks against Iran - Events> \c\c November 2018: The Iranian telecommunication minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi accuses Israel of a failed cyberattack on its telecommunications infrastructure, and vows to respond with legal action. <Attacks against Iran - Events> \c\cIranian fuel 2021 cyberstrike <Attacks against Iran - Events> \c\cThe Iranian government has been accused by western analysts of its own cyber-attacks against the United States, Israel and Persian Gulf Arab countries, but deny this, including specific allegations of 2012 involvement in hacking into American banks. The conflict between Iran and the United States has been called "history's first known cyber-war" by Michael Joseph Gross mid-2013. <Attacks by Iran> \c\c August 2014: An IDF official told press in that Iran has launched numerous significant attacks against Israel's Internet infrastructure. <Attacks by Iran - Events> \c\c 31 March 2015: There was a massive power outage for 12 hours in 44 of 81 provinces of Turkey, holding 40 million people. Istanbul and Ankara were among the places suffering blackout. According to Observer.com, Iranian hackers, possibly Iranian Cyber Army, were behind the power outage. <Attacks by Iran - Events> \c\c June 2017: The Daily Telegraph reported that intelligence officials concluded that Iran was responsible for a cyberattack on the British Parliament lasting 12 hours that compromised around 90 email accounts of MPs. The motive for the attack is unknown but experts suggested that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps could be using cyberwarfare to undermine the Iran nuclear deal. <Attacks by Iran - Events> \c\c January 2022: The website of Israel's Jerusalem Post newspaper is hacked by suspected Iranian hackers. The website's content was replaced with a threat to target the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center, and an apparent reference to Qasem Soleimani who was assassinated exactly two years earlier in Baghdad, Iraq. <Attacks by Iran - Events> \c\cOn May 5, 2020, Reuters reported, quoting a monthly Facebook report, that Iranian state-run media had targeted hundreds of fake social media accounts to covertly spread pro-Iranian messaging, online since at least 2011, for secretly broadcasting online promotional messages in favor of Iran in order targeting voters in countries including Britain and the United States. Accounts suspended for coordinated inauthentic behavior, which removed eight networks in recent weeks, including one with links to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting. <Suspended Iranian accounts> \c\c
In the morning of January 9, 2022, a fire tore through an apartment building in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx.

The 2021–22 Russo-Ukrainian crisis is an ongoing military confrontation and international crisis between Russia and Ukraine that started in late October 2021. The crisis has caused international tension, also involving the United States, NATO, the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States. <Summary> \c\cThe aggravation of Russian-Ukrainian relations occurred in late October – early November and was provoked by the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations. The message about the use of UAVs appeared almost simultaneously with the news about the occupation of the village of Staromarievka on the contact line of the parties, in which 37 Russian citizens who received passports under the simplified program live. <Background> \c\cSpeaking at a defence-related meeting on 2 November, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia was closely monitoring the use of UAVs "near the borders of Russia" and should carefully analyze the situation in this regard. According to OSCE observers, the ceasefire regime began to be violated twice as often as in 2020 (during the period from the evening of 29 October to the evening of 31 October, the ceasefire regime in the Donetsk region was violated 988 times, and in Luhansk — 471). OSCE SMM observers reported on the movement of military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as repeated attempts to muffle the signal of its UAVs, which are used to monitor the terrain. At the same time, publications appeared in the Western media that Russia was again pulling troops to the Ukrainian border. Satellite photos of Russian armoured vehicles were cited as evidence. <Background> \c\cOn 2–3 November, the head of the CIA, William Burns, came to Moscow and met with senior Russian intelligence officials there. According to CNN, the purpose of the trip was to convey to the Kremlin Joe Biden's concern about the situation on the border with Ukraine. Sources of the TV channel reported that after the trip, Burns spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to ease tensions between Moscow and Kyiv. For the same purpose, a high-ranking official of the US State Department was sent to Ukraine on 4 November. <Background> \c\cThe military aggravation was accompanied by aggravation in the Ukrainian political field. On 2 November, Dmytro Yarosh, the former leader of the Right Sector organization, was appointed adviser to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny. On 4 November, a new defence minister was approved — former Deputy Prime Minister – Minister for the Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Oleksii Reznikov, who participated in the meetings of the Trilateral Contact Group on behalf of Ukraine. <Background> \c\cIn November 2021, the Russian Defense Ministry described the deployment of the U.S. warships to the Black Sea as a "threat to regional security and strategic stability." The ministry said in a statement, "The real goal behind the U.S. activities in the Black Sea region is exploring the theatre of operations in case Kyiv attempts to settle the conflict in the southeast by force." <Background> \c\cOn 13 November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Russia has again amassed 100,000 troops in the border area. In early November, reports of Russian military buildups prompted U.S. officials to warn the EU that Russia could be planning a potential invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied allegations that Russia is preparing for a possible invasion of Ukraine. He accused Ukraine of "planning aggressive actions against Donbass." Peskov urged NATO to stop "concentrating a military fist" near Russia's borders and to stop arming Ukraine with modern weapons. <Background> \c\cOn 16 November, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on the West to send Russia "a clear signal calling for reducing tension, avoiding any escalation in and around Ukraine." Stoltenberg added that the alliance records an "unusual concentration" of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border. On 15 November, Acting German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian expressed concern in a joint communique about "the movements of Russian forces and military equipment near Ukraine," calling on both sides to "show restraint." At the same time, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby confirmed that the United States continues to observe "unusual military activity" of the Russian Federation near the borders of Ukraine, and the head of the State Department Antony Blinken discussed reports of "Russian military activity" in the area with Jean-Yves Le Drian. It was reported that the United States is discussing sanctions with European allies in case of further Russian invasion <Diplomatic response> \c\cBack in early November, Ukrainian intelligence stated that information about the transfer of additional Russian troops to the Ukrainian borders was nothing more than "an element of psychological pressure." However, a week later, the Office of the President of Ukraine recognized that the Russian Federation was strengthening "specific groups of troops" near the border. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Paris and Berlin to prepare for a possible military scenario of Russia's actions in the Ukrainian direction. <Diplomatic response> \c\cAgainst this background, Ukraine has sharply intensified diplomatic efforts. On 15 November, Volodymyr Zelensky and the head of the European Council Charles Michel discussed "the security situation along the borders of Ukraine." On the same day, Dmytro Kuleba held talks on the same issues in Brussels. The new head of the Defense Ministry, Oleksii Rezikov, went to Washington, where on 18 November he met with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. On 16 November, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace visited Kyiv. According to the tabloid Daily Mirror, a consolidated rapid response unit of about 600 fighters has been formed in the UK for transfer to Ukraine. <Diplomatic response> \c\cOn 28 December, U.S. and Russia announced bilateral talks would take place in Geneva on 10 January 2022, to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and to confront rising tensions over Ukraine. The talks would be led by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Wendy Sherman. <Security talks (January 2022)> \c\cIn addition to the Geneva talks, it was announced that Russia would hold talks with NATO in Brussels on 12 January 2022. On 13 January 2022, a broader meeting involving the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would take place in Vienna. <Security talks (January 2022)> \c\cOn 21 November, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, reported that Russia allegedly concentrated more than 92,000 troops and Iskander short-range ballistic missile systems near the Ukrainian borders. Budanov said that Russia is behind the protests against vaccination against COVID-19 in Kyiv and other protest rallies in Ukraine – this is a preparation for a large-scale military invasion. According to Budanov, Russia needs the protests so that the Ukrainian population does not resist it during the military operation, believing that the Ukrainian authorities have betrayed it: "They want to organize rallies and protests to show that people are against the government," he said in an interview with Military Times."They are trying to prove that our government is betraying the people." According to the head of Ukrainian intelligence, Russia is trying to get the Ukrainians to change power themselves, and if it doesn\'t work out, "the army will step in." According to Budanov, active actions should be expected in late January – early February 2022. <Military escalation> \c\cMoscow, in turn, accuses Ukraine of aggressive actions. The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said on 25 November that the Ukrainian authorities are escalating tensions in the Donbas and are conducting offensive actions there in some areas: "The hotheads of the Kiev regime, apparently feeling complete impunity, advocate a forceful solution to the internal Ukrainian crisis. The situation in the conflict zone is escalating. Information continues to be received about the use of weapons prohibited by the Minsk Package of Measures, which are supplied to Ukraine by NATO countries." She believes that by doing so, the Ukrainian leadership is trying to "divert attention from the degradation of the socio-economic and political situation in the country ... and switch this attention to some temporary threats from outside." <Military escalation> \c\cHarsh statements from Kyiv and Moscow sound against the background of a deadlock on all existing negotiating platforms. There are no contacts within the Normandy Format and are not expected at any level: there will be no summit, the foreign ministers have not yet been able to coordinate a meeting, and political advisers have not communicated since September. In the Trilateral Contact Group, negotiations are reduced to discussing whether Russia is a party to the conflict. On 15 November, Vladimir Putin signed a decree on providing humanitarian support to the population of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. <Military escalation> \c\cOn 1 December, Russia accused Ukraine of deploying half its army – about 125,000 troops – in Donbas to confront pro-Russian separatists. On 3 December, President Putin criticized Ukraine for using a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone against pro-Russian separatists in Donbas, saying the move violated the Minsk peace agreements. On 3 December, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Olexii Reznikov, speaking to the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada, said: "There is a possibility of a large-scale escalation on the part of Russia. The most likely time to achieve readiness for escalation will be the end of January." In December, Janes analysis concluded that major elements of the Russian 41st Army (headquartered at Novosibirsk in central Russia) and the 1st Guards Tank Army (normally deployed around Moscow) had been repositioned to the west, reinforcing the Russian 20th Guards and 8th Guards armies already positioned closer to the Ukrainian border. Additional Russian forces were reported to have moved into Crimea reinforcing Russian naval and ground units already deployed there. <Military escalation> \c\cOn 9 December, Russia accused Ukraine of moving heavy artillery towards the front line where separatists are fighting with Ukrainian forces. Chief of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, stated that [NATO's] "Deliveries of helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and aeroplanes to Ukraine are pushing the Ukrainian authorities to take sharp and dangerous steps. Any provocations of the Ukrainian authorities by way of a forced settlement of the problems of Donbass will be suppressed." On 31 December 2021, after a phone call between US President Biden and Russian president Putin, Putin declared that if the US sanctioned them it would be "a fatal mistake." <Military escalation> \c\cOn 10 January 2022, the Ukrainian government announced that it had arrested an alleged Russian military intelligence agent who was attempting to recruit others to conduct attacks in the Ukrainian city of Odessa. <Military escalation> \c\c

The 2022 Australian Open is a scheduled Grand Slam tennis tournament that is scheduled to take place at Melbourne Park, from 17–30 January 2022. It will be the 110th edition of the Australian Open, the 54th in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament will consist of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players will compete in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor is Kia. <Summary> \c\cNovak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka are the defending champions in Men's Singles and Women's Singles, respectively. Djokovic may be unable to defend the title because his Australian visa was refused by the Australian Border Force upon entering the country on 5 January 2022. Similarly, Renata Voráčová was deported on 8 January 2022 after her visa was cancelled on 7 January 2022. Djokovic appealed the visa refusal and the Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in favour of Djokovic, ordered his release from detention and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses. <Summary> \c\cThe 2022 Australian Open is the 110th edition of the tournament, held at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. <Tournament> \c\cThe tournament is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consists of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as the mixed doubles events. There are singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which are part of the Grade A category of tournaments.  The junior competitions will be returned after a year of absence. There are also singles, doubles and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category. <Tournament> \c\cThe tournament is played on hard courts and will take place across a series of 25 courts, including the four main show courts of Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena, Margaret Court Arena and 1573 Arena. It is also the debut of Kia Arena, which now makes five main tennis arenas. <Tournament> \c\cBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points offered for each event. <Point distribution and prize money - Point distribution> \c\cThe Australian Open total prize money for 2022 increased by 4.5% to a tournament record A$75,000,000. <Point distribution and prize money - Wheelchair points> \c\c1Qualifiers prize money was also the Round of 128 prize money. <Point distribution and prize money - Junior points> \c\c*per team <Point distribution and prize money - Prize money> \c\cOn 4 January 2022, defending champion Novak Djokovic announced that he could compete in the Australian Open after he had been granted medical exemption from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination by Tennis Australia and the health department of the state of Victoria, after a blind review of his application. However, the Australian Minister for Home Affairs, Karen Andrews, stated that regardless of Tennis Australia and Victoria's decision, Australia's "border requirements" would be still enforced by the federal government, that unvaccinated individuals entering Australia "must provide acceptable proof that they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons". <Point distribution and prize money - Prize money> \c\cOn 5 January, Djokovic was detained by the Australian Border Force upon arriving in Australia as his visa did not meet the country's entry requirements for unvaccinated travellers. His lawyers requested an injunction against deportation in order to appeal the visa refusal; this allowed Djokovic to remain confined in a detention hotel pending the outcome of the appeal. On 10 January, the Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in favour of Djokovic, ordered his release from detention and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses. The reason for the ruling was that when Djokovic was in immigration holding before his visa was cancelled, Australian officials reneged on an agreement to give Djokovic sufficient time to contact his lawyers and tennis authorities before his official interview; this led the Australian government to concede that they treated Djokovic unreasonably. <COVID-19 vaccination and visa controversies> \c\cTwenty-five other players and staff had applied for a medical exemption and a handful of applications had been granted. Among those, two people with the same type of visa and exemption as Djokovic had reportedly been allowed into the country. Player Renata Voráčová, who was one of those granted an exemption, was allowed into the country and participated in a warm-up tournament but was subsequently detained in the same hotel as Djokovic and deported on 8 January 2022. A tennis official with an exemption was also allowed entry but left the country voluntarily. <COVID-19 vaccination and visa controversies> \c\cPublic opinion in Australia of an unvaccinated athlete being permitted entry while many Australians remain stranded overseas due to the pandemic, in order to participate in an event that spectators cannot attend unless fully vaccinated, has been overwhelmingly negative. <COVID-19 vaccination and visa controversies> \c\cOn 14 January 2022, Alex Hawke, the Australian Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, exercised his ministerial powers under the Migration Act to cancel Djokovic's visa, citing "health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so". <COVID-19 vaccination and visa controversies> \c\c
On January 15, 2022, an armed gunman took multiple people hostage at Congregation Beth Israel, a Jewish synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, United States. After more than 12 hours, the four hostages were freed and the attacker is dead. <Summary> \c\cCongregation Beth Israel is a Reform Judaism synagogue located in Colleyville, Texas, a suburb in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The synagogue was opened in 1999 with 25 families and a religious school with 75 children. The synagogue's Rabbi is Charlie Cytron-Walker, who is originally from Lansing, Michigan. <Background> \c\cAt 10:41 a.m., a gunman entered the Congregation Beth Israel and began taking hostages. The assailant entered by posing as a homeless man in need of shelter. Reports of hostages being taken at Congregation Beth Israel came in around 11:30 a.m. via a tweet from the Colleyville Police Department. The police said the SWAT team was on the scene. Police efforts were later assisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Public Safety. Law enforcement evacuated neighborhoods in the vicinity of the crime scene. <Hostage crisis> \c\cA livestream of the synagogue's services showed the ongoing situation, including the taking of hostages. Four hostages, including Charlie Cytron-Walker, the synagogue's rabbi, were taken during the middle of a bar mitzvah. In it, the hostage taker could be seen speaking to authorities, who attempted to negotiate with him. The man, who was armed, could be heard saying "If anyone tries to enter this building, I’m telling you...everyone will die." and "I\'m going to die. Don\'t cry about me..." One member of the synagogue, who was listening to the synagogue's livestream, stated that she heard him speak using anti-Israel epithets. <Hostage crisis> \c\cShortly after 5:00 p.m., the Colleyville Police Department released a statement that one of the hostages was released safely and was not in need of medical attention. At 9:21 p.m., James Hartley of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported hearing "what sounds like gunshots and a much louder bang, possibly a flash grenade" from the synagogue. After more than 12 hours of the synagogue being under siege, Texas Governor Greg Abbott put out a statement via Twitter reading "Prayers answered. All hostages are out alive and safe." <Hostage crisis> \c\cMultiple news agencies reported that the assailant has claimed to be the brother of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani national who in 2010 was convicted of the attempted murder of a United States Army captain while in Afghan custody. However, a former lawyer for her only biological brother, Muhammad, said that he had no involvement with the attack. Law enforcement has not identified the assailant.

A large eruption of Hunga Tonga, a volcanic island in Tonga in the Pacific Ocean, occurred on 15 January 2022. The eruption caused tsunamis in Tonga, Fiji and American Samoa; tsunami warnings were issued in Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, the United States, Canada, Chile and Ecuador. <Summary> \c\cAfter being relatively inactive since 2014, the Hunga Tonga volcano erupted on 20 December 2021, sending particulates into the stratosphere, and a large plume of ash was visible from Nukuʻalofa, the capital city of Tonga, about 70 kilometres (43 mi) from the volcano. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) in Wellington, New Zealand, issued an advisory notice to airlines. Explosions were heard up to 170 kilometres (110 mi) away. This initial eruption ended at 02:00 on 21 December. Volcanic activity continued, and on 25 December, the island had increased in size on satellite imagery. As activity on the island decreased, it was declared dormant on 11 January 2022. <Background> \c\cA large eruption began on 14 January sending clouds of ash 20 kilometres (12 mi) into the atmosphere. The government of Tonga issued a tsunami warning to residents. Tongan geologists near the volcano observed explosions and a 5-kilometre (3.1 mi) wide ash column. <Eruptions> \c\cThe following day, a significantly larger eruption occurred at approximately 17:00 (04:00 UTC). The VAAC again issued an advisory notice to airlines. Ash from the eruption made landfall on the main island of Tongatapu, blotting out the sun. Loud explosions were heard 40 miles (65 km) away in Nukuʻalofa, and small stones and ash rained down from the sky. Many residents in Tonga were stuck in traffic while attempting to flee to higher ground. The explosion was heard as far away as Samoa, roughly 520 miles (840 km) away. Residents in Fiji described the sounds of thunder. Booms were heard in the North Island of New Zealand and as far away as the east coast of Australia. From space, a very wide eruption column and shockwaves were captured propagating across the Pacific by satellites. The pressure wave was measured by weather stations throughout New Zealand at a maximum amplitude of about 7 hPa. The pressure wave was also recorded by weather stations in Australia. The United States Geological Survey registered the eruption at a surface-wave magnitude of 5.8. A pressure fluctuation of 2.5 hPa was measured in Switzerland. <Eruptions> \c\cPreliminary observations showed that the eruption column ejected a large amount of volcanic material into the stratosphere. The eruption has potential to cause a temporary climate effect. A scientist from the University of Auckland described it as a one-in-1000-year event. <Eruptions> \c\cLittle information is yet available on the extent of damage and casualties from Tonga due to communication issues. Video footage showing waves hitting coastal areas in Tonga was reported by Sky News. Atata, a small island off the capital city was reportedly submerged and rescue operations are being carried out. There are some reports of residents in Tonga struggling to breathe as a result of the ash. The Tonga government has not confirmed any casualties from the eruption and tsunami. <Impact> \c\cThe tsunami claimed the lives of two women in Peru when a 2-meter wave struck them at Naylamp beach, Lambayeque. The two women were in a truck along with a driver; the husband of one of the woman. When the wave struck, the male occupant escaped. The bodies of the female victims were taken to a morgue. <Impact> \c\cAs a result of the eruption on 15 January 2022, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake, and a 1.2-metre (3.9 ft) tsunami, struck the Tongan capital Nukuʻalofa. Tide gauges in the city recorded waves 1.5–2 metres (4.9–6.6 ft) in height. Videos posted on the Internet showed a series of waves hitting the shore and homes, sweeping away debris. Other videos show ashfall and a cloud of ash obscuring the sun. According to a resident in the Tongan capital, a series of initial smaller explosions were heard. It was followed by a tsunami approximately 15 minutes later. The first wave was said to be the largest. A long white wave was observed out at sea approaching the coast. Three waves reportedly struck the coast. In the wake of the tsunami King Tupou VI was evacuated and traffic jams formed as locals fled to high ground. <Tsunami - Oceania> \c\cIn Fiji, a tidal gauge in Suva recorded a wave measuring 20 centimetres (8 in) at 17:40 local time. Some tsunami activity was also reported in the Lau Islands. The islands of Moce, Moala, Kadavu and Taveuni were struck by low-level tsunami that triggered flooding. <Tsunami - Oceania> \c\cIn American Samoa, a tsunami measuring 0.61 metres (2 ft) was recorded by tide gauges. <Tsunami - Oceania> \c\c"Destructive" tsunami waves of 1–2.5 metres (3 ft 3 in – 8 ft 2 in) were observed in several islands in Vanuatu. The Vanuatu Meteorology & Geo-hazards Department said tsunami activity is expected to persist for the night of 15 January 2022. Waves up to 0.8 metres (2.6 ft) in height were recorded in Hanalei, Hawaii. <Tsunami - Oceania> \c\cThe tsunami sank several boats and ripped others off their moorings at a marina in Tutukaka in New Zealand. The waves took boats out into the bay and smashed some together. Debris from boats and polystyrene was reported. Civil Defence Northland said that damage at the marina was "serious". According to Hauraki Gulf Weather, the tsunami struck on 16 January at between 01.05 and 01.10 local time on Great Barrier Island with a height of 1.33 meters. The tsunami caused flooding at Mahinepua Bay where a campsite was located but all 50 individuals at the site were safe. There were no casualties reported in New Zealand. <Tsunami - Oceania> \c\cIn Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology said tsunami waves were observed on the shores along the east coast of Australia. Maximum tsunami waves of 1.27 m (4.2 ft) was recorded at Norfolk Island, 1.10 m (3.6 ft) at Lord Howe Island, 0.82 m (2.7 ft) at the Gold Coast, Queensland, 0.77 m (2.5 ft) at Twofold Bay, New South Wales and 0.50 m (1.6 ft) at Hobart, Tasmania. <Tsunami - Oceania> \c\cIn Kominato, Amami, Kagoshima, Japan, a 1.2-metre (3 ft 11 in) tsunami was reported at 23:55 JST. At Tosashimizu, Kōchi, the tsunami was 0.9 metres (2 ft 11 in) in height. A tsunami measuring 0.9 metres (2 ft 11 in) was also reported in Chichijima Futami. On the Tohoku coast, a 0.7-metre (2 ft 4 in) wave struck at 00:38 local time, 16 January. In the Sendai Port, the tsunami measured 0.9 metres (2 ft 11 in) at 00:08. In Iwate Prefecture, a 1.1-metre  tsunami was recorded at 02:26 on January 16. Tsunami waves of less than a meter was reported along the Hokkaido Pacific coast. This was the nation's first tsunami warning since the 2016 Fukushima earthquake. <Tsunami - Asia> \c\cSignificant tsunami waves were reported hitting the Santa Cruz Harbor in California during Saturday morning. Strong currents in Half Moon Bay were reported in a tweet by the official San Mateo-Santa Cruz Fire Department account. Waves up to 0.37 metres (1.2 ft) in height were recorded in Nikolski, Alaska. On the Mexican coasts of the states of Guerrero, Colima and Baja California Peninsula, sea level rise was reported with waves of 0.30 metres (1 ft) to 0.61 metres (2 ft). The NWS reported a minor tsunami surge measuring 0.76 m (2.5 ft) in Port San Luis. Small waves were observed at Seal Beach. At San Gregorio, California, four fishermen were swept out to sea by the tsunami. Two of the men were injured and received medical treatment while another two were rescued and unhurt. <Tsunami - Americas> \c\cAlong the coast of Peru, the tsunami was damaging. Restaurants and boats in Lagunillas beach and San Andrés District were damaged by waves. Many beachgoers evacuated to safety while businesses closed. Damage to piers and some homes occurred in the capital Lima. In some areas, boat owners dragged their boats onto shore to prevent the waves from damaging them. Some material damage was confirmed on the beaches. A wave measuring 0.68 m was recorded in the port of Callao, 0.72 m in Marcona District and 0.65 m in Paita. <Tsunami - Americas> \c\cIn northern Chile, waves of up to 2 meters struck the coastline. Videos and images on social media from the Los Ríos Region showed the tsunami damaging piers, carrying boats and hitting beaches. Coastal evacuation notices were issued in 14 of the 16 regions in Chile. A "Red alert" level was issued to more than 6,400 km of ts coastline. The Chilean National Office for Emergency (ONEMI) said that tsunami activity can persist overnight so those affected have to sustain on their emergency supplies and aid. <Tsunami - Americas> \c\cMinor tsunamis related to the eruption were measured as far away as the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, with NOAA reporting a maximum rise of 0.18 m (0.59 ft) in Puerto Rico. <Tsunami - Americas> \c\cA tsunami warning was issued on 14 January in Tonga after an eruption was observed. Volcanic activity decreased following that eruption and the warning was lifted in the early morning of 15 January. A 30-centimetre wave was observed during the first tsunami warning. Another warning was issued to the whole of Tonga on the evening of 15 January following another large eruption. Warning sirens blared in Nukuʻalofa while authorities urged residents to flee to higher ground. <Response> \c\cThe Mineral Resources Department in Fiji issued advisories to people living around the coastal areas to stay away from the shores. Evacuations were made on the Lau Islands after wave activity was observed in the sea. Fiji's Acting Prime Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum urged the public to stay indoors and cover household water tanks in the event of rain due to the risk of sulfuric acid generated from the eruption. <Response> \c\cTsunami warnings were also issued to American Samoa by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC). The PTWC considered the tsunami "hazardous" and warned that changes in sea level, as well as strong currents could pose a risk along the coast. Samoa later issued a tsunami advisory. The PTWC later cancelled the tsunami warning for American Samoa. <Response> \c\cThe National Emergency Management Agency of New Zealand told residents to expect "strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges" along the north and east coast of North Island, as well as the Chatham Islands. The agency added that the currents have the potential to injure and drown people. <Response> \c\cA tsunami warning was issued by the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia, with a land warning issued for Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island, and a marine warning for the east coast of Australia, Tasmania and Macquarie Island.  On January 16, at 06:55 local time, tsunami warnings were issued to New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Tasmania for strong and dangerous currents. <Response> \c\cThe Japan Meteorological Agency informed residents that a slight disturbance in the sea could occur without any damage. The tsunami would not pose a threat to Japanese coastline. Officials from the JMA said that sea level rise of no more than 20 centimetres (7.9 in) can be expected for 24 hours from 9:00 p.m. Japan Standard Time. A tsunami warning was issued in the Amami Islands and Tokara Islands by the JMA with forecasted waves of up to 3 metres (9.8 ft). Additional warnings were issued to the east and southeast coast for waves of up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in). A warning and evacuation order was issued to Iwate Prefecture, and evacuation orders were also issued to six other prefectures. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA) said that 210,000 residents living in the seven prefectures were evacuated. <Response> \c\cThe National Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami advisory along the West Coast of the United States and British Columbia, Canada. The advisory contained all U.S. areas along the West Coast from Southern California to Alaska. Beaches were closed, and coastal residents were requested to move to higher grounds. Tsunami waves measuring 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) are expected to hit the shores as early as 7:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (UTC−8) along the Central Coast. San Francisco was expected to receive waves at 8:10. The highest tsunami waves are expected one to two hours after the arrival of the first waves. A tsunami advisory was put in place for the entirety of Hawaii. Advisories in Canada were issued along the North and Central coasts of British Columbia, along with the Haida Gwaii archipelago and Vancouver Island. No evacuation issue was ordered, but people were urged to avoid beaches and marinas. The warning level was low due to the height of reported waves, as they were below the 91 centimetres (36 in) threshold which would warrant an upgrade. Chile also issued a warning for a "minor tsunami" for most of its coastal area including the island of Rapa Nui, evacuation was declared for other 12 regions. <Response> \c\cRescue operations are underway at Atata Island, located off the main Tonga island near Nukuʻalofa after the small island was reportedly submerged by the tsunami. <Rescue> \c\cNew Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are discussing the provision of aid to Tonga. She has described the events in Tonga as "hugely concerning". <Assistance> \c\c
The 2022 Al-Hasakah prison attack is an ongoing large-scale Islamic State attack aimed at freeing arrested fighters of the Islamic State from Ghuwayran prison in the city of Al-Hasakah from the Kurdish Administration of northern Syria.The attack was termed by the SOHR as the largest attack committed by the Islamic State since it lost it's last key Syrian territory in 2019. <Summary> \c\cThe first wave of the attack occurred late at night on 20 January, when Islamic State forces launched a car bomb attack targeting the prison whilst Islamic State ground fighters began to open fire on the prison with heavy weapons. <Timeline - January 20> \c\cThe attack triggered a prison riot where the prisoners successfully managed to obtain weaponry from the armoury and then began a full blown attack on the prison staff. The prison was subsequently occupied by armed prisoners and several prisoners managed to escape. <Timeline - January 20> \c\cClashes continued into the next day, by which Islamic State fighters had spread to the Al-Zouhour area of Al-Hasakah city as well as solidified control of the Ghuwayran prison. In an effort to support Kurdish forces fighting in the city, forces of the International Coalition had dispatched military aircraft to the area. <Timeline - January 21> \c\cSDF forces also announced that they had managed to track down and arrest 89 of the prisoners that had escaped the prison. It was also reported that the electricity to several parts of Al-Hasakah city had been cut off due to the clashes. During the clashes, it was reported that U.S fighter jets had conducted 2 airstrikes on Islamic State held buildings in the city. <Timeline - January 21> \c\cThe SOHR reported that clashes continued between Islamic State and Kurdish forces over control of the prison and its surrounding areas."} <Timeline - January 21> \c\c
COVID-19 vaccination in Singapore is an ongoing immunisation campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in response  to the ongoing pandemic in the country. Singapore is currently the most-vaccinated country in the world, with more than 88% of its total population (and more than 91% of its eligible populace) having completed their vaccination regimen. <Summary> \c\cThe Singapore Government invested more than one billion Singapore dollars to sign advanced purchase agreements and made early down payments on promising vaccine candidates, such as Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and CoronaVac. <Background> \c\cOn 5 October 2020, the Singapore Government appointed a 14-member Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, which was to advise and assess on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for use in Singapore. On 24 December 2020, the Expert Committee submitted its recommendations on the overall vaccination strategy of Singapore to the government. In its recommendations, they highlighted that two groups of people had to be priortised for vaccination: people who are at high risk of infection, the frontline healthcare workers; and people who are vulnerable of severe diseases and complications from infections, the elderly. The Committee continued to advise on the use of vaccines as the pandemic continues. It recommended booster shots for people above 60 of age as evidence of declining effacy of vaccination over time emerged, and updated recommendations for those with mild skin reactions after first dosage to continue their vaccination programme. <Background> \c\cOn 14 December 2020, Singapore became the first Asian country to approve Pfizer-BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine. The first shipment of the vaccine arrived seven days later on 21 December. <Background - Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination> \c\cSingapore also received its first shipment of Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac vaccine, on 22 December 2020. However, the vaccine was not authorised for use by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). On 2 June 2021, MOH approved the Sinovac vaccine for used in private healthcare settings so people, who are not suitable to take the mRNA vaccines, can take the Sinovac vaccine. However, since the China-made vaccine is not part of the national programme, those who choose to receive it will not be eligible for the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP) should they develop any adverse reactions. <Background - 2020> \c\cOn 30 December 2020, Singapore became the first country in Asia to start its COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The vaccine is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. Health workers, other frontline workers and seniors were the first inoculated with the vaccine jointly developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. <Background - 2020> \c\cOn 3 February 2021, Singapore also became the first country in Asia to approve Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, jointly developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and Moderna. <Background - 2020> \c\cOn 18 May, the Health Ministry announced that those who register for COVID-19 vaccination from 19 May onwards will have their second dose scheduled six to eight weeks after the first, instead of three to four weeks later. This change in strategy was aimed to have 400,000 more people in Singapore to be given at least one vaccine dose by end-July so that virtually all eligible Singapore residents will get at least one dose by early August. However, as vaccine supplies continue to arrive as planned and most of the population who are willing to take the vaccine will have received their first dose by the second half of July, MOH announced on 29 June that the interval between the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine would revert to four weeks. This was part of the efforts to ensure that more of the population will be fully vaccinated earlier. On 9 July, it was announced that the interval between doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would be further shortened to 3 weeks. It was further added that those who had previously taken a vaccine not approved under the National Vaccination Programme would be advised to take 2 doses of the approved ones. <Background - 2021> \c\cThe Health Sciences Authority (HSA) also approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for children aged 12 to 15; previously, it was given only to those aged 16 years and above. It was granted interim authorization by the HSA under the Pandemic Special Access Route in December 2020. <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 24 June, the Health Ministry concluded a purchase agreement with Novavax for its non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, with shipments expected to arrive in Singapore before the end of 2021. <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 28 July, IHH Healthcare Singapore obtained approval to import the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine (BBIBP-CorV) via the special access route (SAR). The SAR was set up on 31 May to allow individuals to choose vaccines not under the national inoculation program. <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 2 August, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary announced in Parliament that those who suffered allergic reactions after receiving the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will be invited to receive the Sinovac CoronaVac vaccine and will be deemed as fully vaccinated individuals. <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 6 August, the Health Ministry announced it shall recognize all COVID-19 vaccines listed under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) starting from 10 August 2021. This means that Singapore recognizes all individuals that have been inoculated with a WHO-approved vaccine as fully vaccinated individuals and shall be accorded vaccination-differentiated safe management measures and travel concessions. <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 20 September, an additional 101,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine was delivered. <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 23 October, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) granted interim authorization under the Pandemic Special Access Route for the CoronaVac vaccine under a three-dose regime, following which it was included in the National Vaccination Programme. Those who are ineligible to take either of the approved mRNA vaccines would be invited for this vaccine and eligible for the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP). <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 10 December, the Health Sciences Authority approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 with the first shots to be given by end-2021. At the same time, Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is approved for full registration. The first shipment of the paediatric vaccine arrived seven days later on 22 December with the first shots given on 27 December. <Background - 2021> \c\cSingapore started the rolling out of booster shots for senior citizens above 60 years of age from 14 September 2021. Subsequently, from 4 October, it will start giving booster shots for the eligible population above 50 years of age, followed by individuals above 30 years of age from 9 October. The eligible population should have their second dose taken before 6 months. From 24 November, eligible population who completed their second dose before 5 months can get booster shots for all age groups. On 10 December, the use of booster shots is extended to individuals above 18 years of age starting from 14 December. From 14 March 2022, children aged 12 to 17 will need to get a booster shot within 270 days of receiving their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. <Background - 2021> \c\cOn 19 August 2021, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) shall issue a tamper-proof vaccination sticker that is to be pasted onto their travel documents and can serve as proof of vaccination. The issuance of this special sticker will be limited to travelers who have been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the presentation of a valid English-language vaccination certificate. <Background - Booster shots> \c\cOn 24 September 2021, Malaysian National Recovery Council chairman Muhyiddin Yassin confirmed that Malaysia and Singapore would recognise each other's vaccination certificates  in order to facilitate travel between the two countries."} <Recognition of vaccine certificates> \c\c

Whaling in Iceland began with spear-drift hunting as early as the 12th century, and continued in a vestigial form until the late 19th century, when other countries introduced modern commercial practices. Today, Iceland is one of a handful of countries that formally object[clarification needed] to an ongoing moratorium established by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, and that still maintain a whaling fleet. One company remains concentrated on hunting fin whales, largely for export to Japan, while the only other one previously hunted minke whales for domestic consumption until 2020, as the meat was popular with tourists.  In 2018, Icelandic whalers were accused of slaughtering a blue whale. Whaling has been temporarily paused in Iceland since 2019 as coronavirus restrictions, competition from subsidized Japanese whaling, and increasing domestic whale watching tourism have hampered the industry. It is uncertain if commercial whaling will resume in 2022. In 2022, Iceland announced that they would halt commercial whaling by 2024. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/4/iceland-to-end-whaling-as-demand-dwindles <Summary> \c\cIceland has a whale watching sector, which exists in tension with the whaling industry. <Summary> \c\c
The Jihadist insurgency in Burkina Faso (French: Insurrection djihadiste au Burkina Faso) is an ongoing war and civil conflict between the Government of Burkina Faso and Islamist rebels. <Summary> \c\cThe war have been interpreted as being the Burkinabè theatre of the insurgency in the Maghreb.   <Summary> \c\cBlaise Compaoré, president of Burkina Faso from 1987 to 2014, treated Islamists somewhat better than French colonial officials did. Compaore's Mauritanian advisor, Moustapha Ould Limam Chafi and General Gilbert Diendéré both contacted several Islamist leaders in order to free hostages held by these groups. <Background> \c\cBurkina Faso acted as a mediator during the Mali War between rebels and the government. Burkina Faso led an intervention into the country in 2013. However, in November 2014, Compaoré was overthrown, marking the end of his rule and creating a scenario of instability. <Background> \c\cOn 23 August 2015, the insurgency in the Maghreb spread to Burkina Faso, beginning with a attack on a gendarmerie by alleged Boko Haram members. Between August 2015 and October 2016, seven different posts were attacked across the country, slaying 15 and injuring 11. On 9 October, three gendarmes, one rebel, and one civilian were slain during a battle in Samorougan, Hauts-Bassins. On 31 May 2016, three police officers were shot dead in Intangom. On 1 September 2016, a team of two to four jihadists murdered a customs officer and a civilian in Markoye, injuring three others. Two days later, Sahrawi terrorist Adnane Abou Walid Al-Sahraoui accepted responsibility for the attack. <Timeline> \c\cOn 15 January 2016, terrorists attacked the capital city of Ouagadougou, killing 30 people.  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al-Mourabitoune both took responsibility. <Timeline - 2015–2016> \c\cIn 2016, the amount of attacks spiked after a new group was founded : Ansarul Islam, led by imam Ibrahim Malam Dicko. The group is particularly active at the border territories of Mali and Burkina Faso. A large proportion of attacks have been focused on Soum province. On 16 December, Ansarul Islam killed dozens of people in the attack on Nassoumbou. On the first of January 2017,  an Imam and defect from Asarul Islam was assassinated in Tongomayel. Two months later, a teacher was murdered in the village of Kourfayel, Soum province. On 22 March, the leader of Ansarul Islam, Harouna Dicko, was shot dead in Pétéga by security forces. By this point, a total of 70 people, the majority of them soldiers, gendarmes and police officers, had been killed in a series of 20 attacks. <Timeline - 2015–2016> \c\cBetween 27 March – 10 April 2017, the governments of Mali, France, and Burkina Faso launched a joint operation name "Operation Panga," composed of 1,300 soldiers from the three countries, in Fhero forest, near the Burkina Faso-Mali border, considered a sanctuary for Ansarul Islam. On 5 April, Jama\'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin detonated an improvised explosive device on a French military vehicle, injuring two people. An allied detachment found them during a searching operation, but were attacked by the armed Islamist group again, slaying a soldier. During the ensuing twelve days of searching, two jihadists were killed, 8 taken prisoner, and up to 200 suspects arrested. The French forces quickly returned to the offensive, leading several successful raids against military targets. <Timeline - 2017> \c\cOn 27 May, in Pétéga, a retired policeman was assassinated by a group of armed men, but one of them was killed during the operation. On the night between 2 and 3 June, at least five people, including a couple and their child, were murdered in targeted attacks across Soum province. On 9 June, military forces rounded up 74 villagers in the town of Djibo accused of collaborating with Ansarul Islam. Several of the villagers were tortured, two fatally. On 12 July, a shootout between authorities and jihadists took place, with no casualties. <Timeline - 2017> \c\cThe head of Ansarul Islam, Ibrahim Malam Dicko was killed in June 2017. The group announced a new leader, Jafar Dicko. On the night of 24 to 25 July, five members of Ansarul Islam were assassinated in the villages of Ndidja, Sibé and Neyba, Soum province, possibly by the new leadership. <Timeline - 2017> \c\cOn 14 August 2017, a pair of armed men entered a restaurant in Ouagadougou, murdering 18 people before they were shot dead by Burkinabè authorities. <Timeline - 2017> \c\cOn 17 August, a Burkinabè army vehicle rolled over an explosive in Touronata, killing three people and injuring two more. This is the first such incident in the country's history. On 15 September, three men, including an imam and the local village chief, were slain by armed men in Soum province. On 23 September, seven soldiers were killed in a mine explosion. Three days later, two gendarmes were killed in an ambush by jihadists. On 9 November, the Burkina Faso Armed Forces successfully  neutralized 12 jihadists in the village of Ariel. <Timeline - 2017> \c\cOn 2 March 2018, Jama\'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin attacked the French embassy in Ouagadougou as well as the general staff of the Burkinabè army. Eight soldiers and eight attackers were killed, and a further 61 soldiers and 24 civilians were injured . <Timeline - 2017> \c\cIn 2018, the insurgency expanded to the east of the country. The jihadists launched three attacks on 13 June : in Tindangou, against a police checkpoint, and on the police station and gendarmerie brigade of Comin-Yanga. During the last attack security forces managed to shoot an assailant. On 12 August, six people were killed by rebels in a bomb attack in Boungou, near Fada N\'Gourma. On the night of 27–28 August, eight soldiers died after an explosive device detonated near Pama.  On the night of 14–15 September, Jihadists murdered nine people in the villages of Diabiga and Kompiembiga including a religious leader. A few weeks later, rebels kidnapped three employees in a gold mine – an Indian, a South-African and a Burkinabé, slaying three gendarmes in the process.  On 4 October, six soldiers died after their military convoy ran over an explosive device. That night, an army of forty Islamists launched an attack against local gendarmes in Inata. The following day, six policemen died in a mine bombing near Sollé. <Timeline - 2018> \c\cIn early October, the Armed Forces of Burkina Faso unrolled a major military operation in the country's East, supported by French forces. On 3 December, gendarmes successfully repelled an ambush at Bougui, ten kilometres from Fada N\'Gourma, killing six assailants and injuring another. <Timeline - 2018> \c\cOn 1 January 2019, armed men murdered six people in the village of Yirgou, Barsalogho department. The villagers, mostly ethnic Mossis, (who form 52% of Burkina Faso's population) responded by massacring the Fulani members of the town, in what is now known as the Yirgou massacre [fr].  72 people died and over 6,000 were displaced during the incident. <Timeline - 2018> \c\cOn 10 January, a group of 36 jihadists slew twelve civilians in Gasseliki. 17 days later, ten more civilians were killed in Sikiré, near Arbinda. On 28 January, four Burkinabé soldiers were killed and five others wounded in Nassoumbou. From 3–4 February, jihadists are reported to have massacred 14 civilians in  Kaïn, 80 kilometres from Ouahigouya. On 4 February, the army reportedly neutralized 146 jihadists in the departments of Kaïn, Banh and Bomborokuy. Human Rights Watch alleged that the military had carried out several summary executions in the process. The Burkinabé Movement for Human and Peoples\' Rights reported that no evidence was found of an attack carried out by terrorists in Kain on that date, and that about sixty civilians were executed without trial by the soldiers. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cOn 15 February, the Centre-Est region experienced its first attack. Four Burkinabés and a Spanish priest were killed at a customs post in Nohao, close to the border with Togo. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cAccording to Human Rights Watch, between mid-2018 to February 2019, at least 42 people were murdered by jihadists and a minimum of 116 mostly Fulani civilians were killed by military forces without trial. From 31 March to 2 April, ethnic clashes between Fulani, Kurumbas, and Mossis killed 62 people in Arbinda. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cIn 2019, Jihadist groups began to start a persecution campaign against Christians. The campaign began on 28 April 2019, when six people, including a pastor, were killed by a group of 10 to 20 people inside a Protestant church in Silgadji. On 12 May, six more people, including one priest, died in a Catholic church in Dablo after it was raided by Islamists. The next day, a Catholic procession was targeted near Kayon and Singa-Rimaïbé, in Zimtanga department. Four people were murdered and a statue of the Virgin Mary was destroyed. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cOn the night of 9–10 May, French forces attacked a jihadist encampment near Gorom-Gorom, freeing four hostages — two French, one South-Korean and one American. Four jihadists and two French soldiers died. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cDespite this success, massacres have continued to grow more common. On 9 June 19 civilians died in an attack on Arbinda. On 18 June, armed men murdered 17–18 people in the village of Béléhédé. On 22 June 15 villagers in Sagho and Toekédogo, Barsalogho department, were killed, and on the night of 25–26 July, 22 other villagers died in a massacre in Dibilou, nearby the city of Kaya. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cAccording to the NGO, Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, armed violence in Burkina Faso jumped by 174 % in 2019, with nearly 1,300 civilians dead and 860,000 deplaced. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cOn 4 January 2020, a bus carrying mainly middle school students blew up after it ran over an explosive device between Toéni and Tougan, resulting in fourteen deaths. On 20 January, jihadists attacked the villages of Nagraogo and Alamou, inside Barsalogho, Sanmatenga, and massacred 36 civilians. The day later, the Parliament of Burkina Faso adopted a law permitting the recruitment of civilian militias called Koglweogo to fight the jihadists. The idea was initially proposed by president Roch Marc Christian Kaboré in November 2019. <Timeline - 2019> \c\cOn 25 January, the village of Silgadji was attacked again, this time with a death toll of 39 civilians. Three days after, six soldiers were killed between Madjoari and Pama, in Kompienga province. On 12 February, two civilians were killed by jihadists in Tanwalbougou. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn Sunday, 16 February, a Protestant church in Pansi was attacked by armed jihadists, who murdered 24 people (including the pastor) and wounding 20 more. This was a week before five people (also including a pastor) were slain in a church in the neighbouring town of Sebba. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 29 February, Sebba was attacked again, leaving ten policemen dead. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 8 March, the Fulani villages of Barga-Peulh and Dinguila-Peulh, Barga department, were raided by pro-government militias, leaving forty civilians dead. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cIn October, around fifty refugees who had fled elsewhere tried to return to their home region, thinking that the violence had decreased. Their convoy was ambushed in the middle of the night, ten kilometers from Pissila. 25 male refugees, approximately half of the convoy, were murdered by the attackers. All women and children were spared. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cFrom 4–5 June, unknown militants massacred over 170 people in the villages of Solhan and Tadaryat. <Timeline - 2020> \c\cOn 20 August, jihadists killed 80 people in Gorgadji, including 59 civilians.On 14 November, the Jama\'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin attacked a gendarmerie in Soum province, killing 53 soldiers. On 21 November, an attack in Foubé resulted in nine soldiers dead and ten civilians killed. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cIn December, a group of civilians stopped a French convoy in Kaya Department, alleging that France was secretly working with the jihadists. In a separate incident during that month, Islamists killed 41 people in an ambush, including the popular vigilante leader Ladji Yoro. Yoro was a central figure in the Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland, or VDP for short, a pro-government militia that has taken a leading role in the country's struggle against Islamists. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cOn 15 January, at least 10 civilians were killed in an attack blamed on jihadists in northern Burkina Faso, in the village of Namssiguian in Bam province. <Timeline - 2021> \c\cOn 23 January, military officials overthrew Kabore's ruling government. Government failures to quell the Islamist insurgency has been described as a possible motive for the coup, which received unusual popularity. The junta's leader, Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, is well-known for his widely popular military operations against Islamists. <Timeline - 2022> \c\cAllegations have arisen in the aftermath of the coup that the Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration may hire mercenaries from the Wagner Group in the future. Damiba had called earlier to hire Russian mercenaries against the Islamists, but was forbidden to do so by Kabore. <Timeline - 2022> \c\cOn 27 January, France confirmed that from 15 to 23 January 2022, more than sixty recorded jihadists had been "neutralized" in four separate incidents by Burkinabé soldiers working together with French units. <Timeline - 2022> \c\cTen member of Ansarul Islam died during a battle with French forces on February 10 near Ouahigouya. Four civilians died in the crossfire. French authorities expressed regret for the civilian casualties, which they assured was accidental. <Timeline - 2022> \c\cA humanitarian crisis has erupted in the aftermath of the conflict, with thousands of people killed by both sides. The UNHCR estimates that six in ten displaced people in the Sahel are from Burkina Faso. <Timeline - 2022> \c\cGovernment forces have summarily executed countless of civilians, disproportionately targeting ethnic Fulani. In October 2019, 14 men had their turbans ripped off by government forces, then forced into a truck and executed. Fulanis have also been subject to violence by pro-government civilians, such as during the 2019 Yirgou massacre, in which hundreds of civilians were murdered by ethnic Mossis. <Humanitarian situation> \c\cIn 2020, a mass grave of over 180 civilians was found near Djibo, killed by government forces. Summary executions and war crimes by the military have become an ordinary incident in the town. In one separate incident, 10 civilians were killed in a market place in Petagoli, three of them Dogon foreigners from Mali. <Humanitarian situation> \c\cJihadists have also been guilty of human rights abuses. Villagers have been terrorized during their everyday lives, often prohibited from holding baptisms or marriages; the assassination of local elders has become a common occurrence. From April 2019 to January 2020, Human Rights Watch recorded the killing of at least 256 civilians in a series of 20 different attacks. <Humanitarian situation> \c\cIslamists have also targeted schools, the most famous example happening on 12 November 2018, when six Islamists broke into a primary school, mugged the principal, and attacked several students. This was one of the few local cases in which the people responsible for such an attack were arrested. Rebels have justified attacks on schools by painting them as French and Western-style indoctrination programs. Numerous schools have been shut down, leading to an estimated 300,000 children without access to education. <Humanitarian situation> \c\c
Operation Unifier, also known as Canadian Armed Forces Joint Task Force-Ukraine, is the Canadian Armed Forces contribution to the security of Ukraine in coordination with the Ukrainian Armed Forces. It also includes a small Swedish contingent. It was begun in light of fomentation by the of separatist sentiments in the Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimean regions of Ukraine after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. <Summary> \c\cThe operation is part of Multinational Joint Commission, a larger body composed of the U.S., UK, Canada, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and Denmark aimed at reforming Ukraine's military. The first Canadian troops to participate in the operation come from the 1st Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment. The Canadian contribution of training is provided by about 200 Canadian soldiers, rotating every 6 months, increased to 260 in January 2022. As of November 2018 there have been 230 course sessions and more than 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained under Operation Unifier. Since 2018, a small Swedish contingent also operates within the framework. In December 2021, three Swedish officers were in Ukraine within the framework of Operation Unifier. <Synopsis> \c\cCanada made its first delivery of non-lethal military equipment to Ukraine on November 28, 2014. This equipment mainly included cold protective clothing and was delivered to Boryspil International Airport by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). On December 8, 2015, the Minister of National Defence of Canada, Harjit Sajjan, announced that his country has signed an agreement with Ukraine for joint military training and for strengthening its military capabilities.[citation needed] On January 10, 2015, the first shipment of non-lethal military equipment to Ukraine by sea arrived at the port of Odessa. On April 14, 2015, Canada announced the deployment of a CAF task force, known as Joint Task Force Ukraine or Operation Unifier, with nearly 200 Canadian Armed Forces stationed in Ukraine until March 31, 2017. The military training mission officially began on 14 September 2015 at the International Center for Security and Peacekeeping in Starychi and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense Demining Center in Kamianets-Podilskyi. <History> \c\cOn February 13, 2022, the Canadian Armed Forces announced that the operation would be temporarily suspended due to the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis, with most of the units involved being sent to Poland. Canada has assured Ukraine that the withdrawal is only temporary. <History> \c\cOn March 6, 2017, the Government of Canada announced the extension of Operation Unifier until the end of March 2019. <History - Extensions> \c\cOn March 18, 2019, the Government of Canada announced the extension of Operation Unifier until the end of March 2022. <History - Extensions> \c\cOn January 26, 2022, the Government of Canada announced the extension of Operation Unifier until the end of March 2025, and increased the complement of 200 by another 60. <History - Extensions> \c\cAccording to lobbyists from the NATO Association of Canada, Operation Unifier's broader mission includes: <Mission> \c\cHelping the development of the region <Mission> \c\cMaintaining Security <Mission> \c\cMaintaining Democracy <Mission> \c\cProviding Humanitarian Aid <Mission> \c\cPromoting economic stability and growth <Mission> \c\cLieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Troop (October 2019-28 April 2020) <Commanders> \c\cLieutenant Colonel Ryan Simpson (28 April 2020-) <Commanders> \c\cLieutenant Colonel Sarah Heer (since 6 October 2020) <Commanders> \c\cMembers of the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada positively welcomed the Canadian government's contribution to reform the Ukrainian military. A number of community appreciation events were held in Toronto, Edmonton and Winnipeg for CAF members who have served in Operation Unifier. On July 1, 2018, the Band of the Ceremonial Guard performed during its daily guard mounting ceremony on Parliament Hill, a Ukrainian military march known as "Shchob shabli ne braly, shchob Kuli mynaly" (Щоб шаблі не брали, щоб кулі минали) in front of members of the Ukrainian diaspora during the ceremony, as a sort of response to the operation. <Ukrainian diaspora response> \c\c
The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation is a regulation of the European Union and Euratom, which allows the European Commission to adopt measures, including the suspension of payment of funds from the EU budget, to member states which violate the principles of rule of law enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. <Summary> \c\cDemocratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland has been a major concern for the European Union since the 2010s. In December 2017, the European Commission initiated article 7 suspension proceedings against Poland, and in September 2018, the European Parliament did the same against Hungary. The proceedings have since stalled, however, as a suspension of a member state under article 7 requires unanimity, excluding the member state concerned, and Hungary and Poland are widely expected to veto each other's suspension. <Legislative background> \c\cAs a solution to this problem, the European Commission proposed in May 2018 to link disbursements from the European Union's budget to adherence to rule of law standards by means of a regulation. The European Parliament adopted a position on the Commission's proposal in April 2019, but the Council was generally wary of confronting its members from Poland and Hungary. <Legislative background> \c\cThis changed during the adoption of the 2021–2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery package in the summer of 2020. At the July 2020 European Council summit, the heads of state and government of the EU member states agreed that these funds should be tied to a conditionality regime regarding the rule of law. Germany, holding the presidency of the Council, suggested a compromise on the rule of law conditionality regulation proposed by the Commission and European Parliament in September 2020. After trilogue meetings between the Council, the European Parliament, and the Commission, a legislative draft of the regulation was published on 5 November 2020. <Legislative background> \c\cAlthough the regulation could be adopted by the Council by a qualified majority, Hungary and Poland threatened to veto the Own Resources Decision, which defines how the MFF and NGEU are financed. At the European Council summit of 10 and 11 December 2020, the impasse was resolved by adopting a series of declarations on how the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation should be adopted, implemented and interpreted. This paved the way for the adoption of the regulation by the Council on 14 December 2020 and by the European Parliament on 16 December 2020. <Legislative background> \c\cThe regulation provides for the Commission to propose measures against a member state that violates the principles of the rule of law. These measures include the suspension of payments or commitments, and a prohibition on entering into new legal commitments. <Provisions> \c\cIn the context of the regulation, the rule of law is understood to refer to the values enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, and include "the principles of legality implying a transparent, accountable, democratic and pluralistic law-making process; legal certainty; prohibition of arbitrariness of the executive powers; effective judicial protection, including access to justice, by independent and impartial courts, also as regards fundamental rights; separation of powers; and non-discrimination and equality before the law". <Provisions> \c\cArticle 4 of the regulation specifies that measures may only be taken if the violations of the rule of law "affect or seriously risk affecting the sound financial management of the Union budget or the protection of the financial interests of the Union in a sufficiently direct way". <Provisions> \c\cThe declaratory statements adopted at the European Council summit of 10 and 11 December 2020 address how the European Council views the regulation should be implemented. The legal value of these declaratory statements is disputed. <Implementation> \c\cAccording to the European Council's declaratory statements, the Commission should not only develop guidelines for the application of the regulation, but also await the outcome of legal challenges to the regulation before implementing it. Furthermore, the Commission should only apply the regulation when there are no more efficient means to protect the Union's budget. <Implementation> \c\cThe European Parliament adopted a resolution on 25 March 2021 in which it stressed "that the application of the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation cannot be subject to the adoption of guidelines", urging "the Commission to avoid any further delay in its application" and "to keep Parliament regularly informed about all ongoing investigations into breaches of the principles of the rule of law which could affect, or seriously risk affecting, the sound financial management of the Union budget in a sufficiently direct way". The European Parliament threatened to take legal action against the Commission if it would not provide such information to the European Parliament by 1 June 2021. <Implementation> \c\cOn 10 June 2021, after the deadline had passed without the Commission providing the European Parliament with the necessary information, the European Parliament adopted another resolution, calling on the Commission to fulfil its obligations under the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation within two weeks, and notifying the Commission that it would start preparations for legal action against the Commission for failure to act (article 265 TFEU). The European Commission rejected the ultimatum on 23 August 2021 with a five-page letter. <Implementation> \c\cOn 11 March 2021, Hungary and Poland separately launched legal proceedings with the European Court of Justice against the European Parliament and the Council for adopting the regulation, asking the court to annul the regulation as, according to Hungary and Poland, the regulation does not have an appropriate legal basis and that it serves to circumvent the punitive mechanism built in the Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union. The advocate general advised the Court to dismiss those challenges on 2 December 2021. The ECJ ultimately dismissed both countries\' complaints and ruled the regulation fully compatible with the Treaty and not exceeding the competences of the European Union. <Legal challenges> \c\c
Designated terrorist organisations in Australia are organisations that have been designated by the Australian government as terrorist organisations. A list of terrorist organisations was first created under the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, as part of the fight against terrorism worldwide. <Summary> \c\cThe Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002 was passed by the Australian Parliament, "enabling Australian governments to deal with organisations involved in terrorism", and inserted a range of terrorist organisation offences into the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). For example, the Act made it an offence to materially support or be supported by a listed terrorist organisation. <History> \c\cThe list of designated terror organisations is maintained by the Attorney-General's Department. For listing as a terrorist organisation, an organisation may be found to be such by a court as part of a prosecution for a terrorist offence or the designation may be made by regulation upon the motion of the Attorney-General of Australia under Division 102 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Listing, de-listing and re-listing follows a protocol that mainly involves the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Attorney-General's Department. Such action in general is not made with reference to designations made or proposed by other countries or multinational organisations.[citation needed] <Oversight and monitoring> \c\cUnder Division 103 of the Criminal Code Act 1995, it is illegal to finance terrorism. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) monitors financial transactions involving listed terrorist organisations.[citation needed] <Oversight and monitoring> \c\cAs of 14 August 2021,[update] the Australian government lists 26 foreign organisations as terrorist organisations: <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\cHamas was listed in July 2014, but was removed from the list by January 2015.[citation needed] Hamas was reinstated in 2022. <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\cThe Base and the entirety of Hezbollah were added on 24 November 2021. <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\cAustralian anti-terrorism financing laws include: <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\cCriminal Code Act 1995 (Cth): <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\csection 102.6 - getting funds to, from or for a terrorist organisation <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\csection 102.7 - providing support to a terrorist organisation <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\csection 103.1 - financing terrorism <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\csection 103.2 - financing a terrorist, and <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\csection 119.4(5) - giving or receiving goods and services to promote the commission of a foreign incursion offence. <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\cCharter of the United Nations Act 1945 (Cth): <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\csection 20 - dealing with freezable assets, and <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\csection 21 - giving an asset to a proscribed person or entity. <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\cThese offences sanction persons and entities under Australian and international law. The responsibility of prosecuting these offences in Australia rests with the Australian Federal Police, State police forces and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. <List of designated terrorist organisations> \c\c
