This is the first such capture since the 2001 invasion. The Taliban took control of the city on 6 August, with a spokesperson for the local police citing the lack of military reinforcements from the central government as a contributing factor to the loss. The situation in Afghanistan remains tense, with the Taliban continuing to make gains and clashes between the group and Afghan forces leading to civilian casualties. International reactions to the ongoing conflict include calls for peace talks and concerns over the impact on neighboring countries."

Palau has successfully achieved herd immunity against COVID-19 as the country's vaccination drive garnered high participation rates. More than 80% of Palau's population aged 12 years and older have received their COVID-19 vaccine shots. The achievement comes after the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the country on 31 May 2021, with a second case reported on 11 June 2021. Despite the small outbreak, Palau's proactive response to border controls and widespread vaccinations have helped to prevent the virus from spreading further and its containment efforts have been hailed as a success.

As a member of the Compact of Free Association with the United States, Palau had received vaccines from Operation Warp Speed. Vaccinations started on 3 January, and as of 12 April, 40% of the population was fully vaccinated. By 26 May, an estimated 96% of adults (18 years old and above) in the country had been fully vaccinated. Plans were also announced to start vaccinating adolescents from 12 to 17 years old. Thanks to the decisive measures that Palau has taken in response to the pandemic, its vaccination programme has seen high participation rates, which allowed the country to reach herd immunity in less than six months.

With Palau's successful vaccination programme, tourism has resumed in the country, and the government plans to vaccinate all teenagers aged 12 to 17. The country’s Minister of Health, Dr. Emais Roberts, reiterated the importance of vaccination, saying it, ""is critical to the safety, health, and economic recovery of Palau.”


Critics note that despite Palau's success with COVID-19 containment, the island nation is notably dependent on tourism to drive its economy. The continued risk of COVID-19 variants spreading to the country means that the situation remains precarious. Nonetheless, Palau has shown that a proactive response, alongside an effective vaccination drive, can help mitigate the risks posed by the pandemic."

Egypt and Russia's bilateral relations date back to before the 16th century, with historical support from Russia's government and church toward the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. However, relations took a turn during the Nasser years, when the new president Anwar Sadat reoriented the country toward the West. Despite a rocky period, relations between the two countries improved after the fall of communism in the USSR, and Russia's appearance as an independent political actor. In recent years, both countries have worked closely to strengthen military and trade ties, including a preliminary deal in 2014 for arms worth $3.5 billion despite Western sanctions on Moscow. 

In November 2013, Egypt's then-defense minister Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and foreign minister Nabil Fahmy met with their Russian counterparts during their visit to Cairo, leading to the first meeting of its kind since the Soviet era. The two countries have since exchanged multiple visits and signed agreements, including one in which Russia would build Egypt's first nuclear reactor and supply nuclear fuel. Both countries support the Syrian government in the civil war, with Egypt reportedly dispatching 150 troops to assist, and Russia's Wagner Group supporting the House of Representatives' forces in the ongoing Libyan Civil War.

One significant development in their relationship is the recent resumption of direct commercial flights between Russia and Egypt for the first time since the bombing of Metrojet Flight 9268 in 2015, which killed 224 people, most of whom were Russian tourists. A passenger plane from Rossiya Airlines landed in Sharm El Sheikh carrying 518 passengers, marking a significant step in improving bilateral relations. Russia continues to be a popular destination for Egyptian tourists, with Egypt being the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroad. Additionally, the Egyptian Russian University in Badr City, Cairo, offers training in pharmacy and engineering."

Northern Algeria is battling a total of 69 fires for the fourth consecutive day, with the death toll from the wildfires rising to 65. The fires began on August 9, 2021, in the Kabyle region and other areas, prompting Algerian authorities to send soldiers to help with evacuations and firefighting efforts. Distant villages, where many people have very limited access to water, have been particularly hard hit. Some villagers have fled, while others have tried to fight the flames themselves using rudimentary tools such as buckets and branches. The fires have destroyed Mediterranean trees, olive trees, and killed cattle and chickens. Despite the severity of the situation, firefighting aircraft have not been available. President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the wildfires."

Lebanon's ongoing liquidity crisis has taken a new turn as the Central Bank of Lebanon announced the end of fuel subsidies. As an alternative, the bank said it would provide credit lines for fuel imports based on the market price for the Lebanese pound. Experts have warned that the move would lead to a significant increase in fuel prices, further deepening the economic crisis in the country. The crisis began in August 2019 due to various financial hardships, including mounting debt and acute US dollar shortages within Lebanon. The COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 Beirut port explosion have exacerbated the situation. Since then, the black market exchange rate has reached unprecedented levels, causing inflation and poverty to rise. The crisis has also caused the resignation of the prime minister, defaults on Eurobond debts, and restrictions on dollar withdrawals and transfers by commercial banks. The World Bank recently warned that the economic crisis risked becoming one of the most severe in the mid-19th century if the bankrupt economic system, which benefited a few for so long, wasn't reformed."

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has obtained the dissolution of the House of Commons for an election set to take place on September 20, 2021. The federal election will elect members of the House of Commons to the 44th Canadian Parliament. The fixed-date provisions of the Canada Elections Act determine the latest possible date for the vote - the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year after the polling day of the previous election. However, as the current government is a minority government, the election can be held before the scheduled date if Parliament is dissolved by the Governor General of Canada due to a motion of no confidence in the government or at the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada for a snap election. As a result of the election call, a by-election in Haldimand-Norfolk was cancelled. 

In the 2019 federal election, the Liberals, led by incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, lost their majority but won the most seats. The Conservatives continued as the Official Opposition with Andrew Scheer temporarily remaining as Leader of the Opposition until announcing his resignation and triggering a leadership election. The Bloc Québécois became the third party. The New Democrats lost seats but maintained official party status, and although the Greens increased their seats in the House of Commons, they ultimately failed to achieve the required number of MPs, twelve, for official party status.

On August 15, 2021, Trudeau requested Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve the Parliament and call an election for September 20, 2021. Several MPs, including Diane Finley, Ramesh Sangha, and Navdeep Bains, resigned their seats or were removed from their parties since the 2019 election. In June 2021, Fredericton MP Jenica Atwin also left the Green Party and joined the Liberals due to party infighting over the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

The Leaders' Debates Commission recommended a permanent, publicly funded commission to organize two debates for every future election, with the authority to set the criteria for participation in election debates."

The political dispute between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban in Panjshir Province has taken a new turn as reports from Russian intelligence sources claim that resistance forces have recaptured Charikar and the surrounding Parwan Province from the Taliban. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which controls the Panjshir Valley, has been in talks for a negotiated end to the impasse since the Fall of Kabul in 2021. Before the takeover, the Panjshiris had moved military equipment into Panjshir Province and were joined by commanders of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. On August 17, 2021, Amrullah Saleh declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defense Bismillah Mohammadi. As of August 2021, the Panjshir Valley was said to be under siege on all sides but had not come under direct attack. With the latest reports of the recapture of Charikar, the situation in Panjshir Province remains fluid."

Operation Allies Refuge is an ongoing United States military operation to airlift selected at-risk Afghan civilians, particularly interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan. U.S. personnel also assisted NATO and regional allies in their respective evacuation efforts at Kabul International Airport. The operation is concurrent with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan.

On July 14, the Biden administration officially unveiled the operation's name. On July 30, the first group of 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing, with at least 20,000 SIV holders and applicants remaining in the process of being relocated.

Following the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan, on August 12, the Biden administration announced that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to the Kabul International Airport to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, U.S. nationals and SIV applicants.

As the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, the operation shifted to a massive airlift from Kabul airport. On August 15, the Pentagon and the State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops, with the U.S. military taking control of air traffic.

Since then, the United States has evacuated more than 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans, over the course of a few weeks. On August 22, the Department of Defense ordered the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to assist in the evacuation, with 18 commercial planes transporting Afghan evacuees from U.S. bases in the Middle East to Europe and the United States.

The operation has not been without tragedy, with at least eight people killed at the Kabul airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes. Two people were seen falling to their deaths from a departing C-17 cargo plane, while at least three people clinging to the side of an Air Force jet were killed after being run over. The remains of another dead Afghan were found in the landing gear of an American C-17 after the pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in a nearby country because they were unable to retract the gear. The Pentagon said that two armed men who fired into a crowd were killed by U.S. troops."

On August 22, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced that the U.S. Department of Defense will activate the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for the third time and deploy 18 planes to assist in evacuation efforts. The planes will transport American citizens, as well as augment military flights transporting Afghans to U.S. bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Europe and eventually, the United States. The announcement comes after the fall of Kabul and the expansion of the military presence at Kabul International Airport to nearly 6,000 troops. As of August 20, the Pentagon reported having evacuated about 12,700 people from Afghanistan. Operation Allies Refuge has suffered casualties, with at least eight people killed and others injured during the chaotic evacuation efforts, and U.S. troops have been involved in defending the airport and ensuring safe passage for those evacuating."

Operation Allies Refuge continues to be a crucial undertaking by the United States military, aiming to airlift at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, out of Afghanistan. In support of NATO and regional allies, U.S. forces are heavily involved in evacuation efforts at Kabul International Airport as part of the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The initiative's name was officially announced on July 14 by the Biden administration, and since then, it has been moving forward tirelessly.

On July 30, 2021, about 200 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, for SIV processing, with around 20,000 SIV holders and applicants still in the process of being relocated. Following the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, the Biden administration declared on August 12 that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to Kabul International Airport to secure the evacuation of embassy staff, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants.

As the situation in Afghanistan worsened, the U.S. military presence at the airport was increased to almost 6,000 troops, and the military took over air traffic control of the airport. On August 16, a C-17 cargo plane, which usually includes fewer than 150 paratroopers, safely evacuated approximately 823 people to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The next day, General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., head of U.S. Central Command, negotiated with Taliban officials based in Qatar's capital Doha to allow refugees to flee via Kabul Airport.

On August 17, approximately 1,100 people were evacuated on 13 flights. The White House stated that more than 3,200 U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and refugees were evacuated from Afghanistan, and around 2,000 Afghan interpreters were airlifted to the United States for SIV processing. Subsequently, approximately 2,000 people were evacuated on August 18, and the State Department reported that US military flights successfully took almost 5,000 people out of the country. On August 19, over 2,000 individuals were evacuated on 12 flights, with the Pentagon claiming that it has evacuated around 7,000 people from Afghanistan.

On August 20, the Pentagon revealed that roughly 5,700 people were evacuated on 16 flights, with the total number of people evacuated amounting to approximately 12,700. In a display of collaboration between military and commercial flights, the Department of Defense activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, consisting of 18 planes, to help with the evacuation mission. Four planes from United Airlines, three each from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines, and Omni Air, as well as two from Hawaiian Airlines, will fly Afghan individuals to U.S. military bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, from which they will board military planes to Europe and ultimately the United States.

Recently announced by Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, the network has carried out its evacuation efforts, with 24 people, including three Afghan nationals who aided in the network's coverage of the war, safely evacuated from Afghanistan. Amid the evacuation procedure, the security situation remains precarious, with at least eight individuals having been killed at Kabul International Airport as thousands of people attempt to board planes forcibly. Two individuals fell to their deaths while clinging to the landing gear of a departing C-17 cargo plane, and at least three individuals holding on to the side of an Air Force jet were run over and killed. The Pentagon confirmed that two individuals who fired at the crowd were killed by U.S. troops, and the remains of another Afghan were found in the American C-17 landing gear after emergency landing in a nearby country."

The Panjshir conflict, which began on 17 August 2021 following the Fall of Kabul, is an ongoing conflict between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban and the heavily diminished Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance. The Panjshir Valley, largely contiguous with Panjshir Province, is under the de facto control of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and is the only region outside of the Taliban's control as of August 2021. The valley is known for its natural defenses, and its population consists mostly of ethnic Tajik people, in contrast to the Pashtuns, who make up the majority of the Taliban.

Amrullah Saleh, citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, declared himself president of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley on 17 August 2021, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there. His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and the Minister of Defense of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, along with the Afghan Embassy in Dushanbe.

As of mid-August 2021, the Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms, according to a Russian estimate. Other estimates placed this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claimed that 10,000 men were under arms. By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a ""handful of armored Humvees"" in the valley.

There are differences between the forces loyal to Saleh and those loyal to Ahmad Massoud, as the former is hardcore anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistani, whereas the latter maintains good relations with Pakistan, which is supportive of the Taliban.

On 22 August 2021, Ahmad Massoud refused to surrender the Panjshir Valley to the Taliban and stated that war is ""unavoidable"" if the Taliban refuse dialogue on the formation of a comprehensive government. The Panjshir resistance, led by Massoud and Saleh, is determined to prevent the Taliban from taking control of the valley.

Despite the attempted negotiations to end the political impasse and calls for a ""peace deal"" with the Taliban, the situation remains tense in Panjshir. The USA and Western forces have been lowly supportive of the resistance movement due to the ongoing evacuation of Kabul depending fully on the Taliban's benevolence. The absence of direct communication and support between the resistance and the US government was evidenced by Massoud's Washington Post op-ed requesting Western support.

The situation is ongoing, and there have been reports of gunfights, admissions for war injuries, and recaptured districts in the region. However, the Panjshir resistance remains determined to resist the Taliban's control of the valley. Meanwhile, the resistance spokesperson Ali Maisam Nazary has stated that Massoud's group prefers a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implements a system of ""decentralization"" and ""equal rights"" across the country."

Operation Allies Refuge continues to evolve amidst a highly volatile situation in Afghanistan as the world watches the Taliban takeover unfold. The US military operation aims to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians, specifically interpreters, US embassy employees, and other Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from the country. The Biden administration named the operation on July 14 and has since evacuated over 30,000 people from Afghanistan. 

On August 12, the Biden administration announced that 3,000 US troops would be deployed to Kabul International Airport to secure the evacuation of embassy personnel, US nationals, and SIV applicants.  Following the fall of Kabul, the Pentagon and State Department announced the expansion of the military presence at the airport to nearly 6,000 troops, took control over air traffic control, and negotiated with the Taliban to allow refugees to flee using Kabul Airport. 

However, the situation outside the airport remains extremely dangerous, with a security guard killed and three others injured in a gunfight between an unknown gunman and Afghan forces at the north gate of the airport. German and American forces also engaged in the shooting. The incident highlights the continuing threat to both Afghans and foreign personnel trying to leave the country. 

As part of the evacuation efforts, the Department of Defense ordered the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet on August 22 to assist in the evacuation. The activation includes four planes from United Airlines, three planes each from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines, and Omni Air, and two planes from Hawaiian Airlines. Commercial airline pilots and crews are helping transport thousands of Afghans arriving at US bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. From the bases in the Middle East, the airliners are augmenting military flights carrying Afghans to Germany, Italy, Spain, and other stops in Europe, and then ultimately to the United States. 

Despite the challenges, the evacuation effort has made significant progress. President Joe Biden reported on August 22 that 11,000 people had been evacuated in the past 36 hours, and Major General William D. Taylor announced on August 21 that 17,000 people had been evacuated in the past few weeks, including 2,500 Americans. The Pentagon stated on August 19 that it has evacuated about 7,000 people, and on August 20, approximately 5,700 people were evacuated on 16 flights. The State Department said the US military has evacuated nearly 5,000 people from the country. However, as the situation outside the airport remains chaotic, it is unclear how many more people can be evacuated before the August 31 deadline for the complete withdrawal of US troops. 

The crisis has also resulted in casualties, with at least eight people killed at the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people try to forcibly board planes amid the chaos. Pedestrians have been crushed in the melees, and some Afghans have attempted to escape the country by clinging to the side and undercarriage of departing planes, as two people fell to their deaths from a departing C-17 cargo plane. 

The future of Afghanistan remains uncertain, and as the Biden administration navigates the ongoing crisis, it remains committed to evacuating citizens, allies, and other at-risk Afghans from the country."

The 2021 Niger attacks continue to plague the country with ongoing violence by militant groups against civilians and soldiers, mainly in the western region of Tillaberi. As of August, attacks have been carried out every month of the year, leaving 508 people dead and more than 100 others injured. Several major attacks occurred in Niger during the 2010s and 2020, but this is the first time that over 100 civilians were killed in single incidents, marking the January and March attacks as the deadliest against civilians in the country since the insurgency in the Maghreb began. 

On August 10th, Boko Haram militants attacked a military post in Diffa, Niger, killing 16 soldiers and injuring nine others. In response, around 50 Islamist insurgents were killed in a gun battle. These attacks are suspected to be in retaliation for the killings of two militants in the area by local villagers. 

The December 2020 and January 2021 attacks were carried out during Niger's municipal and regional elections, while the February bombing targeted members of the electoral commission. The attacks are conducted by Islamist militants who cross the border from Mali, although the exact terrorist organization responsible is not clear. The government of Niger has dispatched soldiers to the border to counter the attacks, and newly elected President Mohamed Bazoum condemned the latest attacks and declared three days of national mourning. 

In recent months, several more attacks have taken place across the country. On 21 February, seven members of the electoral commission were killed in a landmine explosion in Tillaberi. On 16 March, armed men attacked a convoy returning from a market in Banibangou, killing 58 people. On 21 March, militants riding motorbikes attacked three villages in the Tahoua Region, killing 137 people.

On 26 August 2021, two suicide bombings rocked Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. One bomber blew himself up at Abbey Gate, a key entrance to the airport, while another targeted the nearby Baron Hotel. The blasts killed over 100 people, including at least 90 Afghan civilians and 13 US service members, and injured over 150 others. In a statement, ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the attack, citing the Western presence in Afghanistan as the reason for their action.

In the days leading up to the attack, US and allied officials had warned of an imminent terrorist threat at the airport from ISIS-K, which has been vying with the Taliban for control of Afghanistan. The bombings highlighted the grave security risks surrounding the ongoing evacuation of Afghans and foreign nationals from the country after the Taliban's takeover in mid-August. The airport has been the focal point of the evacuation effort, with tens of thousands of people seeking to leave Afghanistan.

The two suicide attacks represented the deadliest incident for US military personnel in Afghanistan in over a decade. President Joe Biden issued a statement condemning the attack and vowed to continue evacuations until the deadline of 31 August, despite the heightened security threat. The Taliban, which controls the surrounding areas of the airport, condemned the bombings as ""horrific"" and ""un-Islamic."" A Taliban spokesman said that the group had enhanced its security measures around the airport in response to the attacks.

The international community swiftly responded to the bombings, with many countries expressing their condolences and offering support. President Emmanuel Macron of France, a key ally of the US in the region, pledged to work closely with American partners to combat terrorism. Other countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada, also vowed to stand by the US in its evacuation efforts and its fight against terrorism.

The Panjshir conflict, which began on August 17, 2021, between the deposed government of Afghanistan, including the Panjshir resistance, and the Taliban-controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, continues with the valley being the only region out of Taliban control. The Panjshir Valley, mostly held by ethnic Tajik people, is protected by the Hindu Kush mountains and has never fallen to past invaders, including the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban during the 1990s. The resistance fighters, including Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, ex-Mujahideen, and anti-Taliban activists, are estimated at 2,000 to 10,000 fighters. 

On August 23, 2021, the Taliban and resistance organizations failed to reach an agreement, with the Taliban demanding that the future government is centralized, and the resistance fighters calling for decentralization and equal rights. The Taliban continued to send its Mujahideen to capture Panjshir despite the ceasefire, and shows no intention of stopping even while negotiations are ongoing. By August 30, 2021, the Internet and telecommunication services throughout Panjshir province were shut down on orders from the Taliban. 

On September 6, 2021, the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan reported that its fighters had killed eight Taliban militants in the Panjshir Valley amidst clashes near the valley. Negotiations between the two sides are still ongoing to resolve the conflict. Meanwhile, the international community remains somewhat disengaged from supporting the resistance, focusing on evacuations from Kabul and seeking Taliban cooperation in doing so. Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan, have volunteered to prepare to fight against the Taliban despite warnings from Tajik officials that it may be deemed illegal. The outcome of the Panjshir conflict remains uncertain."
23,47,"UPDATED VERSION:

The Panjshir conflict between the National Resistance Front (NRF) and the Taliban continues to escalate as the Taliban recently entered the Panjshir Valley and engaged in fierce fighting with NRF forces led by Ahmad Massoud. Both sides claim heavy casualties, and while the Taliban reports having gained some territory, the NRF maintains control of most of the valley. 

The conflict began on August 17, 2021, following the fall of Kabul and Amrullah Saleh assuming the presidency and declaring resistance. Although both sides declared a ceasefire and agreed to solve all problems through dialogue, talks broke down, and fighting resumed as the Taliban attacked resistance positions. 

The Panjshir Valley is known for its natural defences and its majority Tajik population, while the Taliban is dominated by Pashtuns. The NRF consists of remnants of the Afghan National Army, former Mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, and other anti-Taliban activists. 

The conflict has no public support from the international community, as they focus on the ongoing evacuation of Kabul and seek the Taliban's cooperation. Domestic resistance from inside and outside Afghanistan remains uncertain due to potential risks. Tajiks from Kulob, Tajikistan, have volunteered to prepare to fight the Taliban, despite warnings from Tajik officials that it can be deemed illegal.

Meanwhile, negotiations between the two parties have continued to stall, as Mullah Amir Khan Motaqi, the head of the Taliban's commission for guidance and encouragement blames the leadership of the resistance in Panjshir for not wanting to solve the problem peacefully, and suggests selecting a native of the province as their desired governor. Meanwhile, Ahmad Masoud's group remains committed to a peaceful resolution of the conflict, under the condition that a future government implements a system of decentralisation and equal rights across the country.

As the conflict intensifies, the situation remains uncertain, and the impact of the conflict on the larger Afghan population and the international community remains to be seen."

Operation Allies Refuge was a United States military operation that aimed to evacuate at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants from Afghanistan. The operation was conducted concurrently with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of eligible foreign nationals and vulnerable Afghans. SIV applicants were airlifted to the United States and temporarily housed by the U.S. military while they completed their application process.

The operation was unveiled by the Biden administration on July 14, 2021. On July 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs (ALLIES) Act, which increased the visa cap for Afghan interpreters and expedited the SIV process.

On August 30, the last American troops left Afghanistan, marking the end of the war in the country. However, around 100 Americans were left behind, according to White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, who also stated that the Biden administration would continue to try to rescue them.

Throughout the course of the operation, the U.S. military airlifted thousands of SIV applicants, embassy personnel, and American nationals, as well as eligible Afghans seeking to flee the country. The airport in Kabul became a focal point of the airlift, with nearly 6,000 U.S. troops deployed to provide security and facilitate the evacuation efforts.

Despite efforts to secure the airport and its surroundings, the Taliban was able to take control of the country, resulting in the disintegration of the Afghan Armed Forces. The situation at the airport became increasingly chaotic, with thousands of people trying to forcibly board planes. There were frequent reports of violence, including suicide bombings that killed numerous people, including U.S. service members.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. military continued its evacuation efforts, ultimately evacuating over 120,000 people from Afghanistan. The operation was one of the largest airlifts in history and represented a significant effort by the U.S. to support its allies and partners in the region."

At least one person has died and more than 1.6 million people have been left without electricity following a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck just outside the tourist city of Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico. The earthquake occurred at 20:47 local time on 7 September and had an estimated intensity of VII (Very strong) on the MMI scale. The earthquake was a thrust faulting event located on or near the subduction zone boundary of the Caribbean Plate and Cocos Plate, 3 km from the epicenter in Acapulco. A few buildings were damaged, power outages were reported, and there were many gas leaks. According to the mayor of Acapulco, Adela Román, residents are urged to remain calm while the situation is being assessed. The earthquake occurred on the anniversary of the 2017 Chiapas earthquake which measured Mw  8.2 and killed at least 100 people. Earthquakes of this size, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, are 40x20 km in rupture size. The earthquake occurred at the southern extent of the Guerrero Gap, a seismic gap capable of generating a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. A tsunami measuring 1.2 feet or 0.37 meters was recorded in Acapulco."

Operation Allies Refuge, a United States military operation, was conducted to airlift at-risk Afghan civilians, including interpreters, U.S. embassy employees, and other prospective Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, from Afghanistan. The evacuation efforts also included NATO and regional allies from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. The operation was carried out simultaneously with the larger American military withdrawal from Afghanistan and evacuation of all eligible foreigners and vulnerable Afghans.

The first group of 221 Afghan interpreters arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia on 30 July for SIV processing, with at least 20,000 more SIV holders and applicants yet to be moved. The U.S. embassy staff in Kabul had been destroying sensitive materials and items featuring embassy logos or U.S. flags as part of the standard procedure during a drawdown.

On 15 August, the Taliban took control of Kabul, causing chaos as thousands of Afghan civilians fled to the airport in hopes of boarding flights. The U.S. military, alongside allies, struggled to evacuate embassy personnel, U.S. nationals, and SIV applicants. On 16 August, a C-17 cargo plane safely evacuated around 640 people to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, setting a new record for the aircraft. The U.S. military took control over the security and air traffic control of the airport. 

On 20 August, roughly 5,700 people were evacuated on 16 flights. The Pentagon reported that 12,700 people have been evacuated from the country. The U.S. military used multiple bases across the country to house Afghan nationals that were at risk of Taliban retaliation. Unfortunately, the Taliban's conquest of the country led to the disintegration of the Afghan Armed Forces, and casualties ensued. At least 195 people died at or near the Kabul International Airport as thousands of people tried to forcibly board planes, and a suicide bombing attack by Islamic State militants claimed the lives of at least 182 people, including thirteen U.S. service members.

Recent updates provided additional information about the ongoing evacuation efforts. On 5 September, the White House Chief of Staff, Ron Klain, announced that around 100 Americans remain in Afghanistan, and the Biden administration will look for ways to rescue them. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that 21 Americans had been evacuated from Afghanistan. 

Despite the challenges and losses, the evacuation efforts continue. The U.S. military and its allies continue to evacuate eligible individuals from Afghanistan while navigating the complex political and security situation on the ground."

Since January 2001, the United States government has conducted multiple drone strikes in Afghanistan, with at least 13,074 airstrikes resulting in the deaths of over 4,000 people, including civilians and children. During Donald Trump's presidency, drone strikes multiplied at a pace four to five times faster than they did under Barack Obama. However, on August 29, 2021, a US military drone strike near Kabul International Airport mistakenly killed 10 civilians instead of the intended target, ISIL-K militants, according to Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. The strike has faced immense criticism, with the United States government being heavily scrutinized for the number of civilian casualties resulting from drone strikes, including unintentional targets. Amnesty International USA has also questioned the legality of these attacks. The US government has previously revoked an order by Obama to report civilian drone strike deaths, and the Afghan Air Force has also conducted its own air strikes in the region."

On September 18, 2021, a rally in support of those arrested following the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol was held near the Capitol building. The event, called the Justice for J6 rally, was organized by Look Ahead America, a nonprofit led by former Trump campaign staffer Matt Braynard. The rally was attended by a small crowd of around 400 to 450 people, and at least four participants were arrested for various felonies.

Prior to the event, lawmakers and law enforcement officials expressed concerns about possible violence, prompting the activation of the Metropolitan Police Department and the restoration of protective fencing around the Capitol. A counter-rally was also scheduled, heightening fears of clashes between participants of both events.

The Department of Homeland Security issued an intelligence briefing memo warning of potential violence at the rally, but did not identify any specific or credible plot associated with the event. Far-right groups such as the Proud Boys urged members not to attend the rally, and some Republicans distanced themselves from it.

Former President Donald Trump called the rally a ""setup"" for Republican voters, stating that if people did not show up, it would be perceived as a lack of spirit, and if they did, they would be harassed. Organizers of the Justice for J6 rally criticized the security measures, saying they were designed to discourage participants.

In summary, the Justice for J6 rally held on September 18, 2021, expressed solidarity with those arrested following the January 6 Capitol attack. The event was attended by a small crowd and resulted in four participants being arrested for various felonies.

A deadly earthquake with a moment magnitude of 5.9 Mw hit Harnai in Balochistan, Pakistan, on October 7, 2021, killing at least 24 people and injuring around 200 others. The earthquake occurred near the anniversary of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, which claimed the lives of 87,000 people. The region is directly influenced by the ongoing oblique convergence between the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate with the convergence being highly oblique, involving the large Chaman Fault with thrust faulting in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya region being the direct result of the plate interaction.

According to the US Geological Survey, the earthquake occurred during the rupture of a thrust fault under the Sulaiman Mountains and Central Brāhui Range. It was the largest earthquake in Pakistan since the major tremor in 2013, which occurred nearby and killed at least 800 people, causing significant damage in the province.

The earthquake struck early in the morning at around 03:00 local time, collapsing many homes where residents were asleep. Most of the victims were women and children. Many residents were buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings and rescued by survivors. The number of injured people stands at around 200, and many hospitals in Balochistan are struggling with the influx of patients. The Harnai District and the Shahrag area were severely affected by the quake, with at least 70 homes damaged, while cities like Sibi and Quetta also reported damage.

Following the earthquake, troops from the Pakistan Army were dispatched to Harnai to aid in search and rescue and relief operations. Nine injured victims in need of medical treatment were transported by helicopter from the affected region to Quetta. The Inter-Services Public Relations, army, medical personnel, response workers, and officials are all working together to coordinate the rescue and relief efforts.

Protests by the Serbian population in Kosovo against the government of Kosovo have ended after an agreement was reached between the authorities in Kosovo and Serbia. The protests, which began on 20 September 2021, were prompted by the government's decision to ban Serbian license plates. The ban required people owning vehicles with Serbian plates to switch to Kosovan license plates at a government registration center. The ban aimed to mirror the former ban by the Serbian government on Kosovan plates in Serbia. However, the decision drew widespread opposition and led to protests, which were largely peaceful. 

The Serbian Armed Forces were placed on heightened combat readiness as a result of the protests, but the government of Kosovo and Serbia have now agreed to end the ban. The agreement, which was reached on 30 September 2021, will allow Serbian license plates to be used in Kosovo and Kosovan plates to be used in Serbia. However, national symbols and country codes on both types of plates will be covered with a sticker. 

The agreement is expected to be a temporary resolution, with negotiators from both governments meeting for the first time in Brussels on 21 October 2021, to form a working group to find a more permanent solution. If successful, the working group will announce its proposals in six months, in accordance with EU standards. 

The Kosovo-Serbia border has been a subject of tension for years due to Serbia's refusal to recognize Kosovo's independence. North Kosovo, where the protests took place, is majority Serb and has been a region largely opposed to an independent Kosovo. The community of Serb municipalities was supposed to be formed in accordance with the Brussels Agreement of 2013, but its formation has been blocked by the government of Kosovo. 

Both sides have accused each other of overreach during the protests, which were largely peaceful, but the situation has now calmed after the agreement was reached. International powers have called for de-escalation, with the NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, the Kosovo Force, increasing the amount and duration of its patrols. Russia, meanwhile, has criticized Kosovo's decision to ban Serbian license plates."

Sir David Amess, a British Conservative Party politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for Southend West, was stabbed to death multiple times during a political surgery at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex on 15 October 2021. Ali Harbi Ali, a 25-year-old male British citizen, was arrested at the scene and charged with murder and the preparation of terrorist acts. On 7 March 2022, Ali Harbi Ali was due to be tried for the murder of David Amess after appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court and the Old Bailey. 

Amess was a long-serving politician who had entered Parliament in 1983 as MP for Basildon. He had held no senior positions but was described as an ""instantly recognisable"" member of the Conservative Party, and had been knighted for his political and public service. He was a devout Catholic and a socially conservative politician who opposed abortion, supported capital punishment, and campaigned in favour of Brexit. He was a supporter of animal welfare and was one of the few Conservative MPs to support a ban on fox hunting. 

In the aftermath of Amess's death, significant changes were proposed regarding the safety of MPs during open, public constituency surgeries. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, announced that the security of MPs will be reviewed, and politicians debated calls to enact a law to crack down on online targeting of MPs and end anonymity. The Conservatives suspended political campaigning, and a number of MPs voiced their support for a campaign to give Southend-on-Sea city status as a way of honoring Amess's memory.

In addition, Boris Johnson and the Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer, accompanied by Sir Lindsay Hoyle and the home secretary Priti Patel, laid wreaths at the church hall where Amess was killed. Tributes were paid in a book of condolence placed in the House of Commons Library, as well as in Westminster Hall and Portcullis House. A vigil for Amess was held in his Southend West constituency, and a service of remembrance for Amess was held by MPs at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, which included an address by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. 

However, controversy arose when a Catholic priest reported that he was not allowed to enter the crime scene to administer the last rites for Amess. Following Amess's killing, British Catholic policymakers issued statements affirming Amess's commitment to his faith and lauding his achievements, and Labour MP Mike Kane sought to add an ""Amess amendment"" to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that would ensure Catholic priests' access to crime scenes to administer the last rites. 

Amess's close links to Qatar, which backs Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, have been examined by police. Despite rumours of links to Islamic extremism, Ali Harbi Ali was charged with the murder of David Amess, and remanded to Belmarsh prison. He is due to stand trial on March 7, 2022."

The death toll from the collapse of a building in Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, has risen to 36 three days after the incident occurred. The high-rise block of flats, called the ""360 Degrees Towers,"" was being built by UK-registered company Fourscore Homes, which was led by Nigerian developer Femi Osibona. One of the three towers was a 21-story luxury residential building that had exceeded the approved number of floors authorized by the Lagos State Building Control Agency. Consultancy firm Prowess Engineering Limited had raised concerns regarding the building's integrity and withdrew from the project in February 2020. On 1 November 2021, the 21-story tower collapsed, killing at least 36 people and injuring others. The rescue effort led by the National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos State is ongoing, and the military is expected to take over operations. The state government has suspended the chief architect and arrested the building's owner, while an independent panel has been appointed to conduct an investigation into the incident and is allotted 30 days to disclose its findings."

A tragic incident in Sierra Leone resulted in the death of at least 99 people and the injury of over 100 others. The incident took place on November 5, 2021, in Freetown when an oil tanker collided with a truck, causing a massive explosion. Reports indicate that the collision and subsequent explosion occurred at around 22:00 GMT, at a junction outside Choithram Supermarket in the Wellington suburb of the city.

According to eyewitnesses, fuel spilled from the tanker before igniting, and people rushed to collect the leaking fuel, which led to the explosion. A bus carrying passengers was completely burnt, and nearby shops and markets caught fire as well. The explosion resulted in significant damage to the area and has left many people homeless.

This isn't the first time Freetown has experienced disasters. In March 2021, a massive fire in one of the city's slums injured 80 people and displaced over 5000 residents. In 2017, the city was hit by heavy rains that caused mudslides, resulting in over 1000 fatalities.

The mortuary at Connaught Hospital in Freetown has so far received 92 bodies, and many people are said to be in critical condition. Sadly, about 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive, according to reports. The injured have been transferred to hospitals, and the bodies have been collected.

Following the tragic incident, President Julius Maada Bio, who was attending the United Nations climate talks, offered condolences and promised support to the victims' families. Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals to assess the situation. Journalists at the scene reported that hospital services have been stretched as more and more injured patients arrive.

The accident is a reminder of the dangers associated with transporting fuel and the need to implement strict safety regulations. Investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the collision and to prevent similar incidents in the future.

In the meantime, the people of Freetown are coming together to help the victims, providing shelter, food and other essentials to those affected by the explosion. The government and aid agencies are also providing assistance to those in need."

On 5 November 2021, a collision between a petrol fuel tanker and a lorry at a busy intersection in Sierra Leone's capital and largest city, Freetown, resulted in an explosion and fire that killed at least 115 people and injured more than 100 others. The accident occurred in the Wellington area, which is Freetown's main industrial district. A fuel tanker carrying petrol attempted to make a turn outside Choithram Supermarket in the Freetown suburb of Wellington when a lorry carrying granite collided with it, creating a fuel leakage. The two drivers came out of their vehicles and warned community residents to stay away from the scene, according to Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency. Petrol spilled from the tanker, and locals, particularly ""Okada"" (motorbike) taxi-riders, attempted to collect it in containers. An explosion caused a huge fireball that engulfed vehicles, people, and passengers stuck in traffic created by the initial collision. The mayor of Freetown, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, said that the damage was exacerbated by people who gathered at the lorry, scooped the leaking fuel in containers, and placed them in close proximity to the crash scene, creating chaos. Many of the victims were trapped in vehicles, including a bus full of people, which was intensely burnt, killing all inside. Nearby shops and markets caught fire after fuel spilled onto the streets. The death toll from the disaster rose to 115 four days after the explosion. The injured were transferred to hospitals, and the bodies were collected. Many people, including passengers in cars and buses, were close to the scene of the accident during the explosion, and several people are in critical condition. According to a staff member of Connaught Hospital's intensive care unit, about 30 severely burned victims are not expected to survive. President Julius Maada Bio offered condolences and promised support to the victims' families. Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh visited two hospitals. The event has been described as the first of its kind in the densely populated city of about 1.2 million and follows several similar high-casualty fuel tanker explosions across sub-Saharan Africa. Mass casualties from similar events have occurred in the 2018 Mbuba tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo that killed 50 and the 2019 Morogoro explosion in Tanzania that killed 85."

Israel's highly successful COVID-19 vaccination programme, known as ""Give a Shoulder"" (Hebrew: לתת כתף), has achieved another milestone as the country's pandemic advisory board approves the usage of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11. The programme began on December 19, 2020, and has been lauded for its success, with over 60% of the eligible population receiving at least one dose of the vaccine and a world-leading 60% receiving two doses. Israel's health authorities have been praised for their coordinated efforts, using databases of personal information for citizens, to vaccinate a large proportion of the population in a short timeframe. 

The success of the programme has been attributed to several factors, such as the younger age demographic of Israel's population and the centralized nature of the government system that allowed for quick delivery and distribution of vaccines. The government also secured agreements with companies working on vaccine development, such as Moderna. Early in the programme, Israel provided Pfizer with medical information about its citizens as part of a deal to receive a supply of COVID-19 vaccines from the company. 

The initial campaign for vaccinations focused on the elderly and patient groups with a higher risk of severe illness in the case of infection, such as those with preexisting conditions and healthcare employees. As the vaccination drive progressed, Israel introduced a ""green pass"" certificate of vaccination, which allowed immunized residents to access certain locations like gyms, hotels, and theaters. The green pass indicated that the holder was protected against COVID-19, either by vaccination or previous infection. 

However, Israel faced distribution issues early on, including scheduling appointments, interpreting eligibility rules that led to supply problems, and inadequate distribution in less populated villages and Arab-Israeli communities. The government also had to tackle a moderate amount of vaccine hesitancy in its general population, particularly among young adults and religious/cultural minority groups. The challenges were addressed via messaging, incentives, extensions to the initial vaccine delivery system, and other measures. 

Despite these issues, Israel's vaccination drive has been successful, with the country having one of the highest per capita vaccination rates globally. The government's approval for vaccinating young children is another significant achievement in their fight against COVID-19."

Merseyside Police have declared the explosion that occurred on 14 November 2021, outside the Liverpool Women's Hospital in Liverpool, England, as a terrorist incident. Information has emerged that David Perry, the taxi driver who was injured in the explosion, had shown an incredible presence of mind and bravery by locking the bomber inside the vehicle when he noticed that the passenger was wearing an explosive device. The passenger was killed in the explosion, and he was later identified as a man of Middle Eastern origin who was not known to MI5. It was believed that he constructed the improvised explosive device himself. 

After the terrorist attack, the hospital was placed under lockdown, and roads were closed. Military Logistics and the Bomb Squad were also deployed to the area. The police made three arrests under the Terrorism Act and later announced that they were a direct response to the attack. The UK terror threat level was raised from substantial to severe following the incident.

The investigation into the attack is ongoing, and MI5 has joined the investigation in a support role for the local police. The police have not yet determined the motive of the bomber, but one theory is that he intended to walk to the cathedral and detonate his device as the congregation left. The timing of the incident, which occurred on Remembrance Sunday, with the associated minute’s silence usually observed at 11 am, has raised questions about whether there was a connection between the two events.

The incident has received international attention, with news outlets such as CNN, The New York Times, and the Washington Post covering the news. Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated David Perry for his bravery, while the shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth apologized for ignoring Perry's bravery when expressing condolences to the family of the deceased man. Meanwhile, Mayor Joanne Anderson praised Perry for his quick thinking during the attack. 

The police are urging anyone with information about the attack to come forward to help with the investigations."

The Semeru volcano in East Java, Indonesia erupted on December 4, resulting in one death and 41 injuries. The eruption began when a lava dome at the summit crater collapsed due to intense precipitation, triggering a pyroclastic flow that traveled down the slopes of the volcano. The eruption sent a cloud of volcanic ash 40,000 feet (12,000 m) into the air, affecting six sub-districts in the Malang Regency and causing power interruptions and blackouts for at least 30,253 people.

In the Lumajang Regency, eight villages and two sub-districts were affected by ashfall, and the Gladak Perak Bridge was destroyed, sealing road vehicle access to villages in the area. Heavy volcanic ash buried village homes and vehicles, and an estimated 300 families were evacuated. On December 5, smaller eruptions occurred, causing volcanic ash to fall in the Pronojiwo District of Lumajang and damaging 28 schools in two districts.

The Indonesian Ministry of Health reported one death and 45 injuries caused by burns from the pyroclastic flows. Four burn victims were in the intensive care unit, and 38 people were treated at the Penanggal Health Center. Another ten miners at a sand mine in Renteng Village were initially trapped, but were later rescued. However, some number of sand miners are still unaccounted for. The total number of casualties was later revised to 14, with many of the victims dead from burns. Two of the fatalities were from the Supiturang and Sumberwuluh villages, respectively, and five other victims were from the Curah Kobokan village, with five bodies undergoing identification at the Bhayangkara Hospital.

Local authorities have urged residents to keep at least 5 km away from the main summit crater and prohibited individuals from approaching 1 km or closer to the crater due to concerns of large pyroclastic flows. Residents were also told to keep clear from rivers originating from Semeru as they are transporting volcanic debris. On December 5, at least 1,300 residents in Lumajang were displaced and took refuge in multiple locations, with the BNPB providing aid such as meals ready-to-eat packs, blankets, mattresses, masks, refugee tents, medical supplies, water, and instant food. Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the Lumajang Regency on December 5 to lead post-eruption recovery efforts, while East Java Governor Khofifah Indar Parawansa relocated her office to aid in the evacuation process of residents in the danger zone.

The surge has led to major disruptions in society, with schools and businesses closing and pressure mounting on the healthcare system. The UK's vaccination programme, which had been successful in reducing hospitalisations and deaths, is now being ramped up further with the introduction of booster shots and offering vaccines to children. The government has also reintroduced some restrictions, such as mandatory mask-wearing and limits on large events, while stopping short of imposing another lockdown.

The 2021–22 Russo-Ukrainian crisis continues to escalate as tensions rise between Russia and Ukraine. The crisis has caused international tension involving the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The aggravation of Russian-Ukrainian relations occurred in late October and was provoked by the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAV against the DPR formations.

The crisis has been accompanied by a military and political escalation. On 2 November, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia was closely monitoring the use of UAVs ""near the borders of Russia"" and should carefully analyze the situation in this regard. According to OSCE observers, the ceasefire regime began to be violated twice as often as in 2020, and there have been reports of the movement of military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 

In addition, Ukraine has sharply intensified diplomatic efforts. On 15 November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the head of the European Council Charles Michel discussed ""the security situation along the borders of Ukraine."" The new head of the Defense Ministry, Oleksii Rezikov, went to Washington, where he met with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. 

However, the crisis has also been marked by alleged aggressive actions from both sides. On 21 November, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, reported that Russia has allegedly concentrated more than 92,000 troops and Iskander short-range ballistic missile systems near the Ukrainian borders, and that active actions should be expected in late January – early February 2022. Moscow, in turn, accuses Ukraine of escalating tensions in the Donbas and conducting offensive actions there in some areas.

Amidst the ongoing crisis, Ukrainian authorities have arrested an alleged Russian intelligence agent who they claim attempted to recruit others to launch attacks in the port city of Odessa. The arrest marks a significant escalation in the heated conflict between the two countries. 

The international community is closely watching the situation and has called for reducing tensions and avoiding any escalation in and around Ukraine. Talks between Russia and the US are scheduled to take place in Geneva on 10 January 2022, while discussions with NATO will be held in Brussels on 12 January 2022. A broader meeting involving the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will take place in Vienna on 13 January 2022. The outcome of these talks remains uncertain but will be crucial in determining the future trajectory of the crisis."

The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis, which started in late October 2021, has reached a breaking point in talks between NATO and Russia, as Poland warns of a possible war. The crisis has caused international tension involving the United States, NATO, the European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The tension was provoked by the first combat use of the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 against DPR formations, which occurred in late October-early November. As a result, the ceasefire regime has been violated twice as often as in 2020, and OSCE SMM observers reported on the movement of military equipment and repeated attempts to muffle signals of UAVs used to monitor the terrain. Reports emerged of Russia pulling troops to the Ukrainian border, with satellite photos of Russian armored vehicles cited as evidence, though Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied allegations of preparations for a possible invasion of Ukraine.

This military aggravation was accompanied by aggravation in the Ukrainian political field, with the former leader of the Right Sector organization, Dmytro Yarosh, appointed adviser to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, and former Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for the Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Oleksii Reznikov approved as the new defense minister. The Russian Defense Ministry described the deployment of U.S. warships to the Black Sea as ""a threat to regional security and strategic stability,"" and on November 13, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Russia again amassed 100,000 troops in the border area. In response, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on the West to send Russia ""a clear signal calling for reducing tension, avoiding any escalation in and around Ukraine."" 

Diplomatic responses included sharp diplomatic efforts from Ukraine, including talks between Volodymyr Zelensky and the head of the European Council Charles Michel, Dmytro Kuleba holding talks on the same issues in Brussels, and Oleksii Rezikov's meeting with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The UK also formed a consolidated rapid response unit of about 600 fighters for transfer to Ukraine. However, the deadlock in existing negotiating platforms has resulted in no contacts within the Normandy Format and no meetings expected at any level. 

In December, Janes analysis concluded that major elements of the Russian 41st Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army had been repositioned to the west, reinforcing the Russian 20th Guards and 8th Guards armies already positioned closer to the Ukrainian border. Additional Russian forces were reported to have moved into Crimea reinforcing Russian naval and ground units. Talks between the US and Russia took place in Geneva on 10 January 2022, discussing respective military activities and confrontations over Ukraine, followed by a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels on 12 January with all 30 NATO Allies and Russia discussing the situation in and around Ukraine.

On 13 January 2022, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Alex Hawke, invoked his ministerial powers under the Migration Act 1958 to cancel Djokovic's visa on ""health and good order grounds."" Djokovic was subsequently deported from Australia on 14 January 2022.

The tournament comprises 25 courts, including the four main show courts of Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena, Margaret Court Arena, and 1573 Arena, as well as the debut of Kia Arena. The tournament is played on hard courts, and the prize money for 2022 set a tournament record of A$75,000,000.

However, the tournament faced controversy due to Djokovic's visa refusal and subsequent deportation, as well as the fact that spectators were only allowed if they were fully vaccinated against COVID-19, while Djokovic, who is unvaccinated, was initially granted a medical exemption from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination by Tennis Australia and the health department of the state of Victoria. Public opinion in Australia regarding Djokovic's entry to the tournament was overwhelmingly negative."

On January 15, 2022, an armed gunman claiming to be the brother of Pakistani Al-Qaeda suspect Aafia Siddiqui, took multiple people hostage at Congregation Beth Israel, a Jewish synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, United States. The assailant entered the synagogue by posing as a homeless man in need of shelter and took four hostages, including the synagogue's rabbi, during the middle of a bar mitzvah. The hostage crisis lasted for more than 12 hours, with negotiations taking place and police efforts being assisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Public Safety. 

Shortly after 5:00 p.m., the Colleyville Police Department released a statement that one of the hostages was released safely and was not in need of medical attention. At 9:21 p.m., James Hartley of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported hearing ""what sounds like gunshots and a much louder bang, possibly a flash grenade"" from the synagogue. The assailant was later shot and killed by police, and all hostages were freed alive and safe, according to a tweet from Texas Governor Greg Abbott. 

The White House stated that they were actively monitoring the situation, and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said he was ""closely monitoring"" the situation. Yair Lapid, the Alternate Prime Minister of Israel, said that Livia Link, the Israeli Consulate General located in Houston, Texas was on her way to the scene and that the Israeli government was in contact with American law enforcement. 

The attorney who currently represents Aafia Siddiqui said ""she has absolutely no involvement with [the hostage crisis]."" The attorney stated that ""We strongly condemn the hostage-taking at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville"" and ""We implore the hostage taker to immediately release all hostages and turn himself in."" It is currently unclear why the assailant specifically targeted Congregation Beth Israel and the Jewish community."

On January 20, 2022, ISIS militants launched a large-scale attack on Al-Sina'a prison in the city of Al-Hasakah, with the aim of freeing imprisoned fighters. The attack began with a car bomb targeting the prison, followed by heavy gunfire from ISIS ground fighters. The attack triggered a prison riot, as the prisoners were able to obtain weapons from the prison's armoury and launch a full-blown assault on the prison staff. The ensuing clashes led to the escape of several prisoners.

The attack continued into the next day, with ISIS fighters spreading to the Al-Zouhour area of Al-Hasakah city and solidifying their control of the prison. Clashes between ISIS and Kurdish forces continued over control of the prison and its surrounding areas.

The attack resulted in the death of 67 people, including prison staff, ISIS militants, and civilians caught in the crossfire. In response, forces from the International Coalition were dispatched to the area to support Kurdish forces fighting in the city.

Whaling in Iceland has a long history, dating back to the 12th century. While it continued in a limited form until the late 19th century, modern commercial practices put an end to it. Nevertheless, Iceland is one of the few countries that object to the International Whaling Commission's moratorium established in 1986, and the country still maintains a whaling fleet. However, that will soon change as Iceland recently announced that it will be ending the practice of whaling by 2024.

The decision to end whaling in Iceland comes as the demand and price for whale meat continue to decrease, making the industry economically unviable. One whaling company, which previously hunted minke whales for domestic consumption, stopped in 2020 due to the meat's declining popularity with tourists. Another company still hunts fin whales for export to Japan.

The move to end whaling in Iceland will ease tension with the country's whale watching sector, which has been growing in popularity in recent years. In 2018, Icelandic whalers were accused of slaughtering a blue whale, and the industry has faced other challenges, including competition from subsidized Japanese whaling and the impact of coronavirus restrictions.

Overall, Iceland's decision to end whaling is a significant step towards the conservation of whales and a positive move towards sustainable tourism. It remains to be seen what the future holds for Iceland's whaling industry, but for now, the country is moving towards a more environmentally friendly future."

Operation Unifier, also known as Canadian Armed Forces Joint Task Force-Ukraine, has faced a major shift in its presence as Canada withdraws military advisors from Ukraine and relocates them to an undisclosed European destination. The diplomatic staff has been moved to Lviv, and all operations at the embassy in Kyiv have been suspended. The Canadian contribution of training is provided by about 260 Canadian soldiers, rotating every six months, and more than 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained under Operation Unifier since its inception. The operation is part of the Multinational Joint Commission, a larger body composed of the U.S., UK, Canada, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania, and Denmark aimed at reforming Ukraine's military. A small Swedish contingent also operates within the framework.

Canada first made its delivery of non-lethal military equipment to Ukraine in November 2014, mainly including cold protective clothing. On April 14, 2015, Canada announced the deployment of a CAF task force, known as Joint Task Force Ukraine or Operation Unifier, with nearly 200 Canadian Armed Forces stationed in Ukraine until March 31, 2017. Since then, the operation has been extended until the end of March 2025, with an increased complement of 260 personnel. 

Operation Unifier's broader mission includes helping in the development of the region, maintaining security and democracy, providing humanitarian aid, and promoting economic stability and growth. Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Troop served as the commander of the operation from October 2019 to April 28, 2020, followed by Lieutenant Colonel Ryan Simpson, and then Lieutenant Colonel Sarah Heer, who currently leads the operation.

Members of the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada have positively welcomed the Canadian government's contribution to reform the Ukrainian military, and community appreciation events have been held to honor CAF members who have served in Operation Unifier. However, the recent relocation of military advisors and suspension of operations at the embassy in Kyiv have marked a significant change in Canada's involvement in Ukraine's security."

In a recent development, the European Court of Justice has dismissed legal challenges launched by Hungary and Poland against the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation, which allows the European Commission to suspend payments from the EU budget to member states for violating the principles of the rule of law. The court confirmed that the regulation is in compliance with the treaties of the European Union, and this decision will enable the European Commission to take action against member states with rule of law issues that could impact the management of EU funds.

Democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland has been a major concern for the European Union, and the European Commission had proposed in May 2018 to link disbursements from the EU budget to adherence to rule of law standards through the regulation. Although the European Parliament adopted a position on the Commission's proposal in April 2019, the Council was hesitant to confront its member states from Poland and Hungary.

However, during the adoption of the 2021–2027 Multiannual Financial Framework and the Next Generation EU recovery package in the summer of 2020, the heads of state and government of the EU member states agreed to tie funds to the rule of law conditionality regime. After trilogue meetings between the Council, Parliament, and the Commission, a legislative draft of the regulation was published on 5 November 2020.

The impasse was resolved at the December 2020 European Council summit by adopting a series of declarations on how the rule of law conditionality regulation should be adopted, implemented, and interpreted. This paved the way for the adoption of the regulation by the Council on 14 December 2020 and by the European Parliament on 16 December 2020. The regulation allows the Commission to propose measures against a member state that violates the principles of the rule of law, such as suspension of payments or commitments.

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 25 March 2021, urging the Commission to avoid any further delay in applying the regulation and to keep Parliament informed about ongoing investigations into breaches of the principles of the rule of law which could affect the sound financial management of the EU budget. The Parliament threatened legal action against the Commission if it did not provide such information by 1 June 2021. On 10 June 2021, the Parliament issued another resolution calling on the Commission to fulfil its obligations, and the Commission rejected the ultimatum on 23 August 2021.

These developments are significant as democratic backsliding in certain member states has been a rising concern for the EU, and the rule of law conditionality regulation provides a means for the EU to take action against such violations. With the European Court of Justice's dismissal of legal challenges, the EU can now proceed in enforcing the regulation to safeguard the management of its funds."

The fight against terrorism worldwide has led to the creation of a list of designated terrorist organisations in Australia. The Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002 enabled the Australian government to deal with organisations involved in terrorism, and inserted a range of terrorist organisation offences into the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). An organisation may be listed as a terrorist organisation by a court as part of a prosecution for a terrorist offence or by regulation upon the motion of the Attorney-General of Australia under Division 102 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The list of designated terror organisations is maintained by the Attorney-General's Department, and follows a protocol mainly involving the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Attorney-General's Department.

As of November 2021, the Australian government has designated a number of organisations as terrorist organisations, including the entirety of Hamas, Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham and the Guardians of Religion Organization. Australian anti-terrorism financing laws include a range of offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 (Cth), which sanction persons and entities under Australian and international law. The responsibility of prosecuting these offences in Australia rests with the Australian Federal Police, State police forces and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) also monitors financial transactions involving listed terrorist organisations."
