This marks the first major capture of a provincial city by the group since the 2001 invasion. The Taliban's victory was attributed to the lack of reinforcements from the central government military. A spokesperson for the local police confirmed that the city is now under Taliban control. This development further highlights the deteriorating security situation in the country. The Taliban has been making rapid territorial gains in recent months, capturing dozens of districts and provincial capitals amid the withdrawal of foreign forces. The group's latest victory underscores the urgency of the situation, with fears growing that the Taliban could seize more provincial capitals and possibly even Kabul, the capital city."

The ban triggered protests, mostly consisting of blocking traffic near border crossings, and led to the worsening of relations between Serbia and Kosovo. On 2 October, according to the agreement, barricades set up by protesters were removed, and traffic blocks ended, leading to border traffic resuming. A working group consisting of negotiators from the governments of Kosovo and Serbia will meet in Brussels on 21 October 2021, to find a more permanent solution to the license plate issue. If negotiations are successful, the group will announce their proposals in 6 months.

Although there were widely varying predictions regarding the strength of the cycle ranging from very weak to strong, the Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel predicted in December 2019 that it will be similar to solar cycle 24, with the number of sunspots reaching a (smoothed) maximum of 115 in July 2025 (± 8 months). Early signs of the new cycle include the appearance of reversed polarity sunspots and polarward reversed polarity sunspots since as early as December 2016, as well as the brewing of magnetic regions with the underlying orientation of solar cycle 25 toroidal field component observed in December 2019. Recently, an X-class solar flare, the second of the cycle, erupted which could graze Earth on October 30 or 31, accompanied by possible bright aurorae and potential interference with satellite communications. The first C-class solar flares took place on May 29, 2020, with activity increasing in the following months, especially abruptly in October, with flares taking place on a near-daily basis by November. On November 29, an M4.4 flare, the strongest of the cycle to date, took place, possibly indicating the solar cycle would be more active than initially thought. A small coronal mass ejection was found heading directly towards Earth on December 8, 2020, shortly after a strong C-class solar flare, causing bright aurorae at high latitudes."

The Solomon Islands has been engulfed in civil unrest for three days, with rioting, looting, and clashes with police. The Australian Federal Police have taken control of Honiara, the capital city, and implemented a curfew that begins at 7:00 p.m. local time. The protests began peacefully, but turned violent on 24 November 2021, with buildings being burnt down and schools and businesses closing. Most of the protesters came from Malaita province, which had recently held an illegitimate independence referendum that the national government dismissed. The cause of the civil unrest stems from the government's withdrawal of recognition of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in favor of establishing relations with mainland China, which has caused tension between different provinces in the country. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has resisted calls to resign and accused the protesters of being ""politically motivated,"" while the premier of Malaita Province and the opposition leader have criticized the government's handling of the situation.

82,156,"UPDATE: Whaling in Iceland has a long history, dating back to the 12th century when it was primarily done through spear-drift hunting. Today, Iceland is one of the few countries that still maintains a whaling fleet and has been hunting fin whales for export to Japan. However, in a recent announcement, Iceland has stated that it will end the practice of whaling by 2024, citing the decreasing price of whale meat as the reason for this decision. This announcement comes after a temporary pause in whaling since 2019 due to coronavirus restrictions, competition from heavily subsidized Japanese whaling, and the growth of domestic whale watching tourism. Iceland's decision to end whaling is a significant step towards marine conservation and is sure to be welcomed by environmentalists worldwide."
83,158,"The ongoing jihadist insurgency in Burkina Faso between the government and Islamist rebels has recently seen a battle between French troops and Ansar ul Islam leaving four civilians dead. The clash involved support from an attack helicopter and led to the killing of ten militants. The conflict, which has been ongoing since 2015 and is interpreted as part of the insurgency in the Maghreb, has resulted in a humanitarian crisis with thousands of people killed, displacement of civilians, and reports of war crimes and summary executions by both sides. Jihadists have also targeted schools and terrorized villagers during their everyday lives."
84,163,"Canada has recently made changes to its mission in Ukraine under Operation Unifier. In a move that surprised many, the country withdrew military advisors from Ukraine and relocated them to an undisclosed location in Europe. Additionally, Canada moved its diplomatic staff to Lviv and suspended all operations at its embassy in Kyiv. Despite these changes, Canada has still committed to its broader mission under Operation Unifier, which includes helping the development of the region, maintaining security and democracy, providing humanitarian aid, and promoting economic stability and growth. The operation began in 2015 in coordination with the Ukrainian Armed Forces and also includes a small Swedish contingent. As of January 2022, there are 260 Canadian soldiers involved in providing training to Ukrainian troops, with more than 10,000 soldiers trained under Operation Unifier thus far."
85,165,"The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation is a European Union and Euratom regulation that allows the European Commission to take measures, including suspending payment of EU budget funds, against member states that violate the rule of law principles enshrined in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. In recent years, concerns about democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland have prompted the EU to take action. After years of stalling, the European Council and Parliament finally adopted the regulation in December 2020 with provisions that tie disbursements from the EU budget to adherence to rule of law standards. However, implementation has been delayed, with the European Council issuing declaratory statements in December 2020 addressing how the regulation should be implemented. The European Parliament has called on the Commission to avoid further delay in implementing the regulation, threatening legal action if necessary. Meanwhile, Hungary and Poland launched legal proceedings against the regulation, arguing it lacks a proper legal basis. However, on December 22nd, 2021, the European Court of Justice dismissed these challenges and confirmed the regulation's compliance with EU treaties, allowing the Commission to suspend EU budget funds to member states with rule of law issues affecting financial management."
86,166,"The Australian government designates certain organisations as terrorist organisations, including Hamas (including its political wing), Atomwaffen Division, Tahrir al-Sham, and the Guardians of Religion Organization. This list of designated organisations is maintained by the Attorney-General's Department and enables the government to deal with organisations involved in terrorism. The Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002 inserted a range of terrorist organisation offences into the Criminal Code Act 1995, including making it an offence to materially support or be supported by a listed terrorist organisation. It is illegal to finance terrorism under Division 103 of the Criminal Code Act 1995, and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) monitors financial transactions involving listed terrorist organisations. Australian anti-terrorism financing laws include sections such as 102.6, 102.7, 103.1, 103.2, and 119.4(5) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 and sections 20 and 21 of the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945. Prosecution of these offenses in Australia is overseen by the Australian Federal Police, State police forces, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions."
