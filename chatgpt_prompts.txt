Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the French and German governments to prepare for a possible military scenario of Russia\'s actions against Ukraine. On 15 November, Zelensky and the head of the European Council (EUCO) Charles Michel discussed "the security situation along the borders of Ukraine."
