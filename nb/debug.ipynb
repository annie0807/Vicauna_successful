As of 21 August, the Taliban has reportedly captured around two-thirds of the country and is now moving towards major cities, including Kabul. The international community, including the United States, has expressed concerns over the deteriorating security situation and the potential for a humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, the Afghan government has vowed to retake all seized districts by the Taliban, and local militias have formed to fight against the group, including the People's Resistance Movement of Western Afghanistan in Herat Province.\""

    "'{\"On 13 October 2021, a man shot eight people with a bow and arrow at locations in Kongsberg, Viken, Norway, a town about 70 kilometres (43 mi) southwest of the capital city Oslo. Five people were killed, and three others were injured. The suspect, identified as 37-year-old Espen Andersen Bråthen, a Danish citizen born in Norway, was subsequently taken into custody. <Summary> \\\\c\\\\cPolice were first notified of a person walking around Kongsberg with a bow and arrows in a quiver on his shoulder at 18:12 CEST. Upon receiving the first calls, a patrol was quickly sent to the location of the attack, followed by three others. Armed officers first confronted the perpetrator six minutes after the first calls, but he fired several arrows at them and escaped. Afterwards, he launched the attack and killed his victims, according to the police chief. <Attack> \\\\c\\\\cThe perpetrator is said to have first started firing inside a Coop Extra supermarket in Kongsberg and then moved over a large area. Pictures have been published of arrows lodged in walls at the scene. As the attack continued, police cordoned off several parts of Kongsberg. An arrest was eventually made at 18:47. A warning shot was fired at the time of the arrest, according to the police chief. <Attack> \\\\c\\\\cBy the time of the suspect\\'s arrest, the attack had spurred a large emergency response including 22 heavily-armed police patrols, more than ten ambulances, and two helicopters. The attack was the deadliest in Norway since the 2011 attacks committed by Anders Behring Breivik. <Attack> \\\\c\\\\cFive people were killed in the attack, and three others were injured. The five killed were four women and one man, aged 50 to 70 years. The three survivors did not sustain life-threatening injuries; one of them was an off-duty police officer. The investigation indicated that the victims were all attacked in different locations. <Victims> \\\\c\\\\cThe suspect was taken to a police station in Drammen, where his defence lawyer said he was questioned for more than three hours, was co-operating with authorities, and has confessed to the attack. The Norwegian Police Security Service launched a terrorism investigation. <Investigation> \\\\c\\\\cThe suspect is 37-year-old Espen Andersen Bråthen, who authorities believe acted alone. He was born in Norway to a Norwegian father and a Danish mother and had lived his entire life in the country. He was living in Kongsberg at the time of the attack. Bråthen was known to the police and had converted to Islam around 2016. Police had last been in contact with him in 2020, and they had been concerned about his possible extremist views. However, he did not appear on their radar in 2021. He has several prior criminal convictions for break-ins, cannabis possession, and threats against family members. <Suspect> \\\\c\\\\cNorwegian police constables, who are usually unarmed, were ordered to temporarily carry firearms nationwide after the attack. However, there was no change to the national threat level in the country. Questions were raised about the inability by police to stop the attack during their first confrontation with the perpetrator; officers in Norway are trained to immediately respond to an ongoing incident without waiting for other units. On the day after the attack, flags were flown at half-mast on all public buildings and candles were lit on the steps of Kongsberg Church.\"} <Aftermath> \\\\c\\\\c'\n",

    "'On 13 October 2021, a man shot eight people with a bow and arrow at locations in Kongsberg, Viken, Norway, a town about 70 kilometres (43 mi) southwest of the capital city Oslo. Five people were killed, and three others were injured. The suspect, identified as 37-year-old Espen Andersen Bråthen, a Danish citizen born in Norway, was subsequently taken into custody. <Summary> \\\\c\\\\cPolice were first notified of a person walking around Kongsberg with a bow and arrows in a quiver on his shoulder at 18:12 CEST. Upon receiving the first calls, a patrol was quickly sent to the location of the attack, followed by three others. Armed officers first confronted the perpetrator six minutes after the first calls, but he fired several arrows at them and escaped. Afterwards, he launched the attack and killed his victims, according to the police chief. <Attack> \\\\c\\\\cThe perpetrator is said to have first started firing inside a Coop Extra supermarket in Kongsberg and then moved over a large area. Pictures have been published of arrows lodged in walls at the scene. As the attack continued, police cordoned off several parts of Kongsberg. An arrest was eventually made at 18:47. A warning shot was fired at the time of the arrest, according to the police chief. <Attack> \\\\c\\\\cBy the time of the suspect\\'s arrest, the attack had spurred a large emergency response including 22 heavily-armed police patrols, more than ten ambulances, and two helicopters. The attack was the deadliest in Norway since the 2011 attacks committed by Anders Behring Breivik. <Attack> \\\\c\\\\cFive people were killed in the attack, and three others were injured. The five killed were four women and one man, aged 50 to 70 years. The three survivors did not sustain life-threatening injuries; one of them was an off-duty police officer. The investigation indicated that the victims were all attacked in different locations. <Victims> \\\\c\\\\cThe suspect was taken to a police station in Drammen, where his defence lawyer said he was questioned for more than three hours, was co-operating with authorities, and has confessed to the attack. The Norwegian Police Security Service launched a terrorism investigation. <Investigation> \\\\c\\\\cThe suspect is 37-year-old Espen Andersen Bråthen, who authorities believe acted alone. He was born in Norway to a Norwegian father and a Danish mother and had lived his entire life in the country. Bråthen was living in Kongsberg at the time of the attack. He has several prior criminal convictions for break-ins, cannabis possession, and threats against family members. <Suspect> \\\\c\\\\cBråthen was known to the police and had converted to Islam around 2016. Police had last been in contact with him in 2020, and they had been concerned about his possible extremist views. However, he did not appear on their radar in 2021. The chairman for the board of a Kongsberg mosque recalled Bråthen visiting the mosque three times years ago; according to him, Bråthen was tense and did not pray or know a lot about Islam. He considered contacting the police but did not have anything to go on. <Suspect> \\\\c\\\\cNorwegian police constables, who are usually unarmed, were ordered to temporarily carry firearms nationwide after the attack. However, there was no change to the national threat level in the country. Questions were raised about the inability by police to stop the attack during their first confrontation with the perpetrator; officers in Norway are trained to immediately respond to an ongoing incident without waiting for other units. On the day after the attack, flags were flown at half-mast on all public buildings and candles were lit on the steps of Kongsberg Church.\"} <Aftermath> \\\\c\\\\c'\n",
