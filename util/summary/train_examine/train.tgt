Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías (IPA: ) (born July 28, 1954) is the 53rd and current President of Venezuela. As the leader of the "Bolivarian Revolution," Chávez promotes his vision of democratic socialism, Latin American integration, and anti-imperialism.  He is also an ardent critic of neoliberal globalization and  US foreign policy. \c\cA career military officer, Chávez founded the leftist Fifth Republic Movement after orchestrating a failed 1992 coup détat against former president Carlos Andrés Pérez.  Chávez was elected President in 1998 on promises of aiding Venezuelas poor majority, and was reelected in 2000. Domestically, Chávez has launched massive Bolivarian Missions, whose goals are to combat disease, illiteracy, malnutrition, poverty, and other social ills. Abroad, Chávez has acted against the Washington Consensus by supporting alternative models of economic development, and has advocated cooperation among the worlds poor nations, especially those in Latin America. \c\cChávezs reforms have evoked exceptional controversy in Venezuela and abroad, receiving both criticism and praise. Venezuelans are split between those who say he has empowered the poor and stimulated economic growth, and those who say he is autocratic and has mismanaged the economy. Some foreign governments view Chávez as a threat to global oil prices and regional stability, while others welcome his bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements. \c\cIn May 2006, he was named one of Time magazines 100 most influential people.
The Iraq War (2003 to the present), also known as the Second Gulf War is an ongoing war started by the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following the successful overthrow of the then Iraq President Saddam Hussein, the subsequent occupation of Iraq by a United States-led coalition has resulted in ongoing asymmetric warfare between an insurgency and the occupying coalition forces and sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Iraqis.   The causes and consequences of the war remain controversial.

A political crisis began in Zimbabwe on 11 March 2007 when opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was beaten and tortured after being arrested, prompting widespread domestic and international criticism. \c\c14 March: Two female officers were seriously injured in a fire-bomb attack on a police station in Harare; the government blamed the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Similar attacks and other forms of protest took place in other parts of the country. \c\c15 March: President Robert Mugabe made a statement about Western criticism of his regime: "When they criticise the government when it tries to prevent violence and punish perpetrators of that violence we take the position that they can go hang.". \c\c17 March: Four ranking members of the opposition were refused permission to leave the country, some of them seeking treatment for injuries inflcited in police custody. MP Nelson Chamisa said he was beaten at Harare Airport; doctors later reported that he  had received a fractured skull. \c\c21 March: Levy Mwanawasa, president of neighbouring Zambia, likened the situation in Zimbabwe "to a sinking Titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives". \c\c21 March: The United States Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Christopher Dell, said that the countrys people had "turned a corner" and were "losing their fear". \c\c22 March: The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Bulawayo, Pius Ncube, called for mass public protests to bring pressure to bear on President Robert Mugabe to resign. \c\c23 March: The Prime Minister of Australia John Howard calls for the world to work towards ousting Mugabe. \c\c28 March: Morgan Tsvangirai is arrested in a raid on his headquarters.

The Palestinian Civil War began after the ruling Hamas party accused Fatah of trying to kill the Palestinian National Authority foreign minister after shots were earlier fired at his convoy in Gaza City on December 15, 2006. Mahmoud al-Zahar was unharmed in the attack but one of his bodyguards was killed and his son wounded. The violence is a continuation of the infighting that has left more than 600 Palestinians dead since January 2006.

Bhutto was twice elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, sworn in for the first time in 1988 only to be deposed 20 months later, under the controversial orders of then-president Ghulam Ishaq Khan, on grounds of alleged corruption. Benazir was re-elected to power in 1993, but again sacked by the President in 1996 on similar charges. \c\cBhutto had been living in exile in Dubai since 1999, until she returned to Pakistan on October 18, 2007. She is the eldest child of deposed premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a Pakistani of Sindhi extraction, and Begum Nusrat Bhutto, a Pakistani of Kurdish extraction. Benazir studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at the University of Oxford, and has an additional degree from Harvard University. Her paternal grandfather was Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto. \c\cBenazir did not make it onto the list of Forbes Magazines "100 most powerful women in politics", but in a section referring to female politicians, the article notes "Elsewhere on the Indian subcontinent, another woman may soon return to power. Pakistans ex-Premier Benazir Bhutto." Shortly after her return to Pakistan in October 2007, a suicide bombing apparently targeting Benazir claimed the lives of over 110 bystanders and injured over 200 others.

The United States presidential election of 2008, scheduled to be held on November 4, 2008, will be the 56th consecutive quadrennial election for president and vice president of the United States.  This presidential election schedule coincides with the  2008 Senate elections, House of Representatives elections, and gubernatorial elections, as well as many state and local elections. \c\cUnder Article Two of the United States Constitution, as amended by the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, an Electoral College will elect the president.  These electors are appointed by mechanisms chosen by each states legislature (prevailingly, by popular vote of the voters of each state).  The individual who receives a majority of votes for president — 270 votes are needed for a majority — will be the president-elect of the United States; and the individual who receives a majority of electoral votes for vice president will be the vice president-elect of the United States. If no presidential candidate receives a majority in the Electoral College, then the president-elect will be selected by a vote of the House of Representatives, with each state receiving a single vote. If no vice presidential candidate receives a majority, then the vice president-elect will be selected by a vote of the Senate.  Although rare, these latter scenarios have occurred twice in Americas history, in 1825 and 1837. \c\cAs in the 2004 presidential election, the allocation of electoral votes to each state will be partially based on the 2000 Census. The president-elect and vice president-elect are scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2009.
The current War in Chad began in December 2005. The conflict grew to involve troops from Chad, and rebel groups. These include the United Front for Democratic Change, Janjaweed, and the Alliance of Revolutionary Forces of West Sudan. The conflict has also involved Sudan which allegedly supports the rebels, while Libya has mediated the conflict, as well as diplomats from other countries. \c\cIn their statement, the Chadian government calls for the citizens of Chad to mobilize themselves against the "common enemy", referring to militant members of the Rally for Democracy and Liberty and Platform for Change, Unity and Democracy (SCUD) rebel groups — Chadian rebels, allegedly backed by the Sudanese government — and Sudanese Janjaweed militiamen who crossed over the border from Sudan while pursuing Fur refugees and raiding cities for treasure. The RDL denied receiving support from the Sudanese government. Between December 26 and December 28 RDL and SCUD joined with six other rebel groups to form the United Front for Democratic Change rebel alliance, led by Mohammed Nour. \c\cOn February 8, 2006 the Tripoli Agreement was signed, which brought a cease to the conflict for approximately two months.  The Government of Chad had estimated that 614 Chadian citizens were killed in that period. \c\cHowever, fighting persisted after that, leading to several new agreement attempts. In 2007, a rift between the main Zaghawa and Tama tribes of Chad emerged. The Zaghawa tribe, to which Chads President Idriss Déby belongs, accuses the Sudanese government of supporting members of the rival Tama tribe.

It will coincide with the 2008 Senate elections, House of Representatives elections, and gubernatorial elections, as well as many state and local elections. \c\cAs in the 2004 presidential election, the allocation of electoral votes to each state will be based partially on the 2000 Census. The president-elect and vice president-elect are scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2009.
A presidential election was held in Zimbabwe on March 29 2008, along with a parliamentary election on the same day. The three major candidates are Robert Mugabe of the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and Simba Makoni, an independent. The elections are expected, because of Zimbabwes dire economic situation, to provide President Mugabe with his toughest electoral challenge to date. Mugabes opponents have been critical of the handling of the electoral process, and the government has been accused of planning to rig the election; Human Rights Watch said that the election was likely to be "deeply flawed". \c\cIf no candidate wins a majority in the first round, a second round will be held in three weeks.
Cyclone Nargis (JTWC designation: 01B, also known as Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Nargis) was a strong tropical cyclone that made landfall on Myanmar (also known as Burma) in May 2008, causing catastrophic destruction and at least 22,000 fatalities in the process. Nargis was the first tropical cyclone to strike the country since Cyclone Mala made landfall in 2006. \c\cThe first named storm of the 2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Nargis developed on April 27 in the central Bay of Bengal. Initially it tracked slowly northwestward, and encountering favorable conditions it quickly strengthened. Dry air weakened the cyclone on April 29, though after beginning a steady eastward motion Nargis rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of at least 165 km/h (105 mph) on May 2; the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed peak winds of 215 km/h (135 mph). The cyclone moved ashore in the Ayeyarwady Division of Myanmar near peak intensity, and after passing near the major city of Yangon (Rangoon), the storm gradually weakened until dissipating near the border of Myanmar and Thailand.
The 2008 attack on Omdurman and Khartoum was a military advance by the Justice and Equality Movement, a Darfuri rebel group, against the Sudanese government in the cities of Omdurman and Khartoum. From the ruling governments viewpoint, the life of the invasion seems to have only taken place within the day of May 10, 2008, while JEM has countered the governments account with reports of heavy fighting in parts of the Khartoum metropolitan area into May 11. \c\cIt was the first time that fighting raging in western Sudan reached the capital, marking a dramatic widening of the conflict.

Cyclone Nargis (JTWC designation: 01B, also known as Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Nargis) was a strong tropical cyclone that caused the deadliest natural disaster in Burmas (also known as Myanmar) recorded history. The cyclone made landfall in the country on May 2, 2008, causing catastrophic destruction and at least 34,273 fatalities with a further 27,838  people still missing. However, Labutta Township alone was reported to have 80,000 dead and some have estimated the death toll may be well over 100,000. \c\cNargis is the deadliest named cyclone in the North Indian Ocean Basin, as well as the second deadliest named cyclone of all time, behind Typhoon Nina.  Including unnamed storms, Nargis is the 8th deadliest cyclone of all time.  Nargis was the first tropical cyclone to strike the country since Cyclone Mala made landfall in 2006. \c\cThe cyclone name "Nargis" (نرگس, IPA: næɵr-ɡɵs), is a Persian word meaning daffodil, although the word traveled into Urdu and the cyclone was named through that language. The first named storm of the 2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Nargis developed on April 27 in the central area of Bay of Bengal. Initially it tracked slowly northwestward and, encountering favorable conditions, it quickly strengthened. Dry air weakened the cyclone on April 29, though after beginning a steady eastward motion Nargis rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of at least 165 km/h (105 mph) on May 2; the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed peak winds of 215 km/h (135 mph). The cyclone moved ashore in the Ayeyarwady Division of Burma near peak intensity and, after passing near the major city of Yangon (Rangoon), the storm gradually weakened until dissipating near the border of Burma and Thailand. \c\cRelief efforts were slowed for political reasons as Myanmars military rulers initially resisted U.S aid. U.S. President George W. Bush said that an angry world should condemn the way Myanmars military rulers are handling the aftermath of a devastating cyclone. Myanmars ruling party finally accepted aid a few days later from the U.S after Indias request was accepted. Relief efforts were then further hampered by the 7.9 Mw magnitude Sichuan earthquake, which rocked nearby central China only ten days later, itself killing an estimated 12,000 people.
The 2008 Sichuan earthquake (Chinese: 四川大地震), or Great Sichuan Earthquake which measured at 8.0 Ms and 8.3 Mw according to the China Seismological Bureau, and 7.9 Mw according to USGS, occurred at 14:28:01.42 CST (06:28:01.42 UTC) on 12 May 2008 in Sichuan province of China. It was also known as the Wenchuan earthquake (Chinese: 汶川大地震), after the earthquakes epicenter in Wenchuan County in Sichuan province. The epicenter was 80 kilometres (50 mi) west-northwest of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, with a depth of 19 kilometres (12 mi). The earthquake was felt as far away as Beijing (1,500 km away) and Shanghai (1,700 km away), where office buildings swayed with the tremor. The earthquake was also felt in nearby countries. \c\cOfficial figures (as of May 25, 12:00 CST) state that 62,664 are confirmed dead, including 62,161 in Sichuan province, and 358,816 injured, with 23,775 listed as missing. The earthquake left about 4.8 million people homeless. It was the deadliest and strongest earthquake to hit China since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed at least 240,000 people. \c\cOn May 25 a major aftershock of 6.0 Mw hit in Qingchuan County, causing one death, 260 injuries, and the collapse of thousands of buildings.
The subprime mortgage crisis is an ongoing economic problem manifesting itself through liquidity issues in the global banking system owing to foreclosures which accelerated in the United States in late 2006 and triggered a global financial crisis during 2007 and 2008. The crisis began with the bursting of the US housing bubble and high default rates on  "subprime" and other adjustable rate mortgages (ARM) made to higher-risk borrowers with lower income or lesser credit history than "prime" borrowers.  Loan incentives and a long-term trend of rising housing prices encouraged borrowers to assume mortgages, believing they would be able to refinance at more favorable terms later.  However, once housing prices started to drop moderately in 2006–2007 in many parts of the U.S., refinancing became more difficult. Defaults and foreclosure activity increased dramatically as ARM interest rates reset higher.  During 2007, nearly 1.3 million U.S. housing properties were subject to foreclosure activity, up 79% from 2006. \c\cThe mortgage lenders that retained credit risk (the risk of payment default) were the first to be affected, as borrowers became unable or unwilling to make payments. Major banks and other financial institutions around the world have reported losses of approximately U.S. $379 billion as of May 21, 2008.  Owing to a form of financial engineering called securitization, many mortgage lenders had passed the rights to the mortgage payments and related credit/default risk to third-party investors via mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO).  Corporate, individual and institutional investors holding MBS or CDO faced significant losses, as the value of the underlying mortgage assets declined.  Stock markets in many countries declined significantly. \c\cThe widespread dispersion of credit risk and the unclear effect on financial institutions caused lenders to reduce lending activity or to make loans at higher interest rates.  Similarly, the ability of corporations to obtain funds through the issuance of commercial paper was affected.  This aspect of the crisis is consistent with a credit crunch.  The liquidity concerns drove central banks around the world to take action to provide funds to member banks to encourage the lending of funds to worthy borrowers and to re-invigorate the commercial paper markets. \c\cThe subprime crisis also places downward pressure on economic growth, because fewer or more expensive loans decrease investment by businesses and consumer spending, which drive the economy.  A separate but related dynamic is the downturn in the housing market, where a surplus inventory of homes has resulted in a significant decline in new home construction and housing prices in many areas. This also places downward pressure on growth.  With interest rates on a large number of subprime and other ARM due to adjust upward during the 2008 period, U.S. legislators, the U.S. Treasury Department, and financial institutions are taking action.  A systematic program to limit or defer interest rate adjustments was implemented to reduce the effect.  In addition, lenders and borrowers facing defaults have been encouraged to cooperate to enable borrowers to stay in their homes.  Banks have sought and received over $250 billion in additional funds from investors to offset losses. The risks to the broader economy created by the financial market crisis and housing market downturn were primary factors in several decisions by the U.S. Federal reserve to cut interest rates and the economic stimulus package passed by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush on February 13 2008. Both actions are designed to stimulate economic growth and inspire confidence in the financial markets.
The movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf is an August 2008 attempt by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N), Awami National Party (ANP), and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam to force Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf out of office.
The 2008 Democratic National Convention is a quadrennial presidential nominating convention of the Democratic Party where it adopted its national platform and officially nominated its candidates for President and Vice President of the United States. The convention is being held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 28, 2008, at the Pepsi Center. U.S. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the nominee for President, gave his acceptance speech on August 28 at INVESCO Field in what the party called an "Open Convention". Denver last hosted the Democratic National Convention in 1908. \c\cObama officially received the nomination for President on August 27, when his former opponent Hilary Clinton interrupted the official roll call to move that Obama be selected by acclamation. U.S. Senator Joe Biden of Delaware accepted the nomination for Vice President on the same night. Obama accepted his nomination the following night in a speech at INVESCO Field.
The 2008 unrest in Bolivia began with protests against President Evo Morales and calls for greater autonomy for the countrys eastern departments. Demonstrators escalated the protests by seizing natural gas infrastructure and government buildings. Violence between supporters of Morales and opponents has resulted in as many as eight deaths.
The Kivu conflict is an armed conflict between the military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and rebel forces under the command of Laurent Nkunda.
The Sri Lankan Civil War is an ongoing conflict on the island-nation of Sri Lanka. Since 23 July 1983, there has been on-and-off civil war, predominantly between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, also known as the Tamil Tigers), a separatist armed organization which fights for the creation of an independent state named Tamil Eelam in the north and the east of the island. \c\cOver 70,000 people have been officially listed as killed in the war since 1983. As one of the worlds deadliest ongoing armed conflicts, it has caused significant adversity to the population, environment and the economy of the country. The tactics employed by the Tamil Tigers have resulted in the organization being banned as a terrorist organization in 32 countries including the United States, Japan, Brazil, Australia, the nations of the European Union, and Canada. \c\cAfter two decades of fighting and three failed attempts at peace talks (including the unsuccessful deployment of the Indian Army as a peacekeeping force in 1987) a lasting negotiated settlement to the conflict appeared possible when a cease-fire was declared in December 2001, and a ceasefire agreement signed with international mediation in 2002. However limited hostilities renewed in late 2005 and the conflict continued slowly began to escalate until the government launched a number of major military offensives against the LTTE beginning in July 2006, and drove the LTTE out of the entire Eastern province of the island. The LTTE then declared they would "resume their freedom struggle to achieve statehood". \c\cThe government then shifted its offensive to the north of the country, and formally announced its withdrawal from the ceasefire agreement on January 2, 2008, alleging that the LTTE violated the agreement over 10,000 times. Since then, aided by the destruction of a number of large arms smuggling vessels that belonged to the LTTE, and an international crackdown on the funding for the Tamil Tigers, the government has taken control of 95% of the territory previously controlled by the Tamil Tigers, including their de-facto capital Kilinochchi, main military base Mullaithivu and the entire A9 highway. \c\cAs a result of the recent fighting, experts predict the long running conflict could soon come to an end, with the government taking over the final bit of territory controlled by the Tamil Tigers. However the rebels have vowed to fight on, and are expected to wage an underground guerrilla campaign, launching hit and run attacks against the military and suicide bombings around the country, if they are defeated as a conventional force. In February 2009, the United States, the European Union, Japan and Norway issued a joing statement urging the Tamil Tigers to lay down their arms and end hostilities against Sri Lanka, as there was just  a short time before the Tigers lost all the territory still under their control.
The Durban Review Conference is the official name of the 2009 United Nations World Conference Against Racism (WCAR), also known as Durban II. The conference is scheduled for the 20th to 24th of April 2009 at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. \c\cThe conference is called under the mandate of United Nations General Assembly resolution 61/149 (passed in 1996) with a mandate to review the implementation of the The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action from the 2001 World Conference Against Racism which took place in Durban, South Africa. \c\cAs of 19 April 2009, the governments of Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Sweden and the United States have announced that they will boycott the conference, citing what they describe to be severe flaws in the preparatory process; in particular, concerns that the conference will be used to promote anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, and laws against blasphemy. Other nations, such as Denmark have also stated that they may not attend. Western countries are bothered by draft declaration passages that single out Israel for criticism and what they see as offensive references made to it, passages relating to so-called defamation of religion, and the lack of a passage about discrimination against homosexuals. European countries also have criticized the meeting for focusing heavily on the West and ignoring problems of racism and intolerance in the developing world. Concern has also been expressed regarding the attendance of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the conference due his past statements on Israel and the Holocaust. \c\cIn a not-so-definitive move, the UK will send a delegation to the conference, but without a high-level official.

Air France Flight 447 was a scheduled commercial flight from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France, that crashed on 1 June 2009 over the Atlantic Ocean with the confirmed loss of all 228 crew members and passengers onboard. \c\cThe aircraft, an Air France Airbus A330-200, took off on 31 May 2009 at 19:03 local time (22:03 UTC). The last contact with the crew was a routine message to Brazilian air traffic controllers at 01:33 UTC, as the aircraft approached the edge of Brazilian radar surveillance over the Atlantic Ocean, en-route to Senegalese-controlled airspace off the coast of West Africa. Forty minutes later, a four-minute-long series of automatic radio messages was received from the plane, indicating numerous problems and warnings. The exact meanings of these messages are still under investigation, but the aircraft is believed to have been lost shortly after it sent the automated messages. After the aircraft failed to contact air traffic control on either continent, a search and rescue operation was initiated. \c\cOn 6 June, two bodies and debris from the aircraft were found 680 mi (1,090 km) northeast of the Fernando de Noronha islands off Brazils northern coast. The debris included a briefcase containing an airline ticket, later confirmed to have been issued for the flight. 39 more bodies have been found since, bringing the total number of confirmed fatalities to 41. This accident is the deadliest in the history of Air France, surpassing the crash of an Air France charter flight from Paris-Orly Airport to Atlanta on 3 June 1962, and the airlines first fatal crash since Air France Flight 4590 in July 2000. Paul-Louis Arslanian, the head of the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA, Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety), described it as the worst accident in French aviation history. It was also the first accident in commercial service resulting in fatalities in the 16-year operating history of the Airbus A330.

Both "Persia" and "Iran" are used interchangeably in cultural context; however, Iran is the name used officially in political context. The name Iran is a cognate of Aryan, and means "Land of the Aryans". \c\cThe 18th largest country in the world in terms of area at 1,648,195 km2, Iran has a population of over seventy million. It is a country of special geostrategic significance due to its central location in Eurasia. Iran is bordered on the north by Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. As Iran is a littoral state of the Caspian Sea, which is an inland sea and condominium, Kazakhstan and Russia are also Irans direct neighbors to the north. Iran is bordered on the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, on the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and on the west by Turkey and Iraq. Tehran is the capital, the countrys largest city and the political, cultural, commercial, and industrial center of the nation. Iran is a regional power, and holds an important position in international energy security and world economy as a result of its large reserves of petroleum and natural gas. \c\cIran is home to one of the worlds oldest continuous major civilizations, with historical and urban settlements dating back to 7000 BC. The first Iranian dynasty formed during the Elamite kingdom in 2800 BC. The Iranian Medes unified Iran into an empire in 625 BC. They were succeeded by three Iranian Empires, the Achaemenids, Parthians and Sassanids, which governed Iran for more than 1000 years. Iranian post-Islamic dynasties and empires expanded the Persian language and culture throughout the Iranian plateau. Early Iranian dynasties which re-asserted Iranian independence included the Tahirids, Saffarids, Samanids and Buyids. The blossoming of Persian literature, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, mathematics and art became major elements of Muslim civilization and started with the Saffarids and Samanids. Iran was once again reunified as an independent state in 1501 by the Safavid dynasty — who promoted Twelver Shia Islam as the official religion of their empire, marking one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam. "Persias Constitutional Revolution" established the nations first parliament in 1906, within a constitutional monarchy. Iran officially became an Islamic republic on 1 April 1979, following the Iranian Revolution. \c\cIran is a founding member of the UN, NAM, OIC and OPEC. The political system of Iran, based on the 1979 Constitution, comprises several intricately connected governing bodies. The highest state authority is the Supreme Leader. Shia Islam is the official religion and Persian is the official language.
The July 2009 Ürümqi riots broke out on 5 July 2009, in Ürümqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in northwestern China. They involved between 1,000 and 3,000 Uyghurs. The total death toll has risen to at least 156, according to Chinese government sources. Late in the day rioting had spread to the neighboring city of Kashgar, with conflicting reports claiming that rioters were "causing a rampage" and others reporting that police had fired on a group of protesting students. \c\cThe violence was part of an ongoing ethnic conflict between Han Chinese and Uyghurs, Turkic ethnic group that is predominantly Muslim and is one of the officially recognized ethnic groups in China. Many assume that these specific riots were sparked by dissatisfaction with the Chinese central governments handling of the deaths of two Uyghur workers in Guangdong province. Xinhua said more than 800 others have been injured and that many motor vehicles were burned. Police attempted to quell the riots with tear gas, water hoses, armored vehicles, and roadblocks.

The 2009 Pishin bombing occurred on October 18, 2009 when a suicide bomber detonated explosives at a meeting in the southeastern Iranian town of Pishin in Sistan and Baluchestan Province. The attack killed 48 people including several notable IRGC commanders. The Sunni rebel Jundallah group, with close links to Al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attack. \c\cIran initially blamed the United States for involvement in the attacks, as well as Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom for their alleged support of the Jundallah group. \c\cThe charge d'affaires of Pakistan was summoned by the Iranian Foreign Ministry as the attack was thought to have been launched from Pakistani soil. Iran accused Pakistani agents of involvement in the incident and called on Pakistan to apprehend the attackers.
The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake centred approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, striking at 16:53:09 local time (21:53:09 UTC) on Tuesday, 12 January 2010. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 13 kilometres (8.1 mi). The United States Geological Survey recorded a series of aftershocks, fourteen of them between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.9. The International Red Cross estimated that about three million people were affected by the quake, and the Haitian Interior Minister believes that up to 200,000 could be dead, exceeding earlier Red Cross estimates of 45,000–50,000 people killed.  A number of prominent public figures are among the dead. \c\cThe earthquake caused major damage to Port-au-Prince. Most major landmarks were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace (the President survived), the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail. To compound the tragedy, most hospitals in the area were destroyed. The United Nations reported that the headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), located in the capital, had collapsed and that the Missions Chief, Hédi Annabi, and his deputy were confirmed dead. Elisabeth Byrs of the U.N. called it the worst disaster the United Nations has experienced because the organizational structures of the U.N. in Haiti and the Haitian government were destroyed. The UN warned that the country may resort to lawlessness as up to three million survivors are not receiving needed food and water.
The 2010  Winter Olympics, officially  the XXI  Olympic Winter Games or the  21st Winter Olympics, will be a major international multi-sport event held on February 12–28, 2010, in Vancouver, British  Columbia, Canada, with some events held in the resort town of Whistler, British Columbia  and in the Vancouver suburbs of Richmond, West Vancouver and the University Endowment Lands.  Both the Olympic and Paralympic Games are being  organized by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC). The 2010 Winter Olympics will be the third Olympics  hosted by Canada.  Previously, Canada was home to the 1976 Summer  Olympics in Montreal, Quebec and the 1988 Winter  Olympics in Calgary, Alberta. \c\cFollowing  Olympic tradition, then Vancouver mayor Sam Sullivan received the Olympic flag  during the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The flag was raised on February  28, 2006, in a special ceremony, and will be on display at Vancouver City Hall until the Olympic opening  ceremony. The event will be officially opened by Governor General Michaëlle Jean.
Mahmoud Abdel Rauf al-Mabhouh (Arabic: محمود عبد الرؤوف المبحوح; February 14, 1960–January 19, 2010) was a senior Hamas military commander and one of the founders of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. \c\cAl-Mabhouh was killed in the Al Bustan Rotana Hotel in Dubai on January 19, 2010, having arrived in the country earlier that day from Syria.  It is suspected by Dubai police that he was murdered in his hotel room, with accounts of the cause of death ranging from suffocation to electrocution. Controversy has arisen over evidence indicating that his death may have been an Israeli government-sanctioned assassination, and the alleged assassins' use of fraudulently obtained European passports.
The sovereignty over the Falkland Islands  (Islas Malvinas in Spanish) is disputed between Argentina and the United Kingdom. \c\cThe British claim to de jure sovereignty dates from 1690, and the United Kingdom has exercised de facto sovereignty over the archipelago almost constantly since 1833.  Argentina has long disputed this claim, having been in control of the islands for a brief period prior to 1833.  The dispute escalated in 1982, when Argentina invaded the islands, precipitating the Falklands War. \c\cContemporary Falkland Islanders consider themselves to be British. They were given full British citizenship with the British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983, after the Falklands War.  Argentina argues that the islanders do not have a right to self-determination, based on the argument that they are not aboriginal and were brought to replace the Argentine population that Argentina claims was expelled after the re-establishment of British rule in 1833. The United Nations have called on both countries to begin dialogue over the sovereignty claim.
The 2010 Yushu earthquake struck on April 14, 2010, and registered a magnitude of 6.9 (USGS, EMSC) or 7.1 (Xinhua). It originated in Yushu, Qinghai, China, at 7:49 am local time.

The April 2010 Kohat bombings were a pair of bombings that struck a center for displaced people in the town of Kohat, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan, on April 17, 2010. At least 41 people were killed, while another 64 more were injured.
The second 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland on 14 April 2010 caused extensive air travel disruption.  In response to fears that ash ejected by the volcano would damage aircraft engines, the controlled airspace of many countries was closed to instrument flight rules (IFR, flying on instruments only) traffic in what became the largest air traffic shut-down since World War II. This action caused millions of passengers to be stranded not only in Europe, but across the world. The volcanic ash cloud has caused further disruptions to air travel operations in Northern Ireland and Scotland on the 4 and 5 May 2010. \c\cThe eruption occurred beneath glacial ice.  The cold water from the melting ice chilled the lava quickly, causing it to fragment into very small particles of glass (silica) and ash, which were carried into the eruption plume. Due to the extremely fine nature of the ash particles and the large volume of steam produced from the glacial meltwater, an ash plume that is hazardous to aircraft was rapidly sent high into the upper atmosphere. The presence and location of the plume depended upon the state of the eruption and the winds. Because of the way air masses function, and because of the large volume of steam produced by this eruption, the plume was injected into the jet stream. \c\cWith large parts of European airspace closed to air traffic, many more countries were affected as flights to and from Europe were cancelled. \c\cAt 20:00 UTC on 16 April the ash cloud reached Kazakhstan.  As of 17 April 2010, the eruption was continuing, but less explosively; the plume was rising to 5 kilometres (3 mi) rather than the 13 kilometres (8 mi) it was rising previously, not high enough to travel across Europe.  The forecast for 18 April at 06:00 showed a significant plume continuing over northern Europe. Jet stream forecasts indicated the ash cloud plume would persist until at least 21 April, shifting to the south and affecting more southerly parts of France and Italy. Icelands airspace remained relatively unaffected, being mainly upwind of the eruption site. \c\cThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated that the airline industry worldwide would lose €148 million (US$200 million, GB£130 million) a day during the disruption.
The 2010 Thai political protests are an ongoing series of protests against the ruling government in Thailand.  The protests are the result of an ongoing political crisis and turned violent in March–May 2010. \c\cAnger against Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajivas government was high throughout 2009, due to the controversial legal and military maneuvering that led to the formation of the government.  In February 2010, Abhisit tightened security in anticipation of a controversial Supreme Court ruling. When the 26 February ruling came, protest was limited, but the National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) announced it would organize a 14 March protest and call for new elections.  Abhisit further tightened security in anticipation of the protest.  The media was censored, and radio stations and television stations sympathetic to the protesters were shut down. \c\cThe 14 March protests were large and mostly peaceful, and demanded the dissolution of Parliament and general elections.  The protests were based at Phan Fah bridge on Ratchadamdoen Road and went on for several weeks. Dozens of bombs were set off away from the main protest location, but no one was injured and no arrests were made.  Tensions rose rapidly in early April, as protesters built barricades in the Ratchaprasong commercial district of Bangkok, shutting down commerce and traffic in the area.  On 8 April, Abhisit declared a state of emergency in Bangkok.  On 10 April, government troops attempted to disperse the protesters at Phan Fah, resulting in the deaths of 24 people and injuries to at least 800 others.  Negotiations between the government and the protesters failed to reach agreement on a date for elections.  On 22 April, a series of grenade attacks killed at least one person and injured 86 others. A UDD proposal to hold elections in three months was rejected outright by Abhisit on national TV.  On April 28, Thai security forces and anti-government protesters clashed on the outskirts of Bangkok, with troops firing both over and then directly into a crowd of Red Shirts to keep them from expanding their demonstrations. At least 16 protesters were wounded and one soldier was killed, although there were claims that the death was due to friendly fire. \c\cOn 3 May, Abhisit announced a reconciliatory roadmap which included elections on 14 November.  The roadmap was tentatively accepted by the protesters, but after additional conditions were set by the Red Shirt leaders, negotiations came to a halt.   Tensions then escalated as the military surrounded the protest area with armoured vehicles and armed personnel.  On the evening of Thursday 13 May, Khattiya Sawasdiphol ("Seh Daeng"), a renegade army general and prominent security advisor to the red shirts, was shot in the head by what was apparently a snipers bullet while he was giving an interview to The New York Times.  Seh Daengs shooting, which left him in a coma, kicked off an extended military crackdown on protesters, leading to 31 deaths (all of them civilians) and 230 injuries Sunday 10pm.  The state of emergency was expanded to 17 provinces nationwide on Thursday and the military later declared the protest area a "live fire zone."  Medical personel were banned from entering the protest zone.  On Sunday, protest leaders said again they were ready for talks as long as the Army pulled out its troops, but the government responsed that no conditions could be placed on talks.  A state of emergency was declared in 5 Northeastern provinces on Sunday afternoon.

The Gaza flotilla clash occurred in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea on 31 May 2010 when a six-ship flotilla which intended to break through the Gaza blockade was intercepted by the Israeli naval forces. Up to 19 pro-Palestinian activists aboard the ships were killed. Six Israeli commandos and around 60 activists were wounded. \c\cThe highly publicized Free Gaza Movements flotilla had planned to break through the Gaza blockade, despite Israeli declarations that they would turn the ships back and transfer the aid via land through Ashdod port. After the flotilla activists ignored repeated calls to turn back, Israeli soldiers boarded the ships, after the ship had raised a white flag to signal surrender. \c\cLive fire ensued during the boarding, with conflicting reports about the circumstances of the violence. The Israel Defense Forces said the activists opened fire with weapons they carried onboard, while activists said soldiers opened fire immediately after boarding. \c\cThe Israeli raid was widely condemned and criticized by European and Arab states, and the United Nations called for an investigation of the incident.
The Gaza flotilla raid occurred on 31 May 2010 in the international waters of the Mediterranean Sea, when Israeli naval forces seized a flotilla of six ships carrying 663 activists from 37 nations, known as the "Gaza Freedom Flotilla". The activists were planning to break through the  Israeli blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian supplies.  According to Israeli sources, the flotilla had refused to change its course to the port of Ashdod, where the Israeli government had said it would inspect the aid and deliver (or let humanitarian organizations deliver) non-banned items to Gaza, whereupon their forces boarded the flotilla.  Flotilla organizer Greta Berlin rejected Israels offer to deliver the humanitarian aid, stating, "This mission is not about delivering humanitarian supplies, its about breaking Israels siege on 1.5 million Palestinians". \c\cNine persons aboard the MV Mavi Marmara, the main ship of the convoy, were reportedly killed by Israeli soldiers when clashes broke out on the ship. Up to 60 activists and 10 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers were wounded in the clash. Israeli accounts claim that soldiers, wielding non-lethal paintball guns, were attacked as they boarded the boat, while passenger accounts claim that the Israelis began attacking the boat passengers prior to the boarding. \c\cInternational reaction has varied from strong criticism of Israel, to deep regret for the loss of life and requests for inquiries, with the United Nations Security Council condemning "those acts which resulted in the loss of at least 10 civilians and many wounded", and calling for "a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that "This is a clear case of self-defense. Israel cannot allow the free flow of weapons, rockets and missiles to  Hamas in Gaza.". \c\cIsrael said it would release all 620 people detained, and deport them back to their countries. The equipment found on the ships seized by the Israelis has been unloaded at the Ashdod port to be inspected before the Israeli government will allow it into Gaza by land. The UN Security Council called for "the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel".

The Summer 2010 Russian wildfires were a series of hundreds wildfires throughout western Russia in July and August 2010. As of 5 August 2010, the fires had destroyed approximately one fifth of the countrys grain crop and killed at least 48 people. The fires took hold across Russia, prompting seven regions of the country to declare a state of emergency. The fires are a result of a heatwave which affected much of the country in the middle of 2010. The heat, combined with peat fires on the outskirts of Moscow, caused a severe smog, the worst in nearly ten years which blanketed Moscow on 28 July 2010. \c\cPrime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin said it was "tense and dangerous". President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev abandoned his own holiday. \c\cOn 4 August Medvedev sacked some of his senior navy officers after one fire destroyed Russian navy equipment.

BlackBerry is a line of mobile e-mail and smartphone devices developed and designed by Canadian company Research In Motion (RIM) for 10 years. \c\cBlackBerry functions as a Personal Digital Assistant with address book, calendar and to-do list capabilities, it also functions as a portable media player with support for music and video playback and camera picture and video capabilities.  BlackBerry is primarily known for its ability to send and receive push Internet e-mail wherever mobile network service coverage is present, or through Wi-Fi connectivity. BlackBerry is mainly a messaging phone with the largest array of messaging features in a Smartphone today, this includes auto-text, auto-correct, text prediction, support for many languages, keyboard shortcuts, text emoticons, push email, push Facebook and Myspace notifications, push Ebay notifications, push instant messaging with BlackBerry Messenger, Google Messenger, ICQ, Windows Live messenger and Yahoo Messenger; threaded text messaging and a customizable indicator light near the top right of all Blackberry Devices. All notifications and conversations from applications are shown in a unified messaging application where third party applications can access too. Many of these applications would have to be running in the background of other phones versus BlackBerrys push, giving BlackBerry its renowned battery life. All data on the phone is compressed through BIS, BlackBerry uses around two thirds less data than any other smartphone, while downloading the same data. \c\cBlackBerry commands a 20.8% share of worldwide smartphone sales, making it the second most popular platform after Nokias Symbian OS. The consumer BlackBerry Internet Service, or BIS is available to 91 countries worldwide, on over 500 mobile service operators using various mobile technologies. \c\cThe first BlackBerry device was introduced in 1999 as a two-way pager. In 2002, the more commonly known smartphone BlackBerry was released, which supports push e-mail, mobile telephone, text messaging, Internet faxing, Web browsing and other wireless information services. It is an example of a convergent device. \c\cBlackBerry first made headway in the marketplace by concentrating on e-mail. RIM currently offers BlackBerry e-mail service to non-BlackBerry devices, such as the Palm Treo, through the BlackBerry Connect software. \c\cThe original BlackBerry device had a monochrome display, but all current models have color displays. All models except for the Storm Series had a built-in QWERTY keyboard, optimized for "thumbing", the use of only the thumbs to type. The Storm 1 and Storm 2 include a SureType keypad for typing, and are the two models that are full touch-screen devices with no physical keyboard. Originally, system navigation was achieved with the use of a scroll wheel mounted on the right side of phones prior to the 8700. The trackwheel was replaced by the trackball with the introduction of the Pearl series, the trackball allowed for 4 way scrolling and illuminated. The trackball was replaced by the optical trackpad with the introduction of the Curve 8500 series.   Models manufactured for use with iDEN networks such as Nextel and Mike) also incorporate a Push-to-Talk (PTT) feature, similar to a two-way radio. \c\cModern GSM-based BlackBerry handhelds incorporate an ARM 7 or 9 processor, while older BlackBerry 950 and 957 handhelds used Intel 80386 processors. The latest GSM BlackBerry models (8100, 8300 and 8700 series) have an Intel PXA901 312 MHz processor, 64 MB flash memory and 16 MB SDRAM. \c\cCDMA BlackBerry smartphones are based on Qualcomm MSM6x00 chipsets which also include the ARM 9-based processor and GSM 900/1800 roaming (as the case with the 8830 and 9500) and include up to 256MB flash memory. The CDMA Bold 9650 is the first to have 512mb flash memory for applications. All modern BlackBerrys support up to 32gb microSD cards.

The United Nations estimates over 20 million people are suffering, exceeding the combined total of the affectees of 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  Around a fifth of Pakistans total land area was impacted by the flooding. UN Secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon said that it was the worst disaster he had ever seen, and asked for an initial $460 million for emergency relief, 20% of which had been received as of August 15, 2010.

The 2010 Copiapó mining accident was a mining accident that occurred on August 5, 2010, when the San José copper-gold mine, near Copiapó, Chile, collapsed, leaving 33 miners trapped several hundred meters below ground. \c\cThe miners have set a world record for the length of time workers have survived trapped underground after a mining accident. \c\cThe San José Mine is about 45 kilometres (28 mi) north of Copiapó, in the north of the country. The miners are trapped at approximately 700 metres (2,300 ft) deep and about 5 kilometres (3 mi) from the mine entrance. The mine had a history of instability that had led to previous accidents, including one death. A government report from July 2010 warned that the mine owners had failed "to reinforce the roof ...". The lack of reinforcement "had led to  collapse of the roof." There has been controversy over why the mine was not closed down earlier. \c\cSome, including lawyers representing the mining company, suspect that the owners of the mine will declare bankruptcy after the men are rescued.
The 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to imprisoned Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo "for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China." A co-author of the Charter 08 manifesto and veteran of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he was sentenced to 11 years in prison by Chinese authorities on Christmas Day 2009. Liu defeated a record number of nominations - more than 200 - to secure the award. \c\cIntellectuals and politicians from the international community praised the decision, though the Chinese government expressed dismay. Censorship was experienced during attempts to broadcast news of the award to Chinese citizens via the internet, television and print media. China summoned the Norwegian ambassador in Beijing "to officially share their opinion, their disagreement and their protest." Those who attempted to celebrate were arrested. \c\cLiu was the first Chinese person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The awarding of a Nobel Prize to a Chinese person while inside the country was an unusual occurrence, though Chinese scientists had previously received a Nobel Prize for work done outside the country, and Gao Xingjian, a resident of Paris, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2000.

Medvedev agreed to attend after meeting with President of France Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel.
The 2008–2010 Irish financial crisis is a major ongoing economic crisis in Ireland that is in part responsible for the country falling into recession for the first time since the 1980s. The Irish government officially announced it was in recession in September 2008, with a sharp rise in unemployment occurring in the following months. The Republic of Ireland was the first state in the Eurozone to enter recession as declared by the Central Statistics Office. \c\cThe numbers of people claiming unemployment benefit in Ireland rose to 326,000 in January 2009, the highest monthly level since records began in 1967. Amidst the crisis, which has coincided with a series of banking scandals, the ruling Fianna Fáil party fell to third place in an opinion poll conducted by The Irish Times. The party placed behind Fine Gael and Labour, the latter rising above Fianna Fáil for the first time. \c\cThe weakening conditions drew 120,000 protesters onto the streets of Dublin on 21 February 2009, amidst further threats of protests and industrial action. On 24 February, Dublins ISEQ index fell over 3% to stand at 1,987 points, a 14-year low. The last time it stood under the 2,000 level was the middle of 1995; it had reached 10,000 points briefly in April 2007. This occurrence followed the unexpected resignation of former Anglo Irish Bank director Anne Heraty from the board of the Irish Stock Exchange the night before.

WikiLeaks is an international non-profit media organization that publishes submissions of otherwise unavailable documents from anonymous news sources and leaks. Its website, launched in 2006, is run by The Sunshine Press. Within a year of its launch, the site claimed a database that had grown to more than 1.2 million documents. \c\cThe organization has described itself as having been founded by Chinese dissidents, as well as journalists, mathematicians, and start-up company technologists from the United States, Taiwan, Europe, Australia, and South Africa. Newspaper articles and The New Yorker magazine describe Julian Assange, an Australian Internet activist, as its director. \c\cWikiLeaks has won a number of awards, including the 2008 Economist magazine New Media Award. In June 2009, WikiLeaks and Julian Assange won Amnesty Internationals UK Media Award (in the category "New Media") for the 2008 publication of "Kenya: The Cry of Blood – Extra Judicial Killings and Disappearances", a report by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights about police killings in Kenya. In May 2010, the New York Daily News listed WikiLeaks first in a ranking of "websites that could totally change the news". \c\cIn April 2010, WikiLeaks posted video from a 2007 incident in which Iraqi civilians and journalists were killed by U.S. forces, on a website called Collateral Murder. In July of the same year, WikiLeaks released Afghan War Diary, a compilation of more than 76,900 documents about the War in Afghanistan not previously available for public review. In October, the group released a package of almost 400,000 documents called the Iraq War Logs in coordination with major commercial media organisations. In November, Wikileaks began releasing U.S. State department diplomatic cables. \c\cWikiLeaks was launched as a user-editable "wiki" site and still uses MediaWiki as the content management system, but has progressively moved towards a more traditional publication model, and no longer accepts either user comments or edits.
Julian Paul Assange (/əˈsɑːnʒ/ ə-SAHNZH; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian journalist, publisher and internet activist. He is best known as the spokesperson and editor-in-chief for WikiLeaks, a whistleblower website. Before working with the website, he was a physics and mathematics student as well as a computer programmer.  He has lived in several countries and has told reporters he is constantly on the move. He makes irregular public appearances to speak about freedom of the press, censorship, and investigative reporting; he has also won several journalism awards for his work with WikiLeaks. \c\cAssange founded the controversial WikiLeaks website in 2006 and serves on its advisory board. In this capacity, he has been involved in the publication of material documenting extrajudicial killings in Kenya, a report of toxic waste dumping on the African coast, Church of Scientology manuals, Guantánamo Bay procedures, and material involving large banks such as Kaupthing and Julius Baer among other documents.  He has recently received widespread public attention for the publication of classified material from WikiLeaks documenting details about the involvement of the United States in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  On 28 November 2010, WikiLeaks and its five media partners began publishing the United States diplomatic cables leak.  According to The Guardian, this has placed Assange "at the centre of intense media speculation and a hate campaign against him in America". \c\cOn 30 November 2010, Interpol placed Assange on its red notice list of wanted persons; concomitantly, a European Arrest Warrant was issued for him. He is wanted for questioning on suspicion of "sex crimes"; this does not refer to suspicion of non-consensual sex, but to a condom breaking during consensual sex.  He has not been formally charged with any crime.  Mark Stephens, a British legal representative of Assange, said "It is highly irregular and unusual for the Swedish authorities to issue a red notice in the teeth of the undisputed fact that Mr Assange has agreed to meet voluntarily to answer the prosecutors questions".

Before working with the website, he was a physics and mathematics student as well as a computer programmer.  He has lived in several countries and has told reporters he is constantly on the move. He makes irregular public appearances to speak about freedom of the press, censorship, and investigative reporting; he has also won three journalism awards for his work with WikiLeaks. \c\cAssange founded the controversial WikiLeaks website in 2006 and serves on its advisory board. In this capacity, he has been involved in the publication of material documenting extrajudicial killings in Kenya, a report of toxic waste dumping on the African coast, Church of Scientology manuals, Guantanamo Bay procedures, and material involving large banks such as Kaupthing and Julius Baer among other documents.  He has recently received widespread public attention for the publication of classified material from WikiLeaks documenting details about the involvement of the United States in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  On 28 November 2010, WikiLeaks and its five media partners began publishing the United States diplomatic cables leak.  According to The Guardian, this has placed Assange "at the centre of intense media speculation and a hate campaign against him in America". \c\cOn 30 November 2010, Interpol placed Assange on its red notice list of wanted persons; concomitantly, a European Arrest Warrant was issued for him. He is wanted for questioning on suspicion of "sex crimes"; it is reported that while having consensual sex his condom broke and he either did not disclose the breakage to his partner or continued after his partner asked him to stop. He was arrested in Britain by the London Metropolitan Police on 7 December. He has not been formally charged with any crime.
The 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to imprisoned Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo "for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China". The laureate, a little-known figure inside China due to official censorship, is a veteran of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and co-author of the Charter 08 manifesto for which he was sentenced to 11 years in prison by Chinese authorities on 25 December 2009. Liu was chosen over a record number of nominations – more than 200 – to receive the award. \c\cIntellectuals and politicians from the international community praised the decision, although the Chinese government bitterly attacked the decision. Heavy official censorship was applied on the Internet, on television and in the print media inside China following the announcement. The Chinese government denounced the award as "blasphemy", and summoned the Norwegian ambassador in Beijing "to officially share their opinion, their disagreement and their protest." Chinese citizens who attempted to celebrate were arrested. Lius wife was put under house arrest before the Nobel Committees decision was announced. In November, the Chinese Embassy in Oslo circulated a Note verbale to all other foreign diplomatic missions in Oslo requesting that their countries do not attend the award ceremony on 10 December. \c\cLiu is the first Chinese person (excluding the 14th Dalai Lama, a refugee) to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the first to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China (several Chinese scientists had previously received Nobel Prizes for work done outside the country, and Chinese-born French national Gao Xingjian was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2000).  Liu is also the third person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize while in prison or detention, after Germanys Carl von Ossietzky (1935) and Myanmars Aung San Suu Kyi (1991).

This is a list of notable content from the United States diplomatic cables leak which began on 28 November 2010 when the website of WikiLeaks — an international new media non-profit organisation that publishes submissions of otherwise unavailable documents from anonymous news sources and news leaks — started to publish classified documents of detailed correspondence — diplomatic cables — between the United States Department of State and its diplomatic missions around the world. Since the initial release date, WikiLeaks is releasing further documents every day.
The 2011 Tucson shooting occurred on Saturday, January 8, 2011.  Eighteen people were shot, six of them fatally, during a United States congresswomans meeting with constituents held in a supermarket parking lot in Casas Adobes, a suburb of Tucson. The dead include a nine-year-old girl; a congressional aide; and John McCarthy Roll, the chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat representing Arizonas 8th congressional district, said to be the target of the attack, was shot through the head at close range and is in critical condition. A 22-year-old local man, Jared Lee Loughner, was arrested at the scene, and is being questioned by the FBI. The motive for the shooting is currently unclear, with media reports focusing on the mental health of the shooter.
A series of floods have been affecting northeastern Australia, primarily in the state of Queensland, since October 2010.  The floods have forced the evacuation of thousands of people from towns and cities. At least 22 towns and over 200,000 people have been affected. Damage initially was estimated at around AU$1bn (£650m). This estimate was later revised up to AU$10-11bn. \c\cVast areas of Southern and Central Queensland, an area the size of Germany and France combined, were affected by the flood. About 300 roads were closed, including nine major highways. Coal railway lines were closed and numerous mine sites flooded. The floods have boosted fruit and vegetable prices.
The 2011 Brazilian floods refers to a series of floods which occurred in January 2011 in several towns in the Montainous Region (Região Serrana) in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro. Worst hit were the cities of Teresópolis, Nova Friburgo and Petrópolis, where casualties occurred. The floods have caused at least 271 deaths so far. The floods resulted from heavy rain and were accompanied by mudslides and landslides. \c\cThe three cities that reported human casualties are located in a mountainous area, in the neighborhood of the Serra dos Órgãos state park. The area is a touristic hotspot due to its geographic features, historical landmarks and mild temperatures. Many buildings, however, are directly exposed to landslide hazards because of the steep terrain. In a 24-hour period between 11 and 12 January 2011, the local weather service registered more rainfall than what is expected for the entire month. Flooding of extensive areas in the region followed immediately. The disaster caused extensive property damage and the supply of public utilities such as electricity, running water and phone lines was affected. Around 2960 people had their homes destroyed. Newspaper O Dia called the floods "the biggest catastrophe in the history of the region.". \c\cPresident Dilma Rousseff declared that an emergency R$ 780 million ($466.2 million) budget would become available for reconstruction work.  Acting governor Luís Fernando Pezão sent reinforcements to the affected region and requested urgent federal assistance in machinery, helicopters and manpower. Rescue efforts were led by municipal governments, which also provided shelter and amenities for the newly homeless, often in schools. The Brazilian Navy and the Rio de Janeiro state government will set up field hospitals to assist the victims, while CEDAE will send in 13 tank trucks with clean water. Oil company Petrobras offered 13 helicopters to support rescue workers. \c\cFashion stylist and designer Daniela Conolly died in a mudslide in Itaipava, Petrópolis, along with seven family members.
A series of floods hit Australia, beginning in December 2010, primarily in the state of Queensland and its capital city, Brisbane. The floods have forced the evacuation of thousands of people from towns and cities. At least 70 towns and over 200,000 people have been affected. Damage initially was estimated at around A$1bn (£633m). The estimate of lost revenue from Australias GDP is about A$13 billion. Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser said it was not possible to put a figure on the damage; "other than to say the damage bill is going to start with a b and not an m". \c\cThree-quarters of the state of Queensland has been declared a disaster zone—an area larger than Texas and California combined. The 2010–2011 floods have killed at least 30 and the death toll is expected to rise.
The 2011 Dakar Rally was the 32nd running of the event. It was held in Argentina and Chile for the third successive time, and ran from 1 to 16 January. The Amaury Sport Organisation and the governments of Argentina and Chile agreed to a return to South America for the event on 23 March 2010. \c\cThe rally concluded in Buenos Aires, with Vladimir Chagin of Russia achieving a record seventh victory, at the wheel of his Kamaz truck, thus becoming the most successful pilot in the history of the event. Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar and Timo Gottschalk of Germany won in the car division, giving Volkswagen their third successive victory in the car class. Marc Coma from Spain won his third Dakar in the motorcycle category, and Alejandro Patronelli of Argentina repeated the feat of his brother — Marcos Patronelli in 2010 — to win the class for quad-bikes.
The 2010–2011 Tunisian protests are ongoing fatal protests taking place in numerous towns across Tunisia which led President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to step down from his presidency on 14 January 2011 after 23 years in power. Protestors rioted over unemployment, food inflation, corruption, freedom of speech and poor living conditions. The protests, which began in December 2010 after a fruit and vegetable seller set himself on fire after police confiscated his produce, alleging he did not have the necessary permit. constitute the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades and have resulted in scores of deaths and casualties. \c\cThe protests have also been called the Jasmine Revolution in the western media in line with media termings of colour revolutions.

Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi is a tropical cyclone threatening northern Queensland, Australia. Yasi originated from a tropical low near Fiji. The system intensified to a Category 3 cyclone at about 5 pm on 31 January 2011. Late on 1 February the cyclone strengthened to a Category 4 system, then early on 2 February, the cyclone intensified to a Category 5 system. \c\cA Bureau of Meteorology Technical Bulletin issued at 5 am AEST on 2 February indicated at 4 am AEST the system was centred near 15°42′S 151°42′E\ufeff / \ufeff15.700°S 151.700°E\ufeff / -15.700; 151.700, approximately 650 km east north-east of Cairns, with a central pressure of 924 hectopascals. \c\cAccording to the technical bulletin, it is predicted at 4 pm (AEST) on 2 February that the system will be centred within 95km of 16°48′S 148°06′E\ufeff / \ufeff16.800°S 148.100°E\ufeff / -16.800; 148.100 (a location 250 km East of Cairns), with a central pressure of 924 hectopascals and maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h. \c\cThe commentary on this data indicates that "models are quite consistent with the forecast motion" and adds "with the expectation of being a large and intense system, cyclone intensity may be maintained further inland than normal."
Project Merlin is an agreement between the Britih Government of David Cameron and major high street banks in the United Kingdom covering aspects of banking activity, notably lending, pay and bonuses. The agreement was struck in February 2011. \c\cProject Merlin was announced on 9 February 2011 by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. Under the agreement banks will lend about £190bn to businesses during 2011 - including £76bn to small firms - curb bonuses and reveal some salary details of their top earners. The Bank of England will monitor whether loans targets are being met. This was in addition to the government increasing its levy on banks to £2.5bn in 2011 - raising an extra £800m. HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Lloyds Banking Group have signed up to the Project Merlin agreement, while Santander has agreed to the lending parts of the deal. Other pledges include providing £200m of capital for David Camerons Big Society Bank, which is supposed to finance community projects.
The 2010–2011 Middle East and Arab world protests are an unprecedented series of major uprisings, demonstrations and protests in the Arab countries of Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan and Iran, with minor incidents occurring in Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Morocco. The protests have shared an extensive use of techniques of civil resistance in sustained campaigns involving strikes, demonstrations, and other such methods. The Tunisian and Egyptian protests have been referred to as revolutions. The protests have been the outcome of a host of issues varying from one nation to the other—ranging from rigged elections, kleptocratic and crony-capitalist rule in Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt and Yemen, to rising prices and corruption in Gulf countries; from determination of protesters to overhaul or uproot the existing system and political hierarchies in Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt and Yemen, to demands for reforms in Jordan, Oman, etc. \c\cMany factors have led to the protests, including accusations of government corruption, human rights violations and extreme poverty. Increasing food prices and rates of famine globally have also been a major reason, involving threats to food security worldwide and prices approaching levels seen during the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. \c\cThe protests began on December 18, 2010 with an uprising turning into a revolution in Tunisia, following Mohamed Bouazizis self-immolation in protest at police corruption and ill-treatment. Due to similar hardships in the region and ultimately successful protests in Tunisia, a chain of unrest was started which was followed by protests in Algeria, Jordan, Egypt and Yemen, and to a lesser degree in other Arab states. In many cases the climactic days have been termed "day of rage," or some variation thereof. \c\cSo far, two governments have been toppled—in Tunisia on January 14 and Egypt on February 11. The first government to be overthrown as a result of the protests was Tunisias (an event termed the Jasmine Revolution in the Western media) when former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. World attention then focused on Egypt, where massive protests began on 25 January 2011. After four days of protests, President Mubarak, who has ruled Egypt for 30 years, offered reforms but not his personal resignation, which was the goal of the protesters. On the eighth day and as protests continued, even attracting more numbers of protesters of all social classes, he announced he would step down only in September, and would not seek another presidential term in the forthcoming election. Around the same time, Jordans King Abdullah named a new prime minister and the president of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, announced that he, too, would not seek another term in office, after 32 years of rule. After eighteen days of non-stop protests in major cities in Egypt, Mubarak finally resigned on February 11. \c\cThe protests have drawn great attention and concern from around the world. The possibility has been raised of the protests being nominated for the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize.
The 2010–2011 Arab world protests are an ongoing unprecedented series of major uprisings, demonstrations and protests that began in the predominantly Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa. Western Sahara, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Bahrain, Yemen, Jordan, and Libya have seen major protests, and minor incidents have occurred in Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Morocco and Kuwait. The protests have shared extensive use of techniques of civil resistance in sustained campaigns involving strikes, demonstrations, marches, and rallies, as well as the use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter to organise, communicate, and raise awareness in the face of attempts at state repression. Some of these events, notably the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, which have ended in regime change, have been called revolutions. \c\cNumerous factors have led to the protests, including accusations of government corruption, dictatorship, human rights violations and extreme poverty. Increasing food prices and rates of famine globally have also been a major reason, involving threats to food security worldwide and prices approaching levels seen during the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. \c\cThe protests began on October 10, 2010 in the Western Sahara and December 18, 2010 with an uprising turning into a revolution in Tunisia, following Mohamed Bouazizis self-immolation in protest at police corruption and ill-treatment. Due to similar hardships in the region and ultimately successful protests in Tunisia, a chain of unrest was started which was followed by protests in Algeria, Jordan, Egypt and Yemen, and to a lesser degree in other Arab states.

In Egypt, massive protests began on January 25, and after 18 days of non-stop protests, President Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years resigned on February 11. Around the same time, Jordans King Abdullah named a new prime minister and the president of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, announced that he would not seek another term in office in 2013, after what would then be 35 years of rule. \c\cBoth the volatility of the protests and their profound geopolitical implications have drawn great attention and concern from around the world. The possibility has been raised of the protesters being nominated for the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize.

The Tunisian Revolution is an intensive campaign of civil resistance, including a series of street demonstrations taking place in Tunisia. The events began in December 2010 and led to the ousting of longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. Street demonstrations and other unrest have continued to the present day. \c\cThe demonstrations were precipitated by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of freedom of speech and other political freedom and poor living conditions. The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades and have resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators. The protests were sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on December 17 and led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 28 days later on 14 January 2011, when he officially resigned after fleeing to Saudi Arabia, ending 23 years in power. Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests. The protests inspired similar actions throughout the Arab world; the Egyptian revolution began after the events in Tunisia and also led to the ousting of Egypts longtime president Hosni Mubarak; furthermore, protests have also taken place in Algeria, Yemen, Libya, Jordan, Pakistan and elsewhere in the wider Middle East and North Africa. \c\cFollowing Ben Alis departure, a state of emergency was declared. A caretaker coalition government was also created, including members of Ben Alis party, the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), in key ministries, while including other Opposition figures in other ministries, with elections to take place within 60 days. However, five newly-appointed non-RCD ministers resigned almost immediately, and daily street protests in Tunis and other towns around Tunisia continued, demanding that the new government have no RCD members and that the RCD itself be disbanded. On 27 January Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi reshuffled the government, removing all former RCD members other than himself. On 6 February the new interior minister suspended all party activities of the RCD, citing security reasons.

The 2011 Sendai earthquake and tsunami (東北地方太平洋沖地震, Tōhoku Chihō Taiheiyō-oki Jishin, literally "Tōhoku region Pacific Ocean offshore earthquake") was an 8.8 to 9.1-MW  megathrust earthquake at 05:46 UTC (14:46 local time) on 11 March 2011. The earthquake focus was reported to be 130 kilometres off the east coast of the Oshika Peninsula, Tōhoku at a depth of 24.4 kilometers (15.2 miles). It was locally measured at 7, the maximum on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, in the northern Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. \c\cThe earthquake created tsunami waves of up to 10 meters (33 ft) that struck Japan. News reports indicate that 19,747 deaths, people have died and 2,556 people missing are missing in six different prefectures. \c\cThe estimates of its magnitude would make it the largest earthquake to hit Japan and one of the five largest earthquakes in the world since modern record-keeping began.

The epicenter was reported to be 130 kilometers (81 mi) off the east coast of the Oshika Peninsula, Tōhoku, with the hypocenter at a depth of 24.4 kilometers (15.2 miles). It was locally measured at the maximum possible 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale in the northern Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. \c\cThe earthquake triggered tsunami warnings and evacuations for Japans Pacific coast and at least 20 countries, including the entire Pacific coast of North America and South America. The earthquake created tsunami waves of up to 10 meters (33 ft) that struck Japan and many other countries. In Japan, the waves are reported to have travelled up to 6 miles inland. \c\cThe earthquake caused extensive damage in Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and more than a million households without water. Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least two nuclear reactors were damaged, which prompted evacuations of the affected areas. One of the nuclear reactors has since experienced an explosion of some kind. \c\cNews reports indicate that 19,747 deaths, people have died and 2,556 people missing are missing in six different prefectures. The estimates of its magnitude would make it the largest earthquake to hit Japan and one of the five largest earthquakes in the world since modern record-keeping began. It is thought to have been the largest earthquake in Japan in the past 1,200 years.
The 2011 Sendai earthquake and tsunami was an 8.9-magnitude earthquake that created tsunami waves of up to 10 metres (33 ft). It was measured at 7 on the JMA seismic intensity scale in the northern Miyagi prefecture, while the Japan Meteorological Agencys tsunami warning listed the magnitude as 8.8. The epicenter was reported to be off the Oshika Peninsula, the east coast of Tohoku, Japan on Friday, March 11, 2011 at 05:46 UTC (2:46 p.m. local time) at a depth of 24.4 kilometres (15.2 miles). Reports show that 32 people have died. \c\cThe magnitude of 8.9 made it the largest earthquake to hit Japan in recorded history and the seventh largest in the world since records began.
The 2011 Sendai earthquake and tsunami (東北地方太平洋沖地震, Tōhoku Chihō Taiheiyō-oki Jishin, literally "Tōhoku region Pacific Ocean offshore earthquake") was a 9.0 MW megathrust earthquake off the coast of Japan that occurred at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) on 11 March 2011. The epicenter was reported to be 130 kilometers (81 mi) off the east coast of the Oshika Peninsula, Tōhoku, with the hypocenter at a depth of 24.4 km (15.2 mi). \c\cThe earthquake triggered tsunami warnings and evacuations from Japans Pacific coast and at least 20 countries, including the entire Pacific coast of North America and South America. The earthquake created tsunami waves of up to 10 meters (33 ft) that struck Japan, with smaller waves in many other countries, with a significant surge and damage as far away as Chile, almost exactly on the opposite side of the world from Japan. In Japan, the waves are reported to have travelled up to 10 km (6 mi) inland. \c\cThe Japanese National Police Agency has officially confirmed 19,747 deaths, deaths, 6,242 injured, injuries, and 2,556 people missing people missing across sixteen prefectures, but estimated numbers are far higher. The earthquake caused extensive damage in Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.4 million without water. Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least two nuclear reactors partially melted down, which prompted evacuations of the affected areas, and a state of emergency was established. The Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant experienced an explosion almost 24 hours after the initial earthquake; however, while the blast caused the collapse of the concrete outer containment building, it was reported that the integrity of the inner core-containment vessel was not compromised. Residents within a 20 km (12 mi) radius of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and a 10 km (6.2 mi) radius of the Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated. \c\cThe estimates of the Sendai earthquakes magnitude made it the most powerful earthquake to hit Japan and one of the four most powerful earthquakes in the world overall since modern record-keeping began in 1900.

The epicenter was 130 kilometers (81 mi) off the east coast of the Oshika Peninsula, Tōhoku, with the hypocenter at a depth of 32 km (20 mi). \c\cThe earthquake triggered tsunami warnings and evacuations along Japans Pacific coast and in at least 20 countries, including the entire Pacific coast of North America and South America. The earthquake created extremely destructive tsunami waves of up to 10 meters (33 ft) that struck Japan minutes after the quake, in some cases travelling up to 10 km (6 mi) inland, with smaller waves reaching many other countries after several hours. \c\cThe Japanese National Police Agency has officially confirmed 19,747 deaths, deaths, 6,242 injured, injuries, and 2,556 people missing people missing across 16 prefectures. The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive and severe damage in Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water. Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least three nuclear reactors suffered explosions due to hydrogen buildup within the outer containment buildings.  According to reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), containment of each of the radioactive cores is intact and no meltdowns have occurred.   Residents within a 20 km (12 mi) radius of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and a 10 km (6.2 mi) radius of the Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated. \c\cThe estimates of the Sendai earthquakes magnitude made it the strongest known earthquake to hit Japan, and one of the the five strongest earthquakes in the world overall since modern record-keeping began in 1900. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said that "in the 65 years after the end of World War II, this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan." The earthquake moved Honshu 2.4 m (7.9 ft) east and shifted the Earth on its axis by almost 10 cm (3.9 in), an expected change for an earthquake of that magnitude. Early estimates from AIR Worldwide place insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered ¥15 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March 2011 to normalize market conditions.

The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive and severe damage in Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.4 million without water. Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least three nuclear reactors partially melted down, which prompted evacuations of the affected areas, and a state of emergency was established. Both reactors believed to have partially melted down have experienced a chemical explosion extensively damaging their buildings, but the integrity of the inner core-containment vessel was not compromised and no highly radioactive release from the plants have occurred. Residents within a 20 km (12 mi) radius of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and a 10 km (6.2 mi) radius of the Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated. Early estimates from AIR Worldwide place insured losses from the earthquake and tsunami at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. Chief economist for Japan at Credit Suisse, Hiromichi Shirakawa, said in a note to clients that the estimated economic loss may be around $171–183 billion just to the region which was hit by the quake and tsunami. The Bank of Japan offered a combined ¥15 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March 2011 to make the conditions in the market normal. \c\cThe estimates of the Sendai earthquakes magnitude made it the most powerful earthquake to hit Japan and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world overall since modern record-keeping began in 1900.

The epicenter was reported to be 130 kilometers (81 mi) off the east coast of the Oshika Peninsula, Tōhoku, with the hypocenter at a depth of 24.4 kilometers (15.2 miles). It was locally measured at the maximum possible 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale in the northern Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, 6 in other prefectures and 5 in Tokyo. \c\cThe earthquake triggered tsunami warnings and evacuations from Japans Pacific coast and at least 20 countries, including the entire Pacific coast of North America and South America. The earthquake created tsunami waves of up to 10 meters (33 ft) that struck Japan and many other countries.

It is thought to have been the largest earthquake within the boundaries of the North American and Pacific tectonic plates in 1,200 years.
The 2010–11 Middle East and  North Africa protests are an unprecedented revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests which have been taking place in the Middle East and North Africa since 18 December 2010. To date, Tunisia, Egypt and Libya have seen revolutions of historical consequence, Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Oman and Yemen have all seen major protests, and minor incidents have occurred in Kuwait, Lebanon, Mauritania, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Western Sahara. The protests have shared techniques of civil resistance in sustained campaigns involving strikes, demonstrations, marches and rallies, as well as the use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter to organise, communicate, and raise awareness in the face of attempts at state repression and Internet censorship.
The Datta Khel airstrike was a military airstrike carried out by United States Predator drones in Datta Khel, North Waziristan on 17 March 2011.
The 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis is an ongoing political crisis in Côte d'Ivoire which began after Laurent Gbagbo, the President of Côte d'Ivoire since 2000, claimed he had won the Ivorian election of 2010, the first election in the country in 10 years. The opposition candidate, Alassane Ouattara, and a number of countries, organisations and leaders worldwide claimed Ouattara had won the election.
The 2011 Omani protests are a series of ongoing protests in the Gulf country of Oman. They are a part of the 2010-2011 Middle East and North Africa protests. \c\cThe Omani protesters are demanding salary increases, creating more jobs and fighting corruption. Protests in Sohar centred around the Globe Roundabout. \c\cOn 30 March, The Public Prosecution issued a statement saying that complaints were filed by some citizens about acts of rioting, vandalism and breach of public order, and destruction of public and private properties and obstructing business transactions and easy movement of people on the streets. Based in these complains, Public Prosecution give orders to arrest and clear all the protester around the Globe Roundabout in Sohar. After that, The Omani army stormed the Globe roundabout clearing blockades and arrested a number of protesters ending a month-old sit-in.
The 2011 Syrian uprising is a popular uprising taking place in Syria, which began on 26 January 2011.  The uprising is influenced by concurrent protests in the region, and has been described as "unprecedented". Like the movements in Tunisia and Egypt, it has mainly, but not exclusively, taken the form of peaceful protests of various types. It can therefore be said to amount to a sustained campaign of civil resistance, also called nonviolent resistance. Such resistance, while seeking to limit the incidence of violence in a conflict, is not based on an assumption that the regime being opposed will necessarily refrain from violence. \c\cIn reacting to the largest uprising to take place in the country for decades, Syrian security forces have killed hundreds of protesters, and injured many more. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has condemned the use of deadly force against protesters as "unacceptable". \c\cAs protests continued, the Syrian government decided to employ more merciless tactics, and sent in the military with tanks and snipers to fire at any person walking the streets. Water and electricity  is shut off in Daraa, and security forces began confiscating flour and food. \c\cPresident Hafez al-Assad was in office for nearly 30 years; his son, President Bashar al-Assad, succeeded him in 2000.
In mid-April 2011, two major storm systems tracked through the Mississippi River watershed dumping record rain-fall.  Coupled with yearly snowmelt, the Mississippi River began to swell to record levels by the beginning of May.  Areas experiencing flooding include Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi.  President Barack Obama declared western counties of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi as federal disaster areas.  Eight people have been killed in Arkansas. Thousands of homes have been ordered evacuated, including over 1,000 in Memphis, Tennessee, and more than 2,000 in Mississippi state. About 13% of US petroleum refinery output is expected to be disrupted by flood levels exceeding historical records in several locations.

The Mississippi River floods in April and May 2011 are among the largest and most damaging along the flood-prone U.S. river in the past century. Comparisons are being drawn with the major Mississippi River floods in 1927 and 1993. In April 2011, two major storm systems tracked through much of the vast Mississippi River watershed, dumping record rainfall over large areas.  Already rising from springtime snowmelt, the river, and many of its tributaries, began to swell to record levels by the beginning of May.  Areas along the Mississippi itself experiencing flooding include Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  U.S. President Barack Obama declared the western counties of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi federal disaster areas. \c\cFourteen people have been killed in Arkansas, with 337 killed across seven states in the preceding storms. Thousands of homes have been ordered evacuated, including over 1,000 in Memphis, Tennessee, and more than 2,000 in the state of Mississippi. About 13% of U.S. petroleum refinery output is expected to be disrupted by flood levels exceeding historical records in several locations, with gasoline futures up 9.2%. The flood is expected to crest in Memphis by May 10 and in southern Louisiana by May 23. The Army Corps of Engineers has stated that, even if spillways are opened, an area in Louisiana between Simmesport and Baton Rouge may be inundated with 20-30 feet of water. \c\cThe Old River Control Structure in northern Louisiana may be threatened by the rising waters, and opening of the Morganza Spillway nearby is being considered to lower the river level and flow in this area and downriver.  Failure of either of these structures might allow the Mississippi to divert it main channel to the Atchafalaya Basin and the Atchafalaya River, developing a new delta south of Morgan City in southern Louisiana, and greatly reducing water flow to its present channel through Baton Rouge and New Orleans to its current delta in southeastern Louisiana.  Jeff Masters of the Weather Underground noted that failure of the Old River Control Structure "would be a serious blow to the U.S. economy, and the great Mississippi flood of 2011 will give  its most severe test ever."
Dominique Gaston André Strauss-Kahn (French pronunciation: \u200b; born 25 April 1949), often referred to in the media as DSK, is a French economist, lawyer, and politician, and a member of the Socialist Party of France (PS). A former Communist, Strauss-Kahn became the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 28 September 2007, with the backing of his countrys president, Nicolas Sarkozy. \c\cHe is a full professor of economics at the Paris Institute for Political Studies ("Sciences Po").  Strauss-Kahn was Minister of Economy and Finance from 1997 to 1999 as part of Lionel Jospins "Plural Left" government. He belongs to the right wing of the PS (which is on the center-left of French politics) and sought the nomination in the primaries to the Socialist presidential candidacy for the 2007 election, but he was defeated by Ségolène Royal in November 2006. \c\cIn May 2011, Strauss-Kahn was arrested in New York City and charged with sexual assault, forcible confinement, and attempted rape of a maid who was cleaning his hotel room. He was  refused bail and remanded to jail, with his next court appearance scheduled for May 20. Strauss-Kahn did not enter a plea during the proceedings although his lawyer has said he denies all charges.
The 2011 end times prediction made by Christian radio host Harold Camping states that the Rapture (in premillennial theology, the taking up into heaven of Gods elect people) will take place on May 21, 2011 and that the end of the world as we know it will take place five months later on October 21, 2011. Camping, president of the Family Radio Christian network, claims the Bible as his source and says May 21 will be the date of the Rapture and the day of judgment "beyond the shadow of a doubt". Some of Campings supporters suggest that it will occur at 6 p.m. local time, with the rapture sweeping the globe time zone by time zone, and claim that around 200 million people (approximately 3% of the worlds population) will be raptured. \c\cMost Christian groups have not embraced Campings predictions; some have explicitly rejected them. An interview with a group of church leaders noted that all of them have scheduled services as usual for Sunday, May 22. Camping previously claimed that the world would end in September 1994.
The 2011 end times prediction made by American Christian radio host Harold Camping stated that the Rapture (in a specific tradition of premillennial theology, the taking up into heaven of Gods elect people) would take place on May 21, 2011 and that the end of the world would take place five months later on October 21, 2011.

Harold Egbert Camping (born July 19, 1921) is an American Christian radio broadcaster and president of Family Radio, a California-based radio station that spans more than 150 markets in the United States. \c\cCampings trademarks include his deep, sonorous voice coupled with a slow cadence.  He has also used Bible-based numerology to predict dates for the end of the world, dates which passed without incident. His most recent end times prediction was that the Rapture would occur on May 21, 2011 and that God would subsequently completely destroy the Earth and the universe five months later on October 21. He had previously predicted that the Rapture would occur in September 1994.
The 37th G8 summit is being held 26–27 May in the commune of Deauville in France. \c\cPrevious G8 summits have been hosted by France in locations which include Rambouillet (1975); Versailles (1982); Grande Arche, Paris (1989); Lyon (1996);  and Évian-les-Bains (2003).
On 9 May 2011 a coalition of 22 NGOs announced that "Freedom Flotilla II – Stay Human" is planned to break the blockade of Gaza by Israel, a year after the May 2010 Israeli raid on the first Gaza Freedom Flotilla where nine activists were killed. Legal assessments of the situation range from claims the blockade is illegal, to support of the blockades legality and Israels right to use force, as necessary, to maintain it. Israeli authorities informed flotilla organizers that if they dock at the Israeli port of Ashdod, the humanitarian aid would be delivered by Israel directly to Gaza. \c\cThe flotilla is named in memory of Vittorio Arrigoni, an Italian reporter and activist whose killing  by suspected members of a Palestinian Salafist group in Gaza in April 2011 "left the Palestinian activist community stunned." His favourite expression was "Stay Human". \c\cAs of 24 June 2011, 10 ships, with 1,000 activists from 20 countries were set to sail for Gaza from various European ports, with humanitarian aid, during the last few days of June, or first few days of July 2011. Originally it was thought that the Mavi Marmara would lead the flotilla, but in mid-June, it was announced that the humanitarian aid ship would be unable to sail due to technical issues.
The News International phone hacking scandal is an ongoing controversy involving the News of the World, a now-defunct British tabloid newspaper published by News International, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdochs News Corporation, and the allegations that individuals working for the newspaper engaged in phone hacking. It was especially notable as the story broke in the midst of an attempted takeover of British Sky Broadcasting by News Corporation, which eventually abandoned the acquisition due to public pressure. \c\cFollowing revelations that victims of the News of the World phone hacking may have included the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, relatives of deceased British soldiers, and victims of the 7/7 London bombings, public reaction to the scandal was swift, extensive and generally one of outrage. This backlash led the News of the World to publish its final edition on 10 July 2011, after 168 years of publication. \c\cOn 6 July 2011, British prime minister David Cameron announced to parliament that a public government inquiry would convene to further investigate the affair. On 13 July, Cameron named Lord Justice Leveson as chairman of the inquiry, with a remit to look into the specific claims about phone hacking at the News of the World, the initial police inquiry, allegations of illicit payments to police by the press, and the culture and ethics of the British media. \c\cThe scandal eventually garnered attention in the United States, where News Corporation operates a multitude of media outlets. On 14 July, the FBI launched its own investigation into News Corporation, focusing on claims that its newspapers had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and accessed voicemails of victims of the 9/11 attacks; on 15 July, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Department of Justice had also opened an investigation into the company.

The Syrian civil war, also referred to as the Syrian uprising, is an ongoing internal armed conflict in Syria. The conflict began on 15 March 2011 with public demonstrations as part of the wider Arab Spring and developed into a nationwide uprising, and a civil war in 2012. Protesters have demanded the end to nearly five decades of Ba’ath Party rule, as well as the resignation of Bashar al-Assad. \c\cIn the spring of 2011, the Syrian government deployed the Syrian Army to quell the uprising. Several cities have been besieged, and soldiers were reportedly ordered to open fire on civilians. According to witnesses, soldiers who refused to open fire on civilians were summarily executed by the Syrian Army. Civilians and army defectors began forming fighting units, and unified under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, fighting in an increasingly organized fashion; however, the civilian component of the armed opposition lacks an organized leadership. The Syrian government characterizes the insurgency as "armed terrorist groups". \c\cAccording to various sources, including the United Nations, up to 20,000–27,285 people have been killed, of which about half were civilians, but also including 10,140 armed combatants from both the Syrian army and rebel forces and up to 1,765 opposition protesters. According to the UN, between 500,000 and 1 million Syrians have been displaced within the country. To escape the violence, tens of thousands of Syrian refugees have fled the country to neighboring Iraqi Kurdistan, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Iraq has closed its border to Syrian refugees, while no Syrian refugees have yet arrived at the Israeli border. In addition, tens of thousands of protesters have been imprisoned, and there have been reports of widespread torture in the governments prisons. International organizations have also accused the government and Shabiha of using civilians as human shields, of intentionally targeting civilians and of adopting a scorched earth policy. Anti-government rebels have been accused of human rights abuses as well, including torture, kidnapping, unlawful detention and execution of civilians, Shabiha, and soldiers. HRW also expressed concern at the kidnapping of Iranian nationals. The UN Commission of Inquiry has also documented abuses of this nature, and also has documentation that indicates rebel forces have been responsible for displacement of civilians. \c\cThe Arab League, United States, European Union, GCC states, and other countries have condemned the use of violence against the protesters. China and Russia have opposed attempts to agree to a UN resolution condemning Assads actions, and advised against sanctions, saying that such methods could escalate into foreign intervention. The Arab League suspended Syrias membership over the governments response to the crisis, but sent an observer mission in December 2011, as part of its proposal for peaceful resolution of the crisis. A further attempt to resolve the crisis has been made through the appointment of Kofi Annan as a special envoy. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had repeatedly stated that the Syrian conflict could emerge into an "all-out civil war". \c\cOn 15 July 2012 the International Committee of the Red Cross assessed the Syrian conflict as a "non-international armed conflict" (the ICRCs legal term for civil war), thus applying the international humanitarian law under the Geneva Conventions in Syria.

Canadian–Iranian relations are the foreign relations and diplomatic ties between Canada and Iran. Canadian-Iranian relations date back to 1955, up to which point the Canadian Consular and Commercial Affairs in Iran was handled by the British Embassy. A Canadian diplomatic mission was constructed in Tehran in 1959 and raised to Embassy status in 1961.  Canada and Iran do not maintain diplomatic ties at present. \c\cDue to rocky relations after the Iranian Revolution, Iran did not establish an embassy in Canada until 1991 when its staff, which had been living in a building on Roosevelt Avenue in Ottawas west end, moved into 245 Metcalfe Street in the Centretown neighbourhood of Ottawa which was upgraded to embassy status. In Tehran, the Canadian Embassy is located at 57 Shahid Sarafaz Street and Ostad Motahari Avenue. The mission was staffed by a chargé not a full ambassador and visa office in the city is closed (and transferred to the Canadian Embassy in Turkey). \c\cOn September 7, 2012, Canada severed ties with Iran, closed its embassy in Iran, and expelled Iranian diplomats in Canada, citing Iranian foreign policy and safety concerns for Canadian diplomats in Iran.

A Canadian diplomatic mission was built in Tehran in 1959 and raised to embassy status in 1961. Following the 1979 Iranian revolution, the Canadian embassy provided cover to six American consular staff and assisted in their escape from the country during the Iran hostage crisis. The Canadian embassy in Tehran was closed for eight years thereafter. \c\cIran established an embassy in Canada in 1991, and in 1996 the two countries reestablished normal diplomatic relations and exchanged ambassadors. The relationship experienced further turmoil in 2003, when Iranian-Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi was killed in custody in Iran. \c\cOn September 7, 2012, Canada severed diplomatic ties with Iran, closed its embassy in Tehran, and expelled Iranian diplomats from Canada, citing Iranian foreign policy, support for Bashar al-Assad, violations of human rights, threats against Israel, the Iranian nuclear program, and security concerns for its diplomats in the country.  John Baird, Canadas foreign minister, called Iran "the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today."
Innocence of Muslims, previously called Innocence of Bin Laden (working title: Desert Warrior, YouTube titles The Real Life of Muhammad and Muhammad Movie Trailer), is an amateur 2012 film that disparages Islam and its prophet, Muhammad. Months after its release, violent protests against Western institutions in several Muslim countries resulted in a number of deaths, and hundreds of injuries. Two film trailers were released on YouTube, on July 1 and 2, 2012. The clips were dubbed into Arabic, and then spread by Egyptian-American lawyer and Coptic Christian Morris Sadek. \c\cOn September 8, 2012, a two-minute excerpt from the film was broadcast on Al-Nas TV, an Egyptian Islamist television station. Violent protests, allegedly against the film, broke out on September 11, the eleventh anniversary of the Al-Qaeda attacks on New Yorks World Trade Center and other U.S. landmarks. The protests spread to Libya, Yemen and other Arab and Muslim nations over the following days, included the 2012 U.S. diplomatic missions attacks, incorporating an attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in at least 14 deaths; that of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and those of three other Americans. The film has allegedly sparked protests around the world. U.S. law enforcement officials believe they have identified the filmmaker as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, an Egyptian American who "was connected to the persona" of "Sam Bacile" linked to the making of the film.

The Penn State child sex abuse scandal was a scandal that broke in 2011 at Pennsylvania State University, as a result of longtime former university football assistant coach Jerry Sanduskys sexual assault of at least eight underage boys on or near university property, and alleged actions by some university officials to cover up the incidents or to enable more. Based on an extensive grand jury investigation, Sandusky was indicted in 2011 on 52 counts of child molestation dating from 1994 to 2009, though the abuse may have dated as far back as the 1970s. Per the findings of the grand jury, several high-level school officials were charged with perjury, suspended, or dismissed for covering up the incidents or failing to notify authorities. In the wake of the scandal, school president Graham Spanier was forced to resign, and head football coach Joe Paterno was fired late in the 2011–12 season, while Sandusky maintained his innocence. \c\cThe trial of Jerry Sandusky on 52 charges of sexual crimes against children started on June 11, 2012, at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.  Four charges were subsequently dropped, leaving 48. On June 22, 2012, Sandusky was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts of sexual abuse. Sandusky was sentenced on October 9, 2012 to a minimum of 30 years and maximum of 60 years in prison. \c\cThe scandal had far-reaching outcomes for the university. The report of an independent investigation commissioned by the PSU board and conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh and his law firm stated that Spanier and Paterno, along with athletic director Tim Curley and school vice president Gary Schultz, had known about allegations of child abuse on Sanduskys part as early as 1998, and were complicit in failing to disclose them.  In so doing, Freeh stated that the most senior leaders at Penn State showed a "total disregard for the safety and welfare of Sanduskys child victims" for 14 years and "empowered" Jerry Sandusky to continue his abuse. On July 23, 2012 the NCAA imposed sweeping penalties on Penn State—among the most severe ever imposed on an NCAA member school—including a fine of $60 million, a four-year postseason ban and vacating of all victories from 1998–2011. In doing so, NCAA President Mark Emmert stated that the sanctions were levied "not to be just punitive, but to make sure the university establishes an athletic culture and daily mindset in which football will never again be placed ahead of education, nurturing and protecting young people." The Big Ten Conference subsequently imposed an additional $13 million fine. \c\cAs of July 2012, two other investigations are ongoing: a federal criminal probe by the local United States Attorney launched shortly after the discovery of Sanduskys crimes, and a separate probe from the Department of Education into whether Penn State responded to the incident properly and reported it in accordance with federal law.
Sexual abuse allegations involving the British disc jockey and BBC television presenter Jimmy Savile (1926–2011) and mainly under-age female teenagers resurfaced in late September 2012, leading to him becoming the subject of a national child sexual abuse scandal. \c\cBy 11 October 2012 allegations had been made to 13 British police forces. To date, police investigators have received 340 lines of inquiry, including claims of abuse against adults, and have officially recorded 12 allegations of sexual offences, but are in contact with a total of 40 potential victims involving incidents dating back to 1959. The allegations also led to the setting up of inquiries into practices at the BBC, and within the National Health Service. \c\cMuch of Saviles career involved working with children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years presenting Top of the Pops before a teenage audience, and another 20 years presenting Jim'll Fix It—in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true. \c\cDuring his lifetime, Savile was never convicted of any sexual offences - two investigations concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge him, with other investigations ranging back to 1958 that were also dropped.
The Syrian civil war, also referred to as the Syrian uprising, is an ongoing armed conflict in Syria between forces loyal to the Baath Party government and those seeking to oust it. The conflict began on 15 March 2011 with nationwide demonstrations as part of the wider protest movement known as the Arab Spring. Protesters demanded the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, as well as the end to nearly five decades of Baath Party rule. \c\cIn April 2011, the Syrian Army was deployed to quell the uprising, and soldiers were ordered to open fire on civilians. After months of military sieges, the protests evolved into an armed rebellion. Opposition forces, mainly composed of defected soldiers and civilian volunteers, became increasingly armed and organized as they unified into larger groups, with some groups receiving military aid from several foreign countries. However, the rebels remained fractured, without organized leadership. The Syrian government characterizes the insurgency as "armed terrorist groups." The conflict has no clear fronts, with clashes taking place in many towns and cities across the country. \c\cThe Arab League, United States, European Union, GCC states and other countries have condemned the use of violence against the protesters. China and Russia have opposed attempts to agree to a UN resolution condemning Assads actions, and advised against sanctions, saying that such methods could escalate into foreign military intervention. The Arab League suspended Syrias membership because of the governments response to the crisis, but sent an observer mission in December 2011, as part of its proposal for peaceful resolution of the crisis. A further attempt to resolve the crisis was made through the appointment of Kofi Annan as a special envoy. On 15 July 2012, the International Committee of the Red Cross assessed the Syrian conflict as a "non-international armed conflict" (the ICRCs legal term for civil war), thus applying international humanitarian law under the Geneva Conventions to Syria. \c\cAccording to various sources, between 30,000 and 46,760 people have been killed, including 17,625–19,415 armed combatants consisting of both the Syrian army and rebel forces, and the other half civilians, and up to 2,120 opposition protesters. By October 2012, another 28,000 people were reported missing, civilians forcibly abducted by government troops or security forces. According to the UN, about 1.2 million Syrians have been displaced within the country. To escape the violence, hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have fled to neighboring countries. In addition, tens of thousands of protesters have been imprisoned, and there have been reports of widespread torture in the governments prisons. International organizations have accused the government and Shabiha of severe human rights violations. Anti-government rebels have been accused of human rights abuses as well. The vast majority of abused have, however, been committed by the Syrian governments forces.

The snowfall across the British Isles in January 2013 was a prolonged period of snowfall that began on 14 January 2013, and affected large swathes of Great Britain and Ireland. After initial snow showers in the early hours of 14 January, Scotland, England and Wales received a significant amount of snowfall beginning overnight on 17-18 January. The Met Office issues a rare red warning - the severest of its type - for parts of Wales, while much of England was placed on Amber alert. Snowfall forced the cancellation of flights at a number of British airports, including Heathrow and Bristol, while other there was widespread disruption of trsansport. As many as 3,000 schools were closed in England.
The Battle of Konna is currently being fought between government forces of Mali and the Islamist Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA). On 10 January 2013, the Islamists captured the town of Konna in Mali, after fierce fighting with Malian forces. With French help, on 12 January, Mali claimed it successfully recaptured the town, leaving dozens of soldiers and a hundred Islamist fighters dead.

The snowfall across the British Isles in January 2013 was a prolonged period of snowfall that began on 14 January 2013, and affected large swathes of Great Britain and Ireland. \c\cAn initial fall of heavy snow occurred in the early hours of 14 January that affected England, Wales, and Scotland. Following this widespread snowfall, further, lighter, but still considerable snowfall was reported on most days, except for a slight respite on 16 January. However, the worst of the snowfall arrived on 18 January across most of the UK. This lead to the Met Office issuing a rare red warning for severe snowfall - the highest warning possible of its type - for parts of Wales on the 18th, while much of England was placed under an amber warning, the second-highest level, that same day. As well as heavy snow warnings, there were also weather warnings across England and Wales issued due to ice, especially on 19 January. Also, the Met Office declared a Level 3 Cold Weather Alert across England, the second-highest level for cold weather in this special advanced warning system, on most days following 14 January. \c\cSnowfall forced the cancellation of flights at a number of British airports, including Birmingham, Heathrow, and Southampton. At Heathrow, more than 400 flights were cancelled on 18 January, followed by over 100 more during the morning of 19 January. There was also widespread disruption to other forms of transport across the UK, with many roads, even some major routes, becoming blocked and impassable. As many as 3,000 schools were closed in England, while in Northern Ireland, heavy snow downed power lines, leaving over 2,400 homes along the eastern coast of County Down without power. Further large power cuts were reported in the towns of Banbridge and Craigavon, also in Northern Ireland.
The Kachin conflict is one of multiple conflicts collectively referred to as the Burmese Civil War. Fighting between the Kachin Independence Army and Myanmar Army restarted in June, 2011 after a 17 year-old ceasefire broke down. The recent conflict has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, the displacement of over 100,000 civilians and the widespread use of landmines, child soldiers, systematic rape and torture.
The Senkaku Islands dispute concerns a territorial dispute over a group of uninhabited islands known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, the Diaoyu in China, and Tiaoyutai Islands in Taiwan. Aside from a 1945 to 1972 period of administration by the United States, the archipelago has been controlled by Japan since 1895. The Peoples Republic of China (PRC) disputed the proposed US handover of authority to Japan in 1971 and has asserted its claims to the islands since that time.  The Republic of China (Taiwan) also claims the islands.  The territory is close to key shipping lanes and rich fishing grounds, and there may be oil reserves in the area. \c\cJapan argues that it surveyed the islands in the late 19th century and found them to be Terra nullius  (Latin: land belonging to no one); subsequently, China acquiesced to Japanese sovereignty until the 1970s.  The PRC and the ROC argue that documentary evidence prior to the First Sino-Japanese War indicates Chinese possession and that the territory is accordingly a Japanese seizure that should be returned as the rest of Imperial Japans conquests were returned in 1945. \c\cAlthough the United States does not have an official position on the merits of the competing sovereignty claims, the islands are included within the U.S. Japan Security Treaty, meaning that a defense of the islands by Japan may compel support from the United States military. \c\cIn September 2012, the Japanese government purchased the remaining three of the disputed islands that it did not already own from their private owner, prompting large-scale protests in China. In January 2013, The Economist noted that risks of a military confrontation were rising.
The Uribana prison riot occured on 25 January 2013 at Uribana prison in Barquisimeto, Venezuela. 90 people were injured and at least 54 people were killed. \c\cThe riot was reportedly triggered by an announcement that, in an anti-gang measure, troops would be searching for weapons. The inmates were reportedly waiting for the National Guard when they arrived. Most injuries were from gunshot wounds.

The 2012–2013 Egyptian protests started on 22 November 2012. Hundreds of thousands of protesters are demonstrating against Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, after he granted himself unlimited powers to “protect” the nation, and the power to legislate without judicial oversight or review of his acts.  Morsi followed his decrees by making an effort to push through a referendum on an Islamist-supported draft constitution. \c\cThe demonstrations have been organised by Egyptian opposition organizations and individuals, mainly pro-democratic liberals, leftists, secularists, and Christians. The demonstrations have resulted in violent clashes between members of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood-backed Freedom and Justice Party and the anti-Morsi protesters, with at least seven deaths and hundreds of injuries. Demonstrators gathered outside the presidential palace, which in turn was surrounded by tanks and armored vehicles of the Republican Guard. The anti-Morsi protesters in Cairo alone have numbered over 200,000 in some protests. \c\cA number of Morsis advisers resigned in protest, and many judges spoke out against his actions as well. Resignations were tendered by the director of state broadcasting, Rafik Habib (Christian vice president of the Muslim Brotherhoods Freedom and Justice Party), and Zaghloul el-Balshi (general secretary of the commission overseeing the planned constitutional referendum). Seven members of Morsis 17-member advisory panel  resigned in December 2012. \c\cOn 8 December 2012, Morsi annulled his decree which had expanded his presidential authority and removed judicial review of his decrees, an Islamist official said, but added that the effects of that declaration would stand. George Isaac of the Constitution Party said that Morsi’s declaration did not offer anything new, the National Salvation Front rejected it as an attempt save face, and the April 6 Movement and Gamal Fahmi of the Egyptian Journalists Syndicate said the new declaration failed to address the “fundamental” problem of the nature of the assembly that was tasked with drafting the constitution.

On 6 February, 2013, at 12:12 p.m. an earthquake struck the Solomon Islands, located in the south Pacific Ocean. It struck at a shallow depth, and the epicenter was about 5 km (3 mi) offshore the Santa Cruz Islands in the Solomons. The intensity was estimated at 8.0 on the Richter magnitude scale. It produced a tsunami measuring .91 m (3 ft) at Lata, Solomon Islands. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning for the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, and a tsunami watch the Marshall Islands and Samoa. There were at least two aftershocks that measured at least 6.0. \c\cIn Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, residents evacuated to higher ground. Local news agencies reported that several villages were destroyed.
An ethnic separatist insurgency is taking place in Southern Thailand, predominantly in the Malay Pattani region, made up of the four southernmost provinces of Thailand. Violence has increasingly been spilling over into other provinces. Although separatist violence has occurred for decades in the region, the campaign escalated in 2004. \c\cIn July 2005, Thaksin Shinawatra, then Prime Minister of Thailand, assumed wide-ranging emergency powers to deal with the insurgency. In September 2006, Army Commander Sonthi Boonyaratkalin was granted an extraordinary increase in executive powers to combat the unrest. \c\cSoon afterwards, on 19 September 2006, Sonthi and a military junta ousted Thaksin in a coup. Despite conciliatory gestures from the junta, the insurgency continued and intensified. The death toll, 1,400 at the time of the coup, increased to 2,579 by mid-September 2007. \c\cDespite little progress in curbing the violence, the junta declared that security was improving and that peace would come to the region by 2008. The death toll surpassed 3,000 in March 2008. During the Democrat-led government of Abhisit Vejjajiva, Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya noted a "sense of optimism" and said that he was confident of bringing peace in to the region within 2010. By the end of 2010, insurgency-related violence had increased, confounding the governments optimism.

The Syrian civil war, also commonly known as the Syrian uprising, is an ongoing armed conflict in Syria between forces loyal to the Syrian Baath Party government and those seeking to oust it. The conflict began on 15 March 2011 with nationwide demonstrations, as part of the wider protest movement known as the Arab Spring. Protesters demanded the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, whose family has held presidential power in Syria since 1971, as well as the end to nearly five decades of Baath Party rule. \c\cIn April 2011, the Syrian Army was deployed to quell the uprising, and soldiers were ordered to open fire on demonstrators. After months of military sieges, the protests evolved into an armed rebellion. Opposition forces, mainly composed of defected soldiers and civilian volunteers, became increasingly armed and organized as they unified into larger groups. However, the rebels remained fractured, without organized leadership. The Syrian government characterizes the insurgency as an uprising of "armed terrorist groups and foreign mercenaries". The conflict has no clear fronts, with clashes taking place in many towns and cities across the country. \c\cThe Arab League, United States, European Union, Arab States of the Persian Gulf, and other countries condemned the use of violence against the protesters. The Arab League suspended Syrias membership because of the governments response to the crisis, but it sent an observer mission in December 2011, as part of its proposal for peaceful resolution of the crisis. A further attempt to resolve the crisis was made through the appointment of Kofi Annan as a special envoy. On 15 July 2012, the International Committee of the Red Cross assessed the Syrian conflict as a "non-international armed conflict" (the ICRCs legal term for civil war), thus applying international humanitarian law under the Geneva Conventions to Syria. \c\cOn 2 January 2013, the United Nations stated that the wars death toll had exceeded 60,000; on 12 February, this figure was updated to 70,000. According to various opposition activist groups, between 50,000 and 63,735 people have been killed, of which about half were civilians, but also including 26,110–27,900 armed combatants consisting of both the Syrian Army and rebel forces, up to 2,505 opposition protesters and 1,000 government officials. By October 2012, up to 28,000 people had been reported missing, including civilians forcibly abducted by government troops or security forces. According to the UN, about 1.2 million Syrians have been displaced within the country. To escape the violence, hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have fled to neighboring countries. In addition, tens of thousands of protesters have been imprisoned and there were reports of widespread torture and psychological terror in state prisons. International organizations have accused both government and opposition forces of severe human rights violations. However, human rights groups report that the majority of abuses have been committed by the Syrian governments forces, and UN investigations have concluded that the governments abuses are the greatest in both gravity and scale.

The M23 rebellion is a continuation of fighting that has gone on in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since the formal end of the Second Congo War in 2003. \c\cIn April 2012, up to 700 ethnic Tutsi soldiers mutinied against the DRC government supported by the peacekeeping contingent of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). Mutineers formed a rebel group called the March 23 Movement (M23), also known as the Congolese Revolutionary Army, composed of former members of the rebel National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), allegedly sponsored by the government of the neighbouring Rwanda. \c\cOn 20 November, M23 rebels took control of Goma, a provincial capital with a population of one million people. By the end of November, the conflict has forced more than 140,000 people to flee their homes, according to the U.N. refugee agency, on top of those already forced from their homes by previous rounds of fighting in the region. After repelling an ill-organized government counterattack and making some further gains, M23 agreed to withdraw from Goma on their own and left the city in early December. \c\cOn 24 February 2013, eleven African nations signed an agreement designed to bring peace to the region.

Israeli–Turkish relations refers to bilateral ties between Israel and Turkey. Israel–Turkey relations were formalized in March 1949. Turkey was the first Muslim majority country to recognize the State of Israel. \c\cMilitary, strategic, and diplomatic cooperation between Turkey and Israel were accorded high priority by both countries, which shared concerns with respect to the regional instabilities in the Middle East. According to a New York Times report in 1999, the strategic partnership between the two countries had the potential to alter Middle East politics: Trade and tourism were booming, the Israel Air Force practiced maneuvers in Turkish airspace and Israeli technicians were modernizing Turkish combat jets. There were also plans for high-tech cooperation and water sharing. Relations deteriorated after the 2008–09 Gaza War and the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid.

International organizations have accused both government and opposition forces of severe human rights violations. However, human rights groups report that the majority of abuses have been committed by the Syrian governments forces, and UN investigations have concluded that the governments abuses are the greatest in both gravity and scale.

On 15 July 2012, the International Committee of the Red Cross assessed the Syrian conflict as a "non-international armed conflict" (the ICRCs legal term for civil war), thus applying international humanitarian law under the Geneva Conventions to Syria. The war degenerated into a stalemate in early 2013, with rebels gradually gaining ground. \c\cOn 2 January 2013, the United Nations released an estimate that the wars death toll had exceeded 60,000; on 12 February, this figure was updated to 70,000. According to various opposition activist groups, between 62,550 and 74,470 people have been killed, of which about half were civilians, but also including 30,520 armed combatants consisting of both the Syrian Army and rebel forces, up to 2,715 opposition protesters and 1,000 government officials. By October 2012, up to 28,000 people had been reported missing, including civilians forcibly abducted by government troops or security forces. According to the UN, about 1.2 million Syrians have been displaced within the country. To escape the violence, as many as 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled to neighboring countries. In addition, tens of thousands of protesters have been imprisoned and there were reports of widespread torture and psychological terror in state prisons. International organizations have accused both government and opposition forces of severe human rights violations. However, human rights groups report that the majority of abuses have been committed by the Syrian governments forces, and UN investigations have concluded that the governments abuses are the greatest in both gravity and scale.
The Syrian civil war is an ongoing armed conflict in Syria between forces loyal to the Syrian Baath Party government and those seeking to oust it. The conflict began on 15 March 2011, with popular demonstrations that grew nationwide by April 2011. These demonstrations were part of the wider Middle Eastern protest movement known as the Arab Spring. Protesters demanded the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, whose family has held the presidency in Syria since 1971, as well as the end to over four decades of Baath Party rule. \c\cIn April 2011, the Syrian Army was deployed to quell the uprising, and soldiers were ordered to open fire on demonstrators. After months of military sieges, the protests evolved into an armed rebellion. Opposition forces, mainly composed of defected soldiers and civilian volunteers, became increasingly armed and organized as they unified into larger groups. However, the rebels remained fractured, without organized leadership. The Syrian government characterizes the insurgency as an uprising of "armed terrorist groups and foreign mercenaries". The conflict has no clear fronts, with clashes taking place in many towns and cities across the country. \c\cThe Arab League, United States, European Union, and other countries condemned the use of violence against the protesters. The Arab League suspended Syrias membership because of the governments response to the crisis, but granted the Syrian National Coalition Syrias seat on 6 March 2013. The Arab League also sent an observer mission in December 2011, as part of its proposal for peaceful resolution of the crisis. A further attempt to resolve the crisis was made through the appointment of Kofi Annan as a special envoy. \c\cUntil late 2011 the armed conflict had not reached the biggest cities of Damascus and Aleppo. Suicide bombings in the capital marked growing influence of jihadist group Jabhat al-Nusra within the opposition forces, while Hezbollah entered the war in support of the Syrian army. In mid-2012 full-scaled urban battle began in Damascus, followed by even more deadly battle of Aleppo.

The 2013 Korean crisis, also referred to as the North Korean crisis by media, is an escalation of tensions between North Korea and South Korea, the United States, and Japan that began following North Koreas launch of its Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2 satellite on December 12, 2012, and its nuclear test on February 12, 2013. The crisis was marked by extreme escalation of rhetoric by the new North Korean administration under Kim Jong-un and actions suggesting imminent attacks against South Korea and the United States with nuclear weapons.

One man died in Austria after a landslide caused by the flooding. \c\cOn June 2 Prague closed its subway system as floodwaters covered the esplanades along the Vltava.  Passau, Rosenheim, Budapest, Bratislava and other river cities enacted emergency preparations. 1,000 troops from the Czech Army were called in to help build flood defences.
PRISM is the code word for a Top Secret electronic surveillance program that was implemented by the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2007 under U.S. President George W. Bush. PRISM replaced the Terrorist Surveillance Program, which was implemented in the wake of the  September 11, 2011 (9/11) terrorist attacks. While the Terrorist Surveillance Program was widely criticized and had its legality questioned because it was not conducted subject to the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, PRISM was authorized by an order of the Court. The NSA continued to operate PRISM throughout the Obama Administration. \c\cPRISM was first publicly revealed on June 6, 2013 after certain classified documents about the program were leaked to the Washington Post. Initial reports identified several technology companies that were involved in the PRISM program, including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple.

Fighting from the Syrian civil war has spilled over into Lebanon. Fighting has mainly occurred between Lebanese opponents and supporters of the Syrian government, the spillover conflict has resulted in violent unrest and kidnappings of foreign citizens across Lebanon. Islamists across northern Lebanon have arranged sit-ins and blocked roads to protest the arrest of a Lebanese Islamist linked to the Syrian uprising. The conflict escalated from previous sectarian clashes between pro-Syrian government Alawites and anti-Syrian government Sunni militants in Tripoli in June 2011 and February 2012. Sit-ins were also held in south Lebanon by anti-Hezbollah Salafists, which heightened tensions further. It evolved into a conflict between the anti-Syrian March 14 Alliance and the pro-Syrian March 8 Alliance. The Saudi backed March 14 alliance supports the Syrian rebels, whereas the Iranian backed March 8 alliance supports the Syrian government. \c\cIn May 2012, the conflict spread to Beirut, and later to south and east Lebanon, while the Lebanese Armed Forces deployed in north Lebanon and Beirut. The two factions are not only divided by sectarian but mainly political lines, since members of the same sects can be found on either side. Since May 2012 scores of people have died and hundreds more have been wounded in clashes. Both Sunni and Shia Muslim fighters from Lebanon have joined fighting in Syrias civil war on either side.
The following is a chronological summary of the major events that occurred after Mohamed Morsis decree on 22 November 2012. This article documents part of the third wave of the 2011-2012 Egyptian revolution. \c\cHundreds of thousands of protesters started to demonstrate against Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi on 22 November 2012, after he granted himself unlimited powers to "protect" the nation, and the power to legislate without judicial oversight or review of his acts.  Morsi followed his decrees by making an effort to push through a referendum on an Islamist-supported draft constitution. \c\cThe demonstrations were organized by Egyptian opposition organizations and individuals, mainly pro-democratic liberals, leftists, secularists, and Christians. The demonstrations have resulted in violent clashes between members of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood-backed Freedom and Justice Party and the anti-Morsi protesters, with dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries. Demonstrators gathered outside the presidential palace, which in turn was surrounded by tanks and armored vehicles of the Republican Guard. The anti-Morsi protesters in Cairo alone have numbered over 200,000 in some protests. \c\cA number of Morsis advisers resigned in protest, and many judges spoke out against his actions as well. Resignations were tendered by the director of state broadcasting, Rafik Habib (Christian vice president of the Muslim Brotherhoods Freedom and Justice Party), and Zaghloul el-Balshi (general secretary of the commission overseeing the planned constitutional referendum). Seven members of Morsis 17-member advisory panel resigned in December 2012. \c\cOn 8 December 2012, Morsi annulled his decree which had expanded his presidential authority and removed judicial review of his decrees, an Islamist official said, but added that the effects of that declaration would stand. George Isaac of the Constitution Party said that Morsis declaration did not offer anything new, the National Salvation Front rejected it as an attempt save face, and the April 6 Movement and Gamal Fahmi of the Egyptian Journalists Syndicate said the new declaration failed to address the "fundamental" problem of the nature of the assembly that was tasked with drafting the constitution.

The regime is further upheld by support from Russia and Iran, while Qatar, Saudi Arabia transfer weapons to the rebels. By summer 2013 the governments offensive had slowed in the countrys north, while gained in the south. By July 2013, the Syrian government controls approximately 30–40 percent of the countrys territory and 60 percent of the Syrian population. The insurgency controls large swaths of territory in the countrys north and east. \c\cIn June 2013, the death toll surpassed 100,000 according to the United Nations.

The Sinai insurgency is radical Islamist militant activity in the Sinai peninsula, initiated in early 2011 as a fallout of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. The actions of those Islamist elements, largely composed of radicals among the local Bedouins, drew a harsh response from interim Egyptian government since mid-2011 known as Operation Eagle. However, attacks against government and foreign facilities in the area have continued by mid-2012, resulting in a massive crackdown by the new Egyptian government nicknamed Operation Sinai. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup, which resulted in the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred.
The Voyager 1 spacecraft is a 722-kilogram (1,592 lb) space probe launched by the US space agency, NASA, on September 5, 1977 to study the outer Solar System and interstellar medium. Operating for 44 years, 6 months and 29 days as of 3 April 2022, the spacecraft communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and return data. At a distance of about 125 AU from the Sun as of August 2013, it is the farthest manmade object from Earth. On September 12, 2013, NASA announced that Voyager 1 had entered interstellar space on August 25, 2012, making it the first manmade object to do so. As of 2013, the probe was moving with a relative velocity to the Sun of 17 kilometres per second (11 mi/s). The amount of power available to the probe has decreased over time and will no longer be able to power any single instrument by 2025. \c\cAs part of the Voyager program, and like its sister craft Voyager 2, the spacecraft is in an extended mission, tasked with locating and studying the boundaries of the Solar System, including the Kuiper belt, the heliosphere and to enter interstellar space. The primary mission ended on November 20, 1980, after encountering the Jovian system in 1979 and the Saturnian system in 1980. It was the first probe to provide detailed images of the two planets and their moons.

The M23 rebellion was fighting that had occurred between the March 23 Movement and the government in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since the formal end of the Second Congo War in 2003. \c\cIn April 2012, former CNDP soldiers mutinied against the DRC government supported by the peacekeeping contingent of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). Mutineers formed a rebel group called the March 23 Movement (M23), also known as the Congolese Revolutionary Army, composed of former members of the rebel National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), allegedly sponsored by the government of the neighbouring Rwanda. \c\cOn 20 November, M23 rebels took control of Goma, a provincial capital with a population of one million people. By the end of November, the conflict has forced more than 140,000 people to flee their homes, according to the U.N. refugee agency, on top of those already forced from their homes by previous rounds of fighting in the region. After repelling an ill-organized government counterattack and making some further gains, M23 agreed to withdraw from Goma on their own and left the city in early December. \c\cOn 24 February 2013, eleven African nations signed an agreement designed to bring peace to the region. In October, Congo said told the UN that the movement was virtually finished after being pushed back to a small area near Rwanda.

Typhoon Haiyan (known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda) is the second-deadliest Philippine typhoon on record, killing at least 2,344 people. The thirtieth named storm of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Haiyan originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia on November 2. Tracking generally westward, environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis and the system developed into a tropical depression the following day. After becoming a tropical storm and attaining the name Haiyan at 0000 UTC on November 4, the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to typhoon intensity by 1800 UTC on November 5. By November 6, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the system as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale; the storm passed over the island of Kayangel in Palau shortly after attaining this strength. \c\cThereafter, it continued to intensify; at 1200 UTC on November 7, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the storms maximum ten-minute sustained winds to 235 km/h (145 mph), the highest in relation to the cyclone. At 1800 UTC, the JTWC estimated the systems one-minute sustained winds to 315 km/h (195 mph), unofficially making Haiyan the fourth most intense tropical cyclone ever observed. Several hours later, the eye of the cyclone made its first landfall in the Philippines at Guiuan, Eastern Samar, without any change in intensity; if verified, this would make Haiyan the strongest tropical cyclone to make a landfall on record, surpassing the old record of 305 km/h (190 mph) set by Atlantic Hurricane Camille in 1969. Gradually weakening, the storm made five additional landfalls in the country before emerging over the South China Sea. Turning northwestward, the typhoon eventually struck northern Vietnam as a severe tropical storm on November 10. Haiyan was last noted as a tropical depression by the JMA the following day. \c\cThe cyclone caused catastrophic destruction in the central Philippines, particularly on Samar Island and Leyte, where the governor estimated that at least 10,000 people may have died in the city of Tacloban alone. According to UN officials, about 11 million people have been affected and many have been left homeless.
Typhoon Haiyan (known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda) is the second-deadliest Philippine typhoon on record, killing at least 3,681 people in that country alone.

Turning northwestward, the typhoon eventually struck northern Vietnam as a severe tropical storm on November 10. Haiyan was last noted as a tropical depression by the JMA the following day. \c\cThe cyclone caused catastrophic destruction in the central Philippines, particularly on Samar Island and Leyte. According to UN officials, about 11 million people have been affected and many have been left homeless.
Typhoon Haiyan (known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda) is the second-deadliest Philippine typhoon on record, killing at least 3,681 people in that country alone. The thirtieth named storm of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Haiyan originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia on November 2. Tracking generally westward, environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis and the system developed into a tropical depression the following day. After becoming a tropical storm and attaining the name Haiyan at 0000 UTC on November 4, the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to typhoon intensity by 1800 UTC on November 5. By November 6, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the system as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale; the storm passed over the island of Kayangel in Palau shortly after attaining this strength. \c\cThereafter, it continued to intensify; at 1200 UTC on November 7, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the storms maximum ten-minute sustained winds to 235 km/h (145 mph), the highest in relation to the cyclone. At 1800 UTC, the JTWC estimated the systems one-minute sustained winds to 315 km/h (195 mph), unofficially making Haiyan the fourth most intense tropical cyclone ever observed. Several hours later, the eye of the cyclone made its first landfall in the Philippines at Guiuan, Eastern Samar, without any change in intensity; if verified, this would make Haiyan the strongest tropical cyclone to make a landfall on record, surpassing the old record of 305 km/h (190 mph) set by Atlantic Hurricane Camille in 1969.

The nuclear program of Iran was launched in the 1950s with the help of the United States as part of the Atoms for Peace program. The participation of the United States and Western European governments in Irans nuclear program continued until the 1979 Iranian Revolution that toppled the Shah of Iran. \c\cAfter the 1979 revolution, a clandestine nuclear weapons research program was disbanded by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (1902-1989), who considered such weapons forbidden under Muslim ethics and jurisprudence. Iran has signed treaties repudiating the possession of weapons of mass destruction including the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). \c\cIrans nuclear program has included several research sites, two uranium mines, a research reactor, and uranium processing facilities that include three known uranium enrichment plants. \c\cIrans first nuclear power plant, Bushehr I reactor was complete with major assistance of Russian government agency Rosatom and officially opened on 12 September 2011. Iran has announced that it is working on a new 360 MW nuclear power plant to be located in Darkhovin.  The Russian engineering contractor Atomenergoprom said the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant would reach full capacity by the end of 2012. Iran has also indicated that it will seek more medium-sized nuclear power plants and uranium mines in the future. \c\cIn a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, the United States Intelligence Community assessed that Iran had ended all "nuclear weapon design and weaponization work" in 2003. In 2012, U.S. intelligence agencies reported that Iran was pursuing research that could enable it to produce nuclear weapons, but was not attempting to do so. \c\cIn November 2011, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors criticized Iran after an IAEA report concluded that before 2003 Iran likely had undertaken research and experiments geared to developing a nuclear weapons capability. The IAEA report details allegations that Iran conducted studies related to nuclear weapons design, including detonator development, the multiple-point initiation of high explosives, and experiments involving nuclear payload integration into a missile delivery vehicle. A number of Western nuclear experts have stated there was very little new in the report, that it primarily concerned Iranian activities prior to 2003, and that media reports exaggerated its significance. Iran threatened to reduce its cooperation with the IAEA.
A magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck Iran, on November 28 at a depth of 16.4 km (10.2 mi). The earthquake killed at least 7 people and another 45 were injured.

Fighting from the Syrian civil war has spilled over into Lebanon as Lebanese opponents and supporters of the Syrian government have traveled to Syria to fight, and attacked each other on Lebanese soil. The Syrian conflict has been described as having stoked a "resurgence of sectarian violence in Lebanon", with Lebanons Sunni Muslims mostly supporting the rebels in Syria, while Shiites have largely supported Assad, whose Alawite minority is usually described as an offshoot of Shia Islam. Killings, unrest and kidnappings of foreign citizens across Lebanon has resulted. \c\cIn mid 2011, seven people were killed and 59 wounded in a fight between gunmen in Tripoli. In May 2012, the conflict spread to Beirut, and later to south and east Lebanon, while the Lebanese Armed Forces deployed in north Lebanon and Beirut. As of October 2013 there have been at least 330 fatalities and more than 1,900 injuries. Among Lebanons political blocs the anti-Syrian Saudi-backed March 14 Alliance supports the Syrian rebels, and the Iranian-backed pro-Syrian March 8 Alliance supports the Syrian government.
Typhoon Haiyan, known as Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, was an exceptionally powerful tropical cyclone that devastated portions of Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, in early November 2013. It is the deadliest Philippine typhoon on record, killing at least 5,632 people in that country alone.  Haiyan is also the strongest storm recorded at landfall, and unofficially the fourth strongest typhoon ever recorded in terms of wind speed. \c\cThe thirtieth named storm of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Haiyan originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia on November 2, 2013.

The Hong Kong Observatory put the storms maximum ten-minute sustained winds at 260 km/h (160 mph) prior to landfall in the central Philippines, while the China Meteorological Administration estimated the maximum ten-minute sustained winds at the time to be around 75 m/s (270 km/h or 167 mph). At 1800 UTC, the JTWC estimated the systems one-minute sustained winds to 315 km/h (196 mph), unofficially making Haiyan the fourth most intense tropical cyclone ever observed.

The Euromaidan (Ukrainian: Євромайдан) is a term for the wave of demonstrations and civil unrest that began on the night of 21 November 2013, when Ukrainian citizens started spontaneous protests in the capital of Kiev after the Ukrainian government suspended preparations for signing an Association Agreement and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Union. In turn, protesters have demanded the resignation of the current government, the impeachment of the president, and have called for snap elections. \c\cThe protests are ongoing despite a heavy police presence, and an increasing number of university students are joining the protests. Escalating violence in the early morning of 30 November from government forces has caused the level of protests to rise, with 400,000–800,000 protesters demonstrating in Kiev at the movements peak on 1 December.
Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people living in India may face discrimination not faced by non-LGBT persons. Homosexual intercourse was a criminal offence until 2009 under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The Delhi High Court ruled in Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi that Section 377 and other legal prohibitions against private, adult, consensual, and non-commercial same-sex conduct to be in direct violation of fundamental rights provided by the Indian Constitution. Supreme Court of India overturned the decision of the lower count on December 11, 2013 and made homosexual acts illegal again.
The Sinai insurgency comprises a series of actions by radical Islamist militants in the Sinai peninsula, initiated in early 2011 as a fallout of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. The actions of those Islamist elements, largely composed of radicals among the local Bedouins, drew a harsh response from interim Egyptian government since mid-2011 known as Operation Eagle. However, attacks against government and foreign facilities in the area continued into 2012, resulting in a massive crackdown by the new Egyptian government nicknamed Operation Sinai. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian revolution, which resulted in the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred. Some of the reported attacks never occurred. A CBS journalist named Clarissa Ward went in undercover to the Sinai and saw evidence of a scorched earth policy.
On 29 December 2013, a suicide bombing took place at the Volgograd-1 station in the city of Volgograd, in the Volgograd Oblast of Southern Russia, killing at least sixteen people and injuring approximately fifty. The attack was initially thought to have been carried out by a female suicide bomber, although later there was uncertainty as to the identity of the bomber, with some news agencies stating it was a man.  No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Russian authorities are treating it as an act of terrorism.
In December 2013, two separate suicide bombings a day apart targeted mass transportation in the city of Volgograd, in the Volgograd Oblast of Southern Russia, killing 34 people overall, including both perpetrators. The attacks followed a bus bombing carried out in the same city two months earlier.
The 2014 Australian Open was a tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park on 13–26 January 2014. It was the 102nd edition of the Australian Open, and the first Grand Slam tournament of the year.

The Euromaidan (Ukrainian: Євромайдан, literally "Eurosquare") is a wave of ongoing demonstrations and civil unrest in Ukraine, which began on the night of 21 November 2013 with very large public protests demanding closer European integration. The scope of the protests has since evolved, with many calls for the resignation of President Yanukovych and his government. Protesters also have stated they joined because of the dispersal of protesters on 30 November and "a will to change life in Ukraine". By 25 January 2014 the protests had been fueled by the perception of widespread government corruption, abuse of power, and violation of human rights in Ukraine. \c\cThe demonstrations began on the night of 21 November 2013, when spontaneous protests erupted in the capital of Kiev after the Ukrainian government suspended preparations for signing an Association Agreement and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Union. After a few days of demonstrations an increasing number of university students joined the protests. \c\cDespite so far unmet demands to renew Ukraine-EU integration, the Euromaidan has been repeatedly characterized as an event of major political symbolism for the European Union itself, particularly as "the largest ever pro-European rally in history", able to "improve the EUs damaged self-confidence". \c\cThe protests are ongoing despite a heavy police presence, regular sub-freezing temperatures, and snow. Escalating violence in the early morning of 30 November from government forces has caused the level of protests to rise, with 400,000–800,000 protesters demonstrating in Kiev on the weekends of 1 December and 8 December. In the weeks since, protest attendance has fluctuated from 50,000 to 200,000 during organized rallies. Violent riots have taken place on December 1 and January 19–21 in response to police brutality and government repressions. Since 23 January several Western Ukrainian Oblast (province) Governor buildings and regional councils have been occupied by Euromaidan activists. In the Russophone cities Zaporizhzhya, Dnipropetrovsk and Odessa protesters also tried to take over their local government building. \c\cAccording to December 2013 polls (by three different pollsters) between 45% and more than 50% of Ukrainians supported Euromaidan, while between 42% and 50% opposed it. The biggest support for the protest can be found in Kiev (about 75%) and western Ukraine (more than 80%). In a poll taken on 7 and 8 December, 73% of protesters had committed to continue protesting in Kiev as long as needed until their demands are fulfilled. Polls also show that the nation is divided age-wise: while majority of young people are pro-EU, older generations (50 and above) more often choose Customs Union.
The 2014 Winter Olympics, officially the XXII Olympic Winter Games, or the 22nd Winter Olympics, is a major international multi-sport event being held in Sochi, Russia. \c\cScheduled for 7–23 February 2014, opening rounds in figure skating, skiing, and snowboard competitions were held on the eve of the Opening Ceremony, 6 February 2014. Both the Olympics and 2014 Winter Paralympics are being organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It is the first Olympics in Russia since the breakup of the USSR in 1991. The USSR was the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. \c\cA total of 98 events in 15 winter sport disciplines are being held during the Games. A number of new competitions—a total of 12 accounting for gender—are being held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, womens ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events are being held around two clusters of new venues; an Olympic Park constructed in Sochis Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance, and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana. \c\cIn preparation, organizers focused on modernizing the telecommunications, electric power, and transportation infrastructures of the region. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to over US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing as the most expensive Olympics in history. \c\cThe lead-up to the 2014 Games was marked by major controversies, including allegations of corruption leading to the aforementioned cost overruns, concerns for the safety and human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) athletes and supporters during the Games due to the countrys recent anti-LGBT policies, which led to ongoing Olympic-focussed protests of the laws and its effects, protests by ethnic Circassian activists over the site of Sochi (the site of what they consider to be a genocide) and various security concerns over threats by jihadist groups tied to the insurgency in the North Caucasus.
Following anti-government protests that began in 2013, and culminated in the impeachment of President Viktor Yanukovich, residents of the Eastern and Southern parts of the country, protested against the move. This led to polarization to a level that warnings were issued against the partition of Ukraine.
On March 1 2014, a group of knife-wielding men attacked customers at the Kunming Railway Station in the city of Kunming in south-western China.

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, operated by a Boeing 777-200 aircraft, departed Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am on 8 March 2014. MH370 was expected to land in Beijing at 6.30am the same day. Flight MH370 lost contact with Subang Air Traffic Control at 2.40am on 8 March 2014. The flight was carrying a total number of 227 passengers (including 2 infants), 12 crew members. \c\cMalaysia Airlines is currently working with the authorities who have activated their Search and Rescue team to locate the aircraft.
The Crimean crisis (Russian: Крымский кризис, Ukrainian: Кримська криза) is an ongoing international crisis involving Russia and Ukraine. Most developments apply to the Crimean peninsula, formerly a multiethnic region of the Ukraine comprising the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the administratively separate municipality of Sevastopol; both are populated by an ethnic Russian majority and a large minority of ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars. The demographics of Crimea have undergone dramatic changes in the past centuries. \c\cThe crisis unfolded in late February 2014 in the aftermath of the Ukrainian revolution, when—after months of protests by Euromaidan and days of violent clashes between protesters and police in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev—the Ukrainian parliament held a vote to impeach the President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. However the vote failed to reach the three-fourths majority required to impeach a President according to the Constitution of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said President Yanukovych was illegally impeached and that he regards him as Ukraine’s legitimate president. This was followed by the interim appointment of the Yatsenyuk Government as well as the appointment of a new Acting President of Ukraine, Oleksandr Turchynov, were seen by Russia as "self-proclaimed" in a "coup detat". \c\cBeginning on February 26, unmarked men claimed by Russia to be local self-defense forces but suspected to be Russian forces without insignia gradually took control of the Crimean peninsula. The Crimean parliament voted to dismiss the Crimean government, replace its Prime Minister and to call a referendum on Crimeas autonomy.  Several days later, on March 11, after disagreements between Crimea, Sevastopol, and the newly appointed interim government in Ukraine, the Crimean parliament and the city council of Sevastopol adopted a resolution to show their intention to unilaterally declare themselves independent as a single united nation with the possibility of joining the Russian Federation as a federal subject—should voters approve to do so in an upcoming referendum. \c\cOn March 16, officials said that some 95.5% of voters in Crimea supported joining Russia. Election officials said the turnout was a record high, although many Tatars and opponents of the referendum were reported to have boycotted the vote.  On March 17, the Crimean parliament officially declared its independence from Ukraine and requested to join the Russian Federation. \c\cThe Ukrainian parliament has claimed that the referendum is unconstitutional. Russia declared that its troops would stay until the political situation has been normalized while recognizing both the recently appointed government of Crimea and mayor of Sevastopol, as well as the referendum and its possible outcome. The United States and the European Union said they consider the vote to be illegal, and warned that there may be repercussions for the Crimean ballot.
The Bundy standoff is a dispute between the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and cattle farmer Cliven Bundy. It began in 1993 when Bundy stopped paying fees for grazing his cattle on federal land in Bunkerville, Nevada. In 1998 Bundy was legally prohibited from grazing his cattle on the land. In April 2014 after years of repeated violations of multiple court orders, the dispute led to a confrontation between armed supporters of Bundy and law enforcement.
Since the end of February 2014, demonstrations by pro-Russian and anti-government groups have taken place in major cities across the south-eastern regions of Ukraine, in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the Euromaidan movement. Various Russian news media outlets have used the term Russian Spring ( Error: {{Lang-xx}}: text has italic markup (help)) to describe the protests. The protests have since escalated into an armed separatist insurgency.
The 2014 Boston Marathon will take place in Boston, Massachusetts, on Monday, April 21 (Patriots Day).  It will be the 118th edition of the mass-participation marathon. The race is organized by the Boston Athletic Association.  Due to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, extra security measures will be implemented this year.  The 2014 Marathon has about 36,000 registered participants, second only to the 1996 race in number of entries. The Boston Globe reported that over a million people are expected to line the marathon route to watch the race, twice the number who attend during a typical year.

The Al-Qaeda insurgency in Yemen refers to armed conflict between the Yemeni government with United States assistance, and al-Qaeda affiliated cells. The ongoing strife is often categorized as a sub-conflict in the greater Global War on Terror. \c\cGovernment crackdown against al-Qaeda cells began in 2001, and reached an escalation point on January 14, 2010 when Yemen declared open war on al Qaeda. In addition to battling al Qaeda across several provinces, Yemen is also contending with Shia insurgency in the north and militant separatists in the south. Fighting with al-Qaeda escalated during the course of the 2011 Yemeni revolution, with Jihadists seizing most of the Abyan Governorate and declaring it an Emirate at the close of March. A second wave of violence occurred throughout early 2012, with militants claiming territory across the southwest amid heavy combat with government forces. \c\cIn May 2013, attackers blew up Yemens main oil pipeline, halting the flow of crude oil.
Jean McConville, née Murray (June 7, 1934 – December 1972), was a woman from Belfast in Northern Ireland who, in 1972, was abducted and murdered by the Provisional IRA and secretly buried on a beach in County Louth in the Republic of Ireland. Her family claimed that she was killed because she had helped a wounded British soldier. However, the IRA wrongly claimed that she had been passing information about republicans to the British Army. An investigation by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland rejected these claims. As she was a widowed mother of ten, the McConville killing was particularly controversial. Her body was not found until 2003, and the crime has not been solved. For over 27 years after the murder, the IRA denied that it had been involved.

The Naxalite–Maoist insurgency is an ongoing conflict between Maoist groups, known as Naxalites or Naxals, and the Indian government. The conflict in its present form began after the 2004 formation of the CPI-Maoists, a rebel group composed of the PWG (Peoples War Group), and the MCC (Maoist Communist Centre). In January 2005 talks between the Andhra Pradesh state government and the CPI-Maoists broke down and the rebels accused authorities of not addressing their demands for a written truce, release of prisoners and redistribution of land. The ongoing conflict has taken place over a vast territory (around half of Indias 28 states) with hundreds of people being killed annually in clashes between the CPI-Maoists and the government every year since 2005. In addition the CPA-Maoists have specifically targeted civilians during the conflict, a practice that has resulted in hundreds of deaths every year since 2006. \c\cThe armed wing of the Naxalite–Maoists is called the PLGA (Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army) and is estimated to have between 6,500 and 9,500 cadres, mostly armed with small arms. \c\cThe Naxalites control territory throughout Bihar, Jharkand and Andhra Pradesh states and claim to be supported by the poorest of the rural population, especially the Adivasis. The Naxalites have frequently targeted tribal, police and government workers in what they say is a fight for improved land rights and more jobs for neglected agricultural labourers and the poor. The Naxalites claim that they are following a strategy of rural rebellion similar to a protracted peoples war against the government. \c\cIn February 2009, the Indian central government announced a new nationwide initiative, to be called the "Integrated Action Plan" (IAP) for broad, co-ordinated operations aimed at dealing with the Naxalite problem in all affected states, namely (Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal).  This plan included funding for grass-roots economic development projects in Naxalite-affected areas, as well as increased special police funding for better containment and reduction of Naxalite influence. In August 2010, after the first full year of implementation of the national IAP program, Karnataka was removed from the list of naxal affected states. In July 2011, the number of Naxal affected areas was reduced to (figure includes proposed addition of 20 districts) 83 districts across nine states.  In December 2011, the national government reported that the number of Naxalite related deaths and injuries nationwide had gone down by nearly 50% from 2010 levels. \c\cThe Naxalite–Maoist insurgency gained international media attention after the 2013 Naxal attack in Darbha valley resulted in the deaths of around 24 Indian National Congress leaders including the former state minister Mahendra Karma and the Chhattisgarh Congress chief Nand Kumar Patel.
The Soma mine disaster occurred on May 14, 2014 in the town of Soma, Manisa Province, western Turkey, killing 17 and trapping more than 200. The mine is owned by SOMA Komur Isletmeleri A.S. and is located around 250 kilometres south of Istanbul. \c\cIt is the worst mining accident in Turkey since the 2010 Zonguldak mine disaster.
Soma mine disaster is an underground mine fire at a coal mine in Soma, Manisa, Turkey which is the worst mine disaster in Turkeys history. The fire began on 13 May 2014 at a mine owned by coal producer Soma Kömür İşletmeleri A.Ş. The fire was started by an explosion suspected to have been caused by electrical equipment, an explanation much doubted by some. Because the fire occurred at the mines shift change, the exact number of miners underground at the time is unknown; the number of trapped workers could be as high as 800. Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Taner Yıldız announced the number of dead was 282 as of 08:15 (EEST) on 15 May 2014. 120 workers are said to be still inside, with rescue work ongoing. \c\cMiners protested dangerous mining conditions in late 2013, and the ruling Justice and Development Party of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan rejected a demand to investigate the mines safety only weeks before the disaster.
Since the end of February 2014, demonstrations by pro-Russian and anti-government groups have taken place in major cities across the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, in the aftermath of the Euromaidan movement. Various Russian news media outlets have used the term Russian Spring ( Error: {{Lang-xx}}: text has italic markup (help)) to describe the wave of demonstrations. During the unrest, the Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation after a crisis there. Protests in some regions have escalated into an armed separatist insurgency, which led the Ukrainian government to launch a military counter-offensive against the insurgents.
On the evening of September 11, 2012, Islamic militants attacked the American diplomatic mission at Benghazi, in Libya, killing U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and Sean Smith, U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer.  Stevens was the first U.S. Ambassador killed on duty since 1979. \c\cSeveral hours later, in the early morning of the next day, a second assault targeted a nearby CIA annex in a different compound about one mile away, killing two CIA contractors, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. Although initial news reports stated that Woods and Doherty were State Department security officers, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has since confirmed that the two men were CIA operatives. Ten others were injured in the attacks which were condemned by the governments of Libya, the United States, and many other countries throughout the world. \c\cMany Libyans praised the late ambassador and staged public demonstrations condemning the militias which were suspected of involvement in the attacks. The militias, formed during the civil war to oppose leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi., have since become a source of instability in post-Ghaddafi Libya. The Libyan government has begun attempts to disband many of the groups. \c\cThe United States increased security worldwide at various diplomatic and military facilities and began investigating the Benghazi attack.  In the aftermath of the attack, State Department officials were criticized for denying requests for additional security at the consulate prior to the attack.  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton subsequently took responsibility for the security lapses. \c\cInitially, it was reported that the Benghazi attack was a spontaneous protest, triggered by an anti-Muslim video, Innocence of Muslims. Subsequent investigations determined that there was no such protest and that the attacks were premeditated. \c\cOn August 6, 2013, it was reported that the U.S. had filed criminal charges against several individuals, including militia leader Ahmed Abu Khattala, for alleged involvement in the attacks. Khattala has been described by Libyan and U.S. officials as the Benghazi leader of Ansar al-Sharia. To date, a few arrests have been made, although none by the FBI. As of May 2014, no one has yet been prosecuted. \c\cOn the weekend of June 14 to June 15, U.S. special forces, in coordination with the FBI, captured Ahmed Abu Khattala, one of the suspects leaders of the attack.
After advancing on the Iraqi city of Mosul for almost a week, on the night of 9 June 2014 forces from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS; also called ISIL), in conjunction with Sunni militants loyal to the former Baath government and anti-government tribes, took control of most of it. An estimated 1,300 armed fighters seized the Nineveh Province government offices, army facilities, and Mosul International Airport. Approximately 500,000 residents of Mosul were believed to have fled the city. Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki called for a national state of emergency following the attack. Despite the security crisis, Iraqs Parliament was not convened and did not allow Maliki to declare a state of emergency; many Sunni and Kurdish legislators boycotted the session because they opposed expanding the prime ministers powers. Mosul was reported to be entirely in ISIS hands as of 10 June. On the following day the city of Tikrit also fell to insurgents, who burned government buildings and freed hundreds of inmates from the local prison. \c\cAs Iraqi security forces fled south, Kurdish forces filled the vacuum left adding to the pre-existing issue of the disputed territories of Northern Iraq, with Kurdish parliamentarian Shoresh Haji stating "I hope that the Kurdish leadership will not miss this golden opportunity to bring Kurdish lands in the disputed territories back under Kurdish control". Kurdish mobilization was seen as the latest sign of "rising anarchy" in Iraq. According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, "The Kurds, seeing the Iraqi central regimes weakness, will take all the necessary measures to protect their autonomy and expand their influence to neighboring Syrian Kurdistan. The Kurds understand very well that they could be the next target after the Assyrians and accordingly will preempt any attempt by the jihadists to step foot in their areas. The fall of Mosul could become the beginning of Kurdish quest for independence."
On June 19 a storm system with torrential rains caused severe flash flooding across Northeastern Bulgaria, leaving dozens of villages without electricity and submerging large parts of several cities in the region. At least 13 people were reported killed - 10 in the Asparuhovo neighborhood of Varna and 3 in the city of Dobrich.
Algeria–Egypt relations refer to the bilateral ties between the governments of the two Arab North African countries of Egypt and Algeria. Relations between both countries have been generally friendly throughout their history which dates back to Egypts strong support for Ahmed Ben Bellas FLN during the Algerian War of Independence. This was later followed by Algerias support for Egypt during the Six-Day War in 1967 and the October War in 1973. In addition both countries are member states of the Arab League while sharing similar views on major regional issues such as the Palestinian cause and the conflict in Sudan as well as the same vision on reforming the United Nations Security Council.

The Sinai insurgency comprises a series of actions by Islamist militants in the Sinai peninsula, initiated in early 2011 as a fallout of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. The actions of those Islamist elements, largely composed of tribesmen among the local Bedouins, drew a harsh response from interim Egyptian government since mid-2011 known as Operation Eagle. However, attacks against government and foreign facilities in the area continued into 2012, resulting in a massive crackdown by the new Egyptian government nicknamed Operation Sinai. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup détat, which resulted in the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred.

A referendum on whether Scotland should be an independent country  took place on Thursday, 18 September 2014. \c\cFollowing an agreement between the Scottish and the United Kingdom governments, the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill, setting out the arrangements for this referendum, was passed by the Scottish Parliament in November 2013. The referendum question, as recommended by the Electoral Commission, is "Should Scotland be an independent country?" – voters can answer only Yes or No. To pass, the independence proposal requires a simple majority. With some exceptions, all residents in Scotland aged 16 or over can vote, a total of about 4.3 million people. \c\cYes Scotland is the main campaign group for independence, while Better Together is the main campaign group to maintain the union. Many other campaign groups, political parties, businesses, newspapers and prominent individuals have also been involved. Prominent issues raised during the campaign include which currency an independent Scotland would use, public expenditure, EU membership, and North Sea oil. \c\cCounting began after polls closed at 22:00 BST (21:00 UTC) on 18 September. Running totals from the 32 local government areas were expected during the night, with more than half the votes likely to have been counted by 03:30. By the morning of 19 September 2014, accounting for votes all but one of the areas, about 55% of voters voted in favor of Scotland remaining a territory of the United Kingdom.

The 2014 Hong Kong protests, also known as the Umbrella Movement or Umbrella Revolution, began in September 2014 when anti-government advocates in Hong Kong protested outside the government headquarters and occupied several major city intersections after the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress (NPCSC) announced its decision on proposed electoral reform. Instead of allowing civil nominations, the NPCSC made it clear that a 1200-member nominating committee, which would remain nominated by the business factions and strictly controlled by Beijing, would elect two to three electoral candidates with more than half of the votes before the general public can vote upon, which is seen as effectively screening out any pro-democracy candidate. \c\cThe Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism began protesting outside the government headquarters on 22 September 2014 against the NPCSCs decision. On the evening of 26 September, several hundred demonstrators breached a security barrier and entered the forecourt of the Central Government Complex, which was once a public space that has been barred from public entry since July 2014. Officers cordoned off protesters within the courtyard and restricted their movement overnight, eventually removing them by force the next day. Occupy Central announced that they would begin their civil disobedience campaign immediately. \c\cOn 28 September, protesters blocked both east-west arterial routes in northern Hong Kong Island near Admiralty. Apparent rough-handling by police, including the unnecessary use of tear gas, and attacks on protesters in Mong Kok by opponents that included triad members, triggered more citizens joining the protests. The government set 6 October as a deadline for the protests to end, but this was ignored by protesters, although they allowed government workers to enter offices that had previously been blocked. The state-run Chinese media claimed that the West had played an "instigating" role in the protests and that "more people in Hong Kong are supporting the anti-Occupy Central movement," and warned of "deaths and injuries and other grave consequences" if the protests continue.
The submarine hunts or submarine incidents were a series of several incidents involving foreign submarines that occurred in Swedish territorial waters during the Cold War, more specifically during the 1980s. In this time, there was intensive debate and speculation in Swedish media about the possibility of Soviet submarine infiltration of Swedish territorial waters. \c\cWhile there had been earlier incidents involving foreign submarines (as seen below), the incidents normally referred to in this context are those that followed the sensational stranding of the Soviet submarine U 137 deep inside Swedish waters on October 27, 1981. The Swedish Navy responded aggressively to these perceived threats, increasing patrols in Swedish waters, mining and electronically monitoring passages, and repeatedly chasing and attacking suspected submarines with depth charge bombs, but no hits or casualties were ever recorded. \c\cReports of new submarine sightings and television imagery of Swedish Navy helicopters firing depth charges into coastal waters against suspected intruders became commonplace in the mid-to-late 1980s. They remain, for many Swedes, one of the iconic images of the Cold War and of the Swedish relation to the Soviet Union—for some underlining what was considered a major threat to Swedish sovereignty, while for others illustrating the tense atmosphere of the time. However, the reports of these incidents are not uncontested, and an intensive debate emerged early on. This debate unfolded somewhat, but far from exclusively, along leftwing/rightwing lines, and became tied up with the larger issues of relations to Moscow and Swedish armed neutrality. The Soviet Union consistently denied that it was responsible for violating Swedish waters, and claimed that the U 137 had only crossed the border because of navigational faults. Russia today maintains this stand. While the submarine sightings subsided with the fall of the Soviet Union, the debate about these events has reemerged sporadically. They have been the subject of a number of government investigations in Sweden, and continue to attract media attention.
On October 24, 2014, at around 11:45 AM PST, Marysville Pilchuck High School, located in Marysville, Washington outside Seattle, was the target of a school shooting. \c\c A gunman opened fire and wounded several students before killing himself at the school. \c\cThe gunman opened fire in the cafeteria, shooting several students before committing suicide.

The Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual Major League Baseball (MLB) award, given to one outstanding player in the American League and one in the National League. Since 1931, it has been awarded by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). The winners receive the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award, which became the official name of the award in 1944, in honor of the first MLB commissioner, who served from 1920 until his death on November 25, 1944. \c\cMVP voting takes place before the postseason, but the results are not announced until after the World Series. The BBWAA began by polling three writers in each league city in 1938, reducing that number to two per league city in 1961. The BBWAA does not offer a clear-cut definition of what "most valuable" means, instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters. \c\cFirst basemen, with 34 winners, have won the most MVPs among infielders, followed by second basemen (16), third basemen (15), and shortstops (15). Of the 24 pitchers who have won the award, 15 are right-handed while 9 are left-handed. Walter Johnson, Carl Hubbell, and Hal Newhouser are the only pitchers who have won multiple times, Newhouser winning consecutively in 1944 and 1945. \c\cHank Greenberg, Stan Musial, Alex Rodriguez, and Robin Yount have won at different positions, while Rodriguez is the only player who has won the award with two different teams at two different positions. Barry Bonds has won the most often (seven times) and the most consecutively (2001–04). Jimmie Foxx was the first player to win multiple times; 9 players have won three times, and 19 have won twice. Frank Robinson is the only player to win the award in both the American and National Leagues. \c\cThe awards only tie occurred in the National League in 1979, when Keith Hernandez and Willie Stargell received an equal number of points. There have been 17 unanimous winners, who received all the first-place votes. The New York Yankees have the most winning players with 22, followed by the St. Louis Cardinals with 17 winners. The award has never been presented to a member of the following five teams: Arizona Diamondbacks, Miami Marlins, New York Mets, Tampa Bay Rays, and Washington Nationals. The most recent recipients are Mike Trout in the American League and Clayton Kershaw in the National League. \c\cIn recent decades, pitchers have rarely won the award. When Justin Verlander won the AL award in 2011, he became the first pitcher in either league to be named the MVP since Dennis Eckersley in 1992. Verlander also became the first starting pitcher to win this award since Roger Clemens had accomplished the feat in 1986. The National League went even longer without an MVP award to a pitcher—after Bob Gibson won in 1968, no pitcher in that league was named MVP until Kershaw in 2014.
The shooting of Michael Brown occurred on August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Brown, an 18-year-old black man, was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, 28, a white police officer. The disputed circumstances of the shooting and the resultant protests and civil unrest received considerable attention in the United States and abroad. \c\cBrown and his friend Dorian Johnson were walking down the middle of the street when Wilson drove up and ordered them to move to the sidewalk. Brown and Wilson struggled through the window of the police vehicle until Wilsons gun was fired, either intentionally or as a result of the struggle. Brown and Johnson then fled in different directions, with Wilson in pursuit of Brown. Wilson shot Brown six times, killing him. Witness reports differ as to whether and when Brown had his hands raised, and whether he was moving toward Wilson, when the final shots were fired. \c\cThe shooting sparked protests and unrest in Ferguson, in part due to the belief among many that Brown was surrendering, as well as longstanding racial tensions between the majority-black Ferguson community and the majority-white city government and police. Protests, both peaceful and violent, along with vandalism and looting, continued for more than a week, resulting in night curfews. The response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests received significant criticism from the media and politicians.  There were concerns over insensitivity, tactics and a militarized response. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered local police organizations to cede much of their authority to the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Mainly peaceful protests continued for several weeks. \c\cA few days after the shooting, the Ferguson Police Department released a video of a convenience store robbery that occurred only minutes before the shooting. It showed Brown taking cigarillos and shoving a store employee who tried to prevent him from leaving.  The timing of the video release received criticism from some media, the Brown family, and some public officials, who viewed the release as an attempt to impeach Brown.  On the other hand, others said the video was informative as to Browns state of mind, with the shooting incident coming so shortly after the robbery.  There is conflicting evidence as to whether Officer Wilson knew of Browns involvement in the robbery. \c\cThe events surrounding the shooting are under investigation by a county grand jury, which will decide whether there is probable cause to indict Wilson for his actions. The FBI is investigating whether Wilson violated Browns civil rights. The Department of Justice is reviewing Ferguson Police Departments internal investigations of use of force during the last four years.
Since 2009, conflicts between rival nomadic tribes in Sudan and South Sudan have resulted in a large number of casualties and displaced hundreds of thousands of people.
The Xinjiang conflict is an ongoing separatist struggle in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) far-west province of Xinjiang. A group of Uyghur separatists claim that the region, which they refer to as East Turkestan, is not a part of China, but that the Soviet supported Second East Turkestan Republic was invaded by the PRC in 1949 and has since been under Chinese occupation. The separatist movement is led by Turkic Islamist militant organizations, most notably the East Turkestan independence movement, against the national government in Beijing.
World AIDS Day, observed on 1 December every year, is dedicated to raising awareness of the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV infection, and mourning those who have died of the disease. Government and health officials, non-governmental organizations and individuals around the world observe the day, often with education on AIDS prevention and control. \c\cAccording to Mr. Piyush- "World AIDS Day is one of eight official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO), along with World Health Day, World Blood Donor Day, World Immunization Week, World Tuberculosis Day, World No Tobacco Day, World Malaria Day and World Hepatitis Day. Since 1995, the President of the United States has made an official proclamation on World AIDS Day. \c\cAs of 2013, AIDS has killed more than 36 million people worldwide (1981-2012), and an estimated 35.3 million people are living with HIV, making it one of the most important global public health issues in recorded history. Despite recent improved access to antiretroviral treatment in many regions of the world, the AIDS epidemic claims an estimated 2 million lives each year, of which about 270,000 are children.
December 2014 US hostage rescue operation in Yemen was a failed attempt by US Navy SEALS to rescue US journalist Luke Somers and South African teacher Pierre Korkie held as hostages by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Shabwah Governorate of Yemen. \c\cOn 26 November 2014, U.S. Navy SEALs and Yemeni special forces attempted to rescue Luke Somers and Pierre Korkie, but they had been moved to another location by AQAP prior to the raid. Eight hostages were rescued in that attempt, but none were American. \c\cOn 4 December 2014 AQAP threatened to execute Somers within three days if the US government failed to meet unspecified demands. \c\cOn 6 December 2014 40 SEALs used V-22 Ospreys to land a distance from the compound were Somers and Korkie were kept at about 1 a.m. local time, according to a senior defense official. An AQAP fighter apparently spotted them while relieving himself outside, a counter-terrorism official with knowledge of the operation told ABC News, beginning a firefight that lasted about 10 minutes. \c\cWhen the American soldiers finally entered the building were Somers and Korkie were kept, they found both men alive, but gravely wounded. \c\cThe US forces pulled Somers and Korkie onto the Ospreys and medical teams began performing surgery in midair. Korkie died during the flight and Somers died after the Ospreys landed on the USS Makin Island. \c\cThe entire operation took 30 minutes. Six AQAP fighters were killed, US officials said. No American troops were killed or injured in the raid. \c\cInformation "indicated that Lukes life was in imminent danger," said US President Barack Obama. "Based on this assessment, and as soon as there was reliable intelligence and an operational plan, I authorized a rescue attempt." He condemned the "barbaric murder" of Somers. "The callous disregard for Lukes life is more proof of the depths of AQAPs depravity, and further reason why the world must never cease in seeking to defeat their evil ideology," Obama said in a statement.
ADF insurgency refers to the ongoing rebellion of the Allied Democratic Forces in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo directed against the governments of the two countries. The insurgency began in 1996, intensifying in 2013, resulting in hundreds of deaths.
Typhoon Hagupit, also known as Typhoon Ruby in the Philippines, is currently a relatively weak tropical cyclone affecting the Visayas and the southern part of Luzon, which was tied with Typhoon Vongfong as the most intense tropical cyclone of 2014 in terms of sustained winds. Hagupit, the twenty-second named storm and the eleventh typhoon of the annual typhoon season, started as a tropical storm on December 1 and then became a typhoon the next day. It explosively intensified into a Category 5 super typhoon on December 4. Subsequently, Hagupit began a weakening trend before making landfall in Eastern Samar as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon.
The 2014 Hong Kong protests, also called the Umbrella Revolution (Chinese: 雨傘革命), began in September 2014 when members of the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong protested outside the Hong Kong Government headquarters and occupied several major city intersections after Chinas Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress (NPCSC) announced its decision on proposed electoral reform. In disallowing civil nominations, the NPCSC made it clear that a 1200-member nominating committee, in which the composition remains subject to a second round of consultation, would elect two to three electoral candidates with more than half of the votes before the general public could vote on them. \c\cThe Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism began protesting outside the government headquarters on 22 September 2014 against the NPCSCs decision. On the evening of 26 September, several hundred demonstrators led by Joshua Wong breached a security barrier and entered the forecourt of the Central Government Complex (nicknamed "Civic Square"), which was once a public space that has been barred from public entry since July 2014.

Protesters blocked both east–west arterial routes in northern Hong Kong Island near Admiralty. Police tactics (including the use of tear gas) and attacks on protesters by opponents that included triad members, triggered more citizens to join the protests, occupying Causeway Bay and Mong Kok. The number of protesters peaked at more than 100,000. The government called for an end to the protests by setting a deadline of 6 October, but this was ignored by protesters, although they allowed government workers to enter offices that had previously been blocked. \c\cThe state-run Chinese media claimed repeatedly that the West had played an "instigating" role in the protests, and that "more people in Hong Kong are supporting the anti-Occupy Central movement," and warned of "deaths and injuries and other grave consequences." In an opinion poll carried out by Chinese University of Hong Kong, only 36.1% of 802 people surveyed between 8–15 October accept NPCSCs decision but 55.6% are willing to accept if HKSAR Government would democratise the nominating committee during the 2nd phase of public consultation period. \c\cOn 23 October, the United Nations Human Rights Committee emphasised "the need to ensure universal suffrage, which means both the right to be elected as well as the right to vote." Chinas Foreign Ministry responded that Chinas policy on Hong Kongs elections had "unshakable legal status and effect".

Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 is a currently-missing Indonesia AirAsia Airbus A320-200 flight that was declared missing en route from Surabaya, Indonesia to Singapore on 28 December 2014. The aircraft asked for an unusual route before losing contact with air traffic control. \c\cThe flight took off from Surabaya International Airport at 05:35 local time (UTC+7) and was scheduled to land at 08:30 SGT (UTC+8). The plane lost contact with air traffic control at 07:00 local time while travelling over the Java sea.
Boko Haram ("Western education is forbidden"), officially called Jamaatu Ahlis Sunna LiddaAwati Wal-Jihad (People Committed to the Prophets Teachings for Propagation and Jihad), is a militant Islamist movement based in northeast Nigeria. The group was designated by the United States as a terrorist organisation in November 2013.  Membership has been estimated to number between a few hundred and a few thousand. \c\cBoko Haram killed more than 5,000 civilians between July 2009 and June 2014, including at least 2,000 in the first half of 2014, in attacks occurring mainly in northeast, northcentral and central states of Nigeria. Corruption in the security services and human rights abuses committed by them have hampered efforts to counter the unrest. Since 2009 Boko Haram have abducted more than 500 men, women and children, including the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in April 2014. 650,000 people had fled the conflict zone by August 2014, an increase of 200,000 since May. \c\cAfter its founding in 2002, Boko Harams increasing radicalisation led to a violent uprising in July 2009 in which its leader was executed. Its unexpected resurgence, following a mass prison break in September 2010, was accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks, initially against soft targets, and progressing in 2011 to include suicide bombings on police buildings and the United Nations headquarters in Abuja. The governments establishment of a state of emergency at the beginning of 2012, extended in the following year to cover the entire northeast of the country, resulted in a marked increase in both security force abuses and militant attacks. The Nigerian military proved ineffective in countering the insurgency, hampered by an entrenched culture of official corruption. Since mid-2014, the militants have been in control of swathes of territory in and around their home state of Borno, but have not captured the capital of the state, Maiduguri, where the group was originally based.

Presented by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), accolades are handed out for the best in feature-length film and documentaries of any nationality, that were screened at British cinemas during 2014. \c\cThe nominees were announced on 9 January by Stephen Fry and actor Sam Claflin. The American film Boyhood won three of its five nominations, including Best Film. The Theory of Everything was named Best British Film, while The Lego Movie won Best Animated Film and Citizenfour Best Documentary.

The ceremony opened with a performance from British rock band Kasabian.
The Italian cruise ship Costa Concordia capsized and sank after striking an underwater obstruction off Isola del Giglio, Tuscany, on 13 January 2012, with the loss of 32 lives. \c\cThe ship, carrying 4,252 people, was on the first leg of a cruise around the Mediterranean Sea, starting from Civitavecchia in Lazio, when she deviated from her planned route at the Isola del Giglio, coming closer to that island, and contacted an object on the sea floor. \c\cThe contact could be heard by passengers on board and caused a temporary power blackout when water flooded the engine room. The captain, Francesco Schettino, ordered evacuation after an hour of drifting, during which the ship had started to list. Meanwhile, the harbour authorities were alerted by worried passengers, and vessels were sent to the rescue. During a six-hour evacuation, most passengers were brought ashore. The search for missing people continued for several months, with all but two being accounted for. The ship was righted on 17 September 2013, and on 24 October 2013 it was reported that DNA analysis of one body found earlier in the same month confirmed it was the body of missing Italian passenger Maria Grazia Trecarichi. \c\cCosta Concordia, operated by Costa Crociere (Costa Cruises), is one of the largest ships ever to be abandoned, dominating international media in the days after the disaster. Schettino was arrested on preliminary charges of manslaughter in connection with causing a shipwreck, failing to assist 300 passengers, and failing to be the last to leave the wreck. He was later charged with failing to describe to maritime authorities the scope of the disaster and with abandoning incapacitated passengers. Costa Cruises offered compensation to passengers (to a limit of €11,000 a person) to pay for all damages, including the value of the cruise. One-third of the passengers took this offer. The company also at first offered to pay Captain Schettinos legal costs, but later changed its mind. \c\cThere were immediate fears of an ecological disaster, because the partially submerged wreck was in danger of slipping into much deeper water, with a risk of oil pollution that could have devastated the popular tourist zone. In the end, no significant fuel leak occurred, and all the fuel was extracted safely from the ship by 24 March 2012. Costa Concordia has been officially declared a "constructive total loss" by the insurance company, with her salvage expected to be "one of the biggest maritime salvage operations". On 16 September 2013, the parbuckle salvage of the ship began. The operation started late due to bad weather, and the wreck was set upright in the early hours of 17 September 2013. \c\cIn July 2014, the ship was refloated and towed to Genoa. There the ship will be dismantled and materials from the ship will be recycled. \c\cIn February 2015, Captain Schettino was found guilty of manslaughter of 32 passengers by the Judge Giovanni Puliatti and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Prosecutors had asked for a 26 year sentence, but the court gave Schettino ten years for multiple manslaughter, five years for causing the shipwreck and one year for abandoning the passengers. He is expected to appeal.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Pam is currently a strong South Pacific tropical cyclone that recently affected Vanuatu and nearby islands. Many deaths have been reported, mostly in Vanuatu. \c\cPam is the second most intense storm of the South Pacific Ocean according to pressure, after Zoe of 2002, and recently had the highest 10-minute sustained wind speed of any South Pacific tropical cyclone. Pam is also the third strongest storm in the Southern Hemisphere in terms of barometric pressure, only after Zoe in 2002 and Gafilo in 2004. In terms of peak 10-minute sustained winds, it is tied with Cyclone Orson and Cyclone Monica as the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere.

Three days after the incident the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a temporary recommendation for airlines to ensure that at least two crew members, including at least one pilot, are in the cockpit at all times of the flight. Several airlines announced they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily.
The Sinai insurgency is the conflict ignited by Islamist militants in the Sinai Peninsula, which began after the start of the Egyptian Crisis, which saw the overthrow of longtime Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak in the 2011 Egyptian Revolution and the response from the interim Egyptian government after mid-2011, known as Operation Eagle and then Operation Sinai. The Sinai insurgency consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. \c\cIn May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup détat, which resulted in the ousting of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group claimed allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and proclaimed themselves as the "Province of Sinai". Militant attacks continued into 2015. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with Sinai Province. \c\cThe fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from terrorist operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of heath services. \c\cAdministratively, the Sinai Peninsula is divided into governorates, or provinces, the main ones in Sinai being: the South Sinai Governorate and the North Sinai Governorate. Three other governorates span the Suez Canal, crossing into African Egypt: Suez Governorate ("the Suez"), on the southern end of the Suez Canal, Ismailia Governorate in the center, and Port Said Governorate in the north.

Australian east coast lows (known locally as east coast lows and sometimes as east coast cyclones) are  extratropical cyclones, the most intense of these systems have many of the characteristics of subtropical cyclones. They develop between 25 ̊south and 40 ̊south and within 5 ̊ of the Australian coastline, typically during the winter months. Each year there are about ten "significant impact" maritime lows. \c\cPrior to the introduction of satellite imagery in the early 1960s, many east coast lows were classified as tropical cyclones. These storms which mostly affect the south east coast should not be confused with Australian region tropical cyclones which typically affect the northern half of the continent.
Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man, died of a spinal injury on April 19, 2015. A week earlier, police had taken Gray into custody in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Within an hour of his arrest, police had transported him to a trauma clinic, and he was in a coma. \c\cThe incident has led to protests in Baltimore. Six Baltimore police officers have been suspended with pay.
On April 12, 2015, Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American man, was taken into custody by the Baltimore Police Department for possession of a switchblade, which was illegal under Baltimore law at the time. While being transported, Gray fell into a coma and was taken to a trauma center. Gray died on April 19, 2015.  His death was ascribed to injuries to his spinal cord. \c\cThe circumstances of the injuries are unclear; eyewitness accounts suggested that the officers involved had partaken in unnecessary use of force against Gray while arresting him—a claim denied by an officer involved. On April 21, 2015, pending an investigation of the incident, six Baltimore police officers were temporarily suspended with pay. Commissioner Anthony Batts reported that the officers had failed to provide medical attention to Gray in a timely manner and they did not buckle him inside the police van when being transported to the police station. \c\cGrays death resulted in an ongoing series of protests and civil disorder, in the spirit of the reaction to the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown. A major protest in downtown Baltimore on April 25, 2015, turned violent, resulting in 34 arrests and injuries to 15 police officers. After Grays funeral on April 27, civil unrest intensified with looting and burning of local businesses and a CVS drug store, culminating with a state of emergency declaration by Governor Larry Hogan and Maryland National Guard deployment to Baltimore. \c\cOn May 1, 2015, Baltimore prosecutors announced that they had probable cause to file homicide charges against the police officers involved in Grays death.

In May 2015, protests occurred in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia, against the incumbent Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and his government. Protests began following charges being brought up against Zoran Zaev, the opposition leader, who responded by alleging that Gruevski had 20,000 Macedonian officials and other figures wiretapped, and covered up the murder of a young man by a police officer in 2011. A major protest occurred on May 5, seeing violent clashes between activists and police, with injuries on both sides. In the days afterward, the opposition  claimed that more anti-government actions will occur. Several ministers, including the interior minister, resigned during the protests. Gruevski himself refused to step down, saying on May 16 that "if I back down it would be a cowardly move. I’ll face down the attacks.”. \c\cProtests continued through the month, and a large gathering of anti-government protestors was held in Skopje on May 17. The number of protestors that turned up on Sunday, May 17 is estimated in the tens of thousands (20,000+). Zaev claimed that the number of attendees at the rally on Sunday was 100,000 or more. On May 18, a large pro-government rally occurred of Gruevskis supporters, estimated to be in the tens of thousands.

The USA Freedom Act is a laws originally introduced in both houses of the U.S. Congress on October 29, 2013, and passed on June 2, 2015. The title of the act is a ten-letter backronym (USA FREEDOM) that stands for "Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-collection and Online Monitoring Act.". \c\cThe bill was re-introduced in the 114th Congress, receiving support for acting as "a balanced approach" while being questioned for amendments and extending the Patriot Act through the end of 2019. Supporters of the bill say the most the House Intelligence Committee and House leadership would allow is ending bulk collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act until Section 702 of FISA comes up for review at the end of 2017. Critics assert that mass surveillance of the content of Americans communication will continue under Section 702 of FISA and Executive Order 12333 due to the "unstoppable surveillance-industrial complex" despite the fact that a bipartisan majority of the House had previously voted to close backdoor mass surveillance.

In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that it had been the target of a data breach targeting the records of as many as four million people. Later, FBI Director James Comey put the number at eighteen million. The data breach, which had started in March, 2014, and may have started earlier, was noticed by the OPM in April 2015. It has been described by federal officials as among the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States. Information targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers, as well as names, dates and places of birth, and addresses. Later reports indicated that the hack went deeper than initially believed and likely involved theft of detailed background security-clearance-related background information. One victim wrote that the OPM is the agency that asks your neighbors what they know about you that could be used to blackmail you.

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is an international financial institution proposed by the government of China. The purpose of the multilateral development bank is to provide finance to infrastructure projects in the Asia region. AIIB is regarded by some as a rival for the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which are regarded as dominated by developed countries like the United States. The United Nations has addressed the launch of AIIB as "scaling up financing for sustainable development" for the concern of Global Economic Governance. \c\cChinese Premier Li Keqiang affirms AIIB cooperative stance. As of April 15, 2015, almost all Asian countries and most major countries outside Asia had joined the AIIB, except the US, Japan (which dominated the ADB) and Canada.

The Sinai insurgency is the conflict ignited by Islamist militants in the Sinai Peninsula, which began after the start of the Egyptian Crisis, which saw the overthrow of longtime Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and the response from the interim Egyptian government after mid-2011, known as Operation Eagle and then Operation Sinai. The Sinai insurgency consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. \c\cIn May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup détat, which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group claimed allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and proclaimed themselves as the "Sinai Province". Militant attacks continued into 2015. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with Sinai Province. \c\cThe fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services. Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. \c\cAdministratively, the Sinai Peninsula is divided into two governorates: the South Sinai Governorate and the North Sinai Governorate. Three other governorates span the Suez Canal, crossing into African Egypt: Suez Governorate on the southern end of the Suez Canal, Ismailia Governorate in the center, and Port Said Governorate in the north.

The 2015 Open Championship was the 144th Open Championship, held 16–20 July 2015 at Old Course at St Andrews in Fife, Scotland. It was the 29th Open Championship played at St Andrews. Zach Johnson won the Championship in a 4-hole playoff. \c\cWorld number one Rory McIlroy withdrew prior to the tournament due to an off-course ankle injury, the first defending champion absent from the Open since 1954, when Ben Hogan opted not to participate. Jordan Spieth entered with a chance to win his third consecutive major and take over the top ranking. Spieth finished tied for fourth, one stroke out of the playoff. \c\cThe tournament was originally scheduled to be finished on Sunday, 19 July: however, bad weather – which included heavy rain and very strong winds – forced play to be suspended twice, both on Friday and Saturday, with the latter having play suspended for nearly most of the playing day. As a result, this was the first Open Championship to finish on a Monday since 1988.
The 2015 Lafayette shooting occurred at the Grand Theatre movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana on July 23, 2015. The 2015 Lafayette shooting occurred at Grand Theatre movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana on July 23, 2015. A gunman, believed by at least one witness to be an older white male, and believed to be 58 years old, opened fire about 7:20 PM, during a showing of Trainwreck, leading to either two or three deaths, and multiple individuals, at least 6-8, wounded, some lightly and others critically, either from gunshot injuries and/or from the rush to leave the theater (both possible figures include that of the attacker, who committed suicide by gunshot, after officers had entered the theatre; it was not clear whether the gunman had engaged the officers before allegedly shooting himself). Hospitals were receiving patients and keeping officials informed; but no further information was provided to the public on the names of the hospitals and doctors or the names and precise conditions of the victims, due to privacy concerns and pending notification of families, and because of the early stage of the investigation. One woman was shot in the stomach; she had been found by another witness, and it was unclear as to her condition or whether she had survived. The other Grand Theatre was also closed. The area was locked down. A nearby Mello Mushroom pizza restaurant manager estimated 20 to 30 rescue vehicles were on scene. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, an Indian-American presidential candidate in past elections and in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, was en route and said he was praying for the victims; he met with a colonel on scene. The Louisiana State Police, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), the Lafayette Parish Sheriff, and Lafayette Police Department police (led by Chief Jim Craft, who briefed reporters) were on the scene. Lafayette is 60 miles west of Baton Rouge, and north of New Orleans, with about 120,000 residents. A motive or if there were any co-conspirators or co-participants was unknown, though police believe he acted alone.
The Battle of Sarrin (June–July 2015) refers to a military operation during 2015 in the northeastern Aleppo Governorate, during the Syrian Civil War, in which the Kurdish YPG and Free Syrian Army forces tried to capture the town of Sarrin and the surrounding region from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Following nearly 2 months of a stalled offensive, YPG-led fighters renewed offensive operations on Sarrin on 18 June 2015, followed by a full-fledged operation on 1 July, after ISILs Kobanî massacre. On 4 July, the town of Sarrin was fully besieged by YPG and FSA forces, as well as the village of Khirbat al-Burj and the Sarrin Grain Silos, both located north of Sarrin.
Terrorism in Saudi Arabia has mainly been attributed to Islamic extremists. Their targets include foreign civilians—mainly Westerners affiliated with its oil-based economy—as well as Saudi Arabian civilians and security forces. Anti-Western attacks have occurred in Saudi Arabia dating back to 1995. Saudi Arabia itself has been accused of exporting terrorists to other countries, namely Syria.
The Ferguson unrest (also referred to just as Ferguson) was a series of protests and civil disorder that began the day after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a white police officer on August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri. The unrest sparked a vigorous debate in the United States about the relationship between law enforcement officers and African Americans, the militarization of the police, and the use of force doctrine in Missouri and nationwide. \c\cAs the details of the original shooting event emerged from investigators, police established curfews and deployed riot squads to maintain order. Along with peaceful protests, there was looting and violent unrest in the vicinity of the original shooting. According to media reports, there was police militarization when dealing with protests in Ferguson. The unrest continued on November 24, 2014, after a grand jury decided not to indict the police officer who shot Michael Brown. \c\cIn response to the shooting and subsequent unrest, the U.S. Department of Justice conducted an investigation into the policing practices of the Ferguson Police Department (FPD). In March 2015, the U.S. Justice Department announced that they had determined that the FPD had engaged in misconduct against the citizenry of Ferguson, by discriminating against African-Americans and applying racial stereotypes, in a "pattern or practice of unlawful conduct".
The Kasur child sexual abuse scandal is a series of child sexual abuses that occurred in Hussain Khanwala village in Kasur District, Punjab, Pakistan from 2006 to 2014, culminating in a major political scandal in 2015. Various Pakistani media organizations estimated that 280 to 300 children were victims of sexual abuse, after the discovery of hundreds of video clips showing children performing forced sex acts. The scandal involved an organized crime ring that sold child pornography to porn sites, and blackmailed and extorted relatives of the victims. \c\cThe scandal caused nationwide outrage, among allegations that the Punjab police and Malik Ahmed Saeed, Kasurs Member of the Provincial Assembly from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), were involved in an attempted cover-up of the abuse. \c\cIt is cited by both news agencies and government departments to be the largest child abuse scandal in Pakistans history.
On August 12 2015, an explosion of an unknown cause occurred at a petrol storage station in the Chinese city of Tianjin in the Binhai New Area. Currently, the cause of the explosion is unknown.

The 2015 Bangkok bombing took place outside the Erawan Shrine at the Ratchaprasong intersection in Pathum Wan District, Bangkok, Thailand on 17 August 2015. Twenty people died and 125 were injured. Police are hunting a suspect; the man could be of "mixed origin", who left a backpack at the scene shortly before the explosion. Thailands chief of police said the attack was carried out by a network and issued a sketch of the suspect. Police are also saying that two other people seen on images captured by closed-circuit television were being treated as suspects. The Thai government has said that it was "unlikely" to have been the work of an international terror group. Police say that at least 10 people are suspected of involvement in the attack.
On July 20, 2012, a mass shooting occurred inside of a Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of the film The Dark Knight Rises. A gunman, dressed in tactical clothing, set off tear gas grenades and shot into the audience with multiple firearms. 12 people were killed and 70 others were injured, the largest number of casualties in a shooting in the United States. The sole assailant, James Eagan Holmes, was arrested in his car parked outside the cinema minutes later. It was the deadliest shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. Prior to the shooting, Holmes rigged his apartment with homemade explosives, which were defused by a bomb squad one day after the shooting. \c\cThe shooting prompted an increase in security at movie theaters across the U.S. that were screening the same film, in fear of copycat crimes. The shooting also led to a spike in gun sales in Colorado, as well as political debates about gun control in the United States. \c\cHolmes confessed to the shooting, but pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Arapahoe County prosecutors sought the death penalty for Holmes. The trial began on April 27, 2015. He was convicted of twenty-four counts of first-degree murder, 140 counts of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of possessing explosives on July 16, 2015. On August 7, 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. On August 26, 2015, he was formally sentenced to :12 life sentences or one for every person he killed and an additional 3,318 years for the attempted murders of those he wounded, along with rigging his apartment with explosives.
The 2015 Thalys attack was an attempted mass shooting that took place on 21 August 2015 on a Thalys train passing through Oignies, Pas-de-Calais, France. The train was traveling from Amsterdam to Paris via Brussels when the perpetrator opened fire in a train carriage before being subdued by passengers. Including the assailant, five people were injured, none fatally. The incident is believed by French police to be an Islamist terrorist attack, although the gunman claimed the motivation was robbery due to hunger. Four people who subdued the attacker have been made Chevaliers de la Légion d'honneur, while two others will be honored at a later date (see below).
Miller v. Davis is an ongoing federal lawsuit in the United States regarding the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. After the Supreme Court of the United States legalized same-sex marriage nationwide on June 26, 2015, the county clerk of Rowan County, Kentucky, Kim Davis, has since refused to issue marriage licenses to any couple, same or opposite-sex, citing her religious beliefs. She also refuses to allow her deputies to issue the licenses, as they would still bear her title and name. On August 12, 2015, U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered Davis to issue marriage licenses to all couples. He stayed his ruling until August 31, at her request, while she sought further stays. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied her request for a stay pending appeal on August 26. On August 31, the Supreme Court unanimously refused to issue a stay, ending her legal options.
Homo naledi is an extinct species of the genus Homo (humans), discovered within the Dinaledi Chamber of the Rising Star Cave system, Cradle of Humankind, South Africa. The species is characterized by body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations, but a small endocranial volume similar to Australopithecus. The fossils are not yet dated but are estimated at 2.5 million years. Although the discoverers claim the bones represent a new species of early humans, other experts contend that more evidence is needed before such a claim can be justified.
The Mecca crane collapse refers to an incident on September 11, 2015, when a tower crane collapsed onto pilgrims at the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, killing at least 65 people, mostly pilgrims.

Sovereignty over two large and various smaller separated pieces of territory have been contested between China and India. The westernmost, Aksai Chin, is claimed by India as part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir and region of Ladakh but is controlled and administered as part of the Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang. It is a virtually uninhabited high altitude wasteland crossed by the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway. The other large disputed territory, the easternmost, lies south of the McMahon Line. It was formerly referred to as the North East Frontier Agency, and is now called Arunachal Pradesh. The McMahon Line was part of the 1914 Simla Convention between British India and Tibet, an agreement rejected by China. \c\cThe 1962 Sino-Indian War was fought in both of these areas. An agreement to resolve the dispute was concluded in 1996, including "confidence-building measures" and a mutually agreed Line of Actual Control. In 2006, the Chinese ambassador to India claimed that all of Arunachal Pradesh is Chinese territory amidst a military buildup. At the time, both countries claimed incursions as much as a kilometre at the northern tip of Sikkim. In 2009, India announced it would deploy additional military forces along the border.
The 2015 Southeast Asian haze is an haze crisis in August and September 2015 that is affecting several countries in Southeast Asia, including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Southern Thailand caused by a large-scale burning of illegal land clearing in Indonesian Riau of Sumatra and Kalimantan in Borneo. \c\cOn 14 September 2015, the Indonesian government declared a state of emergency in Riau, one of the provinces worst affected by the haze. Thousands of residents of Pekanbaru, its capital, were forced to flee the city to nearby cities of Medan and Padang.

Hurricane Joaquin (Spanish pronunciation:  wah-KEEN) is a currently active tropical cyclone threatening The Bahamas and Mid-Atlantic United States. Originating from an upper-level low, the system was first classified a tropical depression on September 28, 2015, well to the southwest of Bermuda. Situated in a region of strong wind shear, the depression struggled to develop at first as it moved slowly southwest. After intensifying to a tropical storm the following day, Joaquin organized in earnest and reached hurricane status on September 30. Early on October 1, Joaquin attained Category 3 status, making it the second major hurricane of the annual hurricane season. Later that day, Joaquin attained Category 4 status. \c\cHurricane warnings were raised across much of The Bahamas on September 30 as the hurricane threatened the country.
On October 1, 2015, a school shooting took place at Umpqua Community College, near Roseburg, Oregon, United States. A 26-year-old male fatally shot nine people and injured seven others on the campus before dying in a shootout with responding police.
At 10:05 local time (EET) on October 10, 2015 two bombs were detonated by suicide bombers outside the entrance of the Ankara Central railway station in central Ankara, the capital of Turkey. There were reports of at least 20 fatalities. The bombings preceded a rally organised by the Confederation of Public Workers' Unions (KESK), in opposition to the Turkey–PKK conflict. The rally was supported by the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).
The West Lothian question, also known as the English question, refers to whether MPs from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, sitting in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, should be able to vote on matters that affect only England, while MPs from England are unable to vote on matters that have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. \c\cThe term was coined by Enoch Powell MP in 1977 after Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for the Scottish constituency of West Lothian, raised the matter repeatedly in a House of Commons debate on Scottish and Welsh devolution, as he would continue to do through the late 1970s and the 1980s. Since the establishment of Welsh and Northern Irish Assemblies and the Scottish Parliament in the 1990s, the question took on a new urgency and in 2011 the Government of the United Kingdom set up a commission to examine it. The Commission on the consequences of devolution for the House of Commons, chaired by former Clerk of the House of Commons Sir William McKay, published a report in 2013 which proposed various procedural changes, including that legislation which affects only England should require the support of a majority of MPs representing English constituencies. \c\cThe West Lothian question has again come to the fore following promises of greater devolution for Scotland made during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign and subsequently recommended in the report published by the Smith Commission in November 2014. The idea of "English votes for English laws" (EVEL) has been suggested by Conservative Party politicians as a potential solution. \c\cOn May 5 2015 the Conservative Party won a unexpected overall majority in the House of Commons in the General Election and pledged to fulfil their manifesto promise on EVEL and on October 22 2015 following a debate the motion was passed in a vote to set up new parliamentary procedures and a English Grand Committee of MPs by 321-270 votes as a solution to the West Lothian Question some 38 years after the issue was first raised..
The 2015 Pacific hurricane season is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The year has featured record-high activity in the Central Pacific—the portion of the Eastern Pacific defined between the International Dateline and 140°W—with twelve tropical cyclones forming or entering the basin. This season is also recognized as the second busiest season tied with the 1985 season with a total of 24 named storms. The season officially started on May 15 in the East Pacific Ocean and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; they will both end on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. However, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year. Due to a strong El Niño event, the 2015 season was predicted to be an above-average season.
Boko Haram, which calls itself Wilāyat Gharb Ifrīqīyyah (Arabic: الولاية الإسلامية غرب أفريقيا, (Islamic States) West Africa Province, ISWAP), and Jamāat Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Dawah wal-Jihād (Arabic: جماعة أهل السنة للدعوة والجهاد, "Group of the People of Sunnah for Preaching and Jihad"), is an Islamic extremist group based in northeastern Nigeria, also active in Chad, Niger and northern Cameroon. The groups leader is Abubakar Shekau. The group had alleged links to al-Qaeda, but in March 2015, it announced its allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). \c\cAfter its founding in 2002, Boko Harams increasing radicalization led to a violent uprising in July 2009 in which its leader was summarily executed. Its unexpected resurgence, following a mass prison break in September 2010, was accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks, initially against soft targets, and progressing in 2011 to include suicide bombings of police buildings and the United Nations office in Abuja. The governments establishment of a state of emergency at the beginning of 2012, extended in the following year to cover the entire northeast of Nigeria, led to an increase in both security force abuses and militant attacks. \c\c2.3 million people have been displaced by the conflict since May 2013. 250,000 have left Nigeria and fled into Cameroon, Chad or Niger. Boko Haram has killed more than 17,000 people since 2009, including over 10,000 in 2014. The group have carried out mass abductions including the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in April 2014. Corruption in the security services and human rights abuses committed by them have hampered efforts to counter the unrest. \c\cIn mid-2014, the militants gained control of swathes of territory in and around their home state of Borno, estimated at 50,000 square kilometres (20,000 sq mi) in January 2015, but did not capture the state capital, Maiduguri, where the group was originally based. A military coalition including Chad and Niger displaced the group from most of its occupied territories, although it retained control over southern parts of Borno State. In September 2015, the Director of Information at the Defence Headquarters of Nigeria announced that all Boko Haram camps had been destroyed.
The one-child policy, officially the family planning policy, was a population control policy of the Republic of China in effect from 1979 to 2015. The term "one-child" is inexact as the policy allows many exceptions and ethnic minorities in China are exempt. In 2007, 36% of Chinas population was subject to a strict one-child restriction. An additional 53% were allowed to have a second child if the first child was a girl. \c\cThe policy is enforced at the provincial level through fines that are imposed based on the income of the family and other factors.

Demographers are not clear how much reduction has happened solely because of the policy.  A 2008 survey undertaken by the Pew Research Center reported that 76% of the Chinese population supports the policy; however, it is controversial outside China for many reasons, including accusations of human rights abuses in the implementation of the policy, as well as concerns about negative social consequences. \c\cOn 29 October 2015, Xinhua reported a change in the existing law to a two-child policy, citing a statement from the Communist Party of China.
The family planning policy, known as the one-child policy in the West, is a population control policy of the Peoples Republic of China. The term "one-child" is inexact as the policy allows many exceptions and ethnic minorities in China are exempt. In 2007, 36% of Chinas population was subject to a strict one-child restriction. An additional 53% were allowed to have a second child if the first child was a girl. \c\cThe policy is enforced at the provincial level through fines that are imposed based on the income of the family and other factors.

The 2015 North Indian Ocean cyclone season is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds, but cyclones tend to form between April and December, with the peak from May to November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. \c\cThe scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere, east of the Horn of Africa and west of the Malay Peninsula. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean — the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent, abbreviated ARB by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated BOB by the IMD. \c\cThe official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories. On average, three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every season.
On 12 November 2015, two suicide bombers detonated explosives in Bourj el-Barajneh, a southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, that is inhabited mostly by Shia Muslims and is controlled by Hezbollah. Reports of the number of deaths range from 37 to 41 to 43. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Beginning at 21:16 (CET) of 13 November 2015, a series of violent attacks occurred in the 10th and 11th arrondissements of Paris, France, at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, north of the capital, and elsewhere in Île-de-France. At least three separate explosions and six shootings were reported around the capital, and a hostage crisis is ongoing at the Bataclan theatre, where between approximately 60 and 100 people are believed to be held. \c\cThe number of casualties is unknown, but between 40 and 70 people are reported to have died. One report stated that there might be six gunmen. French radio network Europe 1 reported that as many as three suicide bombers were also involved in the attacks. \c\cIn a televised statement at 23:58 CET, French President François Hollande declared a state of emergency and closed the borders for the whole of France. It is the first time France has declared a state of emergency since the 2005 French riots.
On 14 November 2015, a TGV train crashed near Strasbourg, France, killing five people and injuring seven. The train was being tested on a new section of the Paris-Strasbourg high-speed line.
On the evening of 13 November 2015, a series of coordinated terrorist attacks occurred in Paris and Saint-Denis, France. The attacks consisted of mass shootings, suicide bombings, bombings and hostage taking. Beginning at 21:16 CET, three separate explosions and six mass shootings occurred, including bombings near the Stade de France in the northern suburb of Saint-Denis. The deadliest attack was at the Bataclan theatre where attackers took hostages and engaged in a standoff with police until it was ended at 00:58 14 November CET. \c\cAt least 129 people were killed, 87 of them at the Bataclan theatre. More than 350 people were injured by the attacks, including 99 people described as being in a serious condition. In addition to the civilian casualties, eight attackers were killed and authorities continued to search for any accomplices that remained at large. French President François Hollande subsequently announced a national state of emergency in France, the first nationwide state of emergency since 2005,  and subsequently placed temporary controls on the borders of France in a televised statement at 23:58 CET. The first curfew since 1944 was also put in place, ordering people to get off the streets of Paris. \c\cOn 14 November, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attacks. According to The Wall Street Journal, the attacks were motivated by Islamic State as a "retaliation" for the French role in the Syrian Civil War and Iraqi Civil War. \c\cHollande also said the attacks were organised from abroad "by the Islamic State with internal help" and described them as "an act of war". \c\cThe attacks were the deadliest to occur in France since World War II. They were also the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004. The attacks came just a day after another Islamic State terrorist attack in Lebanon which killed 43, a day after the assassination of ISIL member Jihadi John, and 14 days after the crash of Metrojet Flight 9268, which killed 217 passengers and seven crew members, and for which the Islamic States Sinai branch claimed responsibility. Prior to the attack, France had been on high alert since the January 2015 attacks in Paris that killed 17 people, including civilians and police officers.
UFC 193: Rousey vs. Holm was a mixed martial arts event held on November 15, 2015 at Etihad Stadium in Melbourne, Australia.
On the evening of 13 November 2015, a series of coordinated terrorist attacks—consisting of mass shootings, suicide bombings, and hostage-taking—occurred in Paris, France, and Saint-Denis, one of its northern suburbs. Beginning at 21:20 CET, there were three separate suicide bombings outside the Stade de France and, nearer central Paris, there were mass shootings and a suicide bombing at four different locations. The deadliest of those attacks took place at the Bataclan theatre, where attackers took hostages and engaged in a stand-off with police which ended at 00:58 on 14 November. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attacks. \c\cAccording to news reports, 129 victims were killed, 89 of them at the Bataclan theatre. A further 415 were admitted to hospital with injuries sustained in the attacks, including 80 people described as being seriously injured.  In addition to the victims, seven attackers died, and the authorities continued to search for any accomplices remaining at large. The attacks were the deadliest in France since the Second World War, and the deadliest in Europe since the Madrid train bombings in 2004. \c\cIn response, French President François Hollande announced a state of emergency, the first since the 2005 riots, and placed temporary controls on the countrys borders. People and organizations expressed solidarity including through social media. President Hollande declared the attacks as "an act of war". On 15 November, France launched its largest single airstrike of Opération Chammal, its contribution to the anti-ISIL bombing campaign, by striking targets in Al-Raqqah, Syria in retaliation for the attacks. \c\cPrior to the attack, France had been bombing various targets in the Middle East, including in Syria, since October 2015. ISILs motive was retaliation for French involvement in the Syrian Civil War and Iraqi Civil War. In the weeks leading up to the attacks, ISIL had claimed responsibility for several attacks, such as twin suicide bombings in Beirut two days earlier, and the crashing of Metrojet Flight 9268 on 31 October. France had been on high alert since the January 2015 attacks in Paris that killed 17 people, including civilians and police officers.

The Russia–Ukraine gas disputes refer to a number of disputes between Ukrainian oil and gas company Naftohaz Ukrayiny and Russian gas supplier Gazprom over natural gas supplies, prices, and debts. These disputes have grown beyond simple business disputes into transnational political issues—involving political leaders from several countries—that threaten natural gas supplies in numerous European countries dependent on natural gas imports from Russian suppliers, which are transported through Ukraine. Russia provides approximately a quarter of the natural gas consumed in the European Union; approximately 80% of those exports travel through pipelines across Ukrainian soil prior to arriving in the EU. \c\cA serious dispute began in March 2005 over the price of natural gas supplied and the cost of transit. During this conflict, Russia claimed Ukraine was not paying for gas, but diverting that which was intended to be exported to the EU from the pipelines. Ukrainian officials at first denied the accusation, but later Naftohaz admitted that natural gas intended for other European countries was retained and used for domestic needs. The dispute reached a crescendo on 1 January 2006, when Russia cut off all gas supplies passing through Ukrainian territory. On 4 January 2006, a preliminary agreement between Russia and Ukraine was achieved, and the supply was restored. The situation calmed until October 2007 when new disputes began over Ukrainian gas debts. This led to reduction of gas supplies in March 2008. During the last months of 2008, relations once again became tense when Ukraine and Russia could not agree on the debts owed by Ukraine. \c\cIn January 2009, this disagreement resulted in supply disruptions in many European nations, with eighteen European countries reporting major drops in or complete cut-offs of their gas supplies transported through Ukraine from Russia. In September 2009 officials from both countries stated they felt the situation was under control and that there would be no more conflicts over the topic, at least until the Ukrainian 2010 presidential elections. However, in October 2009, another disagreement arose about the amount of gas Ukraine would import from Russia in 2010. Ukraine intended to import less gas in 2010 as a result of reduced industry needs because of its economic recession; however, Gazprom insisted that Ukraine fulfill its contractual obligations and purchase the previously agreed upon quantities of gas. \c\cOn June 8, 2010, a Stockholm court of arbitration ruled Naftohaz of Ukraine must return 12.1 billion cubic metres (430 billion cubic feet) of gas to RosUkrEnergo, a Swiss-based company in which Gazprom controls a 50% stake. Russia accused Ukrainian side of diverting gas from pipelines passing through Ukraine in 2009. Several high-ranking Ukrainian officials stated the return "would not be quick". \c\cRussia plans to completely abandon gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine after 2018.
On November 27, 2015, a shooting and five-hour stand-off with police occurred at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Three people were killed, including a University of Colorado police officer and two civilians. The suspected shooter, identified as Robert Lewis Dear, was captured alive after police convinced him to give himself up.
Enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is the process of including new member states in NATO. NATO is a military alliance of twenty-six European and two North American countries that constitutes a system of collective defence. The process of joining the alliance is governed by Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which allows only for the invitation of "other European States," and by subsequent agreements. Countries wishing to join have to meet certain requirements and complete a multi-step process involving political dialogue and military integration. The accession process is overseen by the North Atlantic Council, NATOs governing body. \c\cAfter its formation in 1949 with twelve founding members, NATO grew by including Greece and Turkey in 1952 and West Germany in 1955, and then later Spain in 1982. After the Cold War ended, and Germany reunited in 1990, there was a debate in NATO about continued expansion eastward. In 1999, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic joined the organization, amid much debate within the organization and Russian opposition. Another expansion came with the accession of seven Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. These nations were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. The most recent new members, Albania and Croatia, joined on 1 April 2009, prior to the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit. \c\cIn 2011, NATO officially recognized four aspiring members: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, and Montenegro. Macedonia has been prevented from joining the alliance by Greece, one effect of the Macedonian naming dispute. Future expansion is currently a topic of debate in several countries outside the alliance, and countries like Sweden, Finland and Serbia have open political debate on the topic of membership, while in countries like Ukraine, support and opposition to membership is tied to ethnic and nationalist ideologies. The incorporation of countries formerly in the Soviet sphere of influence has been a cause of increased tension between NATO countries and Russia.
Taiwan and the United States have maintained unofficial relations since 1979. The official relations between the government of the Republic of China on Taiwan and the federal government of the United States terminated due to the recognition of Beijing. The United States regulates relations with the 'people on Taiwan' with the Taiwan Relations Act.
This page documents notable tornadoes and tornado outbreaks worldwide in 2015. Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemispheres summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, and Australia. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of severe weather including strong thunderstorms, winds and hail. \c\cThere have been 917 tornadoes reported in the United States in 2015 according to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), of which at least 718 have been confirmed. Worldwide, 480 fatalities have been reported so far in 2015: 449 in China, 14 in Mexico, 10 in the United States, three in Myanmar, two in Brazil and one each in Italy and Russia.

The Malheur incident is an ongoing event in central Oregon connected with the Bundy standoff. On January 2, 2016, armed members of several rump militias took control of the headquarters building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in protest of the pending imprisonment of Harney County, Oregon ranchers Dwight and Steve Hammond.
On 15 January 2016, gunmen attacked with heavy weapons the restaurant Cappucino and the Hotel Splendid at the heart of Ouagadougou, and at least one hostage was taken.
On 15 January 2016, gunmen armed with heavy weapons attacked the Cappuccino restaurant and the Splendid Hotel in the heart of Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. At least 28 people were killed, while at least 56 were wounded; a total of 176 hostages were released after a government counter-attack into the next morning as the siege ended. Three perpetrators were also killed. The nearby YIBI hotel was then under siege, where another attacker was killed. Notably, former Swiss MP Jean-Noël Rey was killed. The attack was claimed by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).
In late January 2016, a winter storm prompted multiple states across the Mid-Atlantic United States to declare a state of emergency. Evolving from a shortwave trough, the system consolidated into a defined low-pressure area on January 21 over Texas. Regarded as a "potentially historic blizzard", meteorologists indicated the storm could produce more than 2 ft (0.61 m) of snow across a wide swath of the Mid-Atlantic region and could "paralyze the Eastern third of the nation.". \c\cOn January 20–22, the governors of eleven states, and the mayor of Washington, D.C., declared a state of emergency in anticipation of significant snowfall and blizzard conditions. Approximately 85 million people are in the storms path, with 30 million under blizzard warnings. Nearly 9,500 flights have been cancelled in relation to the storm, with effects rippling internationally. Thousands of National Guardsmen were placed on standby and states deployed millions of gallons of brine and thousands of tons of road salt to lessen the storms effect on roadways. A travel ban was instituted for New York City on January 23. The storm has also been given various unofficial names, including "Jonas" and "Snowzilla". \c\cIce- and snow-covered roads led to hundreds of accidents across the affected region, several of which resulted in casualties. At least ten people have been killed due to the storm: six in North Carolina, one in Arkansas, one in Maryland, one in Kentucky, and one in Virginia.
In late-January 2016, a record cold wave impacted much of East Asia, bringing record cold temperatures and snowfall to many regions. Many regions saw their coldest temperatures in decades, while sleet was reported in Okinawa for the first time on record. Snowfall and frigid weather stranded thousands of people across four countries. In Taiwan, at least 85 people died from hypothermia and cardiac arrest following a sudden drop in temperature during the weekend of January 22–24. The cold claimed four lives in mainland China while snowstorms resulted in six deaths across Japan.
On January 2, 2016, the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge were occupied by armed members of rump militias who had split off from an earlier peaceful march in protest of the prison sentences for ranchers Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven Hammond. The two were convicted of arson on federal land they were leasing, were ultimately sentenced to five years imprisonment, and are now seeking clemency from the U.S. president to avoid an extension of the original sentence. \c\cAmmon Bundy, a car fleet manager from Phoenix, son of notable anti-government protester Cliven Bundy, and the leader of the group now calling themselves Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, said he began leading the occupation after receiving a divine message ordering him to do so. The militant group has demanded that the federal government cede ownership of the refuge, and have expressed willingness to engage in armed conflict. For their part, the government and police have not engaged directly with the militia, so as to avoid armed confrontation as was the case in the 1993 Waco siege. The ranchers at the heart of the case have disavowed the militia. \c\cOn January 26, a shootout erupted near the scene of the occupation, and authorities arrested Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan, and three other militants. One person, LaVoy Finicum, was killed in the gunfire. \c\cSome see the militia as defenders against federal overreach, while others view them as provocative and dangerous. The takeover has also sparked a debate in the U.S. on the meaning of the word "terrorist" and on how the media and law enforcement treat situations involving people of different ethnicities or religions. The Harney County Sheriffs Office has officially determined the militants to be criminals engaged in trespassing and Oregon Governor Kate Brown announced the occupation is costing about $100,000 a week.
Ongoing news reports in the international media have revealed operational details about the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and its international partners global surveillance of foreign nationals and U.S. citizens. The reports mostly emanate from a cache of top secret documents leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who obtained them  while working for Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the largest contractors for defense and intelligence in the United States. In addition to a trove of U.S. federal documents, Snowdens cache reportedly contains thousands of Australian, British and Canadian intelligence files that he had accessed via the exclusive "Five Eyes" network. In June 2013, the first of Snowdens documents were published simultaneously by The Washington Post and The Guardian, attracting considerable public attention. The disclosure continued throughout 2013, and a small portion of the estimated full cache of documents was later published by other media outlets worldwide, most notably The New York Times, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Der Spiegel (Germany), O Globo (Brazil), Le Monde (France), Lespresso (Italy), NRC Handelsblad (the Netherlands), Dagbladet (Norway), El País (Spain), and Sveriges Television (Sweden). \c\cThese media reports have shed light on the implications of several secret treaties signed by members of the UKUSA community in their efforts to implement global surveillance. For example, Der Spiegel revealed how the German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) transfers "massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA", while Swedish Television revealed the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) provided the NSA with data from its cable collection, under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance. Other security and intelligence agencies involved in the practice of global surveillance include those in Australia (ASD), Britain (GCHQ), Canada (CSEC), Denmark (PET), France (DGSE), Germany (BND), Italy (AISE), the Netherlands (AIVD), Norway (NIS), Spain (CNI), Switzerland (NDB), Singapore (SID) as well as Israel (ISNU), which receives raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens that is shared by the NSA. \c\cOn June 14, 2013, United States prosecutors charged Edward Snowden with espionage and theft of government property. In late July 2013, he was granted a one-year temporary asylum by the Russian government, contributing to a deterioration of Russia–United States relations. On August 6, 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama made a public appearance on national television where he reassured Americans that "We dont have a domestic spying program" and "There is no spying on Americans". Towards the end of October 2013, the British Prime Minister David Cameron warned The Guardian not to publish any more leaks, or it will receive a DA-Notice. Currently, a criminal investigation of the disclosure is being undertaken by Britains Metropolitan Police Service. In December 2013, The Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said: "We have published I think 26 documents so far out of the 58,000 weve seen.". \c\cThe extent to which the media reports have responsibly informed the public is disputed.  In January 2014 Obama said that "the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light" and critics such as Sean Wilentz have noted that many of the Snowden documents released do not concern domestic surveillance. In its first assessment of these disclosures, The Pentagon concluded that Snowden committed the biggest "theft" of U.S. secrets in the history of the United States. Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, described Snowdens disclosure as the "most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever".

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a trade agreement among twelve Pacific Rim countries concerning a variety of matters of economic policy, which was reached on 5 October 2015 after 7 years of negotiations. The agreements stated goal had been to "promote economic growth; support the creation and retention of jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in our countries; and promote transparency, good governance, and enhanced labor and environmental protections." Among other things, the TPP Agreement contains measures to lower trade barriers such as tariffs, and establish an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (but states can opt out from tobacco-related measures).  The United States government has considered the TPP as the companion agreement to the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a broadly similar agreement between the United States and the European Union. \c\cHistorically, the TPP is an expansion of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TPSEP or P4), which was signed by Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore in 2005. Beginning in 2008, additional countries joined the discussion for a broader agreement: Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the United States, and Vietnam, bringing the total number of participating countries in the negotiations to twelve. Current trade agreements between participating countries, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, will be reduced to those provisions that do not conflict with the TPP, or that provide greater trade liberalization than the TPP. \c\cParticipating nations aimed at completing negotiations in 2012, but contentious issues such as agriculture, intellectual property, and services and investments prolonged negotiations. They finally reached agreement on 5 October 2015. Implementing the TPP has been one of the trade agenda goals of the Obama administration in the US. On 5 October 2015 Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper expected "signatures on the finalized text and deal early in the new year, and ratification over the next two years." A version of the text of the treaty "Subject to Legal Review (...) for Accuracy, Clarity and Consistency" was made public on 5 November 2015,  the same day President Obama notified Congress that he intends to sign it. \c\cA number of global health professionals, internet freedom activists, environmentalists, trade unions, advocacy groups, and elected officials have criticized and protested against the treaty, in large part because of the secrecy of negotiations, the agreements expansive scope, and controversial clauses in drafts leaked to the public.

The Tea tape scandal is an incident involving the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and ACT Party candidate John Banks, during the New Zealand general election campaign in 2011. Their meeting in an Auckland café on 11 November 2011, two weeks before election day was seen as a symbolic endorsement of Mr Banks as the National Partys favoured candidate for the Epsom electorate. After publicly meeting for some time, media were asked to leave. A journalist, Bradley Ambrose, left his recording device behind, and subsequently gave the recording of the politicians conversation to the Herald on Sunday newspaper, which declined to publish it. The recording allegedly contained comments about the leadership of ACT and disparaging remarks about elderly New Zealand First supporters. \c\cThe politicians involved considered that their private conversation had been illegally recorded. John Key and the National Party said that it appeared that the Herald had deliberately recorded the conversation, and described it as "News of the World-style tactics", however journalists argued that that the recording was in the public interest and should therefore be released. Following a police complaint laid by John Key, search warrants were issued by police to media outlets to obtain all unreleased media involving the taping. \c\cIn March 2012 Ambrose wrote a letter to John Key and John Banks expressing regret that he had released the recording to the newspaper, and the police decided to issue a warning rather than prosecute. \c\cThe recording was leaked online on 26 January 2012.

Sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas in Spanish) is disputed between Argentina and the United Kingdom. \c\cThe British claim to sovereignty dates from 1690, the first British settlements were in 1765, and the United Kingdom has exercised de facto sovereignty over the archipelago almost continuously since 1833. Argentina disputes this claim, having been in de facto control of the islands for a non-continuous two-year period between 1829 and 1833. The dispute escalated in 1982, when Argentina invaded the islands, precipitating the Falklands War. \c\cContemporary Falkland Islanders overwhelmingly prefer to remain British.  They gained full British citizenship with the British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983, after British victory in the Falklands War.

Sudanese nomadic conflicts are non-state conflicts between rival nomadic tribes taking place in the territory of Sudan and, since 2011, South Sudan. Conflict between nomadic tribes in Sudan is common, with fights breaking out over scarce resources, including grazing land, cattle and drinking water. Some of the tribes involved in these clashes have been the Messiria, Maalia, Rizeigat and Bani Hussein Arabic tribes inhabiting Darfur and West Kordofan, and the Dinka, Nuer and Murle African ethnic groups inhabiting South Sudan.

During the presidency of Barack Obama, Republican congressmembers have stated that Obama may have engaged in impeachable activity and may face removal from office.  Rationales offered for impeachment have included an alleged White House cover-up after the 2012 Benghazi attack  and failure to defend the borders from illegal immigration. No Congressional Representative has drawn up a list of articles of impeachment and proposed them to the Judiciary Committee. \c\cMultiple surveys of U.S. public opinion have found that the clear majority of Americans reject the idea of impeaching the President while most Republicans have been in favor; for example, CNN found in July 2014 that 57% of Republicans supported efforts while about two thirds of adult Americans in general disagreed.
Cyclonic Storm Roanu is an active tropical cyclone in the Bay of Bengal currently affecting the eastern coast of India. It is the first tropical cyclone of the annual cyclone season. Roanu originated from a low pressure area that formed south of Sri Lanka. It gradually drifted north and intensified into a cyclonic storm on 19 May. However, wind shear and land interaction caused it to weaken slightly, before reintensifying as it accelerated towards the coast of Bangladesh. \c\cWhile in its early stages, the storm was responsible for at least 63 deaths in Sri Lanka. Roanu also brought torrential rainfall to the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha as it drifted in a generally northeastward direction, close to the coast. It is forecast to make landfall on the coast of Bangladesh in the next 24 hours, while maintaining cyclonic storm intensity.

By the late hours of 17 May, a tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA) was issued, following which the system was upgraded to tropical storm intensity by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The next day, the IMD upgraded the storm to a Deep Depression, prompting the issuance of cyclone warnings for the states of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. On 19 May, the IMD reported that the storm had reached cyclonic storm intensity, naming it Roanu. Roanu was tracking along the northern periphery of a subtropical ridge located over the Malay Peninsula. Despite the favorable outflow and warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of up to 31 °C (88 °F), its proximity to land and moderate vertical wind shear (VWS) kept the storm from intensifying rapidly. The diurnal temperature variation over land and the persistent wind shear began to affect the deep convection of the low-level circulation center (LLCC). SSMIS imagery later revealed tightly curved rainbands wrapped into the LLCC. Located approximately 150 kilometres (93 mi) from Visakhapatnam, in the late hours of that day, Roanu showed a weakening trend after most of the convection covering the LLCC was sheared off. However, VWS soon decreased, and the storm reestablished deep convection over and around the LLCC, forming a central dense overcast in a period of 6 hours. As a result. Roanu re-intensified slightly as it accelerated towards the coast of Bangladesh.

On April 12, 2015, Freddie Carlos Gray, Jr., a 25-year-old man, was arrested by the Baltimore Police Department for possessing what the police alleged was an illegal switchblade. While being transported in a police van, Gray fell into a coma and was taken to a trauma center. Gray died on April 19, 2015; his death was ascribed to injuries to his spinal cord. On April 21, 2015, pending an investigation of the incident, six Baltimore police officers were suspended with pay. \c\cThe circumstances of the injuries were initially unclear; eyewitness accounts suggested that the officers involved used unnecessary force against Gray during the arrest—a claim denied by at least one officer involved. Commissioner Anthony W. Batts reported that, contrary to department policy, the officers did not secure him inside the van while driving to the police station; this policy had been put into effect six days prior to Grays arrest, following review of other transport-related injuries sustained during police custody in the city, and elsewhere in the country during the preceding years. The medical investigation found that Gray had sustained the injuries while in transport. On May 1, 2015, the Baltimore City States Attorney, Marilyn Mosby, announced her office had filed charges against six police officers after the medical examiner’s report ruled Grays death a homicide, on the grounds that Gray had died as a result of a rough ride—a form of police brutality in which a victim is helplessly thrown around the interior of a police vehicle by deliberately abrupt police driving, while unable to protect themselves due to handcuffs or other restraints. (Rough rides were already implicated in deaths, paralysis, and severe spinal injuries in several other cases.). \c\cThe prosecutors stated that they had probable cause to file criminal charges against the six police officers who were believed to be involved in his death. The officer driving the van was charged with second-degree "depraved-heart" murder for his indifference to the considerable risk that Gray might be killed, and others were charged with crimes ranging from manslaughter to illegal arrest. In a later rebuttal to allegations that the knife was illegal, prosecutors argued that Gray was illegally arrested well before the officers knew that he possessed a knife, and without probable cause. On May 21, a grand jury indicted the officers on most of the original charges filed by Mosby with the exception of the charges of illegal imprisonment and false arrest, and added charges of reckless endangerment to all the officers involved. \c\cGrays hospitalization and subsequent death resulted in an ongoing series of protests. On April 25, 2015, a major protest in downtown Baltimore turned violent, resulting in 34 arrests and injuries to 15 police officers. After Grays funeral on April 27, civil disorder intensified with looting and burning of local businesses and a CVS drug store, culminating with a state of emergency declaration by Governor Larry Hogan, Maryland National Guard deployment to Baltimore, and the establishment of a curfew. On May 3, the National Guard started withdrawing from Baltimore, and the night curfew on the city was lifted.
The Papua conflict is an ongoing low-level conflict between the Indonesian Government and portions of the indigenous populations of West Papua in the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua on the island of New Guinea; in which the Indonesian government has been accused of conducting a genocidal regime against the indigenous inhabitants. Since the withdrawal of the Dutch colonial administration from the Netherlands New Guinea in 1962, the implementation of Indonesian governance in 1963 and the formal absorption of  West Papua into Indonesia in 1969, the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a militant Papuan-independence organisation, has conducted a low-level guerilla war against the Indonesian state, targeting the Indonesian military and police, as well as engaging in the kidnapping of both non-Papuan Indonesian settlers and foreigners. West Papuans have conducted various protests and ceremonies raising their flag for independence or federation with Papua New Guinea, and accuse the Indonesian government of indiscriminate violence and of suppressing their freedom of expression. Many West Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969 and the Indonesian governance style has been compared to that of a police state, suppressing freedom of political association and political expression. The Indonesian Government restricts foreign access to the Papua and West Papua provinces due to sensitivities regarding its suppression of Papuan nationalism.
On June 1, 2016, two men were killed in a murder-suicide at an engineering building at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

EgyptAir Flight 804 (MS804/MSR804) was a scheduled international passenger flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to Cairo International Airport, operated by EgyptAir, which crashed into the Mediterranean Sea on 19 May 2016 at 02:33 Egypt Standard Time (UTC+2). \c\cNo mayday call was received by air traffic control, although signals that smoke had been detected in one of the aircrafts lavatories and in the avionics bay were automatically transmitted by ACARS shortly before the aircraft disappeared from radar. The cause of the disaster is under investigation. \c\cThere were 66 people on board: 56 passengers, 7 aircrew, and 3 security personnel. No survivors were found. Debris from the aircraft were found in the Mediterranean Sea approximately 290 km (180 mi) north of Alexandria, and, approximately a month after the crash, several main locations of the wreckage on the seabed were identified. A multinational search and recovery operation is under way to locate the flight recorders. \c\cOn June 15, 2016, a deep sea search vessel discovered the wreckage of the aircraft in the Mediterranean Ocean
On June 22, 2016, John Lewis led House Democrats in a sit-in after four gun control measures failed to pass in the U.S. Senate.
The Allied Democratic Forces insurgency refers to the ongoing conflict waged by the Allied Democratic Forces in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, against the governments of those two countries. The insurgency began in 1995, intensifying in 2013, resulting in hundreds of deaths.
In March 2015, it became publicly known that Hillary Clinton, during her tenure as United States Secretary of State, had exclusively used her familys private email server for official communications, rather than official State Department email accounts maintained on federal servers.  Those official communications included thousands of emails that would later be marked classified by the State Department retroactively. In June 2016, following its investigation, the FBI recommended that no charges be filled against Clinton. \c\cSome experts, officials, and members of Congress have contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping. In response, Clinton has said that her use of personal email was in compliance with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts. \c\cNearly 2,100 emails on the server were retroactively marked as classified by the State Department, including 65 emails deemed "Secret" and 22 deemed "Top Secret". Government policy, reiterated in the non-disclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information should be considered and handled as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into this category, an investigation was initiated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. \c\cIn May 2016 the State Departments Office of the Inspector General released an 83-page report about the State Departments email practices, including Clintons.
The Iraq Inquiry, also referred to as the Chilcot Inquiry after its chairman, Sir John Chilcot, is a British public inquiry into the nations role in the Iraq War. The inquiry was announced on 15 June 2009 by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, with an initial announcement that proceedings would take place in private, a decision which was subsequently reversed after receiving criticism in the media and the House of Commons. \c\cThe Inquiry was pursued by a committee of Privy Counsellors with broad terms of reference to consider Britains involvement in Iraq between mid-2001 and July 2009. It covered the run-up to the conflict, the subsequent military action and its aftermath with the purpose to establish the way decisions were made, to determine what happened and to identify lessons to ensure that in a similar situation in future, the British government is equipped to respond in the most effective manner in the best interests of the country. The open sessions of the inquiry commenced on 24 November 2009 and concluded on 2 February 2011. \c\cIn 2012, the government vetoed the release of the documents to the Inquiry detailing minutes of Cabinet meetings in the days leading up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Concurrently, the British Foreign Office successfully appealed against a judges ruling and blocked the disclosure of extracts of a conversation between George W. Bush and Tony Blair days before the invasion. The government stated that revealing the conversation would present a "significant danger" to British-American relations. The million-word report of the Inquiry was due to be released to the public by 2014, but difficult negotiations were continuing with the United States over the publication of documents. The Lord-in-Waiting Lord Wallace of Saltaire said on behalf of the government that it would be "inappropriate" to publish the report in the months leading up to the next general election in May 2015. \c\cIn August it transpired that the Report would in any event be further delayed, possibly into 2016, due to the legal requirement of "Maxwellisation", allowing any person who is to be criticised a fair opportunity to comment on a draft prior to finalisation and publication. Chilcot wrote a letter to David Cameron in October 2015, announcing that the text could be complete by April 2016, and furthermore proposed a release date of June or July 2016. \c\cOn 6 July 2016 Sir John Chilcot published the report, more than seven years after the inquiry was announced. The report stated that Saddam Hussein did not pose an urgent threat to British interests, that intelligence regarding weapons of mass destruction was presented with too much certainty, that peaceful alternatives to war had not been exhausted, that the United Kingdom and United States had undermined the authority of the United Nations Security Council, that the process of identifying the legal basis was "far from satisfactory", and that a war in March 2003 was unnecessary.
Rape in Germany is defined by Section 177 of the Criminal Code of Germany. The definition of rape has changed over time but rapes have been reported in Germany throughout history and today marital rape is also illegal in the country.
On July 7, 2016, at the end of a peaceful protest, Micah Xavier Johnson ambushed and shot twelve police officers and two civilians in Dallas, Texas, United States, killing five of the officers. Johnson was an African-American Army Reserve veteran who expressed his hatred of white people and was reportedly angry over recent police shootings of black men. The protest was being held against police killings in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, in the preceding days. \c\cFollowing the shooting, police confronted Johnson at a parking garage, and a standoff ensued. In the early hours of July 8, police killed Johnson with a bomb attached to a bomb-disposal robot. \c\cThe shooting was the deadliest incident for U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The South Sudanese Civil War is an ongoing conflict in South Sudan between forces of the government and opposition forces. \c\cIt began on the evening of Sunday, 15 December 2013, at the meeting of the National Liberation Council at Nyakuron, when opposition leaders Dr. Riek Machar, Pagan Amum and Rebecca Nyandeng voted to boycott the meeting. President Salva Kiir ordered the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) Major General Marial Ciennoung, commander of the Presidential Guard (The Tiger Battalion) to leave the meeting venue and return to the barracks to disarm the troops. After disarming all ethnicities within the guard, Marial allegedly ordered that the Dinka members be re-armed. His deputy, from the Nuer ethnicity, began to question this order and a fight ensued when surrounding officers saw the commotion. The Nuer soldiers also re-armed themselves.  Fighting erupted between the Dinka elements of the Presidential Guard and the Nuer elements, lasting from Sunday night until Monday afternoon. Civilian casualties began when the Dinka elements of the SPLM began targeting Nuer civilians in the capital city of Juba. \c\cPresident Salva Kiir has called it a coup attempt and announced that it had been put down the next day, but fighting again erupted on 16 December and spread beyond the capital, Juba, to the region around Jonglei which is prone to ethnic conflict.  Early estimates stated that at least 1,000 people were reported to have been killed and over 800 other people were injured  in Juba, but this number has now been cited to be much higher than initially thought as a Human Rights Watch article cites eyewitness accounts of large numbers of bodies on December 17, and their removal in trucks to an undisclosed location December 18. Eyewitness accounts also cite SPLM Dinka troops assisted by guides in house to house searches to Nuer homes and killing civilians in Juba.  Similar door to door searches of members of the Nuer ethnicity have been reported in the government held capital city of the Upper Nile State, Malakal. A final death toll of civilian casualties in government held cities of Juba, Malakal, and Bentiu has not been released.  The International Crisis Group estimated in their April 2014 report that over 10,000 had been killed in the conflict. \c\cKiir blamed former Vice President Riek Machar for instigating the "coup" but no evidence of a coup attempt has been found. Former Vice President Riek Machar has denied a coup attempt and instead blamed Kiir for playing power politics.  Bor was seized by a Nuer militia on 19 December. On the same day, a UN compound was stormed in Akobo, Jonglei, resulting in the deaths of two Indian UNMISS peacekeepers. The UN Secretary General expressed deep concern as UN staff received threats from the body guards of Senior government Information Minister that demanded armed access to UN Mission Camps where civilians are sheltering. Following this incident President Salva Kiir accused the UN of sheltering armed opposition forces in their UN Mission, which the UN denied. Salva Kiir also accused the UN of an attempted take over of his leadership.
Philippines v. China is a pending arbitration case unilaterally brought by the Philippines concerning certain issues in the South China Sea  including the legality of Chinas "nine-dotted line" claim over the South China Sea under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \c\cOn 19 February 2013, China officially refused to participate in the arbitration because, according to China, its 2006 declaration under article 298 covers the disputes brought by the Philippines and that this case concerns sovereignty, thus it deems the arbitral tribunal formed for the case has no jurisdiction over the issue. \c\cOn 7 December 2014, a position paper was published by China to elaborate its position. \c\cOn October 29, 2015, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) ruled that it has jurisdiction over the case, taking up seven of the 15 submissions made by Manila. \c\cThe PCA is expected to announce the outcome of the arbitration on 12 July 2016. \c\cThe Permanent Court of Arbitration rules in favor of the Philippines against China over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The court unanimously says that China has "no historical rights" based on the so-called "nine-dashed line" map.

On 15 July 2016, a coup d'état attempt took place in Turkey. The ongoing coup attempt was confirmed by both Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Alleged to have been orchestrated by a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, the coup plotters announced the creation of a Peace Council that would be the governing body of the country. In Ankara, the Turkish Parliament was bombed. \c\cPresident Erdoğan called on people to take to the streets against the attempted coup. According to the Doğan News Agency, soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the coup attempt, resulting in injuries. Shots were heard near major airports in Ankara and Istanbul.
On 14 July 2016, in a suspected terrorist attack, a motorist drove a truck into a crowd of people celebrating Bastille Day on the Promenade des Anglais in the city of Nice in the Alpes-Maritimes department of France. At least 30 were reported killed and hundreds injured, although these figures are unconfirmed Gunfire was also reported by some eyewitnesses. \c\cThe fact that the attacks occurred on Bastille Day has led to speculation that the incident could be an act of terrorism.
The 2016 Republican National Convention, in which delegates of the United States Republican Party chose the partys nominees for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in the United States presidential election, 2016, was held July 18–21, 2016, at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. The event marked the third time Cleveland has hosted this event, the first since 1936. In addition to determining the partys national ticket, the convention ratified the party platform. \c\cThere are 2,472 delegates to the Republican National Convention, with a simple majority of 1,237 required to win the presidential nomination. Most of those delegates were bound for the first ballot of the convention based on the results of the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. The convention formally nominated Donald Trump as the partys nominee and Mike Pence as his running mate.
The 2016 Summer Olympics (Portuguese: Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016), officially known as the Games of the XXXI Olympiad, and commonly known as Rio 2016, is a major international multi-sport event in the tradition of the Olympic Games due to take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. A record number of countries are participating in a record number of sports. More than 10,500 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees (NOCs), including first time entrants Kosovo and South Sudan, are scheduled to take part. With 306 sets of medals, the games will feature 28 Olympic sports — including rugby sevens and golf, which were added by the International Olympic Committee in 2009. These sporting events will take place at 33 venues in the host city and at 5 venues in the cities of São Paulo (Brazils largest city), Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília (Brazils capital), and Manaus. \c\cThese will be the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach. The host city of Rio de Janeiro was announced at the 121st IOC Session held in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009. Rio will become the first South American city to host the Summer Olympics. These will be the first games to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first to be held entirely during the host countrys winter season (the 2000 games began on 15 September – five days before the Southern Hemispheres vernal equinox), the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America, and the first since 2000 (and third overall) to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. \c\cThe lead-up to these games have been marked by political controversies—including the corruption and instability of the countrys federal government, as well as prominent health and safety concerns surrounding the Zika virus and significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay.
On 22 July 2016, three shootings occurred in the Olympia shopping mall in the Moosach district of Munich, Germany. German media have cited a police spokesperson who stated several people have been killed and more injured. \c\cMunich police quoted eyewitnesses who reportedly saw three attackers carrying guns. The shooting began at a McDonalds restaurant near the shopping mall. The police described an "acute terror threat", said that there were "no indications of Islamic terror", and asked online commentators to avoid speculation about the attack. Police reported at least three perpetrators with long guns. \c\cThe GSG 9 was called to Munich.

On 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks published 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the governing body of the United States' Democratic Party. WikiLeaks have not revealed their source. Romanian hacker Guccifer claimed that he was the source of the leaks, but some experts find his claim doubtful. \c\cThe leak includes e-mails from seven key DNC staff members, and date from January 2015 to May 2016. \c\cThe e-mails include DNC staffs 'off-the-record' correspondence with mediapersons, including the reporters at Politico, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post. One e-mail suggests that RealClearPolitics changed a headline after DNCs objections. \c\cThe e-mails suggest that the DNC, which is supposed to be neutral, was biased against the Sanders Campaign, and favoured the Clinton Campaign. An e-mail dated 5 May indicates that DNC executives plotted against Sanders by attempting to brand him as an atheist. \c\cOne particular e-mail describes a fake craigslist job posting made by DNC Staffers to mock Clintons Republican rival Donald Trump.
Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370) was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared on 8 March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia, to Beijing Capital International Airport in China. The aircraft last made voice contact with air traffic control at 01:19 MYT, 8 March (17:19 UTC, 7 March) when it was over the South China Sea, less than an hour after takeoff. It disappeared from air traffic controllers radar screens at 01:22 MYT. Malaysian military radar continued to track the aircraft as it deviated westwards from its planned flight path and crossed the Malay Peninsula. It left the range of Malaysian military radar at 02:22 while over the Andaman Sea,  200 nautical miles (370 km) north-west of Penang in north-western Malaysia. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 15 nations. \c\cA multinational search effort began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, from whence the aircrafts signal was last seen on secondary surveillance radar, and was soon extended to the Strait of Malacca and Andaman Sea. Analysis of satellite communications between the aircraft and Inmarsats satellite communications network concluded that the flight continued until at least 08:19 and flew south into the southern Indian Ocean, although the precise location cannot be determined. Australia took charge of the search on 17 March, when the search moved to the southern Indian Ocean. On 24 March, the Malaysian government noted that the final location determined by the satellite communication is far from any possible landing sites, and concluded that "Flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean." The current phase of the search, the largest and most expensive in aviation history, is a comprehensive survey of the sea floor about 1,800 kilometres (970 nmi) south-west of Perth, Western Australia, which began in October 2014. Nothing was found of the aircraft until 29 July 2015, when a piece of marine debris, later confirmed to be a flaperon from Flight 370, washed ashore on Réunion Island. Although multiple additional small pieces of debris have been found, the bulk of the aircraft has still not been located, prompting many theories about its disappearance. \c\cMalaysia established the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to investigate the incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Neither the crew nor the aircrafts communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police have identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircrafts satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsats satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and the flight continued for five hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its fuel was exhausted. \c\cWith the presumed loss of all on board, Flight 370 is the second deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777 and the second deadliest incident in Malaysia Airlines history, behind Flight 17 in both categories. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem that was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after Flight 370 and the crash of Flight 17; the airline was renationalised by the end of 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information promptly during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370s disappearance brought to public attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders, including several issues raised four years earlier—but never mandated—following the loss of Air France Flight 447. In response to Flight 370s disappearance, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)—the United Nations civil aviation body—adopted new standards for aircraft position reporting over open ocean, extended recording time for cockpit voice recorders, and, from 2020, will require new aircraft designs to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water.
On 24 July 2016, at least one man was killed and eleven were wounded in a suicide bombing outside a wine bar in Ansbach, Germany. The explosion took place near a music festival and was initially thought to have been caused by a gas leak. A man with a backpack was seen near the site of the blast and may have been denied entry into the music festival shortly before the blast. As a result of the bombing, the music festival was cancelled and the immediate vicinity in which the bombing occurred was evacuated.
The 2016 Democratic National Convention is the gathering at which delegates of the United States Democratic Party will choose their nominees for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in the 2016 national election. It will be held July 25–28, 2016, at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, PA, with some caucus meetings at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, beginning exactly one week after the 2016 Republican National Convention. \c\cThere are expected to be 4,769 delegates (worth 4,765 delegate votes) to the Democratic National Convention.  A candidate needs a majority of delegate votes to win the presidential nomination, which in this case is a minimum of 2,383 votes.
On 25 July 2016, at least 19 people were killed and up to 50 injured in a mass stabbing incident at a disabled care home in Sagamihara, Japan. A 26-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.

The  2016 PGA Championship is the 98th PGA Championship which took place from July 28–31 at Baltusrol Golf Club on the Lower Course in Springfield Township, New Jersey, west of New York City. This was the ninth major and second PGA Championship at Baltusrol, which last hosted in 2005. \c\cThis edition of the PGA Championship was moved up two weeks from its early-August spot to accommodate the Olympic tournament in Brazil. The John Deere Classic is taking its place on the schedule for those not qualified for the Olympics.
In Charleroi on 6 August 2016, a man attacked two policewomen with a machete before being shot dead by another police officer. The attacker is reported to have said Allahu Akbar during the attack.
On 6 August 2016, a man attacked two policewomen with a machete in Charleroi, Belgium, before being shot dead by another police officer. The attacker is reported to have said "Allahu Akbar" during the attack. Prime Minister Charles Michel said the incident is believed to be a terrorist attack, making it the first terrorist attack in Belgium since the Brussels bombings in March.
The 2016 Atlantic hurricane season is a current event in the annual tropical cyclone season in the northern hemisphere. The season officially began on June 1, 2016, and will end on November 30, 2016. These dates historically describe the period each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin and are adopted by convention. However, as illustrated by Hurricane Alex and Tropical Storm Bonnie, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year. This season started exceptionally early, nearly five months before the official start, with Hurricane Alex forming in the Northeastern Atlantic in mid-January. Tropical Storm Bonnie followed in late May, which was the first occurrence of two pre-season Atlantic storms since 2012. On June 5, Colin formed, making it the earliest third named storm in the Atlantic in recorded history, whilst Danielle became the earliest fourth named storm on June 20. There were no named storms during the month of July, the first occurrence since 2012. Tropical Storm Earl developed in the western Caribbean on August 2, strengthening into a hurricane late on August 3. \c\cTo this point, most forecasting groups have expected this season to be an above average season, due to a combination of factors including an expected transition to La Niña and warmer than normal sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Western Atlantic, despite near-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Main Development Region near Cape Verde. So far, all five of the seasons storms have impacted land and caused loss of life, directly or indirectly.
The 2016 Summer Paralympics (Brazilian Portuguese: Jogos Paralímpicos de Verão de 2016), the fifteenth Summer Paralympic Games, are an upcoming major international multi-sport event for athletes with disabilities governed by the International Paralympic Committee, to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016, making them the first Summer Paralympics to be held during the host citys wintertime. This will mark the first time a Latin American and South American city hosts the event, the second Southern Hemisphere city and nation, the first one being the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, and also the first time a Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) country hosts the event. These Games will see the introduction of two new sports to the Paralympic program; canoeing and the paratriathlon.
On August 13, 2016, a riot began in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, sparked by the shooting of an armed man by police.
A suicide bomber detonated outside a wedding ceremony in Gaziantep, Turkey on 20 August 2016. At least eight people were killed and sixty more wounded. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to an AKP parliamentary official.
An earthquake hit central Italy on 23 August 2016 at 3:36 local time (01:36 GMT), in the proximity of Norcia, 76 km southeast of Perugia, in an area near the border of the Umbria and Lazio regions. The quake was initially reported by USGS to have a 6.4 magnitude and an epicenter 6.2 miles (10 km) deep. The magnitude was later corrected by USGS to 6.2 while the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre put the magnitude at 6.1. \c\cThe tremor and a number of aftershocks were felt across large parts of central Italy, including Rome, Naples, and Florence.
The 2016 Atlantic hurricane season is the current tropical cyclone season in the North Atlantic Ocean, which officially began on June 1 will end on November 30. This season began nearly five months before the official start, with Hurricane Alex forming in the Northeastern Atlantic in mid-January. Tropical Storm Bonnie followed in late May, which was the first occurrence of two pre-season Atlantic storms since 2012. In June, tropical storms Colin and Danielle formed and became the earliest third and fourth named storms in the Atlantic in recorded history. In August, Hurricane Earl killed 67 people after striking Belize and Mexico. \c\cTo this point, most forecasting groups have expected this season to be an above average season, due to a combination of factors including an expected transition to La Niña and warmer than normal sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Western Atlantic, despite near-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Main Development Region near Cape Verde. So far, six of the eight developed storms have impacted land, and 5 of those storms caused loss of life, directly or indirectly.
Philippines – United States relations (Filipino: Ugnayang Pilipinas at Estados Unidos) are bilateral relations between the United States of America and its former colony the Republic of the Philippines. Relations between the United States and the Philippines have historically been strong and have been been described as a Special Relationship. \c\cThe United States is the Philippines' closest ally in the world, the Philippines being one of the oldest Asian partners of the U.S. and a strategic major non-NATO ally. The United States has consistently been cited as one of the Filipinos' favorite nations in the world, with 90% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. and 91% viewing Americans favorably in 2002, 90% of Filipinos viewing U.S. influence positively in 2011, 85% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. and Americans favorably in 2013, and 92% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. favorably in 2015, and 89% having confidence in United States president, Barack Obama in 2014, making the Philippines the most pro-American country in the world. \c\cThis article discusses Philippine–American relations after Philippine independence from the United States in 1946, while the article History of the Philippines (1898–1946) describes the history of the Philippines during American colonial rule.
The 2016 US Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts. It was the 136th edition of the US Open, the fourth and final Grand Slam event of the year. It took place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. \c\cStan Wawrinka won the mens singles event. Angelique Kerber won the womens singles event and became the first German player to win the tournament since Steffi Graf in 1996.
This is a list of terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2016 as of September 2016.
A bombing at a night market occurred in Davao City, Southern Philippines, on 2 September 2016, causing at least 14 deaths and 70 injuries. On 13 September 2016, one of those injured, a pregnant women died putting the death toll to 15. \c\cMilitant Islamic group Abu Sayyaf reportedly claimed responsibility for the bombing but later denied responsibility, claiming that their allies, the Daulat Ul-Islamiya, were responsible for the incident as a show of sympathy to the group. Disgruntled vendors are also being considered as possible perpetrators.
The 2016 Summer Paralympics (Brazilian Portuguese: Jogos Paralímpicos de Verão de 2016), the fifteenth Summer Paralympic Games, are a major international multi-sport event for athletes with disabilities governed by the International Paralympic Committee, being held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016. The Games mark the first time a Latin American and South American city hosts the event, the second Southern Hemisphere city and nation, the first one being the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, and also the first time a Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) country hosts the event. These Games will see the introduction of two new sports to the Paralympic program: canoeing and the paratriathlon. \c\cThe lead-up to these Paralympics were met with financial shortcomings attributed to tepid sponsor interest and ticket sales, which resulted in cuts to volunteer staffing and transport, the re-location of events and the partial deconstruction of the Deodoro Olympic Park. However, ticket sales began to increase during the lead-up to the opening ceremony: on 9 September 2016 (the second day of competition), the IPC announced that 1.9 million tickets had been sold—making these the second-largest Paralympic Games in terms of ticket sales.
The 19th SAARC summit was a diplomatic conference, which was originally scheduled to be held in Islamabad and Murree, Pakistan in November 2016. The Summit was to be attended by the head of states and the heads of government of eight SAARC member states and representatives of observers, and guest states. \c\cFollowing the rising diplomatic tensions after the Uri terrorist attack, India announced its boycott of the 19th SAARC Summit, alleging Pakistans involvement in the terror attack. Later, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Bhutan also pulled out of the summit. \c\cThe summit was postponed, as a number of SAARC members withdrew from the conference in Islamabad.
On September 29th, 2016, a commuter train ran through a wall at Hoboken train station, New Jersey. The accident occurred during the rush hour of Thursday morning. The police chief in charge of the investigations reported there being mass casualties. Events leading to the crash remain unclear but are being investigated. Initial reports have indicated that at least three people have died and 100 more are injured. \c\cTrain number 1614 on the Pascack Valley Line left Spring Valley, N.Y. at 7:23 a.m. bound for Hoboken and crashed around 8:30 a.m.

Bangladesh has experienced significant terrorism conducted by a number of radical local Islamist and communist organizations. Islamic extremist militant organizations have risen to prominence through assassinations, hostage takings and bomb blasts. Both ISIL and Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent have claimed to be active in the country, although the Bangladeshi government believes that they mainly operate through local affiliates.
After the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum in June 2016, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, indicated that a second referendum on Scottish independence could be held. \c\cA referendum on Scottish independence was previously held in September 2014, when 55% voted against the proposal. One of the reasons cited by those opposed to Scottish independence was that it would endanger Scotland being part of the European Union (EU). Following the Conservative victory in the May 2015 UK general election, a referendum on UK membership of the EU was organised. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports Scottish independence, stated in its manifesto for the May 2016 Scottish Parliament election that it would consider holding a second independence referendum if there was a material change of circumstances, such as the UK leaving the EU. The "Leave" side won the June 2016 referendum with 52% of the vote. In Scotland, 62% of votes were to "Remain" in the EU, including a majority of voters in every local authority area. \c\cThere has since been political debate and negotiation about whether there should be a second Scottish independence referendum, or if it is possible for Scotland to maintain links with the EU after the UK leaves.
On 21 October 2016, a passenger train travelling from Cameroons capital Yaoundé to its largest city Douala derailed near Eséka, Centre Region. At least 53 people were killed and 575 injured, with an unknown number still trapped inside carriages. \c\cIt was the deadliest rail accident on the African continent since the August 2007 Benaleka train accident.
On January 2, 2016, armed militants seized the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon, United States, and continued to occupy it until law enforcement made a final arrest on February 11, 2016. Their leader was Ammon Bundy, who participated in the 2014 Bundy standoff at his fathers Nevada ranch. Other members of the group were loosely affiliated with non-governmental militias and the sovereign citizen movement. \c\cThe organizers were seeking an opportunity to advance their view that the United States Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and other agencies are constitutionally required to turn over most of the federal public land they manage to the individual states. In 2015, the militants decided they could do this by protesting the treatment of two area ranchers convicted of federal land arson, even though the men in question did not want their help. The occupation began when Bundy led an armed party to the refuge headquarters following a peaceful public rally in the nearby city of Burns. \c\cOn January 26, 2016, several leaders were arrested by the Oregon State Police (OSP) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) while en route to a public meeting in a neighboring county. One of them, Robert "LaVoy" Finicum, was shot and killed while resisting arrest and appearing to reach his hands towards his semi-automatic handgun. Afterwards, most of the other militants withdrew from the occupation, peacefully returning to their homes. \c\cBy January 28, only four militants remained in occupation of the site, and the last of them surrendered peacefully on February 11, 2016. More than two dozen of the militants have been charged with federal offenses including conspiracy to obstruct federal officers, firearms violations, theft, and depredation of federal property. As of August 15, twelve have pleaded guilty, while others are awaiting trial. \c\cOn October 27, 2016, a jury acquitted seven of the defendants, including Ammon and Ryan Bundy, of all federal charges.
In March 2015 it became publicly known that Hillary Clinton, during her tenure as United States Secretary of State, had exclusively used her familys private email server for official communications, rather than official State Department email accounts maintained on federal servers. Those official communications included thousands of emails that would later be marked classified by the State Department retroactively. \c\cThe controversy unfolded against the backdrop of Clintons 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi. Some experts, officials, and members of Congress have contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping. In response, Clinton has said that her use of personal email was in compliance with federal laws and State Department regulations and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts, though not their own private email servers. \c\cAfter allegations were raised that some of the emails in question contained classified information, an investigation was initiated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. Of the emails on the server, 113 emails contained information which was classified at the time it was sent, including 65 emails deemed "Secret" and 22 deemed "Top Secret." Of the 113 emails, just three contained markings indicating they could be classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small "c" in parentheses, described as "portion markings" by FBI Director James Comey. Comey also said it was possible Clinton was not “technically sophisticated” enough to understand what the three classified markings meant. Nearly 2,100 emails on the server were retroactively marked as classified by the State Department. Government policy, reiterated in the non-disclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information should be considered and handled as classified even if not marked as such. \c\cIn May 2016, the State Departments Office of the Inspector General released an 83-page report about the State Departments email practices, including Clintons. On July 5, 2016 Comey announced that the FBIs investigation had concluded that Clinton was "extremely careless" in handling her email system but recommended that no charges be filed against her. On July 6, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that no charges would be filed. On July 7, the State Department reopened its probe into the email controversy.
The 2016 Japan Series is the 67th edition of Nippon Professional Baseballs postseason championship series. The Hiroshima Toyo Carp, champions of the Central League, played the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, champions of the Pacific League, in a best-of-seven series beginning on October 22. \c\cHokkaido won the series, four games to two. Hiroshima won the first two games, while Hokkaido won Games 3, 4, 5, and 6. Hokkaidos Brandon Laird won the Japan Series Most Valuable Player Award, and Hiroshimas Brad Eldred won the Fighting Spirit Award, given to the best player on the losing team.

Flag icons denote the first announcements of confirmed cases by the respective nation-states, their first deaths (and other events such as their first reported cases of microcephaly and major public health announcements), and relevant sessions and announcements of the World Health Organization (WHO), and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), as well as relevant virological, epidemiological, and entomological studies.
The 2016 World Series is the 112th edition of Major League Baseballs championship series, a best-of-seven playoff between  the National League champions Chicago Cubs and the American League champions Cleveland Indians. The Indians have home-field advantage by virtue of the American Leagues 4–2 win in the 2016 All-Star Game. \c\cThis is the Indians' sixth overall appearance in the World Series and their first since 1997, with their last Series win in 1948. The Cubs are playing in their 11th World Series overall and their first since 1945, and have the chance to win their first championship since 1908. This matchup features the two franchises with the longest World Series title droughts, a combined 176 years without a championship. The previous longest combined drought was 132 years in 2005 between the Chicago White Sox (88 years) and the Houston Astros (44 years).
The Shah Noorani shrine in Balochistan was attacked on November 12, 2016. More than 47 people were killed in the attack and another 100 were injured.
The Sinai insurgency is the conflict ignited by Islamist militants in the Sinai Peninsula, which began after the start of the Egyptian Crisis, which saw the overthrow of longtime Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. \c\cSinai insurgency consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. Since 2011, the central authorities have attempted to restore their presence in the Sinai through both political and military measures. \c\cEgypt launched two military operations, known as Operation Eagle in mid-2011 and then Operation Sinai in mid-2012. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup détat, which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group claimed allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and proclaimed themselves as the Sinai Province. Militant attacks continued into 2015. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with Sinai Province. \c\cThe fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share the same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services. Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. \c\cAdministratively, the Sinai Peninsula is divided into two governorates: the South Sinai Governorate and the North Sinai Governorate. Three other governorates span the Suez Canal, crossing into African Egypt: Suez Governorate on the southern end of the Suez Canal, Ismailia Governorate in the center, and Port Said Governorate in the north.
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (Persian: اکبر هاشمی رفسنجانی, romanized: Akbar Hāshemī Rafsanjānī pronunciation (help·info)) (هاشمی بهرمانی\u200e, 25 August 1934 – 8 January 2017) was the chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran from 1989 until his death. He was also the fourth president of Iran from 3 August 1989 until 3 August 1997. He was the head of the Assembly of Experts from 2007 until 2011 when he decided not to nominate himself for the post. \c\cDuring the Iran–Iraq War Rafsanjani was the de facto commander-in-chief of the Iranian military. Rafsanjani was elected chairman of the Iranian parliament in 1980 and served until 1989. He played an important role in the choice of Ali Khamenei as Supreme Leader. \c\cRafsanjani became president of Iran after winning 1989 election. He served another term by winning election in 1993. In 2005 election he ran for a third term in office, placing first in the first round of elections but ultimately losing to rival Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the run-off. He and his familly came under fire from conservatives for their support of Mir-Hossein Mousavi who led protests in 2009. \c\cRafsanjani has been described as having been a pragmatic Islamic conservative. The Economist called him a "veteran kingmaker." He supported a free market position domestically, favoring privatization of state-owned industries and a moderate position internationally, seeking to avoid conflict with the United States and the West. He was also founder and one of the Board of Trustees of Azad University. \c\cOn 11 May 2013, Rafsanjani entered the race for the June 2013 presidential election, but on 21 May he was disqualified by the Guardian Council. With Hassan Rouhanis election, in which Rafsanjani openly supported him, the Rafsanjani family gradually recovered their political reputation. \c\cRafsanjani died following a heart attack on 8 January 2017 in a hospital in Tehran at the age of 82.
Turkish Airlines Flight 6491 (TK6491/THY6491) was a scheduled international cargo flight operated by ACT Airlines, on behalf of Turkish Cargo, from Hong Kong to Istanbul via Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. At 7:31 a.m. local time on 16 January 2017, the Boeing 747-412F hit the ground amid thick fog while trying to land at its scheduled stopover at  Manas International Airport in Bishkek. \c\cAt least 38 people were killed in the crash, including all four crew members and 34 residents of Dacha-Suu, a village located approximately 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) to the west of the airport. At least 15 people on the ground were injured, including six children.

Protests against Donald Trump, or anti-Trump protests, have occurred throughout the United States during Donald Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and in the wake of his victory in the U.S. presidential election. \c\cDuring his presidential campaign, activists occasionally organized demonstrations inside Trumps rallies, sometimes with calls to shut the rallies down; fueled by some of Trumps language, protesters began to attend his rallies displaying signs and disrupting proceedings. Following Trumps election to the presidency, students and activists organized larger protests in several major cities across the United States, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Portland, and Oakland. Tens of thousands of protesters participated, with many chanting "Not my president!" to express their opposition to Trumps victory. \c\cDebate began regarding the United States electoral college system after the election because Trumps Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton lost the election while winning the popular vote. Detractors of the system say that popular votes represent the nation as a whole, while supporters of the electoral college say that the system prevents candidates from only focusing on large metropolitan areas for votes.
The Syrian peace process is the ensemble of initiatives and plans to resolve the Syrian Civil War, which has ravaged in Syria since 2011 and has spilled beyond its borders. The peace process has been moderated by the Arab League, the UN Special Envoy on Syria, Russia, and Western Powers. The negotiating parties to end the conflict are typically representatives of the Syrian Baathist government and Syrian Opposition, while the Western-backed Kurdish forces have stayed out of the negotiations framework. Radical Salafist forces and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have not engaged in any contacts on peaceful resolution to the conflict. \c\cThe attempts to find a solution to the conflict began in late 2011, when the Arab League launched two initiatives, but without much success. Russia in January 2012 and in November 2013 suggested talks in Moscow between the Syrian government and opposition. In March–May 2012, hopes were on a United Nations/Arab League plan coordinated by Kofi Annan. In January and February 2014, the Geneva II Conference on Syria took place, organized by Lakhdar Brahimi, then UN envoy to Syria. On 30 October 2015, further talks started  in Vienna involving officials from the US, the EU, Russia, China and various regional actors such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and, for the first time, Iran. Peace talks with rebel leadership will continue in Astana, Kazakhstan in 2017. The Kazakh officials are offering Astana as a neutral venue and "a natural home" for peace negotiations on Syria.
A shooting occurred on January 29, 2017, at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec (CCIQ) in Sainte-Foy, a suburb of Quebec City, Quebec. At least five people were killed after up to three gunmen opened fire during evening prayers, just after 8:00 p.m. EST. About 40 people were reported to be present at the time of the shooting. Many people are reported to have been wounded, and two suspects have been arrested.
Executive Order 13769, entitled "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States", is an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on January 27, 2017. It bars immigrants, refugees, and other visa holders from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days, and Syrian refugees indefinitely, with exceptions.  In the debate, it is often referred to as the travel ban. \c\cThe order limited refugee arrivals to 50,000 and suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days, after which the program would be conditionally resumed for individual countries while prioritizing refugee claims from persecuted minority religions. The order also indefinitely suspended the entry of Syrian refugees. Further, the order suspended the entry of alien nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries — Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — for 90 days. The order allows exceptions to these suspensions on a case-by-case basis. The Department of Homeland Security later exempted U.S. lawful permanent residents (green card holders). \c\cDozens of travelers were detained and held for hours without access to family or legal assistance. In addition, up to 60,000 visas may have been "provisionally revoked", according to the State Department. Lawsuits against the immigration policy of Donald Trump were immediately filed, arguing that the order, or actions taken pursuant to the order, violated the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, and treaty obligations. Federal courts issued emergency orders halting detention, expulsion, or blocking of lawful travelers, pending final rulings. A district court ruling in State of Washington v. Trump blocked major provisions of the order nationwide, including the travel ban and refugee suspension, except the 50,000 limit. Homeland Security and State Departments stopped enforcing the order and reinstated the revoked visas. \c\cDomestically, the order was criticized by Democratic and Republican members of Congress, universities, business leaders, Catholic bishops, and Jewish organizations. Some 1,000 U.S. diplomats signed a dissent cable opposing the order, setting a record. Public opinion was divided, with initial national polls yielding inconsistent results. Protests against the order erupted in airports and cities. Internationally, the order prompted broad condemnation, including from longstanding U.S. allies. The travel ban and suspension of refugee admissions was criticized by top United Nations officials and by a group of 40 Nobel laureates and thousands of other academics.
Women of eighteenth-century Russia were luckier than their European counterparts in some ways; in others, the life of a Russian woman was more difficult. The eighteenth-century was a time of social and legal changes that began to affect women in a way that they had never before experienced.  Peter the Great ruled Russia from 1682–1725 and in that time brought about many changes to Russian culture, altering the orthodox traditions that had been observed since the fall of the Byzantine Empire. \c\cThe three major social classes present during these reforms experienced changes in varying degrees according to their proximity to the tsar and urban settings where reforms could be more strictly enforced. Large cities underwent the westernization process more rapidly and successfully than the outlying rural villages. Noblewomen, merchant class women, and peasant (serf) women each witnessed Petrine reforms differently. For the lower classes it was not until the end of the eighteenth-century (during the time of Catherine the Great’s reign) that they began to see any changes at all. \c\cWhen these reforms did begin to change women’s lives legally, they also helped to expand their abilities socially. The Petrine reforms of this century allowed for more female participation in society, when before they were merely an afterthought as wives and mothers.  “The change in women’s place in Russian society can be illustrated no better than by the fact that five women ruled the empire, in their own names, for a total of seventy years.”. \c\cIn the post-Soviet era, the position of women in Russian society remains at least as problematic as in previous decades. In both cases, nominal legal protections for women either have failed to address the existing conditions or have failed to supply adequate support. In the 1990s, increasing economic pressures and shrinking government programs left women with little choice but to seek employment, although most available positions were as substandard as in the Soviet period, and generally jobs of any sort were more difficult to obtain. Such conditions contribute heavily to Russias declining birthrate and the general deterioration of the family. At the same time, feminist groups and social organizations have begun advancing the cause of womens rights in what remains a strongly traditional society.
Day Without Immigrants (or A Day Without Immigrants) is a  protest and boycott taking place on February 16, 2017. Immigrants and supporters will strike to demonstrate the importance of immigration. The protest is related to President Donald Trumps  plans to build a border wall and to potentially deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The strike called for immigrants not to go to work, to avoid spending money, and keep children home from  school.
The Battle of al-Bab was a battle for the city of al-Bab in the Aleppo Governorate that includes a military offensive launched by Syrian rebel groups (including groups affiliated with the Free Syrian Army) and the Turkish Armed Forces north of al-Bab, a separate Syrian Democratic Forces offensive east and west of the city, and another Syrian Army offensive from the south of the city. The northern Turkish-led forces intend to capture al-Bab from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as part of the Turkish military intervention in Syria. \c\cThe battle was concurrent with the other anti-ISIL operations including Raqqa offensive launched by the SDF, the Battle of Mosul launched by the Iraqi forces, and the Battle of Sirte launched by the Libyan GNA.

Abiogenesis (Brit.: /ˌeɪˌbaɪoʊˈdʒɛnɪsɪs, -ˌbaɪə-, -ˌbiːoʊ-, -ˌbiːə-/), biopoiesis, or informally, the origin of life, is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. It is thought to have occurred on Earth between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years ago. Abiogenesis is studied through a combination of laboratory experiments and extrapolation from the characteristics of modern organisms, and aims to determine how pre-life chemical reactions gave rise to life on Earth. \c\cThe study of abiogenesis can be geophysical, chemical, or biological, with more recent approaches attempting a synthesis of all three. Life itself is dependent upon the specialized chemistry of carbon and water and is largely based upon five different families of chemicals.  Lipids are fatty molecules comprising large chemical chains of hydrocarbons and play an important role in the structure of living cell membranes, actively and passively determining the transport of other molecules into and out of cells.  Carbohydrates are sugars, and as monomer units can be assembled into polymers called polysaccharides, such as Cellulose, the rigid chemical of most plant cell walls.  Nitrogenous bases are organic molecules in which the amine group of nitrogen combined with two hydrogen atoms, play an important part.  Chlorophyll is based upon a porphyrin ring derived from amine monomer units, and is important in the capture of the energy needed for life.  Nucleic acid monomers are made from a carbohydrate monosaccharide a nitrogenous base and one or more high energy phosphate groups.  When joined together they form either the unit of inheritance, the gene, made from DNA or RNA, which translates the genetic information into protein structures.  The monomer unit of a protein is always one of 20 amino acids, comprising an amine group, a hydrocarbon and a carboxylic acid.   Through dehydrogenation, the removal of a water molecule linking the amine to the acid, a polypeptide protein group is formed which has many catalytic metabolic functions for living processes.  Any successful theory of abiogenesis must explain the origins and interactions of these five classes of molecules. \c\cMany approaches to abiogenesis investigate how self-replicating molecules, or their components, came into existence. It is generally thought that current life on Earth is descended from an RNA world, although RNA-based life may not have been the first life to have existed. The classic Miller–Urey experiment and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the basic chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate those of the early Earth. Various external sources of energy that may have triggered these reactions have been proposed, including lightning and radiation. Other approaches ("metabolism-first" hypotheses) focus on understanding how catalysis in chemical systems on the early Earth might have provided the precursor molecules necessary for self-replication. Complex organic molecules have been found in the Solar System and in interstellar space, and these molecules may have provided starting material for the development of life on Earth. \c\cThe panspermia hypothesis alternatively suggests that microscopic life was distributed to the early Earth by meteoroids, asteroids and other small Solar System bodies and that life may exist throughout the Universe. It is speculated that the biochemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the age of the universe was only 10 to 17 million years. The panspermia hypothesis therefore answers questions of where, not how, life came to be; it only postulates that life may have originated in a locale outside the Earth. \c\cNonetheless, Earth remains the only place in the Universe known to harbour life, and fossil evidence from the Earth informs most studies of abiogenesis. The age of the Earth is about 4.54 billion years; the earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago, and possibly as early as the Eoarchean Era, after geological crust started to solidify following the molten Hadean Eon. Microbial mat fossils have been found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia. Other early physical evidence of biogenic substances includes graphite and possibly stromatolites discovered in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in southwestern Greenland, as well as "remains of biotic life" found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. According to a scientist who commented on the study, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth .. then it could be common in the universe."
Cannabis in Israel is illegal for recreational use but allowed for some specified medical usages. It was decriminalized in March 2017.
Executive Order 13780, titled Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, is an executive order signed by United States President Donald Trump on March 6, 2017, that places limits on travel to the U.S. from certain countries, and by all refugees who do not possess either a visa or valid travel documents. According to its terms on March 16, this executive order will revoke and replace Executive Order 13769 issued January 27, 2017.
The March 2017 Israel–Syria incident took place on March 17, 2017 to the present, when Israeli Air Force jets targeted a military site in Syria, near Palmyra. Syrian Army responded with several S-200 fired at the Israeli jets. Israel reported that one missile had been shot down by an Arrow 2 missile and no aircraft had been damaged. Syria claimed to have shot down one attacking aircraft. The State of Israel has stated it was targeting weapons shipments headed toward anti-Israeli forces, specifically Hezbollah, located in Lebanon. Israel denied Syrias claim that one jet fighter was shot down and another damaged. Israel has not reported any pilots or aircraft missing in Syria, or anywhere else in the Middle East following the incident. Also, neither Syria nor Hezbollah have shown photos or video of downed Israeli aircraft or personnel. According to some sources, the incident was the first time Israeli officials clearly confirmed an Israeli strike on Syrian territory during the Syrian Civil War. \c\cFollowing a generic statement by the Israeli Defense Forces reading "Several anti-aircraft missiles were launched from Syria following the mission, and IDF aerial defense systems intercepted one of the missiles. At no point was the safety of Israeli civilians or the IAF aircraft compromised", several news reports started speculating about the use of the Arrow system to defend jet fighters from hostile surface to air missiles. However other Israeli news publications confirmed that the initial reading of the IDF statement was wrong; in fact, the IDF said that the jet fighters were never in danger and the missiles were far from the planes. But the IDF detected Syrian S-200 missiles on course to land in Israel, so the Arrow missile system was used to prevent them falling on settled areas. Indeed a S-200, after losing its target, hence going ballistic, has approximately the size, the speed and the range of a battlefield artillery rocket such as the FROG-7, which is one of the very standard targets the Israeli missile defense is shaped around. \c\cThe Jordanian armed forces reported that a part of the Arrow missile fell in its territory. There were no casualties in Jordan. Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1994, leading to a normalization of diplomatic, trade and cultural relations between the two nations, and Jordan is not a target or participant in the Israeli-Syrian conflict. \c\cThe Israeli airstrikes continued on March 22, 2017, with a fourth round of bombings carried out on suspected Hezbollah targets near Damascus.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Debbie is currently a powerful tropical cyclone off the coast of northern Queensland. It was the first cyclone to reach severe tropical cyclone intensity and the strongest cyclone in the Australian region since Cyclone Quang in April 2015, and was branded the most dangerous cyclone to impact Queensland since Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Forming as a tropical low on 23 March, the low gradually intensified to a named tropical cyclone on 26 March. Cyclone Debbie is expected to make landfall between Ayr and Cape Hillsborough, north of Mackay, around midday on 28 March.
Georgia and the European Union have maintained relations since 1996 in the INOGATE framework, and in 2006 a five-year "Action Plan" of rapprochement was implemented in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). A more comprehensive Association Agreement is under ratification (as of 2015). \c\cA European Union Monitoring Mission was sent to Georgia in the wake of the 2008 South Ossetia war. \c\cGeorgia does not have any official status as a candidate for future enlargement of the European Union, but in 2011 Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili expressed a desire for his country to become a member state of the EU.  This view has been explicitly expressed on several occasions as links to the United States, EU and NATO have been strengthened in an attempt to move away from the Russian sphere of influence.
Brexit is a commonly used term for the United Kingdoms prospective withdrawal from the European Union. Following a referendum vote to leave, the UK government announced it will start the the formal procedure for withdrawing on 29 March 2017, putting the UK on course to leave the EU by 31 March 2019 at the latest.  "Brexit" is a portmanteau of "Britain" and "exit". \c\cPrime Minister Theresa May, elected in the wake of the referendum, has promised a bill to repeal the European Communities Act and  incorporate existing EU laws into UK domestic law. In January 2017, she announced a 12-point plan of negotiating objectives and confirmed that the UK government would not seek continued membership in the single market. The terms of withdrawal have not yet been negotiated and in the meantime, the UK remains a full member of the European Union. \c\cThe UK joined the European Communities (EC), a predecessor of the EU, in 1973, and confirmed its membership in a 1975 referendum by 67% of the votes. Historical opinion polls 1973–2015 tended to reveal majorities in favour of remaining in the EEC, EC or EU. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EEC was advocated mainly by some Labour Party and trade union figures. From the 1990s, withdrawal from the EU was advocated mainly by some Conservatives and by the newly founded UK Independence Party (UKIP).
The 2016 South Korean political scandal (Korean: 최순실 게이트, Choi Soon-sil gate) involves the influence of Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a shaman-esque cult leader Choi Tae-min, over president Park Geun-hye. \c\cWidespread coverage of this South Korean political scandal began in late October 2016. \c\cOn November 29, Park offered to begin the process of removing herself from power. \c\cOn December 9, Park was impeached, and then Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn became the acting president. \c\cOn December 21, a Special Prosecution Team led by Park Young Soo began to investigate the Choi Soon-sil scandal. \c\cOn March 10, 2017, The Constitutional Court of Korea ruled to uphold the impeachment of President Park Geun-Hye. All 8 judges agreed that President Park abused her power. A new election will be held in 60 days.
A bridge collapsed on Interstate 85 (I-85) in the US city of Atlanta, Georgia, after a massive fire on the evening of March 30, 2017. After the collapse of the 100-foot-long (30 m) section, I-85 was closed to traffic between its split with I-75 and the interchange with State Route 400 (SR 400).
Severe Tropical Cyclone Debbie was the strongest tropical cyclone in the Australian region since Cyclone Quang in 2015. Cyclone Debbie was branded the most dangerous cyclone to impact Queensland since Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Forming as a tropical low on 23 March, the low gradually intensified to a named tropical cyclone on 26 March. After steadily strengthening offshore to a Category 4 system, Debbie eventually made landfall near Airlie Beach, just north of Proserpine, at around 14:00 AEST on 28 March. Afterwards, Debbie rapidly weakened into a tropical low by late on 28 March, but continued to travel south, causing significant damage and flooding in the populous areas of South East Queensland and Northern Rivers.

On the morning of 7 April 2017, during the Syrian Civil War, the United States launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea into Syria, aimed at the Syrian governments Shayrat Airbase. The strike was ordered by US President Donald Trump as a direct response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack on  April 4, 2017. \c\cThe strike was the first unilateral attack by the United States military to intentionally target Baathist Syrian government forces during the war. President Trump justified the strike by stating, "It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.". \c\cAssads forces were able to launch bombing raids against the rebels from the base only hours after the American attack. The ability to continue to use the base for these attacks has been attributed to the advance warning the US gave to Syrias ally, Russia, prior to the missile strike.
On 22 March 2017, a terrorist attack took place in the vicinity of the Palace of Westminster in London, seat of the British Parliament. The attacker, 52-year-old Briton Khalid Masood, drove a car into pedestrians on the pavement along the south side of Westminster Bridge and Bridge Street, injuring more than 50 people, four of them fatally. \c\cAfter the car crashed into the perimeter fence of the Palace grounds, Masood abandoned it and ran into New Palace Yard where he fatally stabbed an unarmed police officer. He was then shot by an armed police officer and died at the scene. The attack lasted 82 seconds. Police treated the attack as "Islamist-related". Islamic State claimed the attacker answered its calls to target citizens of states that are fighting against it, though their claim was disputed. Police later said that they had not determined his motive and had found no link with a terrorist organisation so far.
North Korea–United States relations (Korean: 북미관계; Hanja: 北美關係; RR: Bugmi gwangye) are hostile and have developed primarily during the Korean War, but in recent years have been largely defined by North Koreas five tests of nuclear weapons, its development of long-range missiles capable of striking targets thousands of miles away, and its ongoing threats to strike the United States and South Korea with nuclear weapons and conventional forces. During his presidency, George W. Bush referred to North Korea as part of "The Axis of evil" because of the threat of its nuclear capabilities. \c\cAs North Korea and the United States have no formal diplomatic relations, Sweden acts as the protecting power of United States interests in North Korea for consular matters. Since the Korean War, the United States has maintained a strong military presence in South Korea. \c\cIn 2015, according to Gallups annual World Affairs survey, only 9% of Americans have a favorable view of North Korea, while 87% of Americans have a negative view. According to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, only 4% of Americans view North Koreas influence positively with 90% expressing a negative view, one of the most negative perceptions of North Korea in the world.
On 11 April 2017, the tour bus of German football team Borussia Dortmund was attacked with roadside bombs in Dortmund, Germany. Three bombs exploded as the bus ferried the team to the Westfalenstadion for the first leg of their quarter-final against Monaco in the UEFA Champions League. One of the teams players and a policeman were wounded, but the strengthened windows of the bus prevented further casualties. \c\cThe initial line of inquiry was that was an Islamist terrorist attack due to letters found at the scene claimed the attack as retaliation for Muslims killed in the German military intervention against Islamic State, and threatened further attacks unless Germany withdraws and the US military base in Ramstein is shut. However, discrepancies in the evidence led investigators to consider it false flag attack, and on 21 April 2017 arrested a man on suspicion of planting bombs to drive down the Borussia Dortmund share price and profit by short-selling.
On the night of 14–15 April 2014, 276 female students were kidnapped from the Government Secondary School in the town of Chibok in Borno State, Nigeria. Responsibility for the kidnappings was claimed by Boko Haram, an extremist Islamic and terrorist organization based in northeastern Nigeria. 57 of the schoolgirls managed to escape over the next few months and some have described their capture in appearances at international human rights conferences. A child born to one of the girls and believed by medical personnel to be about 20 months old also was released, according to the Nigerian presidents office. \c\cSince then hopes were raised on various occasions that the 219 remaining girls might be released. Newspaper reports suggested that Boko Haram was hoping to use the girls as a negotiating pawns in exchange for some of their commanders in jail. \c\cIn May 2016, one of the missing girls, Amina Ali, was found. She claimed that the remaining girls were still there, but that six had died. A second girl was discovered later in the week, but parents have expressed doubts as her name is not among those originally missing. A further 21 girls were freed in October 2016, while another was rescued the next month. Another was found in January 2017. 82 more girls were freed in May 2017.
WannaCry (or WannaCrypt, WanaCrypt0r 2.0, Wanna Decryptor) is a ransomware program targeting Microsoft Windows. On Friday, 12 May 2017, a large cyber-attack using it was launched, infecting more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries, demanding ransom payments in bitcoin in 28 languages. The attack spreads by multiple methods include phishing emails and on unpatched systems as a computer worm. The attack has been described by Europol as unprecedented in scale. \c\cThe attack affected Telefónica and several other large companies in Spain, as well as parts of Britains National Health Service (NHS), FedEx, Deutsche Bahn and LATAM Airlines. Other targets in at least 99 countries were also reported to have been attacked around the same time. \c\cWannaCry is believed to use the EternalBlue exploit, which was developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to attack computers running Microsoft Windows operating systems. Although a patch to remove the underlying vulnerability for supported systems had been issued on 14 March 2017, delays in applying security updates and lack of support by Microsoft of legacy versions of Windows left many users vulnerable. Due to the scale of the attack, to deal with the unsupported Windows systems, Microsoft has taken the unusual step of releasing updates for all older unsupported operating systems from Windows XP onwards. \c\cShortly after the attack began a researcher found an effective kill switch, which prevented many new infections, and allowed time to patch systems. This greatly slowed the spread. It was later reported that a new version was detected which lacks the kill switch. Cybersecurity experts also warn of a second wave of the attack due to such variants and the beginning of the new workweek.
WannaCry, also known by the names WannaCrypt, WanaCrypt0r 2.0, Wanna Decryptor and other similar names, is a ransomware program targeting Microsoft Windows.

The WannaCry ransomware attack is an ongoing cyberattack of the WannaCry (or WannaCrypt, WanaCrypt0r 2.0, Wanna Decryptor) ransomware computer worm targeting the Microsoft Windows operating system. The attack started on Friday, 12 May 2017, infecting more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries, with the software demanding ransom payments in the cryptocurrency bitcoin in 28 languages.

Other targets in at least 99 countries were also reported to have been attacked around the same time. \c\cMost previous ransomware arrives by phishing emails, and this is alleged to be the case with WannaCry,  although there still arent any confirmations. However, once installed it uses the EternalBlue exploit and DoublePulsar backdoor developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to spread through local networks and remote hosts which have not installed recent security updates to directly infect any exposed systems. A "critical" patch had been issued by Microsoft on 14 March 2017 to remove the underlying vulnerability for supported systems, nearly two months before the attack, but many organizations had not yet applied it. \c\cThose still running exposed older, unsupported operating systems were initially at particular risk, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, but Microsoft has now taken the unusual step of releasing updates for these operating systems for all customers. \c\cShortly after the attack began a web security researcher who blogs as "MalwareTech" inadvertently established an effective kill switch by registering a website mentioned in the code of the ransomware. This slowed the spread of infection, but new versions have now been detected that lack the kill switch.
Wikimedia Foundation, et al. v. National Security Agency, et al. is a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation and several other organizations against the National Security Agency (NSA), the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), and other named individuals, alleging mass surveillance of Wikipedia users carried out by the NSA. The suit claims the surveillance system, which NSA calls "Upstream", breaches the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects freedom of speech, and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. \c\cThe suit is filed in the federal District Court for the District of Maryland; the NSA is based in Fort Meade, Maryland. \c\cThe plaintiffs are the Wikimedia Foundation, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International USA, the PEN American Center, the Global Fund for Women, The Nation magazine, the Rutherford Institute, and the Washington Office on Latin America.
Seth Conrad Rich (January 3, 1989 – July 10, 2016) was a 27-year-old employee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) who was fatally shot in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C. \c\cThe crime was used as the pretext for right-wing conspiracy theories, which have been debunked by law enforcement agencies in their official statements about the case. These theories falsely stated that there is credible evidence Rich was the source of the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak. According to U.S. intelligence assessments, Russian intelligence services are most likely responsible for the hacking and the leak. \c\cRichs parents have condemned the conspiracy theories and have urged members of the press to stop posting about the incident. They accused conspiracy theorists of politicizing their sons death for political gain, and called posters of the debunked conspiracy theories "sociopaths" and "disgusting". In a statement released by the family, they said the people who promote the conspiracy theories "are either blind to the damage they are doing to a murder victims family or dont care, showing a profound lack of judgment and common decency." Seth Richs parents have asked for a retraction and an apology from Fox News which spread the conspiracy theory, but have not received one. They also sent a "cease and desist" letter to Rod Wheeler, the investigator whom Fox News cited as a source, demanding that he stop making comments about Seth. \c\cMembers of the alt-right and certain commentators on Fox News, which has given air time to the conspiracy theories, have been accused of having done so in order to distract public attention from negative news about the Trump administration.
On 7 June 2017, a Shaanxi Y-8 aircraft of the Myanmar Air Force was reported missing on a flight from Myeik to Yangon. There were 106 people on board.
Attacks were carried simultaneously in the Iranian parliament and the Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini, shrine of Iran’s revolutionary founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on 7 June 2017. According to the semi-official Tasnim News Agency, one parliament guard was killed in the shooting, while several people were injured in the shrine attack, according to the report by the Fars agency.
James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was dismissed by U.S. President Donald Trump on May 9, 2017. Comey had been under public and political pressure as a result of both the FBIs role in the Hillary Clinton email controversy and the FBIs investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, which also involves a possible collusion with the 2016 Donald Trump campaign. In the termination letter, Trump wrote that Comey had told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. According to The Washington Post, sources stated that this and other assertions Trump made about events leading up to the dismissal were false, and Trump subsequently implied that he may have the conversations with Comey on tape. \c\cAfter the dismissal, Trump said that he had been considering the dismissal since the election, and had experienced an "erosion of confidence" because Comey was "not doing a good job", pointing to Comeys recent congressional testimony as problematic, and also basing the dismissal partly on a recommendation from the United States Department of Justice alleging that Comey had mishandled the investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server. These justifications were criticized by some Democrats and political commentators, and Trump later sought to further explain his decision to dismiss Comey, saying that Comey was a "showboat" and "grandstander", while Trump also indicated that the dismissal was connected to dissatisfaction with the counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the election. During a meeting on May 10 with two Russian officials, Trump boasted about firing Comey, describing Comey as "crazy, a real nut job" and saying to them that he (Trump) "faced great pressure because of  Russia . Thats  taken off.". \c\cAccording to Comey associates, Trump had asked Comey in January to pledge loyalty to him, to which Comey demurred, instead offering him "honesty", and when pressed further by Trump, "honest loyalty". Trump denied that he asked Comey for his loyalty, but says such a discussion would not necessarily have been inappropriate. Several sources within the FBI have stated that the White Houses firing of Comey was a culmination of high-level efforts to interfere in the Russia investigation.  Appearing before Congress two days after the dismissal, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified: "There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date", later adding "I cannot comment on any conversations that the Director may have had with the president". Comey has accepted an invitation from the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify at a public hearing. \c\cOn May 16, 2017, the New York Times reported on the existence of a memo written by Comey in February after a conversation with Trump, in which the FBI director described Trumps request that the FBI shut down the investigation into Trump associate Michael T. Flynn, who had resigned as National Security Adviser the previous day. The White House denied the allegation. Comey personally believes that the White House tried to get him to halt the investigation. \c\cComeys termination was controversial, with some comparing it to President Richard Nixons termination of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the 1973 Saturday Night Massacre, while Bob Woodward said the matter was not yet comparable to Watergate. On May 17, 2017 the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as Special Counsel to oversee the Russia investigation. On June 3, Rosenstein said he would recuse from supervision of Mueller, if he himself were to become a subject in the investigation due to his role in Comeys dismissal.
Relations between Ukraine and the European Union (EU) are currently shaped through the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), a foreign policy instrument of the EU designed for the countries it borders. \c\cThe EU is seeking an increasingly close relationship with Ukraine, going beyond co-operation, to gradual economic integration and deepening of political co-operation. Ukraine is a priority partner within the ENP. \c\cIn 2012, the EU initialled deals on free trade and political association with Ukraine; however, EU leaders stated that these agreements would not be ratified unless Ukraine addresses concerns over a "stark deterioration of democracy and the rule of law", including the imprisonment of Yulia Tymoshenko and Yuriy Lutsenko in 2011 and 2012. Deadlines were set for Ukraine to carry out the required changes to its justice and electoral systems in order to enable the formal signing of their agreements with the EU in Vilnius on 29 November 2013. But although the then Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had urged the Ukrainian parliament to adopt laws so that Ukraine could meet the EUs criteria, the Ukrainian government suspended preparations for signing the association agreement on 21 November 2013. Yanukovych still attended the aforementioned EU summit in Vilnius on 28–29 November 2013 where the association agreement was originally planned to be signed but it was not. The decision to put off signing the association agreement led to pro-EU Euromaidan movement. These led to the removal of Yanukovych and his government by parliament after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution in February 2014. Since then, Ukraine has been striving towards integration into the European Union whilst the eastern part of the county has been engaged in pro-Russian unrest, opposing the Euromaidan movement. \c\cThe political part of the Association Agreement was signed on 21 March 2014 by the new Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk. Meanwhile, the EU has attempted to stabilize Ukraine by freezing assets of allegedly corrupt Russians and Ukrainians and by granting financial aid to Ukraine. The economic part of the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement was signed on 27 June 2014 by the new President, Petro Poroshenko, who described this as Ukraines "first but most decisive step" towards EU membership. Poroshenko also set 2020 as a target for an EU membership application. On January 1, 2016, Ukraine joined the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the EU.
The Grenfell Tower fire is a large fire that started shortly before 01:00 BST (UTC +1) on 14 June 2017, at the 24-storey Grenfell Tower, a block of flats in North Kensington, West London. \c\cIt is being attended to by at least 200 firefighters and 45 fire engines, but the fire has not been contained. Residents of surrounding buildings have been evacuated out of fear the tower may collapse. \c\cIt was reported that people may have been trapped in the fire. Officials confirmed there were fatalities but they have not been able to determine how many have been killed.
The Grenfell Tower fire was a major fire at a 24-storey, 220-foot (67 m) high tower block of public housing flats in North Kensington, west London, England which started on 14 June 2017 resulting in a high number of casualties and severe damage to the building. The Metropolitan Police Service has said that five fatalities have been formally identified and a further 74 people are missing and presumed dead, bringing the presumed total number of fatalities to 79 – the deadliest fire in Great Britain since those caused by the Blitz, the air raids of World War II. \c\cEmergency services received the first report of the fire at 00:54 local time and it burned for around 24 hours until finally extinguished. Initially hundreds of firefighters and 45 fire engines were involved in efforts to control the fire, with many firefighters continuing to attempt to control pockets of fire on the higher floors after most of the rest of the building had been gutted. Residents of surrounding buildings were evacuated due to concerns that the tower could collapse, though the building was later determined to be structurally sound. \c\cThe tower contained 127 flats, with 227 bedrooms, at the time of the fire. Sixty-five people were rescued by firefighters. Seventy-four people were confirmed to be in five hospitals across London; 17 of them were in a critical condition. The searches had to be stopped for a time on 16 June 2017, as the building was thought to be unsafe, but rescuers were able to enter on 17 June 2017 and reached as far as the top floor. The fire started in a faulty fridge-freezer in a fourth-floor flat. The speed at which the fire spread is believed to have been aided by the buildings recently added exterior cladding. \c\cThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, criticised the safety guidelines, in particular, those telling people to stay in their flats until rescued by fire services. This advice assumed that fire services would be able to contain a fire within the buildings interior, which was impossible in this case as the fire was spreading rapidly via the buildings exterior. Since 2013, the residents' organisation, Grenfell Action Group, had repeatedly expressed concern about fire safety, and had warned the blocks management in November 2016 that only a catastrophic fire would finally force them to treat fire precautions and maintenance of fire-related systems properly. \c\cOn 16 June, Prime Minister Theresa May, who had faced criticism for failing to meet Grenfell Tower residents following the tragedy, announced a £5 million fund for victims of the fire; all those made homeless were to receive an initial down payment of £5,500, with each household to be given at least £500 in cash and £5,000 paid into an account. On 18 June the government announced that a dedicated new response team was taking over the management of the ongoing response to the disaster – acknowledging that the initial response by the state, both locally and nationally, was inadequate. On 21 June, the government announced that 68 new flats in the same borough as Grenfell Tower are to be made available to survivors of the fire.

The Hillsborough disaster was a human crush at Hillsborough football stadium in Sheffield, England on 15 April 1989, during the 1988–89 FA Cup semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. With 96 fatalities and 766 injured it is the worst disaster in British sporting history. The crush occurred in the two standing-only central pens in the Leppings Lane stand, allocated to Liverpool supporters. Shortly before kick-off, in an attempt to ease overcrowding outside the entrance turnstiles, the police match commander, chief superintendent David Duckenfield, ordered exit gate C to be opened, leading to an influx of even more supporters to the already overcrowded central pens. \c\cIn the days and weeks following the disaster, police fed false stories to the press suggesting that hooliganism and drinking by Liverpool supporters were the root causes of the disaster. Blaming of Liverpool fans persisted even after the Taylor Report of 1990, which found the main cause of the disaster was a failure of control by South Yorkshire Police (SYP). Following the Taylor report, the DPP ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution of individuals or institutions. The disaster also led to a number of safety improvements in the largest English football grounds, notably the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football. \c\cThe first coroners inquest into the Hillsborough disaster, completed in 1991, ruled all deaths on the day as accidental. Families strongly rejected the original coroners findings, and their fight to have the matter re-opened persisted, despite Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concluding in 1997 there was no justification for a new inquiry. Private prosecutions brought by the Hillsborough Families Support Group against Duckenfield and his deputy Bernard Murray failed in 2000. \c\cIn 2009, Hillsborough Independent Panel was formed to review all evidence. Reporting in 2012, it confirmed Taylors 1990 criticisms, while also revealing new details about the extent of police efforts to shift blame onto fans, the role of other emergency services, and the error of the first coroners inquest. The panel report resulted in the previous findings of accidental death being quashed, and the creation of a new coroners inquest. It also produced two criminal investigations led by police in 2012: Operation Resolve to look into the causes of the disaster, and an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to examine actions by police in the aftermath. \c\cThe second coroners inquest, was held from 1 April 2014 to 26 April 2016, its verdict was that the supporters were unlawfully killed due to grossly negligent failures by police and ambulance services to fulfil their duty of care to the supporters. The inquest also found that the design of the stadium contributed to the crush, and that supporters were not to blame for the dangerous conditions. Public anger over the actions of his force during the second inquest led the SYP chief constable David Crompton to be suspended following the verdict.

The Kingdom of Bhutan and the Peoples Republic of China do not maintain official diplomatic relations, and relations are historically tense. The PRC shares a contiguous border of 470 kilometres (km) with Bhutan to the north and its territorial disputes with Bhutan have also been a source of potential conflict. Since the 1980s, the two governments have conducted regular talks on border and security issues aimed at reducing tensions.

On Wednesday 21 June 2017 at 09:13am BST two occupants of a car were attacked with acid in Beckton in the London Borough of Newham. The victims were later named as Jameel Muhktar and his cousin and aspiring model Resham Khan. Their injuries were described as "life-changing".
The March for Justice was a 450 km march from Ankara to Istanbul to protest arrests that were made as part of the government crackdown that followed the July 2016 coup d'état attempt. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that the march is illegal. Counter-demonstrations have been held by Ak Parti supporters. The protest was led by opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu, to protest the lengthy prison sentence that Enis Berberoğlu received for allegedly giving the press a video that shows Turkish intelligence smuggling weapons into Syria. The march concluded in Istanbul on July 9 with a rally attended by hundreds of thousands of people.
The 2017 electronics ban refers to a controversial order issued by the United States government in March 2017 banning electronics beyond the size of a mobile phone on carry-on luggage for direct flights departing from 10 major airports in the Middle East and traveling to the United States, and requiring airlines to enforce this ban. The order was issued based on intelligence that the Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was planning on using batteries and compartments of large electronic equipment to conceal explosives that are not detectable by current aviation security scanners. The US government has been accused by the International Air Transport Association of implementing the ban more of as a protectionist measure to shield major US airlines from increasing competition of major airlines from the Middle East than for security reasons. The United Kingdom has issued a similar ban but covers a different range of airports and airlines, including low-cost airlines.
Following heavy rain in July 2017, Gujarat state of India was affected by the severe flood. As of 31 July, there were at least 213 deaths since 1 June due to rain related causes. 16 people died in neighbouring Rajasthan state.
On 12 August 2017, a suicide bombing took place near a Pakistan army truck in Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan leaving 15 people dead including 8 soldiers, while injuring 40 others. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the attack.
The GCI Great Alaska Shootout (originally known as the Sea Wolf Classic) is an annual college basketball tournament in Anchorage, Alaska that features colleges from all over the United States. The University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) hosts the tournament every Thanksgiving. Tournament games are played at the Alaska Airlines Center, a new arena on the UAA campus. Prior to the opening of the Alaska Airlines Center in September 2014, games were played at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage. Prior to the Sullivan Arena opening in 1983, games were played at Buckner Fieldhouse. The mens tournament, held annually since 1978, includes eight teams while the womens tournament, held annually since 1980, has four participants. \c\cUnder National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules, teams are normally limited to 28 regular-season games. However, games in "exempted events", traditionally played early in the season, are not counted against that limit. The most recent policy from the NCAA in this regard allows all teams to play in one exempted event per season. Those teams who choose to take advantage of that opportunity may play up to thirty-one games per season, including games played in those exempted events but excluding postseason tournament games. A previous incarnation of this rule allowed for all games played outside the United States mainland to be exempt from the (then) 27-game limit. This version of the rule was partially responsible for the genesis of tournaments such as the Great Alaska Shootout. \c\cThe mens tournament field has included at least one team which would qualify for the NCAA Division I tournament later in the season during each of its 36 editions. The 1985 field included an event record six teams that would go on to be invited to the NCAA Tournament. Five times the tournament field has included the defending NCAA Champion, most recently in 1996 when the University of Kentucky took part in the tournament. \c\cOn 26 August 2017, it was announced that the 2017 Shootout would be the last.
The 2017 Berkeley protests refer to a series of violent protests and clashes between organized groups that occurred in the city of Berkeley, California in the vicinity of the University of California campus. Violence has occurred predominantly between anti-Trump protesters, some of whom were anarchists, anti-fascists, and other far-left radicals; and alt-right radicals, white supremacists and Neo-Nazis and other supporters of Donald Trump, . \c\cThe first event occurred on February 1, when Trump supporter Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to give a speech at the university. Two later incidents on March 4 and April 15, were pro-Trump rallies met by counter-protesters. Another rally occurred on April 27, hosted by Kyle Chapman, Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern, and others at Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park. This was scheduled after a planned speech by Ann Coulter was cancelled.
The assassination of Benazir Bhutto took place on 27 December 2007 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Benazir Bhutto, twice Prime Minister of Pakistan (1988–1990; 1993–1996) and then-leader of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party, had been campaigning ahead of elections scheduled for January 2008. Shots were fired at her after a political rally at Liaquat National Bagh, and a suicide bomb was detonated immediately following the shooting. She was declared dead at 18:16 local time (13:16 UTC), at Rawalpindi General Hospital. Twenty-four other people were killed by the bombing. Bhutto had previously survived a similar attempt on her life that killed at least 139 people, after her return from exile two months earlier. \c\cThough early reports indicated that she had been hit by shrapnel or the gunshots, the Pakistani Interior Ministry initially stated that Bhutto died of a skull fracture sustained when the force of the explosion caused her head to strike the sunroof of the vehicle. Bhuttos aides rejected this version, and argued instead that she suffered two gunshots before the bomb detonation. The Interior Ministry subsequently backtracked from its previous claim. \c\cIn May 2007, Bhutto asked for additional protection from foreign contracting agencies Blackwater and the British firm Armor Group. The United Nations investigation of the incident revealed that, "Ms. Bhuttos assassination could have been prevented if adequate security measures had been taken."
Hurricane Harvey is an active tropical cyclone that is causing unprecedented and catastrophic flooding in southeastern Texas. It was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005, ending a record 12-year period with no hurricanes of Category 3 intensity or higher making landfall in the United States. In a four-day period, many areas received more than 40 inches (100 cm) of rain as the system meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters. With peak accumulations of 51.88 in (131.8 cm), Harvey is the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the contiguous United States. The resulting floods prompted more than 13,000 rescues, displaced more than 30,000 people, and inundated hundreds of thousands of homes. \c\cThe eighth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles, reaching tropical storm status on August 17. The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day, passing just south of Barbados and later near Saint Vincent. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia early on August 19. The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucatán Peninsula, before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August 23. Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24, regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day. While the storm moved generally northwest, Harveys intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August 24–25, however Harvey soon resumed strengthening and became a Category 4 hurricane late on August 25. Hours later, Harvey made landfall near Rockport, Texas, at peak intensity. \c\cHarvey has caused at least 39 (and counting) confirmed deaths; 1 in Guyana, and 38 in the United States. Catastrophic inland flooding is ongoing in the Greater Houston metropolitan area. FEMA director Brock Long called Harvey the worst disaster in Texas history, and expected the recovery to take many years. Preliminary estimates of economic losses range from $10 billion to $160 billion, with a large portion of losses sustained by uninsured homeowners.
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is an American immigration policy founded by the Obama administration in June 2012. DACA allows certain illegal immigrants who entered the country as minors to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and eligibility for a work permit. The program was formally rescinded by the Trump Administration in September 2017, but implementation was delayed by six months to give Congress time to come up with a solution for the population that was previously eligible for DACA.  . \c\cThe policy was created after acknowledgment that these students had been largely raised in the United States, and was seen as a way to remove immigration enforcement attention from "low priority" individuals with good behavior. The illegal immigrant student population was rapidly increasing; approximately 65,000 illegal immigrant students graduate from U.S. high schools on a yearly basis. In August 2012, the Pew Research Center estimated that up to 1.7 million people might be eligible. As of June 2016, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had received 844,931 initial applications for DACA status, of which 741,546 (88%) were approved, 60,269 (7%) were denied, and 43,121 (5%) were pending. Over half of those accepted reside in California and Texas. \c\cIn November 2014, Obama attempted to expand DACA.  However, in December 2014, Texas and 25 other states, all with Republican governors, sued in the District Court for the Southern District of Texas asking the court to enjoin implementation of both the DACA expansion and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (a similar program). In February 2015, Judge Andrew S. Hanen issued a preliminary injunction blocking the expansion from going into effect while the case, Texas v. United States, proceeds. After progressing through the court system, an equally divided (4-4) Supreme Court left the injunction in place, without setting any precedent. On June 16, 2017, the United States Department of Homeland Security announced that it would rescind the executive order by the Barack Obama administration that expanded the DACA program, though the DACA programs overall existence would continue to be reviewed. On September 5, 2017, the Trump Administration formally rescinded the program, but delayed implementation for six months to give Congress time to act. \c\cResearch shows that DACA increased the wages and labor force participation of DACA-eligible immigrants, reduced the number of unauthorized immigrant households living in poverty, and increased the mental health outcomes for DACA-eligible immigrants and their children.
The United States Intelligence Community has concluded with high confidence that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A January 2017 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) stated that Russian leadership preferred presidential candidate Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, and that Russian president Vladimir Putin personally ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Clintons electoral chances and "undermine public faith in the US democratic process.". \c\cOn October 7, 2016, the ODNI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) jointly stated that the U.S. Intelligence Community was confident that the Russian Government directed recent hacking of e-mails with the intention of interfering with the U.S. election process. According to the ODNI′s January 6, 2017 report, the  Russian military intelligence service (GRU) had hacked the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the personal Google email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and forwarded their contents to WikiLeaks.  Russian officials have repeatedly denied involvement in any DNC hacks or leaks.  In January 2017, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified that Russia also interfered in the elections by disseminating fake news that was promoted on social media. \c\cOn October 31, President Barack Obama warned Putin via the "red phone" to stop interfering or face consequences.  In December, Obama ordered a report on hacking efforts aimed at U.S. elections since 2008, while U.S. Senators called for a bipartisan investigation. President-elect Donald Trump initially rejected claims of foreign interference and said that Democrats were reacting to their election loss. On December 29, 2016, the U.S. expelled 35 Russian diplomats, denied access to two Russia-owned compounds, and broadened existing sanctions on Russian entities and individuals. \c\cSeveral investigations about Russian influence on the election have been underway: a counter-intelligence investigation by the FBI, hearings by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Intelligence Committee, and inquiries about possible links and financial ties between the Kremlin and Trump associates, notably targeting Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Roger Stone. On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, citing in part dissatisfaction with the ongoing suspicions of his presidency because of "this Russia thing". On May 17, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as Special Counsel to oversee the investigation.
On 7 September 2017, at 11:49 p.m. CDT, a magnitude 8.4 earthquake occurred off the coast of Chiapas, Mexico, approximately 87 kilometres (54 mi) south of Pijijiapan in the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The earthquake caused some buildings in Mexico City to shake, prompting people to evacuate. At least 26 people have died in total.  The earthquake also generated a tsunami with waves of 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) above tide level; tsunami alerts have been issued for surrounding areas. It was the strongest earthquake recorded in Mexico in a century as well as the second strongest recorded in the countrys history, behind the magnitude 8.6 earthquake in 1787. It is also the most intense recorded globally in 2017. \c\cOn 6 September, several earthquake alarms in Mexico City were mistakenly activated and prompted the evacuation of buildings. The incident prompted a review of the system.
The presidency of Donald Trump began at noon EST on January 20, 2017, when Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, succeeding Barack Obama. Trump, the Republican nominee, was a businessman and reality television personality from New York City at the time of his victory in the 2016 presidential election over the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. His running mate, former Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, took office as the 48th Vice President of the United States on the same day. Trumps term in office is set to end on January 20, 2021, though he is eligible for election to a second term and has declared his intention to run. \c\cAs of August 2017, Trump has issued 42 executive orders and 51 presidential memoranda. The executive orders 13769 and 13780 denying admission to the US of people from several foreign countries have been halted by federal courts, although the Supreme Court partially reinstated order 13780. Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 7, 2017.
Hurricane Irma is a powerful tropical cyclone that is currently impacting Cuba and is threatening the state of Florida as a major hurricane. It is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, and is tied with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin as well as the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma of 2005 in terms of maximum sustained winds, the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007, and the first of such intensity to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic since Felix in 2007. Irma is also the first Category 5 hurricane  on record to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at such an intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924. \c\cA typical Cape Verde hurricane, Irma developed on August 30 near the Cape Verde Islands from a tropical wave that had moved off the west African coast two days prior. It is the ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. Under favorable conditions, Irma rapidly intensified shortly after formation, becoming a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale within a mere 24 hours. It became a Category 3 hurricane (and therefore a major hurricane) shortly afterward; however, the intensity fluctuated for the next several days due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles. On September 5, Irma became a Category 5 hurricane, and by early the next day, Irma reached peak intensity with 185 mph (295 km/h) winds and a minimum pressure of 914 mbar (914 hPa; 27.0 inHg). This ties it as the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed, surpassed only by Allen of 1980 which reached wind speeds of 190 mph (305 km/h). Irma sustained these 185 mph (295 km/h) winds for 37 hours, surpassing Allens record, which had sustained 180 mph (285 km/h) winds for 18 hours. In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds ever on record. Irmas low pressure also makes it the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 so far. \c\cIt caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane. Irma was the strongest hurricane to strike the northern Leeward Islands and one of the worst storms to hit the region, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995. As of September 9, the hurricane has caused at least 25 deaths (two in Puerto Rico, one in Barbuda, ten in the French West Indies and two more on the Dutch side of Saint Martin).
The Sinai insurgency is an ongoing conflict between Islamist militants and Egyptian security forces in the Sinai Peninsula, which began after the start of the Egyptian Crisis, which saw the overthrow of longtime Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. \c\cThe Sinai insurgency initially consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group claimed allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and proclaimed themselves as the Sinai Province. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with Sinai Province and have blamed the porous border and ongoing civil war for the increase in sophisticated weapons available to the Islamist groups. \c\cThe Egyptian authorities have attempted to restore their presence in the Sinai through both political and military measures. Egypt launched two military operations, known as Operation Eagle in mid-2011 and then Operation Sinai in mid-2012. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup détat, which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred. \c\cThe fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share the same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services. Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. \c\cAdministratively, the Sinai Peninsula is divided into two governorates: the South Sinai Governorate and the North Sinai Governorate. Three other governorates span the Suez Canal, crossing into African Egypt: Suez Governorate on the southern end of the Suez Canal, Ismailia Governorate in the center, and Port Said Governorate in the north.
Zapad 2017 (Russian: «Запад-2017», Belarusian: Захад-2017) is a planned joint strategic military exercise of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and Belarus (the Union State) scheduled for 14—20 September 2017, to be held in Belarus as well as in  Russias Kaliningrad Oblast and other north-western areas. According to the information made public by the Defence Ministry of Belarus prior to the exercise, fewer than 13,000 personnel of the Union State are to take part in the military maneuvers, a number that does not trigger mandatory formal notification and invitation of observers under the OSCEs Vienna Document. Western analysts, however, believed in July 2017 that the total number of Russian troops, security personnel and civilian officials to be involved in the broader war-games will range from 60,000 to 100,000, which would make them Russias largest since the Cold War. Since 2016, concerns have been voiced in a number of NATO countries over Russias suspected ulterior motives and objectives in connection with the exercise. In early September 2017, the Warsaw-based Centre for Eastern Studies judged Zapad 2017 to have become "the core of an information war between Russia and NATO".
The planned end of mission for Cassini is disposal by a controlled fall into Saturns atmosphere on September 15, 2017. This method was chosen because it is imperative to ensure protection and prevent biological contamination of any of the moons of Saturn now thought to offer potentially habitable environments. Factors that can affect the mission end method are the amount of rocket fuel it has left, the health of the spacecraft, and funding for operations on Earth. \c\cSome possibilities for Cassinis later stages were aerobraking into orbit around Titan, leaving the Saturn system, or making close approaches and/or changing its orbit. For example, it could collect solar wind data in a heliocentric orbit.
The 2017 Puebla earthquake  struck at 13:14 CDT (18:14 UTC) on 19 September 2017 with a magnitude estimated to be Mw7.1 approximately 55 km (34 mi) south of Puebla. It has caused damage in the Mexican states of Puebla, Morelos and the Greater Mexico City area, including the collapse of over twenty buildings. \c\cThe quake occurred on the 32nd anniversary of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which killed about 10,000 people. The 1985 quake was commemorated on its anniversary with a national earthquake drill at 11 a.m. local time, two hours before the earthquake struck. At least 104 people have been killed by the earthquake.
Hurricane Maria is a powerful tropical cyclone which recently made landfall on Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale, and is currently threatening the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Leeward Islands, and the Dominican Republic. The thirteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, fourth major hurricane, and the second Category 5 hurricane of the unusually active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Maria formed on September 16 out of a tropical wave that was monitored by the National Hurricane Center since September 13. It is the third major hurricane in a row to threaten the Leeward Islands with a direct strike or major impacts within two weeks, after Hurricane Irma caused catastrophic damage there and Jose, then a Category 4 hurricane, passed dangerously close just days after. At 23:30 UTC on September 18, Maria had strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane, therefore making the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season the first since 2007 to feature two Category 5 hurricanes, and one of only six Atlantic hurricane seasons to feature two or more Category 5 hurricanes in the satellite era, as well as only the second (after 2007) to feature two hurricanes making landfall at Category 5 intensity. In addition, it is the tenth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record, and has the lowest pressure worldwide in 2017. At 10:35 UTC on September 20, Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), becoming the strongest to hit the territory since the 1928 San Felipe hurricane, as well as the most intense hurricane to hit the territory in recorded history, and the most intense to make landfall anywhere in the United States (including locations outside of the Lower 48) since Hurricane Camille in 1969. \c\cAs of September 19, the hurricane has caused at least nine deaths: seven in Dominica and two in Guadeloupe. Initial assessments indicate catastrophic damage to Dominica, which suffered an island-wide communication blackout. The islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique also endured widespread flooding, damaged roofs and uprooted trees.
Cuba and the United States restored diplomatic relations on 20 July 2015, which had been severed in 1961 during the Cold War. U.S. diplomatic representation in Cuba is handled by the United States Embassy in Havana, and there is a similar Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C. The United States, however, continues to maintain its commercial, economic, and financial embargo, which makes it illegal for U.S. corporations to do business with Cuba. Leaders in both houses of Congress as well as President Donald Trump support the embargo, although the Cuban government has called for it to be repealed. \c\cThe hold of the Spanish Empire on possessions in the Americas was reduced in the 1820s as a result of the Spanish American wars of independence; only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the Spanish–American War (1898) that resulted from the Cuban War of Independence. Under the Treaty of Paris, Cuba became a U.S. protectorate; the U.S. gained a position of economic and political dominance over the island, which persisted after it became formally independent in 1902. \c\cFollowing the Cuban Revolution of 1959, bilateral relations deteriorated substantially. In 1961, the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Cuba and began pursuing covert operations to topple the Communist regime. Moreover, the U.S. imposed and subsequently tightened a comprehensive set of restrictions and bans vis-à-vis the Cuban regime as retaliation for the nationalization of U.S. corporations property by Cuba. Meanwhile, several organizations, including a nearly unanimous United Nations General Assembly, have called for "an end to the United States decades-long economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba.". \c\cOn 17 December 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced the beginning of a process of normalizing relations between Cuba and the U.S., which media sources have named "the Cuban Thaw". Negotiated in secret in Canada and Vatican City over preceding months, and with the assistance of Pope Francis, the agreement led to the lifting of some U.S. travel restrictions, fewer restrictions on remittances, U.S. banks access to the Cuban financial system, and the establishment of a U.S. embassy in Havana, which closed after Cuba became closely allied with the USSR in 1961. The countries respective "interests sections" in one anothers capitals were upgraded to embassies on 20 July 2015. On 20 March 2016, President Barack Obama visited Cuba, becoming the first President in 88 years to visit the island. \c\cOn June 16, 2017 President Donald Trump announced that he was suspending the policy for unconditional sanctions relief for Cuba, while also leaving the door open for a "better deal" between the US and Cuba. \c\cTo today, no Cuban American can receive Cuban citizenship. They are required to use an American passport since they are not Cuban Citizens.
North Korea–South Korea relations (Korean: 남북 관계; Hanja: 南北關係; RR: Nambuk gwan-gye; MR: Nambuk kwan'gye) are the political, commercial, diplomatic, and military interactions between North Korea and South Korea. These interactions extend from the division of Korea in 1945 following World War II to today. The 1950–1953 Korean War and the subsequent Korean conflict are major factors impacting the efforts to achieve peace and Korean reunification. \c\cAccording to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, 3% of South Koreans view North Koreas influence positively, with 91% expressing a negative view, making South Korea, after Japan, the country with the most negative feelings of North Korea in the world. However, a 2014 government-funded survey found only 13% of South Koreans viewed North Korea as hostile, and 58% of South Koreans believed North Korea was a country they should cooperate with. \c\cAccording to a 2017 Korea Institute for National Unification, 57.9% of South Korean citizens had responded that unification is necessary. The number had declined as 62.1% of South Korean citizens thought unification is necessary in 2016. Among the respondents of 2017 survey, 13.8% said 'we really need unification' while 44% said 'we kind of need the unification'. Regarding the survey question of 'Do we still need unification even if ROK and DPRK could peacefully coexist?', 46% agreed and 31.7% disagreed. \c\cAt the start of 2018, following Kim Jong-uns New Year message of lowering military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and improving ties with the South, relationship between the two countries has seen major diplomatic breakthrough. On 2 Jan 2018, South Korea formally invited North Korea to 2018 Winter Olympics and offered high level talks to discuss about its participation on 9 Jan 2018, which the latter accepted. On 3 Jan 2018, North Korea reopened a border hotline with South Korea, restoring a channel of direct dialogue and signaling a possible thaw in relations.

The Slender Man stabbing occurred on Saturday, May 31, 2014, in the American city of Waukesha in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, when 12-year-olds Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser lured 12-year-old Payton Leutner into the woods and stabbed her 19 times in an attempt to impress the fictional character Slender Man. After being stabbed, the victim crawled to a road and lay on a sidewalk where a cyclist found her and called 9-1-1. She was rushed to a hospital, at which point she was "one millimeter away from certain death", according to a criminal complaint. The victim recovered after being hospitalized for six days. During the resultant legal proceedings, both perpetrators were ultimately found not guilty by reason of insanity. Weier was committed to 25 years in a state mental institute while Geyser was sentenced to 40 years in a mental institution.

London City Airport (IATA: LCY, ICAO: EGLC) is an international airport in London, United Kingdom. It is located in the Royal Docks in the London Borough of Newham, approximately 6 NM (11 km; 6.9 mi) east of the City of London and a shorter distance east of Canary Wharf. These are the twin centres of Londons financial industry, which is a major user of the airport. The airport was developed by the engineering company Mowlem in 1986–87. In 2016 it was bought by a Canadian-led consortium of Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), OMERS, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and Wren House Infrastructure Management of the Kuwait Investment Authority. \c\cLondon City Airport has a single 1,500-metre (4,900 ft) long runway, and a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P728) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flight training (but only for training necessary for the operation of aircraft at the airport). Only multi-engine, fixed-wing aircraft with special aircraft and aircrew certification to fly 5.5° approaches are allowed to conduct operations at London City Airport. The largest aircraft which can be used at the airport is the Bombardier CS100. \c\cLondon City served over 4.3 million passengers in 2015, an 18% increase compared with 2014. This was the largest percentage growth among London airports, and a record total for London City. It was the fifth-busiest airport in passengers and aircraft movements serving the London area—after Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton—and the 13th-busiest in the UK.
A sexual abuse scandal involving mainly young male English victims was revealed in mid-November 2016 when former professional footballers waived their rights to anonymity and talked publicly about child sexual abuse by former football coaches in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. \c\cEchoing similar revelations in the 1990s, the initial 2016 allegations centred on abuse of young players at Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City due to the clubs' associations with Barry Bennell (previously convicted of sexual abuse offences in the UK and US), who in February 2018 became the first person charged, tried and convicted of new offences of historical sexual abuse. Allegations were also made against a former Newcastle United youth coach George Ormond (imprisoned in 2002 for offences against young footballers in the area and, in July 2017, facing 35 new charges) and a former scout, Eddie Heath, at Chelsea, together with allegations that both clubs tried to cover up the abuse. Bob Higgins, a coach at Southampton and Peterborough, was also the subject of allegations, and, in July 2017, was charged with 65 offences. \c\cIn early December 2016, allegations about former youth coaches and scouts in Northern Ireland and Scotland also started to emerge (with some individuals, including three associated with Celtic Boys Club, charged with new offences in 2017). By mid December, in response to allegations from 350 individuals, the Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, several football clubs and over 20 UK police forces had established various inquiries and investigations. By 28 September 2017, the number of affected clubs had grown to 331, with 285 identified suspects and 784 alleged victims, arising from 2,028 referrals.

The 2018 NRA boycott is a social media activism campaign, started in February 2018, in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, calling for corporations and companies in the United States to sever ties with the National Rifle Association (NRA). \c\cOn February 20, 2018, ThinkProgress asked over two dozen corporations offering discounts to NRA members whether they would continue their relationships with the NRA. Several companies terminated their agreements with the NRA, and their announcements went viral, along with hashtags such as #BoycottNRA, started by activists like Michael Skolnik. First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately held bank in the United States, announced that it will not renew its deal for the “official credit card of the NRA.”. \c\cGuns Down America started a petition asking FedEx to pull out of the NRAs Business Alliance. Activists also created the hashtag #stopNRAmazon asking Amazon to discontinue streaming programs from NRATV, the NRAs online video channel, an initiative supported by celebrities like Alyssa Milano, Denis O’Hare, Evan Handler and Misha Collins. \c\cCompanies that have severed ties with the NRA as of February 24, 2018 include: . \c\cAlamo Rent a Car. \c\cAvis. \c\cAllied Van Lines. \c\cBest Western. \c\cBlackRock. \c\cBudget. \c\cChubb Limited. \c\cDelta Air Lines. \c\cEnterprise Rent-a-Car. \c\cFirst National Bank of Omaha. \c\cHertz. \c\cMetLife. \c\cNorth American Van Lines. \c\cSimpliSafe. \c\cSymantec. \c\cTrueCar. \c\cUnited Airlines. \c\cWyndham Hotel Group
The Nunes memo (formally titled Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Abuses at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) is a four-page memorandum written by Republican staff members of U.S. Representative Devin Nunes and released to the public by the Republican controlled House Intelligence Committee on February 2, 2018. The memo alleges illegality and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) "may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources" to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant in October 2016 and in three subsequent renewals on Trump adviser Carter Page in the early phases of the FBIs investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. \c\cNunes is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a supporter of FISA surveillance extension. In April 2017, Nunes stepped aside from chairing the House Intelligence Committees Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee conducted an inquiry into possible ethics violation involving his secret coordination with the White House. He then began his own secret parallel investigation. The Ethics Committee investigation ended in December 2017, and Nunes later claimed he had never recused. \c\cRepublican legislators favoring public release of the memo argued that the memo contains evidence that the FISA warrant process was misused by FBI employees to sabotage the Donald Trump presidency. They alleged there was excessive dependence on allegations in the Trump–Russia dossier in obtaining a warrant from the FISA court. Political allies of Donald Trump attempted to use the memo to pivot attention away from the Special Counsel investigation of the Trump presidential campaigns role in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.  Prior to release of the memo, sources reported that Trump told his associates that release of the memo would discredit the investigation. \c\cA social media campaign, under the hashtag #ReleaseTheMemo, emerged in mid-January 2018 to publicly release the memo despite some of its classified contents. Journalist and national security advocacy groups reported that Russian-linked bots on Twitter helped spread the controversial hashtag. \c\cTrump approved release of the Republican document over the objections of law enforcement and the U.S. Intelligence Community. The FBI issued a rare statement expressing "grave concerns" about factual omissions and the accuracy of the memo. Within Congress, anticipation of the release of the memo sparked controversy, mainly along political lines. House Republicans released the memo on February 2, 2018. \c\cDemocrats on the House Intelligence Committee prepared a classified 10 page rebuttal of claims in the Nunes memo, which was initially blocked for release. After the Nunes memo was released to the public, the House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously to release the Democrats memo. On February 9, Trump blocked release of the Democrats memo, suggesting the committee revise sensitive material before release. A redacted version of the Democratic memo was finally released on February 24.
5th generation wireless systems, abbreviated 5G, are improved networks deploying in 2018 and later. Which technologies should be called "5G" is disputed. In addition to IMT, millimeter wave bands (26, 28, 38, and 60 GHz.) and Massive MIMO (64-256 antennas) have laid claim to also be 5G.  "Low-band 5G" uses frequencies from 600 MHz. \c\cMost large mobile networks are testing all three. Verizon and AT&T announced millimeter wave commercial deployments for 2018. Softbank deployed Massive MIMO beginning in 2016. In 2018 T-Mobile announced low band 5G for 30 cities. \c\cMillimeter wave 5G offers higher capacity than 4G and lower latency. Qualcomm estimates millimeter wave median speeds of 1.4 gigabits and low band speeds of 490 megabits. \c\cAs of 2017, development of 5G is being led by several companies, including Samsung, Intel, Qualcomm, Nokia, Huawei, Ericsson, ZTE and others. Although 5G is planned to be commercially available world-wide by 2020, South Korea, with the technical support from Samsung, KT Corporation, and Intel, has successfully launched 5G in 2018 Winter Olympics Pyeongchang for the visitors.
The Russian government interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in order to increase political instability in the United States and to damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by bolstering the candidacies of Donald J. Trump, Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein. A January 2017 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) stated that Russian leadership favored presidential candidate Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, and that Russian president Vladimir Putin personally ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Clintons electoral chances and "undermine public faith in the US democratic process.". \c\cOn October 7, 2016, the ODNI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) jointly stated that the U.S. Intelligence Community was confident that the Russian Government directed recent hacking of e-mails with the intention of interfering with the U.S. election process. According to the ODNI′s January 6, 2017 report, the Russian military intelligence service (GRU) had hacked the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the personal Google email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and forwarded their contents to WikiLeaks. Although Russian officials have repeatedly denied involvement in any DNC hacks or leaks, there is strong forensic evidence linking the DNC breach to known Russian operations. In January 2017, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified that Russia also interfered in the elections by disseminating fake news that was promoted on social media. \c\cOn October 31, 2016, President Barack Obama warned Putin via the "red phone" to stop interfering or face consequences.  In December 2016, Obama ordered a report on hacking efforts aimed at U.S. elections since 2008, while U.S. Senators called for a bipartisan investigation. President-elect Donald Trump rejected claims of foreign interference and said that Democrats were reacting to their election loss. On December 29, 2016, the Obama Administration expelled 35 Russian diplomats, denied access to two Russia-owned compounds, and broadened existing sanctions on Russian entities and individuals. \c\cSeveral investigations about Russian influence on the election have been underway: a counter-intelligence investigation by the FBI, hearings by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Intelligence Committee, and inquiries about possible links and financial ties between the Kremlin and Trump associates, notably targeting Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Roger Stone. On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, citing in part dissatisfaction with the ongoing suspicions of his presidency because of "this Russia thing". On May 17, Deputy Attorney General, and Acting Attorney General for this investigation, Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as Special Counsel to oversee the investigation. \c\cIn February 13, 2018 testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, the heads of the top six American intelligence agencies unanimously reaffirmed Russian interference. Three sources familiar with Trumps thinking told CNN he remains unconvinced that Russia interfered because it suggests he didnt win the election solely on his own merits.
The Panama Papers are 11.5 million leaked documents that detail financial and attorney–client information for more than 214,488 offshore entities. The documents, some dating back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source. \c\cThe documents contain personal financial information about wealthy individuals and public officials that had previously been kept private. While offshore business entities are legal (see Offshore Magic Circle), reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, including fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions. \c\c"John Doe", the whistleblower who leaked the documents to German journalist Bastian Obermayer from the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ), remains anonymous, even to the journalists who worked on the investigation. "My life is in danger", he told them. In a May 6 statement, John Doe cited income inequality as the reason for his action, and said he leaked the documents "simply because I understood enough about their contents to realise the scale of the injustices they described". He added that he had never worked for any government or intelligence agency and expressed willingness to help prosecutors if granted immunity from prosecution. After SZ verified that the statement did in fact come from the source for the Panama Papers, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) posted the full document on its website. \c\cSZ asked the ICIJ for help because of the amount of data involved. Journalists from 107 media organizations in 80 countries analyzed documents detailing the operations of the law firm. After more than a year of analysis, the first news stories were published on April 3, 2016, along with 150 of the documents themselves. The project represents an important milestone in the use of data journalism software tools and mobile collaboration. \c\cThe documents were dubbed the Panama Papers because of the country they were leaked from; however, the Panamanian government expressed strong objections to the name, as did other entities in Panama and elsewhere. Some media outlets covering the story have used the name "Mossack Fonseca papers".
On 4 March 2018, Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in Salisbury, England, with what the Government of the United Kingdom concluded to be a Novichok nerve agent. As of 15 March 2018, the pair remain critically ill at Salisbury District Hospital, and an investigating police officer is also seriously ill. So far, 38 people have been identified by UK intelligence officials as having been affected by the nerve agent. \c\cOn 14 March 2018, the British government accused the Russian Federation of attempted murder and announced punitive measures against Russia without providing any evidence to support its accusations. The United Kingdom received support from the United States and its other allies. Russia denied the accusations. \c\cIn the 1990s, Sergei Skripal was an officer for Russias Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), and worked as a double agent for the UKs Secret Intelligence Service from 1995 until his arrest in Moscow in December 2004. In 2006, he was convicted of treason and sentenced to 13 years in a penal colony. He settled in the UK in 2010 following the Illegals Program spy swap. Yulia Skripal is a Russian citizen visiting her father from Moscow, and Sergei is a British citizen.
There are no formal diplomatic relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States of America. Pakistan serves as Irans protecting power in the United States, while Switzerland serves as Americas protecting power in Iran. Contacts are carried out through the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy in Tehran. \c\cRelations between the two nations began in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. Initially, while Iran was very wary of British and Russian colonial interests during The Great Game, the United States was seen as a more trustworthy foreign power, and the Americans Arthur Millspaugh and Morgan Shuster were even appointed treasurers-general by the Shahs of the time. During World War II, Iran was invaded by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, both US allies, but relations continued to be positive after the war until the later years of the government of Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was overthrown by a coup organized by the Central Intelligence Agency and aided by the MI6. This was followed by an era of very close alliance and friendship between Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavis regime and the U.S. government, which was in turn followed by a dramatic reversal and disagreement between the two countries after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. During this era, Iran was one of the United States' closest allies. \c\cOpinions differ over what has caused the cooling in relations. Iranian explanations include everything from the natural and unavoidable conflict between the Islamic Revolution on the one hand, and perceived American arrogance and desire for global hegemony on the other. Other explanations include the Iranian governments need for an external bogeyman to furnish a pretext for domestic repression against pro-democratic forces and to bind the government to its loyal constituency. \c\cSince 1995, the United States has had an embargo on trade with Iran. In 2015 the United States led successful negotiations for a nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA) intended to dismantle Irans nuclear weapons capabilities, and when Iran complied in 2016, sanctions on Iran were lifted. \c\cAccording to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 5% of Americans view Iranian influence positively, with 87% expressing a negative view, the most unfavorable perception of Iran in the world. On the other hand, research has shown that most Iranians hold a positive attitude about the American people, though not the U.S. government. Relations tend to improve when the two countries have overlapping goals, such as repelling Sunni militants.
China–North Korea relations (Chinese: 中朝关系, zhōngcháo guānxi Korean: 조중 관계, chojung kwangye) are bilateral between China and North Korea. \c\cChina maintains an embassy in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang and a consulate general in Chongjin. The Embassy of North Korea in China is located in Beijings Chaoyang District, while a consulate general is in Shenyang. \c\cChina and North Korea have, in the past, enjoyed close diplomatic relations. However, China–North Korea relations have declined markedly over the past few years. The decline in China–North Korea relations is primarily due to growing concern in China over issues such as North Koreas impoundment of Chinese fishing boats and more importantly nuclear weapons program. \c\cFavorable views of North Korea among Chinese people appear to be receding as well. According to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, 20% of Chinese people view North Koreas influence positively, with 46% expressing a negative view.
The Manchester Arena bombing was an Islamist terror attack in Manchester, United Kingdom. On 22 May 2017, a shrapnel-laden homemade bomb was detonated as people were leaving Manchester Arena following a concert by the American singer Ariana Grande. Twenty-three people were killed, including the attacker, and over 500 were injured. After initial suspicions of a terrorist network, police later said they believed the bomber, Salman Ramadan Abedi, had largely acted alone but that others had been aware of his plans.
On 25 March 2018 at 17:00 local time (10:00 UTC), a fire at the Winter Cherry complex mall in Kemerovo, Russia, killed at least 64 people according to official statements. The blaze started somewhere on the top floor of the four-story complex, and people were seen jumping from windows to escape it. 100 people were evacuated, and another 20 were rescued. Others claim the number of people killed in fire is being covered up, and that the real figures run into the hundreds.
On 4 March 2018, former Russian military intelligence officer and British spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal were poisoned in Salisbury, England, with a Novichok nerve agent, according to official UK sources. As of 26 March 2018, Sergei remained critically ill in hospital and doctors have indicated that he may never fully recover; Yulia, shortly afterwards, was conscious again and able to speak. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey was also in intensive care after becoming contaminated when he went to Sergei Skripals house. By 22nd March he had recovered enough to leave the hospital. An additional 46 people sought medical advice after the attack, but none required treatment. \c\cIn the 1990s, Sergei Skripal was an officer for Russias Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) and worked as a double agent for the UKs Secret Intelligence Service from 1995 until his arrest in Moscow in December 2004. He was convicted of high treason and sentenced to 13 years in a penal colony by a Russian court in 2006. He settled in the UK in 2010 following the Illegals Program spy swap. Sergei is a British citizen; Yulia is a Russian citizen, and was visiting her father from Moscow. According to former FSB officer Boris Karpichkov who fled to the UK in 1998, Skripal was included by the Russian FSB into a hit list, along with him, Oleg Gordievsky, William Browder and Christopher Steele. \c\cLater in March, the British government accused Russia of attempted murder and announced diplomatic sanctions against Russia, including the expulsion of diplomats accused of being intelligence agents. The UKs official assessment of the incident was supported by its allies, which also took the measure of expelling Russian diplomats. Russia denied the accusations and responded in kind to the expulsions and accused Britain of poisoning its former agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter.

On January 12, 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Donald Trumps personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid pornographic actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money in October 2016, shortly before the presidential election, to deny she had an affair with Trump in 2006. Cohen denied the existence of an affair on behalf of his client, Trump, but later acknowledged having paid Daniels $130,000 out of his own money. \c\cOn March 6, 2018, Daniels filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump claiming that the nondisclosure agreement she had signed regarding the alleged affair was invalid because Trump had never personally signed it. The suit also alleges that Trumps attorney has been trying to intimidate Daniels and "scare her into not talking". A day after, Cohen initiated a private arbitration process which resulted in an order barring Daniels from disclosing "confidential information" related to the nondisclosure agreement. The order itself, which Daniels lawyers called bogus, was supposed to remain confidential. \c\cIn a March 25, 2018, interview with 60 Minutes, Daniels said that she and Trump had sex once, and that later she had been threatened in front of her infant daughter, and felt pressured to later sign a nondisclosure agreement.
The Inn Din massacre was a mass execution of Rohingyas by the Myanmar Army and armed Rakhine locals in the village of Inn Din, in Rakhine State, Myanmar on 2 September 2017. The victims were suspected of being members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) by authorities. This was the first instance where Myanmars security forces admitted to extrajudicial killings during their "clearance operations" in the region.

Threatened fauna of Australia are those species and subspecies of birds, fish, frogs, insects, mammals, molluscs, crustaceans and reptiles to be found in Australia that are in danger of becoming extinct. This list is the list proclaimed under the Australian federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The classifications are based on those used by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), however IUCN and Australian rankings do differ.

He was convicted of high treason and sentenced to 13 years in a penal colony by a Russian court in 2006. He settled in the UK in 2010 following the Illegals Program spy swap. Sergei holds dual Russian and British citizenship; Yulia is a Russian citizen, and was visiting her father from Moscow. \c\cLater in March, the British government accused Russia of attempted murder and announced a series of punitive measures against Russia, including the expulsion of diplomats. The UKs official assessment of the incident was supported by 28 other countries which responded similarly. Altogether an unprecedented 153 Russian diplomats were expelled. Russia denied the accusations and responded in kind to the expulsions and accused Britain of poisoning its former agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter.
On 4 March 2018, former Russian military intelligence officer and British spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal were poisoned in Salisbury, England, with a Novichok nerve agent, according to official UK sources. After three weeks in a critical condition, Yulia regained consciousness and was able to speak. Sergei was in a critical condition until he regained consciousness one month after the attack. \c\cA police officer was also taken into intensive care after being contaminated when he went to Sergei Skripals house. By 22 March he had recovered enough to leave the hospital.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in Portugal have improved substantially in the past decade and are now among the best in the world. After a long period of oppression during the Salazar dictatorship, Portuguese society has become increasingly accepting of homosexuality, which was decriminalized in 1983, eight years after the Carnation Revolution. Portugal has wide-ranging anti-discrimination laws and is one of the few countries in the world to contain a ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation in Article 13 of its Constitution. Since 5 June 2010, the state became the eighth in the world to recognize same-sex marriage. On 1 March 2011, the President ratified the Law of Gender Identity, said to be the most advanced in the world, which simplifies the process of sex and name change for transgender people. Same-sex adoption has been legal since 1 March 2016.
Since 1949, a series of armed skirmishes and firefights have occurred along the Durand Line (the Afghanistan–Pakistan border) between the Afghan National Security Forces and the Pakistan Armed Forces. The latest hostilities, which are ongoing, began with the overthrow of the Taliban government.
The cinema of Saudi Arabia is a fairly small industry that only produces a few feature films and documentaries every year. \c\cWith the exception of one IMAX theater in Khobar by Khalid there are no cinemas in Saudi Arabia, although there is occasionally talk of opening movie theaters, and in 2008 conference rooms were rented to show the comedy Mennahi. Saudis wishing to watch films have done so via satellite, DVD, or video. Cinemas had been banned for 35 years until the first cinema in Saudi Arabia opened on 18 April 2018 in Riyadh. AMC Theatres plans to open up to 40 cinemas in some 15 Saudi cities over the following five years. \c\cKeif al-Hal?, released in 2006, was billed as Saudi Arabias first film; however, it was shot in the United Arab Emirates and the lead female was played by a Jordanian. The 2012 film Wadjda had an all-Saudi cast and was the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia. The film Barakah Yoqabil Barakah by director Mahmoud Sabbagh was shot in Jeddah in 2015, premiered the 66th Berlin International Film Festival, making it the first feature film to participate in the festival. Sameera Aziz is the first Saudi filmmaker in famous Indian cinema Bollywood. \c\cCinema of Saudi Arabia, both locally produced or foreign-sourced is subject to strict Saudi censorship.
The Inn Din massacre was a mass execution of Rohingyas by the Myanmar Army and armed Rakhine locals in the village of Inn Din, in Rakhine State, Myanmar on 2 September 2017. The victims were suspected of being members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) by authorities. This was the first instance where Myanmars security forces admitted to extrajudicial killings during their "clearance operations" in the region.

Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 (WN1380, SWA1380) is a regularly scheduled United States domestic passenger multi-city flight operating from New York-LaGuardia Airport to San Francisco with intermediate stops in Dallas, New Orleans, Oakland, Reno, and Las Vegas. At approximately 11:03 a.m. EDT on April 17, 2018, on the first segment of the flight, the #1 (port-side) engine of the twin-engine Boeing 737-700 operating the route explosively failed. The pressurized aircraft fuselage was breached and it experienced rapid depressurization. The pilots quickly brought the aircraft to a lower altitude, diverted and made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport at about 11:20 a.m. \c\cThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that the aircraft may have experienced an in-flight uncontained engine failure; however, an official determination has not yet been made. There was one fatality confirmed by the NTSB.
Stephen Lawrence (13 September 1974 – 22 April 1993) was a Black British man from Plumstead, south east London, who was murdered in a racially motivated attack while waiting for a bus in Well Hall, Eltham on the evening of 22 April 1993. The case became a cause célèbre and one of the highest profile racial killings in UK history; its fallout included profound cultural changes to attitudes on racism and the police, and to the law and police practice, and the partial revocation of double jeopardy laws, before two of the perpetrators were convicted in 2012. \c\cAfter the initial investigation, five suspects were arrested but not convicted. It was suggested during the course of that investigation that the murder was racially motivated and that Lawrence was killed because he was black, and that the handling of the case by the police and Crown Prosecution Service was affected by issues of race. A public inquiry was held in 1998, headed by Sir William Macpherson, which examined the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation and concluded that the force was institutionally racist. It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence: this became law in 2005 with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The publication in 1999 of the resulting Macpherson Report has been called "one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain". Jack Straw, Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001, commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was "the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary". In 2010 the case was described as being "one of the highest-profile unsolved racially-motivated murders". \c\cOn 18 May 2011, following a cold case review, it was announced that two of the original suspects, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were to stand trial for the murder in the light of "new and substantial evidence" becoming available. At the same time it was disclosed that Dobsons original acquittal had been quashed by the Court of Appeal, allowing a retrial to take place. Such an appeal had only become possible following the 2005 change in the law, although Dobson was not the first person to be retried for murder as a result. On 3 January 2012, Dobson and Norris were found guilty of Lawrences murder; the pair were juveniles at the time of the crime and were sentenced to detention at Her Majestys pleasure, equivalent to a life sentence for an adult, with minimum terms of 15 years 2 months and 14 years 3 months respectively for what the judge described as a "terrible and evil crime". \c\cIn the years after Dobson and Norris were sentenced, the case again regained prominence when concerns of corrupt police conduct during the original case handling surfaced in the media. Such claims had surfaced before, and been investigated in 2006, but were reignited in 2013 when a former undercover police officer stated in an interview that at the time, he had been pressured to find ways to "smear" and discredit the victims family, to mute and deter public campaigning for better police responses to the case. Although further inquiries in 2012 by both Scotland Yard and the Independent Police Complaints Commission had ruled that there was no basis for further investigation, Home Secretary Theresa May ordered an independent inquiry by a prominent QC into undercover policing and corruption, which was described as "devastating" when published in 2014. An inquiry into whether members of the police force shielded the alleged killers was set up in October 2015.
Iran-Morocco relations have often been tarred by disputes. On several occasions Iran and Morocco have mostly or completely severed diplomatic relations. \c\cIran cut off all diplomatic ties with Rabat in 1981. This was in response to King Hassan IIs decision to give asylum to the exiled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.  It was almost a decade before relations would thaw enough to renew ties. It was almost one decade after that before Abderrahmane Youssoufi, Prime Minister of Morocco at the time, would lead the first Moroccan delegation to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Economic ties increased greatly in recent times. \c\cOn 6 March 2009, King Mohammed VI of Morocco severed diplomatic ties with Iran, offering several reasons.  Moroccos Foreign Ministry said in a press release on Friday that Morocco has cut its diplomatic ties with Iran following Tehrans critical remarks over Bahrain;  It also cited that Iran spreading its Shi’ite brand of Islam in Sunni Morocco was interfering in Moroccos domestic affairs. \c\cOn February 2014, the two countries said they were re-establishing diplomatic ties.  In 2 May 2018 however, Morocco cuts its diplomatic ties again with Iran. According to Morrocan foreign affair minister, the decision was taken because Iran provided financial and logistical support to secesionist movement Polisario through its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah.
The Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: Nobelpriset i litteratur) has been awarded annually, since 1901, to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced "in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction" (original Swedish: den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here "work" refers to an authors work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. \c\cAlthough the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the worlds most prestigious literature prize, the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read. The prize has "become widely seen as a political one - a peace prize in literary disguise", whose judges are prejudiced against authors with different political tastes to them. Tim Parks has expressed skepticism that it is possible for "Swedish professors ..  compar a poet from Indonesia, perhaps translated into English with a novelist from Cameroon, perhaps available only in French, and another who writes in Afrikaans but is published in German and Dutch...". As of 2016, 16 of the 113 recipients have been of Scandinavian origin. The Academy has often been alleged to be biased towards European, and in particular Swedish, authors. Some, such as Indian academic Sabaree Mitra, have noted that, though the Nobel Prize in Literature is significant and tends to overshadow other awards, it is "not the only benchmark of literary excellence.". \c\cNobels "vague" wording for the criteria for the prize has led to recurrent controversy. In the original Swedish, the word idealisk translates as either "idealistic" or "ideal". The Nobel Committees interpretation has varied over the years. In recent years, this means a kind of idealism championing human rights on a broad scale.
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA; Persian: برنامه جامع اقدام مشترک, romanized: barnāme jāme‘ eqdām moshtarak, acronym: برجام BARJAM), known commonly as the Iran deal or Iran nuclear deal, is an international agreement on the nuclear program of Iran reached in Vienna on 14 July 2015 between Iran, the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States—plus Germany), and the European Union. \c\cFormal negotiations toward the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Irans nuclear program began with the adoption of the Joint Plan of Action, an interim agreement signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in November 2013. For the next twenty months, Iran and the P5+1 countries engaged in negotiations, and in April 2015 agreed on an Iran nuclear deal framework for the final agreement. In July 2015, Iran and the P5+1 confirmed agreement on the plan along with the "Roadmap Agreement" made between Iran and the IAEA. \c\cUnder the agreement, Iran agreed to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium, cut its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, and reduce by about two-thirds the number of its gas centrifuges for 13 years. For the next 15 years, Iran will only enrich uranium up to 3.67%. Iran also agreed not to build any new heavy-water facilities for the same period of time. Uranium-enrichment activities will be limited to a single facility using first-generation centrifuges for 10 years. Other facilities will be converted to avoid proliferation risks. To monitor and verify Irans compliance with the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will have regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities. The agreement provides that in return for verifiably abiding by its commitments, Iran will receive relief from U.S., European Union, and United Nations Security Council nuclear-related economic sanctions. \c\cOn 13 October 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States would not make the certification provided for under U.S. domestic law, but stopped short of terminating the deal. On 30 April 2018, the United States and Israel stated that Iran did not disclose a past covert nuclear weapons program to the IAEA, which was required in the 2015 deal. \c\cFrench President Emmanuel Macron warned President Donald Trump not to withdraw from the Iran deal, and told German magazine Der Spiegel that doing so "would open the Pandora’s box. There could be war."
The Grenfell Tower fire broke out on 14 June 2017 at the 24-storey Grenfell Tower block of public housing flats in North Kensington, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, West London. It caused 71 deaths and over 70 injuries. Occupants of 23 of the 129 flats died. 223 people escaped. Inquests for 70 victims have been opened and adjourned at Westminster Coroners Court. \c\cThe Grenfell Tower Inquiry held its first hearing on 14 September 2017, and evidential hearings started in October. Police and fire services believe the fire started accidentally in a fridge-freezer on the fourth floor. The rapid growth of the fire is thought to have been accelerated by the buildings exterior cladding, which is of a common type in widespread use. An independent review of building regulations and fire safety is in progress. \c\cEmergency services received the first report of the fire at 00:54 local time. It burned for about 60 hours until finally being extinguished. More than 250 London Fire Brigade firefighters and 70 fire engines were involved from stations all across London in efforts to control the fire. Over 100 London Ambulance Service crews on at least 20 ambulances attended, joined by the specialist Hazardous Area Response Team. The Metropolitan Police Service and Londons Air Ambulance also assisted the rescue effort.

In 2017, the eligibility of a number of Australian members of Parliament to be elected to the Parliament of Australia was called into question. With an increasing number of political casualties, it became a protracted political event, referred to by some as a constitutional crisis. The situation arose primarily due to section 44(i) of the Australian Constitution, which prohibits members of either house from having allegiance to a foreign power. On that basis, the High Court of Australia had previously held that someone who holds dual citizenship is ineligible for election unless they have taken "reasonable steps" to renounce the foreign citizenship before nomination. \c\cSeven parliamentarians, referred to collectively in the media as the "Citizenship Seven", were referred to the High Court between August and September in 2017, each by the house of parliament in which the member sat. They were: Senator Scott Ludlam, co-deputy leader of the Greens; Senator Larissa Waters, also co-deputy leader of the Greens; Senator Matt Canavan, Resources Minister; Barnaby Joyce MP, Deputy Prime Minister; Senator Malcolm Roberts of One Nation; Senator Fiona Nash, the third Cabinet member; and Senator Nick Xenophon, minor party leader. Ludlam and Waters voluntarily resigned their Senate seats, while Canavan resigned from the Ministry. \c\cThe Courts unanimous decision determined that Canavan and Xenophon had been eligible for election, unlike the other five who were dual citizens at the time of nomination. After countbacks, the High Court approved successors from the same parties to Ludlam, Waters, and Roberts. \c\cIn November 2017, several resignations followed the Courts decision as more parliamentarians recognised their dual citizenship, beginning with the President of the Senate, Liberal Stephen Parry. Liberal MP John Alexanders resignation cost the Coalition Government its majority in the lower house, although Joyce and Alexander soon regained their seats in by-elections. Senators Jacqui Lambie and the NXTs Skye Kakoschke-Moore also resigned. \c\cFollowing publication of a register of parliamentarians citizenship status in December 2017, introduced by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Labors Senator Katy Gallagher and MP David Feeney were referred to the High Court. Feeney resigned in February 2018, before his case was heard. \c\cIn May 2018, the High Court ruled that Gallagher was also ineligible, thereby establishing that taking "reasonable steps" to renounce citizenship does not guarantee exemption from s 44(i). As a result, four more MPs under similar circumstances are likely to vacate their seats and trigger by-elections. \c\cThe crisis has also involved parts of section 44 not concerning dual citizenship. The High Court ruled in November that Nashs presumptive successor was ineligible due to holding an office of profit under the Crown, contrary to section 44(iv), and in December that Jim Molan would replace her. However, in February 2018 Jacqui Lambies deemed successor Steve Martin survived a similar challenge.  A further court challenge has been brought against National MP David Gillespie, alleging a breach of the "pecuniary interest" requirement in section 44(v).

Russia returned after their absence from the previous edition, and for the first time since 2011, no country withdrew from the contest. \c\cThis edition of the contest marked the first time that Azerbaijan, Romania and Russia failed to qualify for the grand final since the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004. Also, no Caucasus countries are participating in the final for the first time since 2005.
Politics of Malaysia takes place in the framework of a federal representative democratic constitutional monarchy, in which the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is head of state and the Prime Minister of Malaysia is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the federal government and the 13 state governments. Federal legislative power is vested in the federal parliament and the 13 state assemblies. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, though the executive maintains a certain level of influence in the appointment of judges to the courts. \c\cThe Constitution of Malaysia is codified and the system of government is based on the Westminster system. The hierarchy of authority in Malaysia, in accordance to the Federal Constitution, stipulates the three branches (administrative components) of the Malaysian government as consisting of the Executive, Judiciary and Legislative branch. Whereas, the Parliament consists of the Dewan Negara (Upper House / House of Senate) and Dewan Rakyat (Lower House / House of Representatives). \c\cMalaysia has had a multi-party system since the first direct election of the Federal Legislative Council of the Malaya in 1955 on a first-past-the-post basis. The ruling party was the Alliance Party (Malay: Parti Perikatan) coalition and from 1973 onwards, its successor, the Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition. Since the 14th general election that was held on 9 May 2018, the Pakatan Harapan coalition was elected as the countrys new federal government. \c\cThe Pakatan Harapan coalition currently consists of (PKR) Peoples Justice Party (Malaysia), Democratic Action Party (Malaysia), National Trust Party (Malaysia), Malaysian United Indigenous Party, and the Sabah Heritage Party.The opposition are made up of one of the worlds longest serving government Barisan Nasional, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), the Socialist Party of Malaysia (PSM) and other smaller parties. \c\cAlthough Malaysian politics has been relatively stable, critics allege that "the government, ruling party, and administration are intertwined with few countervailing forces." However, since the 8 March 2008 General Election, the medias coverage on the countrys politics has noticeably increased. \c\cThe Economist Intelligence Unit  rated Malaysia a "flawed democracy" in 2016.
The 2018 Preakness Stakes was the 143rd running of the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the American Triple Crown. It was a Grade I stakes race with a purse of $1.5 million for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of 1+3⁄16 miles (1.9 km). It was held on May 19, 2018, at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland and was broadcast on NBC from 5:00 pm to 7:15 pm EDT with coverage of the undercard on NBCSN starting at 2:30 pm. \c\cIt was a very muddy track and extremely foggy at post time with visibility down to a sixteenth of a mile. Out of the gate, Justify went to the early lead while Good Magic rushed up his inside to challenge. The two matched strides for the first mile before Good Magic tired somewhat down the stretch. Justify held off a fast closing Bravazo to win by half a length, keeping alive his hopes of winning the Triple Crown.
The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held at 12:00 BST on 19 May 2018 at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American former actress. Prince Harry was conferred the title of Duke of Sussex by Queen Elizabeth II on the morning of the wedding, and Ms. Markle became Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex on marriage.
Cyclonic Storm Sagar was an unusual tropical cyclone that made landfall over northwestern Somalia. It is the westernmost landfalling cyclone on record in the North Indian Ocean, surpassing Tropical Storm 01A of 1984, which took a nearly identical track.
North Korea–South Korea relations or DPRK-ROK relations, Inter-Korean relations are the political, commercial, diplomatic, and military interactions between Republic of Korea, abbreviated as ROK, commonly known as "South Korea", and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, abbreviated as DPRK, commonly known as "North Korea". \c\cThe relations began in 1945 with the division of Korea at the end of World War II. Since then, the DPRK and ROK have been locked in a conflict which erupted into open warfare in 1950 with the Korean War and which has continued ever since, thwarting the goal of Korean reunification. \c\cAccording to a 2014 BBC World Service poll, 3% of South Koreans viewed North Koreas influence positively, with 91% expressing a negative view, making South Korea, after Japan, the country with the most negative feelings of North Korea in the world. However, a 2014 government-funded survey found 13% of South Koreans viewed North Korea as hostile, and 58% of South Koreans believed North Korea was a country they should cooperate with. \c\cAccording to a 2017 Korea Institute for National Unification, 58% of South Korean citizens had responded that unification is necessary. The number had declined as 62% of South Korean citizens thought unification was necessary in 2016. Among the respondents of the 2017 survey, 14% said we really need unification while 44% said we kind of need the unification. Regarding the survey question of Do we still need unification even if ROK and DPRK could peacefully coexist?, 46% agreed and 32% disagreed. \c\cIn 2018, beginning with North Koreas participation in the Winter Olympics in South Korea, the relationship has seen a major diplomatic breakthrough. In April, the two countries signed the Panmunjeom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula.
The possibility of life on the planet Mars is a subject of significant interest to astrobiology due to its proximity and similarities to Earth. To date no proof has been found of past or present life on Mars. However, cumulative evidence is now clear that during the ancient Noachian time period, the surface environment of Mars had liquid water and may have been habitable for microorganisms. The existence of habitable conditions does not necessarily indicate the presence of life. \c\cScientific searches for evidence of life began in the 19th century, and they continue today via telescopic investigations and deployed probes. While early work focused on phenomenology and bordered on fantasy, modern scientific inquiry has emphasized the search for water, chemical biosignatures in the soil and rocks at the planets surface, and biomarker gases in the atmosphere. On November 22, 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior. \c\cMars is of particular interest for the study of the origins of life because of its similarity to the early Earth. This is especially so since Mars has a cold climate and lacks plate tectonics or continental drift, so it has remained almost unchanged since the end of the Hesperian period. At least two thirds of Marss surface is more than 3.5 billion years old, and Mars may thus hold the best record of the prebiotic conditions leading to abiogenesis, even if life does not or has never existed there. In May 2017, evidence of the earliest known life on land on Earth may have been found in 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. These findings may be helpful in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars. \c\cOn January 24, 2014, NASA reported that the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers started searching for evidence of past life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic, or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective. \c\cIn July 2017, researchers reported that the surface on the planet Mars may be more toxic to microorganisms, especially a common terrestrial type, Bacillus subtilis, than thought earlier. This is based on studies with perchlorates, common on Mars, in a simulated Martian ultraviolet atmosphere. \c\cOn September 5, 2017, scientists reported that the Curiosity rover on Mars detected boron, an essential ingredient for life on Earth. Such a finding, along with previous discoveries that liquid water was clearly present on ancient Mars, further supports the possible early habitability of Gale Crater on Mars.
The United States Armed Forces are the military forces of the United States of America. It consists of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces and forms military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), both federal executive departments, acting as the principal organs by which military policy is carried out. All five armed services are among the seven uniformed services of the United States. \c\cFrom the time of its inception, the U.S. Armed Forces played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the founders of the United States were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played a critical role in the American Civil War, continuing to serve as the armed forces of the United States, although a number of its officers resigned to join the military of the Confederate States. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold Wars onset, created the modern U.S. military framework. The Act merged the previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and the National Security Council. \c\cThe U.S. Armed Forces are one of the largest militaries in terms of the number of personnel. It draws its personnel from a large pool of paid volunteers. Although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972, but the Selective Service System retains the power to conscript males, and requires that all male citizens and residents residing in the U.S. between the ages of 18–25 register with the service. \c\cAs of 2017, the U.S. spends about US$610 billion annually to fund its military forces and Overseas Contingency Operations. Put together, the U.S. constitutes roughly 40 percent of the worlds military expenditures.  The U.S. Armed Forces has significant capabilities in both defense and power projection due to its large budget, resulting in advanced and powerful technologies which enables a  widespread deployment of the force around the world, including around 800 military bases outside the United States. The U.S. Air Force is the worlds largest air force, the U.S. Navy is the worlds largest navy by tonnage, and the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps combined are the world’s second largest air arm.
The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is a United Nations body whose mission is to promote and protect human rights around the world. The UNHRC has 47 members elected for staggered three-year terms on a regional group basis. The next three-week session of the UNHRC will begin 18 June 2018. The headquarters of UNHRC is in Geneva, Switzerland. \c\cThe UNHRC investigates allegations of breaches of human rights in UN member states, and addresses important thematic human rights issues such as freedom of association and assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of belief and religion, womens rights, LGBT rights, and the rights of racial and ethnic minorities. \c\cThe UNHRC was established by the UN General Assembly on 15 March 2006 (by resolution A/RES/60/251) to replace the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR, herein CHR) that had been strongly criticised for allowing countries with poor human rights records to be members. UN Secretaries General Kofi Annan and Ban Ki-moon, former president of the council Doru Costea, the European Union, Canada, and the United States have accused the UNHRC of focusing disproportionately on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and many allege an Anti-Israel bias- the Council has resolved more resolutions condemning Israel than the rest of the world combined. The UNHRC works closely with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and engages the UN’s special procedures.
On 3 October 2014, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that he would put forth a motion to send Canadian forces to participate in the coalition for military intervention against ISIL by deploying combat aircraft. On 7 October 2014, the Canadian Parliament approved of sending nine Canadian aircraft to join coalition airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq along with 69 special forces advisors to train the Iraqi governments military. The Canadian Armed Forces’ contribution to the coalition against ISIL was later dubbed Operation Impact. On 30 March 2015, the Canadian Parliament voted to extend the mission to targets in Syria. No additional forces were announced. \c\cIn late November 2015, new Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the withdrawal of Canada’s fighter aircraft from the fight against ISIL, but their surveillance and transport and refueling aircraft would remain in the area. All airstrikes by the Canadian fighter aircraft ended as of 15 February 2016. As part of the Canadian reorganization of the operation in February 2016, it was announced the number of military trainers would triple to a total of 600 ground personnel. This force was later augmented in mid-May 2016 by three Bell CH-146 Griffon helicopters. \c\cOn 20 July, it was announced by Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan that Canada was deploying a field hospital in support of United States and French troops in their effort to retake Mosul. The hospital requires 60 personnel, however the Minister said that the number of committed to the overall operation would not climb. The hospitals deployment would be for one year.
The Trump administration family separation policy, described by the Trump administration as part of its "zero tolerance" policy, is an enforcement aspect of U.S. President Donald Trumps immigration policy. The policy was implemented in April 2018, and, following immense public opposition and political pressure, was suspended for an indefinite period of time on June 20, 2018, through an executive order. \c\cUnder the policy, federal authorities separated children from their parents, relatives, or other adults who accompanied them in crossing the border, whether apprehended during an illegal crossing or, in a number of reported cases, legally presenting themselves for asylum. The policy involved prosecuting all adults who were detained at the U.S.–Mexico border, sending the parents to federal jails and placing children and infants under the supervision of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Trump administration justified its policy by falsely claiming that they were required by law to implement it and that Democrats were at fault. Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the policy, citing the Bible. Other administration officials argued that the policy was intended to deter immigration or be used as political leverage to force Democrats and moderate Republicans to accept hardline immigration legislation. \c\cIn April and May 2018, an average of 45 children were taken from their parents per day. According to the HHS, the policy led to the separation of over 2,300 children from their parents, though others said the figure may have been much higher. Authorities made the decision to take children from their parents without a plan to reunite families, resulting in numerous cases of parents and children having no contact since being forcefully separated. \c\cThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians and the American Psychiatric Association condemned the policy, with the American Academy of Pediatrics saying that the policy has caused "irreparable harm" to the children. \c\cFollowing the suspension of the policy, the children that were already separated from their parents remain interned; the Department of Health and Human Services stated that the status of children already detained will not be affected by the Executive Order, and will not be immediately reunited with their families.
Up until September 2017, Saudi Arabia was unique in being the only country in the world where women were forbidden to drive motor vehicles. The women to drive movement (Arabic: قيادة المرأة في السعودية qiyāda al-imarʾa fī as-Suʿūdiyya) is a campaign by Saudi women, who have more rights denied to them by the regime than men, for the right to drive motor vehicles on public roads. Dozens of women drove in Riyadh in 1990 and were arrested and had their passports confiscated. In 2007, Wajeha al-Huwaider and other women petitioned King Abdullah for womens right to drive, and a film of al-Huwaider driving on International Womens Day 2008 attracted international media attention. \c\cIn 2011, the Arab Spring motivated some women, including al-Huwaider and Manal al-Sharif, to organise a more intensive driving campaign, and about seventy cases of women driving were documented from 17 June to late June. In late September, Shaima Jastania was sentenced to ten lashes for driving in Jeddah, although the sentence was later overturned. \c\cTwo years later, another campaign to defy the ban targeted 26 October 2013 as the date for women to start driving. Three days before, in a "rare and explicit restating of the ban", an Interior Ministry spokesman warned that "women in Saudi are banned from driving and laws will be applied against violators and those who demonstrate support." Interior Ministry employees warned leaders of the campaign individually not to drive on 26 October, and in the Saudi capital police road blocks were set up to check for women drivers. On 26 September 2017, King Salman issued an order to allow women to drive in Saudi Arabia, with new guidelines to be created and implemented by the following June. The ban was officially lifted on 25 June 2018.
The 2018 German government crisis is a ongoing crisis of the German government, quarreling over asylum policies.
The 2018 German government crisis, in Germany also referred to as Asylstreit (asylum quarrel), is a government crisis of the German government, the Fourth Merkel cabinet, quarreling over asylum policies.
The Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, also known as EU Copyright Directive and file 2016/0280(COD), is a proposed European Union directive with the stated goal to harmonize aspects of copyright law in the Digital Single Market of the European Union. It is an attempt to adjust copyright law for the Internet by providing additional protection to those who own material. The European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs approved the proposal on June 20, 2018 with further voting by the entire parliament required before it becomes law. \c\cThe directives proposals include giving publishers the ability to request payment for the use of short bits of text, that for-profit websites who primarily host content posted by users must take "effective and proportionate" measures to prevent unauthorized postings of copyrighted content, and copyright exceptions for text and data mining by scientific research institutions. Because both licenses and exceptions are established on a national basis, articles 11 and 13 would fragment the EU market contrary to the stated goal of the directive. UK Member of parliament Stephen Doughty also wants to see similar upload filters used to prevent "extremist material" on the Internet. \c\cOn April 26, 2018, 145 organizations from the areas of human and digital rights, media freedom, publishing, libraries, educational institutions, software developers, and Internet service providers signed a letter opposing the proposed legislation. Some of those opposed include Electronic Frontier Foundation, Creative Commons, European Digital Rights, various Wikimedia chapters, and as of June 29, 2018, Wikimedia Foundation, owner of Wikipedia. Individuals who have publicly opposed the law include Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf who raise concerns regarding the costs and effectiveness of upload filters and the negative effects on free speech online. A change.org petition opposing the directive has more than 600,000 signatures. Groups that support the directive include many publishers and media groups. This includes David Guetta, three major music labels, and the Independent Music Companies Association.
On 30 June 2018, two British nationals, 45-year-old Charlie Rowley and 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess, were hospitalised in a critical condition after being found unconscious at a property in Amesbury, Wiltshire. As of 4 July, it is suspected that they have been poisoned using Novichok nerve agents of the same kind used in the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal in the city of Salisbury, 7 miles away, almost four months prior. \c\cThe incident is currently being investigated by the National Counter Terrorism Policing Network alongside Wiltshire Police and the Metropolitan Police. According to the Metropolitan Police, there is nothing in either of the victims' backgrounds to suggest that they were deliberately targeted, and there have been no other reports of people presenting with similar symptoms.
Starting on July 1, 2018, the air temperature has consistently gotten above 35 °C (95.0 °F) in parts of Quebec and Ontario. The humidex value for Ottawa on Canada Day between noon and 3 pm was 47 °C (116.6 °F), the highest ever recorded in the city. The heat wave has also affected the Maritimes, with temperatures reaching a record breaking 45 degrees with humidex in Greenwood, Nova Scotia. It has killed at least 54 people, 28 of which were in Montreal. Twelve of these were in Montreal, and did not cause a rise above the citys overall daily death average. On July 4, municipal emergency services reported 1200 calls per day about the heat, up 30% from prior busiest days.
On April 6, 2018, sixteen people were killed and thirteen injured when a westbound semi-trailer truck was struck by a northbound coach bus near Armley, Saskatchewan, Canada. The semi-trailer had failed to yield  at a flashing stop sign  at the intersection of Highways 35 and 335.  The bus was travelling at a speed of approximately 100 km/h.  Most of the dead and injured were teenagers from the Humboldt Broncos, a junior ice hockey team that plays in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL). \c\cOn July 6, 2018, the RCMP charged 29-year-old Jaskirat Singh Sidhu, the driver of the semi-trailer, with 16 counts of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death and 13 counts of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily injury.   Sidhu immigrated to Canada from India in 2013. \c\cAcross the country, the crash prompted condolences from public figures and celebrities, vigils, and tributes, such as people leaving hockey sticks outside their doors.  A GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign set a national record by raising over $15 million.
On 5 July 2018, two tourist boats capsized and sank near Phuket, Thailand, during a sudden storm. At least 41 people died and 15 were missing, all of whom from the double-decker ship Phoenix PC Diving, which carried 105 people, including 93 Chinese tourists. The second boat, Serenita, carried 42 passengers, all of whom were rescued.
On 5 July 2018, heavy floods started in western areas of Japan, most in the Hiroshima Prefecture, which has been hit by torrential rain. As of 7 July, 50 people were killed (several buried alive by landslides), another 48 were declared missing and 1.5 million people were displaced. 48,000 members of Japans Self-Defense Forces, police and firefighters have been searching for the people trapped or wounded in landslides and flooding triggered by the heavy rain, while the Japanese government has set up a liaison unit at the crisis management center of the prime ministers office to gather information.
Relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia are historically adversarial. Immediately after Eritreas independence from Ethiopia, relations were cordial despite the former relationship. Since independence Eritreas relationship with Ethiopia was entirely political, especially in the resuscitation and expansion of IGADs scope. Since 1998 and the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, the relationship became increasingly hostile.
The state of human rights in Iran has been criticized both by Iranians and international human rights activists, writers, and NGOs since long before the formation of the current state of Iran. The United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Commission have condemned prior and ongoing abuses in Iran in published critiques and several resolutions. The government of Iran is criticized both for restrictions and punishments that follow the Islamic Republics constitution and law, and for actions that do not, such as the torture, rape, and killing of political prisoners, and the beatings and killings of dissidents and other civilians. \c\cWhile the monarchy under the rule of the shahs had a generally abysmal human rights record according to most Western watchdog organizations, the current Islamic Republic does not have a positive reputation either, with its human rights record under the administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad considered to have "deteriorated markedly," according to Human Rights Watch. Following the 2009 election protests there were reports of killing of demonstrators, the torture, rape and killing of detained protesters, and the arrest and publicized mass trials of dozens of prominent opposition figures in which defendants "read confessions that bore every sign of being coerced." In October 2012 the United Nations human rights office stated Iranian authorities had engaged in a “severe clampdown” on journalists and human rights advocates. \c\cRestrictions and punishments in the Islamic Republic of Iran which violate international human rights norms include harsh penalties for crimes, punishment of "victimless crimes" such as fornication and homosexuality, execution of offenders under 18 years of age, restrictions on freedom of speech and the press (including the imprisonment of journalists and political cartoonists), and restrictions on freedom of religion and gender equality in the Islamic Republics Constitution (especially attacks on members of the Baháí religion). Reported abuses falling outside of the laws of the Islamic Republic that have been condemned include the execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988, and the widespread use of torture to extract repudiations by prisoners of their cause and comrades on video for propaganda purposes. Also condemned has been firebombings of newspaper offices and attacks on political protesters by "quasi-official organs of repression," particularly "Hezbollah," and the murder of dozens of government opponents in the 1990s, allegedly by "rogue elements" of the government. \c\cOfficials of the Islamic Republic have responded to criticism by stating that Iran has "the best human rights record" in the Muslim world; that it is not obliged to follow "the Wests interpretation" of human rights; and that the Islamic Republic is a victim of "biased propaganda of enemies" which is "part of a greater plan against the world of Islam". According to Iranian officials, those who human rights activists say are peaceful political activists being denied due process rights are actually guilty of offenses against the national security of the country, and those protesters claiming Ahmadinejad stole the 2009 election are actually part of a foreign-backed plot to topple Irans leaders.
The Inn Din massacre was a mass execution of Rohingyas by the Myanmar Army and armed Rakhine locals in the village of Inn Din, in Rakhine State, Myanmar on 2 September 2017. The victims were suspected of being members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) by authorities. This was the first instance where Myanmars security forces admitted to extrajudicial killings during their "clearance operations" in the region.

The Eritrean–Ethiopian War took place from May 1998 to June 2000 between Ethiopia and Eritrea, one of the conflicts in the Horn of Africa. While Eritrea and Ethiopia—two of the worlds poorest countries—spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the war and suffered tens of thousands of casualties as a direct consequence of the conflict, only minor border changes resulted. \c\cAccording to a ruling by an international commission in The Hague, Eritrea broke international law and triggered the war by invading Ethiopia. At the end of the war, Ethiopia held all of the disputed territory and had advanced into Eritrea. After the war ended, the Eritrea–Ethiopia Boundary Commission, a body founded by the UN, established that Badme, the disputed territory at the heart of the conflict, belongs to Eritrea. As of 2018, Ethiopia still occupies the territory near Badme, including the town of Badme. On 5 June 2018, the ruling coalition of Ethiopia, headed by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, agreed to fully implement the peace treaty signed with Eritrea in 2000. \c\cFrom 1961 until 1991, Eritrea had fought a long war of independence against Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Civil War began on 12 September 1974 when the Marxist Derg staged a coup détat against Emperor Haile Selassie.  It lasted until 1991 when the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)—a coalition of rebel groups led by the Tigrayan Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF)—overthrew the Derg government and installed a transitional government in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. The Derg government had been weakened by their loss of support due to the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. \c\cDuring the civil war, the groups fighting the Derg government had a common enemy, so the TPLF allied itself with the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front (EPLF). In 1991 as part of the United Nations-facilitated transition of power to the transitional government, it was agreed that the EPLF should set up an autonomous transitional government in Eritrea and that a referendum would be held in Eritrea to find out if Eritreans wanted to secede from Ethiopia. The referendum was held and the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of independence. In April 1993 independence was achieved and the new state joined the United Nations. \c\cIn 1991 the EPLF-backed transitional government of Eritrea and the TPLF-backed transitional government of Ethiopia, agreed to set up a commission to look into any problems that arose between the two former wartime allies over the foreseen independence of Eritrea. This commission was not successful and during the following years relations between the governments of the two sovereign states deteriorated. \c\cThe border between the two states became a major irritant, and in November 1997 a border committee was set up to try to resolve that specific dispute. After federation and before independence the line of the border had been of minor importance because it was only a demarcation line between federated provinces and initially the two governments tacitly agreed that the border should remain as it had been immediately before independence. However, on independence the border became an international frontier, and the two governments could not agree on the line that the border should take along its entire length, and they looked back to the colonial period treaties between Italy and Ethiopia for a basis in international law for the precise line of the frontier between the states. Problems then arose because they could not agree on the interpretation of those agreements and treaties, and it was not clear under international law how binding colonial treaties were on the two states. \c\cWriting after the war had finished Jon Abbink postulates that President Isaias Afewerki of Eritrea, realising that his influence over the government in Ethiopia was slipping and given that "the facts on the ground, in the absence of a concrete border being marked—which anyhow lost much of its relevance after 1962 when Eritrea was absorbed by Ethiopia—have eminent relevance to any  borderline decision of today" calculated that Eritrea could annex Badme. If successful this acquisition could be used to enhance his reputation and help maintain Eritreas privileged economic relationship with Ethiopia. However, because Badme was in the province of Tigray, the region from which many of the members of the Ethiopian government originate (including Meles Zenawi the former Ethiopian prime minister), the Ethiopian government came under political pressure from within the EPRDF as well as from the wider Ethiopian public to meet force with force.
On 5 July 2018, two tourist boats capsized and sank near Phuket, Thailand, during a sudden storm. Forty-four people died and 5 were missing, all of whom were on the double-decker ship Phoenix PC Diving, which carried 101 people, including 89 tourists (all but 2 were Chinese nationals). All 42 passengers aboard the second boat, Serenita, were rescued.
The 2018 North American heat wave is an ongoing heat wave in some parts of North America and has passed in others. At least 70 deaths in Quebec were heat-related. Eighteen states between Michigan and New Mexico issued heat advisories to over 60 million people.

In late June through mid-July 2018, successive heavy downpours in southwestern Japan resulted in widespread, devastating floods and mudflows. As of 12 July, 195 were dead More than 8 million people were advised or urged to evacuate across 23 prefectures. Approximately 54,000 members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, police and firefighters have been searching for the people trapped or injured in landslides and flooding triggered by the heavy rain, while the Japanese government has set up a liaison unit at the crisis management center of the prime ministers office to gather information.
The Siege of al-Fu'ah and Kefriya is an ongoing siege of the towns of al-Fu'ah and Kafriya in the Idlib Governorate, during the Syrian Civil War. The siege was initiated with a rebel assault on the capital of the province in March 2015, resulting in the capture of Idlib.
Oksana Shachko (Ukrainian: Оксана Шачко; 31 January 1987 – 23 July 2018) was a Ukrainian artist and activist with FEMEN. She was one of the founders of FEMEN in April 2008, along with Anna Hutsol and Alexandra Shevchenko. Shachko had been born in Khmelnytskyi but had moved to Kiev. FEMEN initially protested about issues affecting women students, but rapidly moved on to demonstrating against the sexual exploitation of Ukrainian women. and against sex tourism in 2008. Initially Femen gained attention by demonstrating while dressed in underwear: however, in August 2009 Shachko bared her breasts at a protest in Kiev. Since then  FEMEN activists have regularly protested ‘topless’,  and broadened their agenda to womens rights and civil rights in Ukraine and around the world. Shachko co-operated with French writer Galia Ackerman who produced a history of FEMEN which was published by Calmann-Lévy in 2013. In 2014 was released "Je suis Femen" (I am Femen), awarded documentary about Oksana Shachko, by film maker Alain Margot. France granted her political refugee status in 2013. She lived in Paris as a painter.
A hydroelectric dam under construction in Attapeu Province, south-east Laos, collapsed on 23 July 2018, leading to widespread destruction and homelessness among the local population. As of 25 July, 26 people were confirmed dead, at least 130 more were missing and 6,600 others were displaced.
Almost all water on Mars today exists as ice, though it also exists in small quantities as vapor in the atmosphere and occasionally as low-volume liquid brines in shallow Martian soil. The only place where water ice is visible at the surface is at the north polar ice cap. Abundant water ice is also present beneath the permanent carbon dioxide ice cap at the Martian south pole and in the shallow subsurface at more temperate conditions. More than five million cubic kilometers of ice have been identified at or near the surface of modern Mars, enough to cover the whole planet to a depth of 35 meters (115 ft). Even more ice is likely to be locked away in the deep subsurface. \c\cSome liquid water may occur transiently on the Martian surface today, but limited to traces of dissolved moisture from the atmosphere and thin films, which are challenging environments for life as we know it. No large standing bodies of liquid water exist, because the atmospheric pressure at the surface averages just 600 pascals (0.087 psi)—about 0.6% of Earths mean sea level pressure—leading to either rapid evaporation (sublimation) or rapid freezing. Before about 3.8 billion years ago, Mars may have had a denser atmosphere and higher surface temperatures, allowing vast amounts of liquid water on the surface, possibly including a large ocean that may have covered one-third of the planet. Water has also apparently flowed across the surface for short periods at various intervals more recently in Mars history. On December 9, 2013, NASA reported that, based on evidence from the Curiosity rover studying Aeolis Palus, Gale Crater contained an ancient freshwater lake that could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life. \c\cMany lines of evidence indicate that water is abundant on Mars and has played a significant role in the planets geologic history. The present-day inventory of water on Mars can be estimated from spacecraft imagery, remote sensing techniques (spectroscopic measurements, radar, etc.), and surface investigations from landers and rovers. Geologic evidence of past water includes enormous outflow channels carved by floods, ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds; and the detection of rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Numerous geomorphic features suggest the presence of ground ice (permafrost) and the movement of ice in glaciers, both in the recent past and present. Gullies and slope lineae along cliffs and crater walls suggest that flowing water continues to shape the surface of Mars, although to a far lesser degree than in the ancient past. \c\cAlthough the surface of Mars was periodically wet and could have been hospitable to microbial life billions of years ago, the current environment at the surface is dry and subfreezing, probably presenting an insurmountable obstacle for living organisms. In addition, Mars lacks a thick atmosphere, ozone layer, and magnetic field, allowing solar and cosmic radiation to strike the surface unimpeded. The damaging effects of ionizing radiation on cellular structure is another one of the prime limiting factors on the survival of life on the surface. Therefore, the best potential locations for discovering life on Mars may be in subsurface environments. On November 22, 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice on Mars; the volume of water detected is equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior. In July 2018, scientists reported the discovery, based on MARSIS radar studies, of a subglacial lake on Mars, 1.5 km (0.93 mi) below the southern polar ice cap, and extending sideways about 20 km (12 mi), the first known stable body of water on the planet. \c\cUnderstanding the extent and situation of water on Mars is vital to assess the planet’s potential for harboring life and for providing usable resources for future human exploration. For this reason, "Follow the Water" was the science theme of NASAs Mars Exploration Program (MEP) in the first decade of the 21st century. Discoveries by the 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and Mars Phoenix lander have been instrumental in answering key questions about waters abundance and distribution on Mars. The ESAs Mars Express orbiter has also provided essential data in this quest. The Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, MER Opportunity rover, MRO, and Mars Science Lander Curiosity rover are still sending back data from Mars, and discoveries continue to be made.
Aleph (Japanese: アレフ, Hepburn: Arefu), formerly Aum Shinrikyo (オウム真理教, Oumu Shinrikyō), is a Japanese doomsday cult founded by Shoko Asahara in 1984. It carried out the deadly Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 and was found to have been responsible for another smaller sarin attack the previous year. \c\cThe group never confessed. They claim that those who carried out attacks did so secretly, without being known to other executives and ordinary believers. Asahara broadcast his singing, insisting on his innocence through a radio broadcast on a signal they purchased in Russia and directed toward Japan. \c\cOn 6 July 2018, after exhausting all appeals, Asahara and six other followers were executed by Japan, as punishment for the 1995 attacks and other crimes. \c\cAum Shinrikyo, which split into Aleph and Hikari no Wa in 2007, has been formally designated a terrorist organization by several countries, including the European Union, Russia, Canada, Kazakhstan, and the United States. \c\cJapans Public Security Examination Commission considers Aleph and Hikari no Wa to be branches of a "dangerous religion" and it announced in January 2015 that they would remain under surveillance for three more years. The Japanese government ended surveillance of Hikari no Wa in 2017, but continued to keep Aleph under watch.
Cannabis in the United Kingdom is widely used as an illegal drug, while other strains lower in THC (commonly called hemp) have been used industrially for over a thousand years for fibre, oil, and seeds. \c\cCannabis has been restricted as a drug in the United Kingdom since 1928, though its usage as a recreational drug was limited until the 1960s, when increasing popularity led to stricter 1971 classification. Since the end of the twentieth century, there has been rising interest in cannabis-based medicine, and a number of advocacy groups have pressed the government to reform its cannabis drug policies.

The Weinstein effect is a global trend in which people come forward to accuse famous or powerful men of sexual misconduct. The term came into use to describe a worldwide wave of these allegations that began in the United States in October 2017, when media outlets reported on sexual abuse allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein. The allegations were described as a "tipping point" or "watershed moment" and precipitated a "national reckoning" against sexual harassment. USA Today wrote that 2017 was the year in which "sexual harassment became a fireable offense". \c\cThe subsequent #MeToo campaign encourages people to share their experiences of sexual harassment and assault, and the two events triggered a cascade of allegations that brought about the swift removal of many men in positions of power in the United States, while tarnishing and ending political careers of additional men as it spread around the world. In the entertainment industry, allegations led to the dismissal of actors and directors alike. \c\cMost prominently, actor Kevin Spacey and filmmaker Brett Ratner had projects canceled following at least six allegations each. More than 300 women accused filmmaker James Toback of sexual harassment. In journalism, allegations led to the firing of editors, publishers, executives, and hosts, including high-profile television figures such as Charlie Rose, Mark Halperin, and Matt Lauer. In politics, accusations of varying degrees of severity were made against U.S. House Representative John Conyers (D-MI) and U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-MN), both of whom resigned their seats in Congress, and Roy Moore (R-AL), who lost his 2017 bid for election to the United States Senate. Celebrity chefs Mario Batali and John Besh were also removed, as well as some financial and public relations executives.

Hurricane Florence is a long-lived Cape Verde hurricane and the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the Carolinas and the ninth wettest tropical cyclone to affect the contiguous United States. The sixth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence originated from a strong tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 30, 2018. Steady organization resulted in the formation of a tropical depression on the next day near Cape Verde. Progressing along a steady west-northwest trajectory, the system acquired tropical storm strength on September 1, and fluctuated in strength for several days over open ocean. An unexpected bout of rapid intensification ensued on September 4–5, culminating with Florence becoming a Category 4 major hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale with estimated maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). \c\cEnvironmental conditions tore the storm apart, and Florence degraded to a tropical storm by September 7. Shifting steering currents led to a westward turn into a more suitable environment; the system regained hurricane strength on September 9 and major hurricane status by the following day. At 16:00 UTC on September 10, Florence again became a Category 4 hurricane, later reaching a new peak intensity with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a central pressure of 939 mbar (27.7 inHg). Afterwards, Florence weakened slightly as it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, but began to restrengthen late on September 11. However, increasing wind shear caused the storms winds to gradually taper over the next few days, though the storms wind field continued to grow. By the evening of September 13, Florence had been downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. Early the next day on September 14, Florence made landfall just south of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, and weakened further as it slowly moved inland. \c\cEarly in the storms history, the system brought squall conditions to the Cape Verde islands, resulting in some landslides and flooding; however, overall impacts were negligible. With the threat of a major impact in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States becoming evident by September 7, the governors of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, and Maryland, and the mayor of Washington, D.C. declared a state of emergency. On September 10 and September 11, the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia all issued mandatory evacuation orders for some of their coastal communities, as it was expected that emergency management personnel would be unable to reach people in those areas once the storm arrived.
The Panama Papers case (officially titled Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi  v. Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif), or the Panamagate case, was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of Pakistan that disqualified incumbent Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif from holding public office. \c\cOpposition politicians Imran Khan and Sheikh Rasheed petitioned the court in the aftermath of the Panama Papers leak, which uncovered links between the Sharif family and eight offshore companies. The Court initially ordered the formation of a joint investigation team (JIT) to inquire into allegations of money laundering, corruption, and contradictory statements by Sharif and his relations in a 3–2 split decision on 20 April 2017, with the dissenting judges ruling that Sharif be disqualified. After the JIT submitted its report and subsequent arguments were heard, the Court disqualified Sharif from holding public office by unanimous verdict. \c\cThe case has been described as the most publicized in Pakistans history, as well as a "defining moment" for the country.

American comedian Bill Cosby has been the subject of publicized sexual assault allegations, with the earliest incidents allegedly taking place in the mid-1960s. He has been accused by numerous women of rape, drug-facilitated sexual assault, sexual battery, child sexual abuse, and sexual misconduct. Assault allegations against him became more public after a stand-up routine by comedian Hannibal Buress became viral in October 2014, alluding to Cosby’s covert sexual misbehavior; thereafter, many additional claims were made. The dates of the alleged incidents have spanned from 1965 to 2008 in ten U.S. states and one Canadian province. \c\cCosby has maintained his innocence and repeatedly denied the allegations made against him. He was asked about the allegations in November 2014 and responded, "I don’t talk about it!” He has declined to publicly discuss the accusations in interviews in the past, although he told Florida Today that "people shouldn’t have to go through that and shouldn’t answer to innuendos". In May 2015, he said, "I have been in this business 52 years and I’ve never seen anything like this. Reality is a situation and I cant speak.". \c\cFollowing the allegations, numerous organizations have severed ties with the comedian, and previously awarded honors and titles have been revoked. Reruns of The Cosby Show and other television programs featuring Cosby have also been pulled from syndication by many media organizations. Twenty-five colleges and universities have rescinded his honorary degrees. Adweek reporter Jason Lynch noted that the "media landscape has changed considerably—and has now been joined by the far-less-forgiving social media arena". \c\cMost of the alleged acts fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal legal proceedings, but criminal charges have been filed against Cosby in one case and numerous civil lawsuits have been brought against him. As of November 2015, eight related civil suits were active against him. Gloria Allred is representing 33 of the alleged victims. In July 2015, some of the court records were unsealed and released to the public from Andrea Constand’s 2005 civil suit against Cosby. The full transcript of his deposition was also released to the media by a court reporting service. In his testimony, Cosby admitted to casual sex involving recreational use of the sedative-hypnotic methaqualone (Quaaludes) with a series of young women, and he acknowledged that his dispensing the prescription drug was illegal. \c\cIn December 2015, three Class II felony charges of aggravated indecent assault were filed against Cosby in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania based on allegations by Constand concerning incidents in January 2004. Cosby’s first trial in June 2017 ended in a mistrial. Cosby was found guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault at retrial on April 26, 2018, and he faces up to ten years in prison and a $25,000 fine for each count, with his sentencing date being set to September 24, 2018. On September 25, 2018, Cosby was sentenced to 3 to 10 years in state prison. Cosbys attorney, Thomas Mesereau, plans to appeal.

During the clashes around the airport and neighborhoods in southern Tripoli, shelling damaged the electricity infrastructure.  . \c\cOn 25 September, a ceasefire was signed, ending the battle.
President Donald Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to become an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States on July 9, 2018, filling the vacancy left by the retirement of Anthony Kennedy. When nominated, Kavanaugh was a sitting judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to which he had been appointed by George W. Bush in 2006.  . \c\cKavanaughs confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on September 4. The hearings were interrupted numerous times by senators from the Democratic Party, who objected to the withholding of documents from Kavanaughs time as a White House attorney during the George W. Bush administration. The hearings were also interrupted by a number of protesters, at least 227 of whom were arrested. \c\cDuring the confirmation process, Kavanaugh was accused of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford, currently a professor in clinical psychology at Palo Alto University, while they were both in high school. The Senate Judiciary Committee had been scheduled to vote on the confirmation on September 20 to determine whether the nomination will go to the full Senate for a vote. In response to the sexual assault allegations, the White House said it is not withdrawing its nomination. On September 17, the Committee announced that the confirmation would not proceed until both Ford and Kavanaugh responded in a hearing. The hearing occurred September 27. Both parties were questioned by members of the Judiciary Committee and Arizona-based sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. \c\cOn September 23, a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in 1983. Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations by Ford and Ramirez. On September 26, Michael Avenatti released a sworn declaration by a third woman, Julie Swetnick, who alleged another incident had occurred.

On 28 September 2018, a shallow earthquake struck in the neck of the Minahasa Peninsula, Indonesia, with its epicentre located in the mountainous Donggala Regency, Central Sulawesi. The quake was located 77 km (48 mi) away from the provincial capital Palu and was felt as far away as Samarinda on East Kalimantan and also in Tawau, Malaysia. This event was preceded by a sequence of foreshocks, the largest of which was a magnitude 6.1 tremor that occurred earlier that day. \c\cFollowing the mainshock, a tsunami alert was issued for the nearby Makassar Strait, but was called off an hour after. However, a localised tsunami later struck Palu, sweeping shore-lying houses and buildings on its way. The combined effects of the earthquake and tsunami led to the deaths of at least 1200 people  and injured a further 540, making it the deadliest earthquake in Indonesia since the September 2009 Sumatra earthquake. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) confirmed that a tsunami had been triggered with its height reaching an estimated maximum of 4 to 6 metres (13 to 20 ft), striking the settlements of Palu, Donggala and Mamuju along its path.
On 24 December 2017, the President of Peru, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, pardoned jailed ex president Alberto Fujimori. Because the pardon was granted on Christmas Eve, it became known as the "indulto de Navidad" ("Christmas pardon"). \c\cIn 2009, Fujimori was convicted of human rights violations and sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in killings and kidnappings by the Grupo Colina death squad during his governments battle against Shining Path leftist guerrillas in the 1990s. The verdict marked the first time that an elected head of state has been extradited to his home country, tried, and convicted of human rights violations. Fujimori was specifically found guilty of murder, bodily harm, and two cases of kidnapping. The pardon was granted after Fujimori had completed 10 years of imprisonment in Lima. \c\cThe pardon sparked protests across Peru. Protestors accused Kuczynski of corruption, claiming that the pardon was payback for the support of Fujimoris son, Kenji Fujimori, which had been central to Kuczynskis success in surviving an impeachment vote days earlier. \c\cOn 3 October 2018, Fujimoris pardon was reversed and he was order to be returned to prison.

Hurricane Leslie (known as Storm Leslie or Cyclone Leslie in Portugal and Spain while extratropical) was the strongest cyclone to strike the Iberian Peninsula since 1842. A large, long-lived, and erratic tropical cyclone, Leslie was the twelfth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm was of non-tropical origin, developing from a large low-pressure system that developed over the northern Atlantic Ocean on 22 September. The low quickly acquired subtropical characteristics and was classified as Subtropical Storm Leslie on the following day. The cyclone meandered over the northern Atlantic and gradually weakened, before merging with a frontal system on 25 September, which later intensified into a powerful hurricane-force low over the north Atlantic. \c\cWhile Post-Tropical Cyclone Leslie began to weaken on 27 September, it simultaneously began to reacquire subtropical characteristics, and by late on 28 September, Leslie had completed the transition to a subtropical storm once again. Leslie gradually intensified, becoming a hurricane early on 3 October, and initially peaked with winds of (130 km/h (81 mph) later that day. Leslie gradually weakened, falling to tropical storm intensity late on 4 October. The cyclone continued to slowly weaken before beginning to re-strengthen on 8 October. On 10 October, Leslie reached hurricane status for a second time. Leslie continued to slowly strengthen, reaching peak intensity with sustained winds of (150 km/h (93 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 969 hPa (28.6 inHg), on 12 October. Leslie then began to gradually weaken over the next day, while accelerating towards the northeast, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone just off the coast of Portugal on 13 October, before making landfall shortly afterward. Leslies remnant continued moving eastward while rapidly weakening, dissipating on 16 October near the Franco-Spanish border. \c\cHurricane Leslie prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings for Madeira Island, the first in its history. The storm was also responsible for 16 deaths, including 2 in Portugal and 14 in France.
In late October 2018, suspicious packages were sent to several American Democratic politicians, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. CNN received one addressed to former CIA Director John O.

The Woolsey Fire is a destructive wildfire burning in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties of the U.S. state of California. The fire ignited on November 8, 2018, and burned over 83,275 acres (33,700 hectares) of land. The fire destroyed at least 177 homes, killed 31 people, and prompted the evacuation of more than 265,000 people. It is now equals the deadliest wildfire on record in California - the 1933 Griffith Park disaster in Los Angeles. \c\cThe fire started near the Santa Susana Field Laboratory in the Santa Susana Mountains above the Simi Valley near the boundary between Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The Santa Ana winds, which often are a factor for Southern California fires, pushed the fire in a southerly direction throughout the first day. The freeway between the San Fernando Valley and the Conejo Valley was closed as the fire crossed and headed into the rugged Santa Monica Mountains. \c\cThe fire raced through the chaparral covered steep canyons where it encountered historic movie and TV sets, small ranches, and the homes of celebrities. Dozens of homes in Malibu, California were destroyed or damaged on both sides of Pacific Coast Highway. Many of these  were on Point Dume that juts out from the narrow coastal terrace that lies between the mountains and the Pacific Ocean. While the firefighters successfully protected Pepperdine University to the south, the entire portion of the Malibu coast north to the community of Solromar suffered damage from the fire.
The 2018 California wildfire season has been one of the most destructive on record in the state of California. During 2018, a total of 7,579 fires had burned an area of 1,667,855 acres (6,749.57 km2), the largest amount of burned acreage recorded in a California fire season, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the National Interagency Fire Center, as of November 11. The fires caused over $2.975 billion (2018 USD) in damages, including $1.366 billion in fire suppression costs. Through the end of August 2018, Cal Fire alone spent $432 million on operations. The Mendocino Complex Fire burned more than 459,000 acres (1,860 km2), becoming the largest complex fire in the states history, with the complexs Ranch Fire surpassing the Thomas Fire and the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 to become Californias single-largest recorded wildfire. \c\cIn mid-July to August 2018, a series of large wildfires erupted across California, mostly in the northern part of the state, including the destructive Carr Fire and the Mendocino Complex Fire. On August 4, 2018, a national disaster was declared in Northern California, due to the massive wildfires burning there. In November 2018, foehn winds caused another round of large, destructive fires to erupt across the state. This new batch of wildfires included the Camp Fire, which destroyed more than 6,700 structures and became Californias most destructive wildfire on record.
The Camp Fire is the most destructive and deadliest wildfire in California history. Named after Camp Creek Road, its place of origin, the fire started on November 8, 2018, in Butte County, in Northern California. The fire, pushed by strong Diablo winds, has burned more than 109,000 acres (440 km2), destroyed at least 6,713 structures, killed 31 civilians, and injured three firefighters, with most of the destruction occurring within the first two days of the fire. The fire forced the evacuation of Paradise and Magalia, and threatens the communities of Butte Creek Canyon, Butte Valley, Chico, Concow, Forest Ranch, Helltown, Honey Run, Inskip, Oroville, Stirling City, and Yankee Hill, destroying or heavily damaging homes, businesses, churches, a hospital, schools, and a rest home. Within the first day, the Camp Fire had essentially destroyed the town of Paradise, with an estimated 80% to 90% of buildings in the town destroyed. The fire began on the same day as the Woolsey Fire and the Hill Fire, in Southern California.
A tampon tax is a popular term used to call attention to the fact that tampons—and other feminine hygiene products—are subject to value-added tax, unlike the tax exemption status granted to other products considered basic necessities. Proponents of tax exemption argue that tampons, sanitary napkins, menstrual cups and comparable products constitute basic, unavoidable necessities for women and thus should be made tax exempt. \c\cProponents argue that feminine hygiene products serving the basic menstrual cycle should be classified alongside other unavoidable, tax exempt necessities, such as groceries and personal medical items. The BBC estimates that women—half of the global population—need to use feminine hygiene products for about a week each month for about 30 years. While sales tax policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed at the same rate as non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general consumption tax on sanitary products. When asked about equivalent exemptions for men, proponents argue that no male products, condoms included, are comparable to feminine hygiene products, since menstruation is biological and "feminine hygiene is not a choice". As the vast majority of consumers of feminine hygiene products are women, the increased cost has been criticized as being discriminatory against women. The tampon tax is not a special tax levied directly on feminine hygiene products. \c\cAfter the tax in Canada was removed mid-2015, women began protesting in other countries later that year. On July 21, 2018, India eliminated the Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 12% from sanitary napkins.
Dog meat is the flesh and other edible parts derived from dogs. Historically, human consumption of dog meat has been recorded in many parts of the world. In the 21st century, dog meat is consumed in some regions in China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Nigeria and it is still eaten or is legal to be eaten in other countries throughout the world. Some cultures view the consumption of dog meat as part of their traditional, ritualistic, or day-to-day cuisine, while other cultures consider consumption of dog meat a taboo, even where it had been consumed in the past. It was estimated in 2014 that worldwide, 25 million dogs are eaten each year by humans. \c\cBy 2018, South Korea was only country in Asia where dogs were reported to be routinely and intensively farmed for human consumption.
Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) (Urdu: تحریک لبیک پاکستان "Here-I-Am Movement Pakistan", referring to a phrase used in Islamic prayer) is an Islamist political party in Pakistan with Islamic ideology. The party was founded by preacher Khadim Hussain Rizvi. \c\cTLP is known for widespread (often countrywide) street power and massive protests in opposition to any change to Pakistans blasphemy law. The Islamic party came into existence, and subsequently rose to fame, after the hanging of Mumtaz Qadri, which the political party states was unjustifiable. \c\cTLP demands that Sharia law be established as law of Pakistan through a gradual legal and political process. \c\cMost of the partys members belong to Barelvi school of Islamic thought. \c\cIn 2017, TLP was allotted the crane as its election symbol. \c\cIn the 2018 general election, the party won two seats in the Provincial Assembly of Sindh.
The Brexit negotiations are the negotiations currently taking place between the United Kingdom and the European Union for the prospective withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, following the UKs referendum on EU membership in June 2016. \c\cA negotiating period began on 29 March 2017 when the United Kingdom served the withdrawal notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. The period for negotiation stated in Article 50 is two years from notification, unless an extension is agreed. \c\cOn 19 June 2017, the British Brexit Secretary, David Davis, arrived in Brussels to begin negotiation of the terms of the withdrawal with the Chief Negotiator appointed by the European Commission, Michel Barnier. \c\cNegotiations on the withdrawal agreement (which includes a transitional period and an outline of the objectives for a future relationship between the UK and the EU) have now been concluded, with the European Union indicating that no further negotiation or changes before the UK legally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 will be possible. \c\cIf the withdrawal agreement is ratified by the UK and other EU state governments and comes into force, future negotiation might also need to address Free Trade Agreement treaties between the European Union and its members (including the UK) for one part and third countries for the other part, and the tariff-rate quota, which might be split or renegotiated.
Genome editing, or genome engineering is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the genome of a living organism. Unlike early genetic engineering techniques that randomly inserts genetic material into a host genome, genome editing targets the insertions to site specific locations. \c\cIn 2018, the common methods for such editing use engineered nucleases, or "molecular scissors". These nucleases create site-specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) at desired locations in the genome. The induced double-strand breaks are repaired through nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR), resulting in targeted mutations (edits). \c\cAs of 2015 four families of engineered nucleases were used: meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector-based nucleases (TALEN), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) system. Nine genome editors were available as of 2017. \c\cGenome editing with engineered nucleases, ie all three major classes of these enzymes—zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and engineered meganucleases—were selected by Nature Methods as the 2011 Method of the Year. The CRISPR-Cas system was selected by Science as 2015 Breakthrough of the Year.
Fake news is a type of yellow journalism or propaganda that consists of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional print and broadcast news media or online social media. The term is also at times used to cast doubt upon legitimate news from an opposing political standpoint, a tactic known as the lying press. The false information is then often reverberated as misinformation in social media, but occasionally finds its way to the mainstream media as well. Fake news is written and published usually with the intent to mislead in order to damage an agency, entity, or person, and/or gain financially or politically, often using sensationalist, dishonest, or outright fabricated headlines to increase readership, online sharing, and Internet click revenue. In the latter case, it is similar to sensational online "clickbait" headlines and relies on advertising revenue generated from this activity, regardless of the veracity of the published stories. Intentionally misleading and deceptive fake news differs from obvious satire or parody, which is intended to amuse rather than mislead its audience. \c\cThe relevance of fake news has increased in post-truth politics. For media outlets, the ability to attract viewers to their websites is necessary to generate online advertising revenue. If publishing a story with false content attracts users, this benefits advertisers and improves ratings. Easy access to online advertisement revenue, increased political polarization, and the popularity of social media, primarily the Facebook News Feed, have all been implicated in the spread of fake news, which competes with legitimate news stories. Hostile government actors have also been implicated in generating and propagating fake news, particularly during elections. \c\cFake news undermines serious media coverage and makes it more difficult for journalists to cover significant news stories. An analysis by Buzzfeed found that the top 20 fake news stories about the 2016 U.S. presidential election received more engagement on Facebook than the top 20 election stories from 19 major media outlets. Anonymously-hosted fake news websites lacking known publishers have also been criticized, because they make it difficult to prosecute sources of fake news for libel. \c\cDuring and after his presidential campaign and election, Donald Trump popularized the term "fake news" when he used it to describe the negative press coverage of himself. In part as a result of Trumps use of the term, the term has come under increasing criticism, and in October 2018 the British government decided that it will no longer use the term because it is "a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes."
The Corinaldo stampede occurred at around 1am on 8 December 2018 at the Lanterna Azzurra nightclub in Corinaldo, Italy. Six people were killed: three girls and two boys aged 14-16, and a 39-year-old woman accompanying her daughter to the event. 59 other people were injured. \c\cAccording to investigators and state radio, there were about 1,000 people inside at the time, even though the nightclubs maximum capacity was approximately 870.
The use of cannabis in New Zealand is governed by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, which makes unauthorised possession of any amount of cannabis illegal. On 11 December 2018, the country passed a new law allowing for much broader use of medical marijuana, making the drug available to a wide range of chronically or terminally ill patients. \c\cIn October 2017, following the ascension of a Labour/Green/New Zealand First coalition to government, the Greens announced a nationwide referendum of the legality of cannabis for both medical and personal use, set to be held by 2020. \c\cCannabis is the fourth-most widely used recreational drug in New Zealand, after caffeine, alcohol and tobacco, and the most widely used illegal drug. In the population of more than four million, 13.4% of those aged 16–64 use cannabis. This ranks as the ninth-highest cannabis consumption level in the world.
On September 16, 2007, employees of Blackwater Security Consulting (now Academi), a private military company, shot at Iraqi civilians, killing 17 and injuring 20 in Nisour Square, Baghdad, while escorting a U.S. embassy convoy.  The killings outraged Iraqis and strained relations between Iraq and the United States. In 2014, four Blackwater employees were tried and convicted in U.S. federal court; one of murder, and the other three of manslaughter and firearms charges. \c\cBlackwater guards claimed that the convoy was ambushed and that they fired at the attackers in defense of the convoy. The Iraqi government and Iraqi police investigator Faris Saadi Abdul stated that the killings were unprovoked. The next day, Blackwater Worldwides license to operate in Iraq was temporarily revoked. The U.S. State Department has said that "innocent life was lost", and according to the Washington Post, a military report appeared to corroborate "the Iraqi governments contention that Blackwater was at fault". The Iraqi government vowed to punish Blackwater. The incident sparked at least five investigations, including one from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI investigation found that, of the 17 Iraqis killed by the guards, at least 14 were shot without cause. \c\cIn December 2008, the U.S. charged five Blackwater guards with 14 counts of manslaughter, 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and a weapons violation but on December 31, 2009, a U.S. district judge dismissed all charges on the grounds that the case against the Blackwater guards had been improperly built on testimony given in exchange for immunity. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki harshly criticized the dismissal. In April 2011, a U.S. federal appeals court reinstated the manslaughter charges against Paul A. Slough, Evan S. Liberty, Dustin L. Heard and Donald W. Ball after closed-door testimony. The court said "We find that the district courts findings depend on an erroneous view of the law," A fifth guard had his charges dismissed, and a sixth guard (Jeremy Ridgeway) pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. On January 6, 2012, Blackwater settled a lawsuit filed on behalf of six of the victims for an undisclosed sum. On October 22, 2014, a Federal District Court jury convicted Nick Slatten of first-degree murder, and three other guards (Slough, Liberty and Heard) guilty of all three counts of voluntary manslaughter and using a machine gun to commit a violent crime.  On April 13, 2015, Slatten was sentenced to life in prison, while the other three guards were sentenced to 30 years in prison. \c\cOn August 4, 2017, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit tossed Slattens murder conviction and ordered the other defendants to be re-sentenced.  A new trial was also recommended for Slatten, on the grounds that it was unjustifiable to try him with his co-defendants, and that he should have been tried separately.
General elections will be held in Bangladesh on 30 December 2018 to select members of the Jatiya Sangsad.
General elections were held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 30 December 2018, to determine a successor to incumbent President Joseph Kabila. Preliminary results were scheduled to be announced on 6 January 2019, with the final result on January 15 and the inauguration of the next president on January 18. However, It was later announced that the announcement of preliminary results would be delayed, as less than half of the votes have been verified. \c\cAccording to the constitution, the second and final term of President Kabila expired on 20 December 2016. General elections were originally scheduled for 27 November 2016, but were delayed with a promise to hold them by the end of 2017. This promise was subsequently broken, but after both international and internal pressure the elections were finally scheduled for 23 December 2018. They were, however, postponed for a week on 20 December 2018 due to a fire in the electoral commissions warehouse in Kinshasa destroying 8,000 electronic voting machines. \c\cIncumbent President Kabila is constitutionally unable to participate. He and his party, the People’s Party for Reconstruction and Democracy, support the candidacy of Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, the former Minister of the Interior. \c\cIn opposition to Shadarys candidacy, seven opposition leaders, including Jean-Pierre Bemba and Moïse Katumbi, nominated Martin Fayulu as their candidate for president. However, Félix Tshisekedi and Vital Kamerhe soon after broke this agreement and agreed that Tshisekedi should run for president while Kamerhe would serve as his campaign manager and become Prime Minister if he won. They also agreed that Tshisekedi and his party will back a candidate from Kamerhes Union for the Congolese Nation in the 2023 presidential elections.

On the night of February 20, 2016, a series of apparently random shootings took place at an apartment complex, a car dealership, and outside a restaurant in Kalamazoo County, Michigan. Six people were killed and two others were injured. \c\cPolice detained a 45-year-old Uber driver, Jason Brian Dalton, as a "strong suspect" in the shootings. He was subsequently charged with murder, assault, and criminal firearm use two days after the shootings. After he was found competent to stand trial, Daltons lawyers planned a legal insanity defense for their client.
General elections were held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 30 December 2018, to determine a successor to incumbent President Joseph Kabila, as well as for the 500 seats of the National Assembly and 750 provincial council seats. Preliminary results were scheduled to be announced on 6 January 2019, with the final result on 15 January and the inauguration of the next president on 18 January. However, it was later announced on 5 January that the publication of preliminary results would be delayed, as less than half of the votes have been obtained by the election commission. On 10 January the election commission declared Félix Tshisekedi, leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress opposition party, as the winner of the election. Martin Fayulu, who came in second, has claimed that the election was rigged and that he will challenge the result in the DRCs Constitutional Court. The countrys influential Roman Catholic Church, which deployed 40,000 election monitors, has also said the official result does not align with its observations, which place Fayulu as the winner. On 12 January it became known that parties supporting Joseph Kabila won the majority in the National Assembly. \c\cAccording to the constitution, the second and final term of President Kabila expired on 20 December 2016.

The 2018–19 North American winter is winter in North America as it is occurring across the continent from late 2018 through early 2019. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2018 occurred on December 21, 2018, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2019 will occur on March 20, 2019. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 28. Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. Since both definitions span the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm in two different years.
Between 2010 and 2017 there was a series of disappearances of men in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In the early part of the decade the Toronto Police Service (TPS) had created Project Houston, a divisional task force which linked the disappearances of three men of South Asian or Middle Eastern origin to Church and Wellesley, Torontos gay village.  However, the investigation was unable to determine if the disappearances were related or if a crime had been committed.  In the summer of 2017, amid public speculation of a serial killer at Church and Wellesley, evidence was gained from another missing-persons investigation which led TPS to create a second divisional task force, Project Prism.  In January 2018 Project Prism investigators obtained evidence connecting two disappearances to Bruce McArthur, a 66-year-old self-employed landscaper, whom they arrested on January 18, 2018. \c\cPolice say that they found evidence in McArthurs apartment leading to homicide charges, and that they found the dismembered remains of several men in planter boxes at a residence where McArthur stored landscaping equipment. McArthur and many of his alleged victims were active on online dating apps for men who have sex with men, such as Manjam.com and Silverdaddies.com, where McArthur stated that he wanted to meet submissive men. As of April 11, 2018, McArthur has been charged with eight counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of missing men, most of whom have been linked to Church and Wellesley. On January 29, 2019, McArthur pleaded guilty to all eight counts in Ontario Superior Court. McArthur is the most-prolific known serial killer in Toronto. \c\cThe criminal investigation of McArthur has been described as unprecedented, involving numerous possible crime scenes, identification of skeletal remains, judicial authorizations for data hosted on foreign servers, and examination of cold cases dating back to the mid-1970s.  It is expected to become the largest investigation conducted by the TPS and has also called on the resources of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and other police and forensic services.  Criticisms of the TPSs handling of the missing persons investigations have led to a number of internal reviews, an external review called by the civilian Toronto Police Services Board (TPSB), and the formation of a dedicated missing persons unit.
The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty, formally Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles) is a 1987 arms control agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union (and later its successor state the Russian Federation). Signed in Washington, D.C. by President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev on 8 December 1987, the treaty was ratified by the United States Senate on 27 May 1988 and came into force on 1 June 1988. \c\cThe INF Treaty eliminated all nuclear and conventional missiles, as well as their launchers, with ranges of 500–1,000 kilometers (310–620 mi) (short-range) and 1,000–5,500 km (620–3,420 mi) (intermediate-range). The treaty did not cover sea-launched missiles. By May 1991, 2,692 missiles were eliminated, followed by 10 years of on-site verification inspections. \c\cOn 20 October 2018, citing Russian non-compliance, US President Donald Trump announced that he was withdrawing the US from the treaty. Numerous prominent nuclear arms control experts, including George Shultz, Richard Lugar and Sam Nunn, urged Trump to preserve the treaty. Russian president Vladimir Putin announced on 20 November 2018 that the Kremlin was prepared to discuss INF with Washington but would "retaliate" if the United States withdrew. On 1 February 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announces the U.S. was suspending the treaty.
On November 30, 2018, at 8:29 a.m. AKST (17:29 UTC), a magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit South Central Alaska. The earthquakes epicenter was near Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson, about 10 miles (16 km) north of Anchorage, and occurred at a depth of 29 miles (47 km). It was followed six minutes later by a magnitude 5.7 aftershock centered 2.5 miles (4.0 km) north-northwest of the municipality. The earthquake could be felt as far away as Fairbanks. \c\cThe National Tsunami Warning Center—itself located inside the quake zone, in Palmer, Alaska, 42 miles (68 km) northeast of Anchorage—issued tsunami warnings for nearby coastal areas, including Cook Inlet and the Kenai Peninsula, but they were lifted shortly after.
The 2018–19 North American winter is winter in North America as it is occurring across the continent from late 2018 through early 2019. So far, notable events have included snow in the Southeast in December and a strong cold wave that affected the U.S. in late January. Unlike previous winters, a developing El Niño was expected to influence weather patterns across North America. \c\cWhile there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used.

As of January 2019, Elizabeth Warren, the senior United States Senator from Massachusetts, has been considered a top contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination for President. Warren announced on December 31, 2018, that she was forming an exploratory committee to consider running for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election.  On February 9, 2019, Warren officially announced her run at a rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

Unlike previous winters, a developing El Niño was expected to influence weather patterns across North America. \c\cWhile there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2018 occurred on December 21, 2018, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2019 will occur on March 20, 2019. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 28. Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. Since both definitions span the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm in two different years.

After this, Pakistan scrambled their own jets, but state no casualties or damage has been inflicted.
Nuclear warfare (sometimes atomic warfare or thermonuclear warfare) is a military conflict or political strategy in which nuclear weaponry is used to inflict damage on the enemy.  Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction; in contrast to conventional warfare, nuclear warfare can produce destruction in a much shorter time and can have a long-lasting radiological warfare result. A major nuclear exchange would have long-term effects, primarily from the fallout released, and could also lead to a "nuclear winter" that could last for decades, centuries, or even millennia after the initial attack. Some analysts dismiss the nuclear winter hypothesis, and calculate that even with nuclear weapon stockpiles at Cold War highs, although there would be billions of casualties, billions more rural people would nevertheless survive. However, others have argued that secondary effects of a nuclear holocaust, such as nuclear famine and societal collapse, would cause almost every human on Earth to starve to death. \c\cSo far, two nuclear weapons have been used in the course of warfare, both by the United States near the end of World War II. On August 6, 1945, a uranium gun-type device (code name "Little Boy") was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, on August 9, a plutonium implosion-type device (code name "Fat Man") was detonated over the Japanese city of Nagasaki. These two bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately 120,000 people. \c\cAfter World War II, nuclear weapons were also developed by the Soviet Union (1949), the United Kingdom (1952), France (1960), and the Peoples Republic of China (1964), which contributed to the state of conflict and extreme tension that became known as the Cold War. In 1974, India, and in 1998, Pakistan, two countries that were openly hostile toward each other, developed nuclear weapons. Israel (1960s) and North Korea (2006) are also thought to have developed stocks of nuclear weapons, though it is not known how many. The Israeli government has never admitted or denied to having nuclear weapons, although it is known to have constructed the reactor and reprocessing plant necessary for building nuclear weapons. South Africa also manufactured several complete nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but subsequently became the first country to voluntarily destroy their domestically made weapons stocks and abandon further production (1990s). Nuclear weapons have been detonated on over 2,000 occasions for testing purposes and demonstrations. \c\cAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the resultant end of the Cold War, the threat of a major nuclear war between the two nuclear superpowers was generally thought to have declined. Since then, concern over nuclear weapons has shifted to the prevention of localized nuclear conflicts resulting from nuclear proliferation, and the threat of nuclear terrorism.

Thunderbolt is the brand name of a hardware interface developed by Intel (in collaboration with Apple) that allows the connection of external peripherals to a computer. Thunderbolt 1 and 2 use the same connector as Mini DisplayPort (MDP), whereas Thunderbolt 3 re-uses the Type-C connector from USB. It was initially developed and marketed under the name Light Peak, and first sold as part of a consumer product on 24 February 2011. \c\cThunderbolt combines PCI Express (PCIe) and DisplayPort (DP) into two serial signals, and additionally provides DC power, all in one cable. Up to six peripherals may be supported by one connector through various topologies.
The 2018–19 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season is an ongoing and above-average event of the annual cycle of tropical cyclone and subtropical cyclone formation. It officially began on November 15, 2018, and will end on April 30, 2019, with the exception for Mauritius and the Seychelles, for which it will end on May 15, 2019. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of 90°E and south of the Equator. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Réunion. \c\cThe first tropical cyclone was a moderate tropical storm that did not receive a name formed northeast Madagascar on September 13, 2018, two months before the official start of the season. Two cyclones formed in the month of November, with Intense Tropical Cyclone Alcide forming on November 5 and Severe Tropical Storm Bouchra. Two tropical cyclones formed in the month of December, Cilida and Kenanga. Intense Tropical Cyclone Kenanga crossed into the basin from the Australian region, retaining its name assigned by TCWC Jakarta. Two moderate tropical storms formed in the month of January 2019, Desmond and Eketsang. In the month of February, two simultaneous tropical cyclones, Funani and Gelena, formed. The season saw six intense tropical cyclones, the most since 2006–07.
Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya. On 10 March 2019 a Boeing 737 MAX 8 operating the flight crashed with no survivors. \c\cThe accident marks the second time in less than a year that a Boeing 737 MAX 8 has been involved in an airline disaster, following the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia in late 2018.
Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport in Ethiopia to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya. On 10 March 2019, the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft crashed six minutes after takeoff near the town of Bishoftu, killing all 157 passengers and crew aboard the aircraft. \c\cFlight 302 was the first fatal accident occurring on an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft since Ethiopian Airlines Flight 409 crashed in January 2010. It is the deadliest aircraft incident in Ethiopian Airlines history, superseding the fatal hijacking of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961 near Comoros in 1996. It is also the deadliest aircraft accident to occur in Ethiopia, superseding the crash of an Ethiopian Air Force Antonov An-26 in 1982, which killed 73. \c\cThe accident aircraft type, the Boeing 737 MAX 8, first flew on 29 January 2016 and entered service in 2017, making it one of the newest aircraft in Boeings commercial airliner offerings, and the newest generation of Boeing 737. As of January 2019, 350 have been produced, and one other has crashed, Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia in October 2018. According to safety experts, Boeing withheld information about potential hazards associated with a new flight-control feature suspected of playing a role in the Lion Air jet accident. Following the accident, the Boeing 737 MAX was grounded in several countries and by several airlines.

Bloody Sunday, sometimes called the Bogside Massacre, was an incident on 30 January 1972 in the Bogside area of Derry, Northern Ireland, when British soldiers shot 28 unarmed civilians during a protest march against internment. Fourteen people died: thirteen were killed outright, while the death of another man four months later was attributed to his injuries. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers and some were shot while trying to help the wounded. Other protesters were injured by rubber bullets or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles. The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as "1 Para". \c\cTwo investigations have been held by the British government. The Widgery Tribunal, held in the immediate aftermath of the incident, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. It described the soldiers shooting as "bordering on the reckless", but accepted their claims that they shot at gunmen and bomb-throwers. The report was widely criticised as a "whitewash". The Saville Inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville of Newdigate, was established in 1998 to reinvestigate the incident. Following a 12-year inquiry, Savilles report was made public in 2010 and concluded that the killings were both "unjustified" and "unjustifiable". It found that all of those shot were unarmed, that none were posing a serious threat, that no bombs were thrown, and that soldiers "knowingly put forward false accounts" to justify their firing. On the publication of the report, British prime minister David Cameron made a formal apology on behalf of the United Kingdom. Following this, police began a murder investigation into the killings. \c\cBloody Sunday was one of the most significant events of "the Troubles" because a large number of civilians were killed, by forces of the state, in full view of the public and the press. It was the highest number of people killed in a single shooting incident during the conflict. Bloody Sunday increased Catholic and Irish nationalist hostility towards the British Army and exacerbated the conflict. Support for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) rose and there was a surge of recruitment into the organisation, especially locally.
A rocket strike occurred on March 14, 2019, when two rockets were launched from the Gaza Strip towards Tel Aviv. The incident is the first rocket strike against Tel Aviv in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict since 2014 Gaza war beach bombing incidents.
Burning Sun scandal, also known as Burning Sun club scandal was a 2019 entertainment scandal in Seoul, South Korea which involved several celebrities, including Korean idols in popular K-pop groups, and police officials. It began on January 28, 2019, when MBC Newsdesk reported a November 2018 alleged assault of 29-year-old Kim Sang-kyo at the Burning Sun, a prominent nightclub in Gangnam, by a staff member. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency investigation soon turned to one concerning the clubs alleged involvement in prostitution, drug trafficking and police corruption. Seungri of the band Big Bang, one of the clubs executive directors, released a statement on February 2, apologizing for the assault and saying he was not present at the club at the time, subsequently resigned his position at the club, and from the entertainment industry on March 11, after being charged with sex bribery. \c\cThe scandal quickly encompassed allegations of rape and spy cams when singer and entertainer Jung Joon-young confessed to secretly filming himself having sex with women and sharing the videos, without their knowledge or consent, and he resigned from entertaining on March 12. While looking into the Burning Sun scandal, SBS had discovered 2015-2016 videos and conversations he shared in chat groups, on the social media app KakaoTalk, with other celebrities, including Seungri, and acquaintances. in one alleged chat conversation, Jung said, “Let’s all get together online, hit the strip bar and rape them in the car.” Another member responded, “Our lives are like a movie. We have done so many things that could put us in jail. We just haven’t killed anyone." On March 14, Yong Jun-hyung of Highlight and Choi Jong-hoon of F.T. Island admitted they were participants in the chatroom, and resigned their positions. The agency for Lee Jong-hyun of CNBLUE, FNC Entertainment, admitted his involvement on March 15. The chatroom exposé also affected actor Cha Tae-hyun and comedian Kim Jun-ho with allegations of golf gambling in large amounts. They quit all their television programs, including 2 Days & 1 Night, where they were cast members with Jung, and which had already announced suspended production on March 16, due to the scandal. \c\cIn early March, the scandal led to street protests in front of the Burning Sun, Seungris other nightclub, Monkey Museum, and other nightclubs, calling for an end to a South Korean culture that treats women as sexual objects. Although thousands of women had rallied in 2018 against illicit filming and sharing, which is common in South Korea, the allegations against the wholesome image of pop idols still surprised the public. \c\cThe serious nature of the scandal, which included allegations that illegal drug use and sexual violence occurred at the Burning Sun, that Seungri arranged sexual services for potential investors from overseas, and Jungs filming and sharing of illicit videos of himself having sex with women, prompted a response from the countrys president. On March 18, President Moon Jae-in ordered a thorough investigation, to include two past similar cases, one involving a former vice justice minister, Kim Hak-ui, who was cleared of a scandal in 2013, but had new allegations of raping women and appearing in sex videos with them. The second case was the 2009 suicide of rookie actress Jang Ja-yeon, whose suicide note said she was forced to have sex with as many as thirty men by her entertainment agency. The handling of those cases had been criticized for nonimpartiality due to the involvement of high-profile figures.
In late October 2018, sixteen packages containing pipe bombs were mailed via the U.S. Postal Service to several prominent critics of U.S. President Donald Trump, including leading Democratic Party politicians such as former U.S. President Barack Obama, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. While the packages were initially treated as live bombs, analysis indicated some of them could not explode, though it is unclear if they were "intentional" duds. \c\cOther people who were sent packages include U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, U.S. Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, two former intelligence chiefs (ex-CIA Director John O. Brennan and ex-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper), billionaires George Soros and Tom Steyer, and actor Robert De Niro. One package was addressed only to CNN and sent to its world headquarters. \c\cThe attempted bombings prompted investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. All sixteen confirmed bombs sent were actual improvised explosive devices, though none of them had a trigger mechanism and none of the devices exploded outside of a controlled setting. A suspect, Cesar Altieri Sayoc Jr. was arrested in Florida on October 26 and charged with five federal crimes the following week. The FBI is investigating the case as domestic terrorism.
The Special Counsel investigation (also referred to as the Mueller Probe or Mueller Investigation) was a United States law enforcement and counterintelligence investigation of the Russian governments efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. According to its authorizing document, which was signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on May 17, 2017, the investigation included any possible links or coordination between Donald Trumps presidential campaign and the Russian government as well as "any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation." The scope of the investigation reportedly includes potential obstruction of justice by Trump and others. It was conducted by the United States Department of Justice Special Counsels Office, headed by Robert Mueller, a Republican and former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). As part of the investigation, Mueller also took over several other existing FBI investigations, including those into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. \c\cThe investigation has resulted in dozens of indictments for federal crimes, and at least eight guilty pleas, or convictions. In August 2018, Manafort was found guilty on eight felony counts of financial crimes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and, a month later, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, in a plea bargain for his full cooperation with prosecutors. The investigation also led to Flynn pleading guilty to making false statements to the FBI and, as part of a December 2017 plea deal, he is required to be a cooperating witness in the investigations. Mueller further secured guilty pleas from Manaforts business partner, Rick Gates, Dutch attorney Alex van der Zwaan, former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, lobbyist W. Samuel Patten, and Richard Pinedo; all, except Van der Zwaan, have become cooperating witnesses for investigators. In February 2018, Mueller indicted 13 Russian citizens and three Russian entities, most notably the Internet Research Agency and, in June 2018, added an indictment of Konstantin Kilimnik, Manaforts business partner. In July 2018, 12 members of the Russian GRU cyber espionage group known as Fancy Bear, responsible for the 2016 DNC email hacking, were indicted. Investigations into Trumps personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, were referred to the US Attorneys office of the Southern District of New York. Longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone was indicted on seven charges in January 2019. \c\cWhile enjoying bipartisan support, the special counsel investigation became subject to criticism by Trump and his supporters. On January 30, 2019, an FBI court filing revealed that someone located in Russia was also attempting to discredit the special counsel investigation through Twitter. Russian people have also sent falsified documents to reporters. Some allegations of investigators misconduct have been raised and were almost immediately debunked. Trump and his supporters criticized the cost of the investigation; by December 2018, the investigation had cost approximately $25 million, while gaining approximately $48 million through asset forfeitures. On March 22, 2019, Robert Mueller completed his nearly 2 year investigation by submiting a report to Attorney General Bill Barr. It is currently under Justice Department review. It is reported that the "Principle Conclusion" of the investigation will be released sometime between March 23-24th. \c\cOn March 22, 2019, the Special Counsel submitted their final report to Attorney General William Barr.

Barr announced that there is no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia and that no conclusion was reached on whether Trump obstructed justice. The letter did detail two attempts which were made by Russia to influence the election in Trumps favor.
On February 14, 2018, a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing seventeen students and staff members and injuring seventeen others. Witnesses identified Nikolas Cruz, a nineteen-year-old who had been expelled as a student, as the assailant. Cruz fled the scene on foot by blending with other students. He was arrested about one hour later in nearby Coral Springs. He confessed to being the perpetrator, and he was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Police and prosecutors have not offered a motive and are investigating "a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior", but Cruz offered several motives for the crime. \c\cCruzs killing spree is the deadliest high school shooting in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre that killed 13 in Colorado on April 20, 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control following mass shootings in Las Vegas, Nevada and Sutherland Springs, Texas, respectively, in October and November 2017. \c\cIn 2016 and 2017, the sheriffs office received a number of tips about Cruzs threats to carry out a school shooting. The FBI learned that a YouTube user with the username "nikolas cruz" posted a message in September 2017 about becoming a school shooter, but the agency could not identify the user. In January 2018, someone contacted the FBI tip line with a direct complaint that Cruz had made a death threat, but the complaint was not forwarded to the local FBI office. \c\cFollowing the massacre, the anger and frustration of Parkland student survivors intensified towards the perceived inaction of the Republican-dominated legislature on the wider issue of mass shootings and gun violence. The students founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for legislative action on gun violence. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that raised the minimum age for buying rifles in Florida from 18 to 21. The legislation also established waiting periods and background checks for gun buyers. The law allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school police. So-called "bump stocks" would now be banned and some potentially violent or mentally unstable persons would be prohibited from possessing guns. The National Rifle Association (NRA) immediately filed a lawsuit that challenged the federal constitutionality of the age requirement clause. \c\cAfter the shooting, the Broward County Sheriffs Office received national criticism for its handling of the police response, with much of the criticism being directed at Sheriff Scott Israel for not addressing loopholes that allowed Cruz to purchase a firearm despite his lengthy record of threatening behavior. Israels deputies were also criticized for staying outside the school and not attempting to confront Cruz while the shooting was in progress. Several police officers who responded to the shooting later resigned, and Israel was suspended by new Governor Ron DeSantis in January 2019 for his conduct in regards to the shooting. A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the attack condemned the police inaction in the wake of the attack and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security, including the possibility of allowing educators and staff members to carry their own firearms on school property, in order to prevent further attacks.
The Gaza–Israel conflict is a part of the wider Israeli–Palestinian conflict. \c\cThe conflict originated with the election of the Islamist political party Hamas in 2005 and 2006 in the Gaza Strip and escalated with the split of the Palestinian Authority into the Fatah government in the West Bank and the Hamas government in Gaza and the following violent ousting of Fatah after Fatah lost the election to Hamas. Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel, Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, and the joint Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza have exacerbated the conflict. The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets illegal under international law. \c\cAs part of its 2005 disengagement plan, Israel retained exclusive control over Gazas airspace and territorial waters, continued to patrol and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, with the exception of its southernmost border (where Egypt retained control of the border and border crossings were supervised by European monitors) and continued to monitor and blockade Gazas coastline. Israel largely provides and controls Gazas water supply, electricity and communications infrastructure.  According to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, Israel remains an occupying power under international law. The United Nations has stated that under resolutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council, it regards Gaza to be part of the "Occupied Palestinian Territories". Meanwhile, the Fatah government in the West Bank, internationally recognized as the sole representative of the State of Palestine, refers to the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian state and does not recognize the Hamas government.
The Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market 2016/0280(COD), also known as the EU Copyright Directive, is a European Union (EU) directive intended to ensure "a well-functioning marketplace for the exploitation of works and other subject-matter.. taking into account in particular digital and cross-border uses of protected content". It extends existing European Union copyright law and is a component of the EUs Digital Single Market project. First introduced by the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs on 20 June 2018, a revised proposal was approved by the European Parliament on 12 September 2018. A final version resulting from negotiations during Trilogue discussions was presented to the European Parliament on 13 February 2019. The measure was approved by Parliament on 26 March 2019. \c\cThe European Council describe their key goals as protecting press publications, reducing the "value gap" between the profits made by Internet platforms and content creators, encouraging "collaboration" between these two groups, and creating copyright exceptions for text and data mining. The directives specific proposals include giving press publishers direct copyright over use of their publications by Internet platforms such as online news aggregators (Article 11 also called the "link tax") and requiring websites who primarily host content posted by users to take "effective and proportionate" measures to prevent unauthorised postings of copyrighted content or be liable for their users actions (Article 13 also called the "upload filter"). \c\cArticles 11 and 13 (respectively renumbered as 15 and 17 in the latest version) have attracted widespread criticism and controversy from European and American parties, with fears that the directives would inhibit online expression by requiring websites to obtain licenses in order to link to news articles, and Article 13 would require use of content-matching technologies that cannot identify fair dealing such as parody. A Change.org petition has gathered more than 5 million signatures opposing the directive as of 21 March 2019, the most in history. Initial supporters of the directive, largely media groups and large publishers, reject these arguments with claims that a disinformation and astroturfing campaign was carried out by big Internet platforms. These large media groups and publishers, however, have had much greater contact between their lobbyists and MEPs than the technology industry. A group of major international media and music rights-holders initially supported the proposal, but flipped to opposing as it was finalised in February 2019. The International Federation of Journalists calls the current version "bad for journalism". David Kaye, the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression warns that the directive might harm freedom of expression in Europe. Public protests against the directive have seen tens to hundreds of thousands of people marching in the streets of cities in Germany and across Europe.
Intense Tropical Cyclone Idai (/ɪˈdaɪ/) was one of the worst tropical cyclones on record to affect Africa and the Southern Hemisphere as a whole. The long-lived storm caused catastrophic damage in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, leaving more than 800 people dead and hundreds more are missing. Idai is the second-deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the South-West Indian Ocean basin, behind only the 1892 Mauritius cyclone. In the Southern Hemisphere, it currently ranks as the third-deadliest tropical cyclone on record, behind the aforementioned 1892 Mauritius cyclone. \c\cand Cyclone Flores in 1973. \c\cThe tenth named storm and seventh intense tropical cyclone of the 2018–19 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Idai originated from a tropical depression that formed off the east coast of Mozambique on 4 March. The storm, Tropical Depression 11, made landfall in Mozambique later in the day and remained a tropical cyclone through its trek over land. On 9 March, the depression re-emerged into the Mozambique Channel and strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Idai on next day. Idai then began a stint of rapid intensification, reaching an initial peak intensity as an intense tropical cyclone, with sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on 11 March. Idai then began to weaken, due to ongoing structural changes within its inner core, falling to tropical cyclone intensity. Idais intensity remained stagnant for about a day or so before it began to re-intensify. On 14 March, Idai reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 940 hPa (27.76 inHg). Idai then began to weaken as it approached the coast of Mozambique, due to less favourable conditions. On 15 March, Idai made landfall near Beira, Mozambique, as an intense tropical cyclone, subsequently weakening into a remnant low on 16 March. Idais remnants slowly continued inland for another day, before reversing course and turning eastward on 17 March. On 19 March, Idais remnants re-emerged into the Mozambique Channel and eventually dissipated on 21 March. \c\cIdai brought strong winds and caused severe flooding in Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe, which killed 856 people – 534 in Mozambique, 261 in Zimbabwe, 60 in Malawi, and one in Madagascar – and affected more than 3 million others. Catastrophic damage occurred in and around Beira in central Mozambique. The President of Mozambique stated that more than 1,000 people may have died in the storm. A major humanitarian crisis unfolded in the wake of the cyclone, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of assistance across Mozambique and Zimbabwe. In the former nation, rescuers were forced to let some people die in order to save others. Infrastructural damages from Idai across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Malawi were estimated to be at least US$1 billion (2019 USD), making Idai the costliest tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean basin.
The SNC-Lavalin affair (French: Laffaire SNC-Lavalin), also known as the SNC-Lavalin controversy or SNC-Lavalin scandal, or sometimes dubbed the Raybould Scandal or affair  and colloquially referred to as LavScam, is an ongoing political scandal in Canada involving alleged political interference and obstruction of justice by the Prime Ministers Office and the former minister of justice Jody Wilson-Raybould. The allegations centre around purported pressure put on Jody Wilson-Raybould and the potentially unethical decisions made by Raybould, Canadas Minister of Justice and Attorney General at the time, to intervene in an ongoing criminal prosecution case against Quebec construction giant SNC-Lavalin. \c\cDuring Justice Committee hearings, Wilson-Raybould testified regarding efforts of various members within government to interfere in her duty as Attorney General by pressuring her to offer SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement. The Trudeau government has maintained that no undue pressure was applied to the Attorney General, that no laws were broken, that use of a deferred prosecution agreement could save 9,000 jobs in Canada, and that the whole situation resulted from a misunderstanding and "erosion of trust" between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould.

On June 21, 2017, airport police Lt. Jeff Neville was stabbed in the neck at Bishop International Airport in the city of Flint, Michigan, in the United States. The man, Amor Ftouhi, reportedly yelled "Allahu akbar" during the attack and was travelling on a Canadian passport. Bomb sniffing dogs searched the evacuated airport, finding nothing. He was charged with violence at an international airport and interfering with airport security. He was later charged with committing an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries. Found guilty of all three charges in November 2018, he is was sentenced to life in prison in April 2019.
The Special Counsel investigation of 2017 to 2019, also referred to as the Mueller probe, Mueller investigation and Russia investigation, was a United States counterintelligence investigation of the Russian governments efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. According to its authorizing document, which was signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on May 17, 2017, the investigations scope included allegations that there were links or coordination between Donald Trumps presidential campaign and the Russian government as well as "any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation." It included a criminal investigation which looked into potential obstruction of justice charges against Trump and others within the campaign and administration. Conducted by the Department of Justice Special Counsels Office headed by Robert Mueller, a Republican and former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Special Counsel investigation began eight days after President Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey, who had been leading existing FBI investigations since July 2016 into links between Trump associates and Russian officials. Following Comeys firing, over 130 Democratic Party lawmakers in Congress called for the appointment of a special counsel, while the FBI began investigating Trump for obstruction of justice. The special counsels office took over both these investigations from the FBI. \c\cAs of April 2019, thirty-four individuals were indicted by Special Counsel investigators. Eight have pled guilty to or been convicted of felonies, including at least five Trump associates and campaign officials. Trumps former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who had a four year long relationship with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak and in December 2015 had been photographed sitting next to Vladimir Putin on an undisclosed trip to Russia, and who Russian intelligence agents described as an ally they could use to influence Trump, pled guilty to making false statements about his discussions of sanctions with the ambassador during the campaign. Sanctions overwhelmingly passed by Congress in response to Russian electoral interference were not imposed by Trump, to the astonishment of some observers. Muellers proposed plea agreement with Flynn was rejected by the sentencing judge, who accused Flynn of selling out his country. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was found guilty on eight felony counts and later pled guilty to conspiracy to defraud and obstruction of justice. A lobbyist for Russian interests in Ukraine for a decade, Manafort had been released on an agreement to cooperate, but subsequently lied to investigators and was sentenced to over seven years in jail. Muellers team also indicted twenty-five Russian citizens and three Russian entities, including the Internet Research Agency, twelve members of the Russian GRU cyber espionage group known as Fancy Bear, responsible for the 2016 DNC email hacking, and in June 2018 added an indictment of Konstantin Kilimnik, Manaforts business partner, to whom he had passed internal campaign polling data, and who investigators accused of working for Russian intelligence. Also among the convicted were Trumps personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who pled guilty to making hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal for Trump in violation of campaign finance and possibly state tax laws, Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, and Russian spy Maria Butina. Longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone was indicted on seven charges. \c\cInitially receiving bipartisan support, the Special Counsel investigation was later criticized by Trump and his supporters. Trump has criticized people or groups related to the investigation over 1,000 times. On January 30, 2019, an FBI court filing revealed that someone located in Russia was also attempting to discredit the Special Counsel investigation through Twitter. Russian people have also sent falsified documents to reporters. Some allegations of investigators misconduct have been raised and were almost immediately debunked. Trump and his supporters criticized the cost of the investigation. By December 2018, the investigation had cost approximately $25 million while gaining approximately $48 million through asset forfeitures. \c\cThe Special Counsels office concluded its investigation and submitted the final report (also known as the Mueller report) to Attorney General William Barr on March 22, 2019. Barr had been previously critical of the investigation before Trump announced on December 7, 2018, his intent to nominate Barr for Attorney General. Following the conclusion of the special counsel, at least three dozen ongoing investigations originally handled by the Special Counsels office were passed on to district and state prosecutors, other Department of Justice branches, other federal agencies, and Congress. \c\cOn March 24, 2019, Attorney General Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress regarding the special counsels findings regarding Russian interference and obstruction of justice. Barr said that on the question of Russian interference in the election, Mueller detailed two ways in which Russia attempted to influence the election, firstly disinformation and social media campaigns by the Internet Research Agency to cause social discord, and secondly computer hacking and strategic release of emails from the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and Democratic Party organizations. However, Barr quoted the report as saying: "he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." On the question of obstruction of justice, Barr said no conclusion was reached by the special counsel, noting that Mueller wrote "while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him". Barr and Rosenstein concluded by March 24, 2019, that obstruction could not be proven in a court of law. The Justice Department discussed the final report with White House attorneys, and Barr and Rosenstein held a press conference on April 18, 90 minutes before its release to Congress and the public later today. The final report has been sent to the chairmen and ranking members of the House Committee Judiciary and Senate Committee Judiciary.
Presidential elections were held in Ukraine on 31 March and 21 April 2019. \c\cThere were a total of 39 candidates for the election on the ballot. Due to 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and the occupation of parts of Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast, around 12% of eligible voters were unable to participate in the election. As no candidate received an absolute majority of the vote, a second round was held between the top two candidates, Volodymyr Zelensky and Petro Poroshenko on 21 April 2019. According to exit polls, Zelensky won the second round with more than 70% of the vote.
On 21 April 2019, Easter Sunday, three churches across Sri Lanka and three luxury hotels in the commercial capital Colombo, were bombed. Later in the day, there were smaller explosions at a housing complex and a guest house, killing two civilians and three police investigating the situation and raiding suspect locations. Several cities in Sri Lanka, including Colombo, were targeted. At least 290 people were killed, including at least 35 foreign nationals and three police officers, and at least 500 were injured in the bombings. \c\cThe church bombings were carried out during Easter services in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo; the hotels bombed were the Shangri-La, Cinnamon Grand and Kingsbury hotels, all in Colombo.
A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck the island of Luzon in the Philippines on April 22, 2019, leaving at least 16 people killed and injured 112 others. Despite the epicenter is in Zambales, most of the infrastructure in a neighboring province, Pampanga, suffered severe damage.
The United States applies economic, trade, scientific and military sanctions against Iran. U.S. economic sanctions are administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Currently, the U.S. sanctions against Iran include an embargo on dealings with the country by the U.S., and a ban on selling aircraft and repair parts to Iranian aviation companies. \c\cOn 17 May 2018 the European Commission announced its intention to implement the blocking statute of 1996 to declare the US sanctions against Iran null and void in Europe and ban European citizens and companies from complying with them. The Commission also instructed the European Investment Bank to facilitate European companies' investment in Iran.
A referendum on electoral reform was held on April 23, 2019 in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. The referendum was held simultaneously with the 2019 provincial election.
Intense Tropical Cyclone Kenneth is a currently weakening tropical cyclone that has made landfall in northern Mozambique and is also affecting Tanzania. In addition, Kenneth was the most intense tropical cyclone to ever make landfall on Mozambique in the recorded history of the country. The fourteenth tropical storm, record-breaking tenth tropical cyclone, and tenth intense tropical cyclone of the 2018–19 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kenneth formed from a vortex that the Météo-France office on La Réunion (MFR) first mentioned on 17 April. The MFR continued to monitor the system over the next several days before designating it as Tropical Disturbance 14 on 21 April. The disturbance was located in a favorable environment to the north of Madagascar, which allowed it to strengthen into a tropical depression early on the next day. Several hours later, the MFR upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm, assigning the name Kenneth. The storm then began a period of rapid intensification, becoming a severe tropical storm early on 24 April and a tropical cyclone in the middle of the day. The structure of the storm continued to improve, with a pinhole eye developing by 25 April. On that day, Kenneth peaked as an intense tropical cyclone with 10-minute winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 934 hPa (27.58 inHg). At that time, Kenneth began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle and began to weaken before making landfall later that day as an intense tropical cyclone, the most intense landfalling storm in the recorded history of Mozambique. As a result of land interaction, Kenneth started to lose its convective structure as it made landfall. Following landfall, Kenneth rapidly degenerated after the MFR classified it as an overland depression. The storm then shifted southward, with the MRF cancelling all major warnings for inland cities. Kenneths structure continued to degrade as it moved further inland, with the MFR issuing its last warning at midnight UTC on 26 April. Thunderstorm activity developed off the coast of Mozambique on 27 April as the system began drifting northward. \c\cPrior to Kenneths landfall, local authorities evacuated over 30,000 people in the path of the storm in northern Mozambique. Kenneth killed at least six people. On the island of Comoros, Kenneths winds and rains caused at least 3 deaths, while three people were killed in Mozambique.
The Naxalite–Maoist insurgency is an ongoing conflict between Maoist groups known as Naxalites or Naxals and the Indian government. The conflict in its present form began after the 2004 formation of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI-Maoists), a rebel group composed of the Peoples War Group (PWG) and the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC). In January 2005, talks between the Andhra Pradesh state government and the CPI-Maoists broke down and the rebels accused authorities of not addressing their demands for a written truce, release of prisoners and redistribution of land. The ongoing conflict has taken place over a vast territory (around half of Indias 29 states)  with hundreds of people being killed annually in clashes between the CPI-Maoists and the government every year since 2005. \c\cHowever, it  is now confined to only few districts of Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra. \c\cThe armed wing of the Naxalite–Maoists is called the Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) and is estimated to have between 6,500 and 9,500 cadres, mostly armed with small arms. According to a study of the newspaper The Times of India, 58% of people surveyed in the state of Andhra Pradesh have a positive perception of the guerrilla, against only 19% against it. The Naxalites have frequently targeted tribal, police and government workers in what they say is a fight for improved land rights and more jobs for neglected agricultural labourers and the poor. The Naxalites claim that they are following a strategy of rural rebellion similar to a protracted peoples war against the government. \c\cIn February 2009, the Indian central government announced a new nationwide initiative to be called the Integrated Action Plan (IAP) for broad co-ordinated operations aimed at dealing with the Naxalite problem in all affected states, namely Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. This plan included funding for grass-roots economic development projects in Naxalite-affected areas as well as increased special police funding for better containment and reduction of Naxalite influence. After the first full year of implementation of the national IAP program, Karnataka was removed from the list of Naxal-affected states in August 2010. In July 2011, the number of Naxal-affected areas was reduced to (figure includes proposed addition of 20 districts) 83 districts across nine states. In December 2011, the national government reported that the number of Naxalite related deaths and injuries nationwide had gone down by nearly 50% from 2010 levels. \c\cThe Naxalite–Maoist insurgency gained international media attention after the 2013 Naxal attack in Darbha valley resulted in the deaths of around 24 Indian National Congress leaders, including the former state minister Mahendra Karma and the Chhattisgarh Congress chief Nand Kumar Patel.
The tax returns of Donald Trump have been the subject of controversy for the past several years, particularly over making them public due to his political career. \c\cBefore Trump announced his candidacy for president, he has offered in 2011, 2014 ("absolutely") and 2015 to release his tax returns. During his presidential campaign, Trump first said he would release his returns after they were "worked on", then Trump claimed that, because the returns were being audited, he could not make them public, but would do so. No law actually prevents tax returns from being released due to an audit, as emphasized by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Further on during his campaign, later said that voters were not interested in his returns, "theres nothing to learn from them", and that his tax rate is "none of your business". \c\cSince Trumps election, he has refused requests to release the returns, making him one of the few presidents in recent times to not reveal their tax returns. Historians say he has been the first major party nominee since 1976 not to make his tax returns public. \c\cThe United States House Committee on Ways and Means has formally requested from the IRS six years of Trumps returns. As of April 23, 2019, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has refused to comply with the second deadline given by the committee. \c\cIn May 2019 the California Senate passed a bill that would keep Donald Trump off the 2020 ballot until he releases his tax returns.

Aeroflot Flight 1492 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Sheremetyevo International Airport, Moscow, to Murmansk Airport, Murmansk, Russia. On 5 May 2019, the Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft operating the flight returned to Sheremetyevo shortly after take-off after suffering an in-flight fire. The wings and rear fuselage caught fire after a hard touchdown, and 13 people onboard were reported to have been killed.
Presidential elections were held in North Macedonia on 21 April 2019. Three candidates were on the ballot in the first round; Stevo Pendarovski of the ruling Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova of the nationalist opposition VMRO-DPMNE party, and Blerim Reka, an independent representing the Albanian minority. After the first round did not result in a majority for any candidate, Pendarovski won against Siljanovska-Davkova in the second round on 5 May. \c\cIncumbent President Gjorge Ivanov was constitutionally barred from seeking a third term in office, having previously been elected in 2009 and 2014.
The nuclear program of Iran has included several research sites, two uranium mines, a research reactor, and uranium processing facilities that include three known uranium enrichment plants. In 1970, Iran ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), making its nuclear program subject to the IAEAs verification. \c\cIrans nuclear program was launched in the 1950s with the help of the United States as part of the Atoms for Peace program. The participation of the United States and Western European governments in Irans nuclear program continued until the 1979 Iranian Revolution that toppled the last Shah of Iran. Following the 1979 Revolution, most of the international nuclear cooperation with Iran was cut off. In 1981, Iranian officials concluded that the countrys nuclear development should continue. Negotiations took place with France in the late 1980s and with Argentina in the early 1990s, and agreements were reached. In the 1990s, Russia formed a joint research organization with Iran, providing Iran with Russian nuclear experts and technical information. \c\cIn the 2000s, the revelation of Irans clandestine uranium enrichment program raised concerns that it might be intended for non-peaceful uses. The IAEA launched an investigation in 2003 after an Iranian dissident group revealed undeclared nuclear activities carried out by Iran. In 2006, because of Irans noncompliance with its NPT obligations, the United Nations Security Council demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs. In 2007, the United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) stated that Iran halted an alleged active nuclear weapons program in fall 2003. In November 2011, the IAEA reported credible evidence that Iran had been conducting experiments aimed at designing a nuclear bomb until 2003, and that research may have continued on a smaller scale after that time. On 1 May 2018 the IAEA reiterated its 2015 report, saying it had found no credible evidence of nuclear weapons activity in Iran after 2009. \c\cIrans first nuclear power plant, the Bushehr I reactor, was completed with major assistance from the Russian government agency Rosatom and officially opened on 12 September 2011.  The Russian engineering contractor Atomenergoprom said the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant would reach full capacity by the end of 2012. Iran has also announced that it is working on a new 360 Megawatt Darkhovin Nuclear Power Plant, and that it will seek more medium-sized nuclear power plants and uranium mines in the future. \c\cAs of 2015, Irans nuclear program has cost $100 billion in lost oil revenues and lost foreign direct investment because of international sanctions ($500 billion, when including other opportunity costs).
The 2019 Indian general election was held in seven phases from 11 April to 19 May 2019 to constitute the 17th Lok Sabha. The counting of votes will be conducted on 23 May, and on the same day the results will be declared. About 900 million Indian citizens were eligible to vote in one of the seven phases depending on the region. The 2019 elections attracted a turnout of over 67% – the highest ever in the history of Indian general elections, as well the highest recorded participation in Indian elections by women. According to most exit polls released on 19 May 2019, states The Washington Post, the BJP-led alliance and incumbent prime minister Narendra Modi appeared poised to win reelection; however exit polls in India have an inconsistent record. \c\cAccording to the preliminary official results released by the Election Commission of India for all 542 constituencies after the first 12 hours of counting, the Bharatiya Janata Party had won or led in 303 constituencies, increasing its seat count, while the Indian National Congress party in 52, while their alliance partners and un-aligned parties had won or led in 187. In order to become the official opposition party in India, a party must gain 10% of the seats (55 seats) in the Lok Sabha. The largest opposition party, the Indian National Congress, once again failed to attain this number. Thus, India remains without an official opposition party. \c\cLegislative Assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim were held simultaneously with the general election.
A heartbeat bill or fetal heartbeat bill is a controversial form of abortion restriction legislation in the United States which makes abortions illegal as soon as the embryos or fetus heartbeat can be detected. \c\cThe first heartbeat bill to pass a state legislature was in North Dakota in 2013, but was struck down by U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland, who described the bill as "clearly invalid and unconstitutional based on the United States Supreme Court precedent in Roe v. Wade." There has been a flurry of bills proposed in 2018 and 2019 with five states having passed bills by late May that havent been struck down by courts yet, with the bill in Alabama outlawing abortion at any stage of pregnancy with no exceptions for pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. The activity was largely in part due to the activism of anti-abortion activist Janet Porter. \c\cA fetal heartbeat can be detected at about six to seven weeks of pregnancy, but may be as late as 12 weeks when detected with a Doppler fetal monitor. Many women who are pregnant remain unaware of their pregnancy at six weeks from their last period. Most women who have an abortion do so after six weeks. Abortion-rights activists contend that because of this, the fetal heartbeat bills are de facto blanket bans on abortion in the majority of cases.

The Cuban thaw (Spanish: deshielo cubano) was a warming of Cuba–United States relations that began in December 2014 ending a 54-year stretch of hostility between the nations. In March 2016, Barack Obama became the first U.S. President to visit Cuba since 1928. \c\cOn December 17, 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced the beginning of a process of normalizing relations between Cuba and the United States. The normalization agreement was secretly negotiated in preceding months, facilitated by Pope Francis and largely hosted by the Government of Canada. Meetings were held in both Canada and Vatican City. The agreement would see the lifting of some U.S. travel restrictions, fewer restrictions on remittances, U.S. banks access to the Cuban financial system, and the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Havana and the Cuban embassy in Washington, which both closed in 1961 after the breakup of diplomatic relations as a result of Cubas close alliance with the USSR. \c\cOn April 14, 2015, the Obama administration announced that Cuba would be removed from the United States State Sponsors of Terrorism list. With no congressional action to block this within the permitted time period, Cuba was officially removed from the list on May 29, 2015. This marked a further departure by the United States from the Cold War conflict and its strain on Cuba–United States relations. On July 20, 2015, the Cuban and U.S. "interests sections" in Washington and Havana were upgraded to embassies. \c\cOn June 16, 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he was "cancelling" the Obama administrations deals with Cuba, while also expressing that a new deal could be negotiated between the Cuban and United States governments. \c\cOn November 8, 2017, it was announced business and travel restrictions which were loosened by the Obama administration would resume and would go into effect on November 9.

Cuba–United States relations are bilateral relations between Cuba and the United States. Cuba and the United States restored diplomatic relations on 20 July 2015, relations which had been severed in 1961 during the Cold War. U.S. diplomatic representation in Cuba is handled by the United States Embassy in Havana, and there is a similar Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C. The United States, however, continues to maintain its commercial, economic, and financial embargo, making it illegal for U.S. corporations to do business with Cuba. \c\cThe hold of the Spanish Empire on possessions in the Americas was reduced in the 1820s as a result of the Spanish American wars of independence; only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the Spanish–American War (1898) that resulted from the Cuban War of Independence. Under the Treaty of Paris, Cuba became a U.S. protectorate from 1898-1902; the U.S. gained a position of economic and political dominance over the island, which persisted after it became formally independent in 1902. \c\cFollowing the Cuban Revolution of 1959, bilateral relations deteriorated substantially. In 1961, the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Cuba and began pursuing covert operations to topple the Communist regime. In October 1960, the U.S. imposed and subsequently tightened a comprehensive set of restrictions and bans against the Cuban regime as retaliation for the nationalization of U.S. corporations property by Cuba. The 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, the 1962 missile crisis, and American efforts to stand up to Fidel Castros attempts to spread communism throughout Latin America and Africa, are main highlights of U.S. antagonism towards Cuba during the Cold War, although Nixon, Ford, Kennedy, and Johnson resorted to back-channel talks with the Cuban government during the Cold War. \c\cOn 17 December 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced the beginning of a process of normalizing relations between Cuba and the U.S., which media sources have named "the Cuban Thaw". Negotiated in secret in Canada and Vatican City over preceding months, and with the assistance of Pope Francis, the agreement led to the lifting of some U.S. travel restrictions, fewer restrictions on remittances, U.S. banks access to the Cuban financial system, and the establishment of a U.S. embassy in Havana, which closed after Cuba became closely allied with the USSR in 1961. The countries respective "interests sections" in one anothers capitals were upgraded to embassies on 20 July 2015. On 20 March 2016, President Barack Obama visited Cuba, becoming the first U.S. President in 88 years to visit the island. \c\cOn 16 June 2017 President Donald Trump announced that he was suspending the policy for unconditional sanctions relief for Cuba, while also leaving the door open for a "better deal" between the U.S. and Cuba. On 8 November 2017, it was announced business and travel restrictions which were loosened by the Obama administration would resume and went into effect on November 9. On 4 June 2019, the Trump administration announced new restrictions on American travel to Cuba. \c\cA 2016 survey shows that 77% of Cubans have a favorable view of the United States, with only 4% expressing an unfavorable view.
A by-election took place in the Parliamentary constituency of Peterborough on 6 June 2019. It was won by Lisa Forbes of the Labour Party. Mike Greene of the Brexit Party took second place. \c\cThe seat was vacant following the removal of the former Labour MP Fiona Onasanya on a recall petition, triggered by her conviction for perverting the course of justice.
Turkey–United States relations are bilateral relations between Turkey and the United States. Relations in the post-World War II period evolved from the Second Cairo Conference in December 1943 and Turkeys entrance into World War II on the side of the Allies in February 1945. Later that year, Turkey became a charter member of the United Nations. Difficulties faced by Greece after the war in quelling a communist rebellion, along with demands by the Soviet Union for military bases in the Turkish Straits, prompted the United States to declare the Truman Doctrine in 1947. The doctrine enunciated American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece, and resulted in significant U.S. military and economic support. This support manifested in the establishment of a clandestine stay-behind army, denoted the "Counter-Guerrilla", under Operation Gladio. After participating with United Nations forces in the Korean War, Turkey joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1952. \c\cRelations between the countries began to deteriorate in 2003 as Turkey refused to allow the United States to use Incirlik Air Base for the invasion of Iraq, a process that intensified following the failed coup détat attempt in Turkey in July 2016 as the country′s foreign policy has gradually re-orientated towards seeking partnerships with other powers such as Russia. \c\cA 2017 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed 79% of Turks had a negative view of the United States, with only 18% having a positive view. The same study also showed only 11% of Turks had confidence in the current US leader, President Donald Trump,  with 82% having no confidence in him.
On 03 June 2019 (Monday, around 01:00 PM), an Antonov An-32 twin engine turboprop transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force disappeared while flying over the Assam. The aircraft was en route from Jorhat Airport Assam to Mechuka H.Q in Arunachal Pradesh and had contacted ground control about 30 minutes after takeoff. There were 13 people on board.  The type of aircraft involved is the same that went missing in 2016.   A spokesman for Indias opposition National Congress party criticized the government and Defense Ministry for not replacing its fleet of aircraft after the 2016 incident, and continuing to fly the An-32, saying that there were better-equipped aircraft that could have been used instead. \c\cOn 11 June 2019, after a week-long search for the missing aircraft that had been hindered by poor weather, the wreckage of the plane was spotted 16km north of Lipo in Arunachal Pradesh at 12,000 feet elevation.  The Air Force had previously offered a cash reward for anyone who could share information on the aircraft after several days of searching.
The Flint water crisis began in 2014, after the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to a less costly source of the Flint River. Due to insufficient water treatment, lead leached from water pipes into the drinking water, exposing over 100,000 residents to elevated lead levels. \c\cAfter a pair of scientific studies proved lead contamination was present in the water supply, a federal state of emergency was declared in January 2016 and Flint residents were instructed to use only bottled or filtered water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and bathing. Some officials have alleged that as of early 2017, the water quality had returned to acceptable levels. However, as of January 2019, residents and officials still express doubt over whether the water in Flint is safe to drink. All the lead pipes are being replaced, which is expected to be completed in 2019. There are an estimated 2,500 lead service lines still in place as of April 2019.

On June 13, 2019, two oil tankers were attacked near the Strait of Hormuz while transiting the Gulf of Oman. The Japanese Kokuka Courageous and Norwegian Front Altair were supposedly attacked with limpet mines, causing fire damage to both ships. Iranian, Dutch, and American personnel responded to the attacks and were involved in rescuing crew members from the ships. The attacks took place a month after the nearly identical May 2019 Gulf of Oman incident. The attacks occurred on the same day that Ayatollah Khamenei met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe in Iran. Abe was acting as an intermediary between Donald Trump and Khamenei. \c\cAmid heightened tension between Iran and the United States, the United States and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for the attacks. Iran denied the accusation, blaming the United States for warmongering and spreading disinformation.

The 2019 Brecon and Radnorshire recall petition was an ongoing recall petition under the provisions of the Recall of MPs Act 2015 in the UK parliamentary constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire. It followed the conviction of its Member of Parliament (MP) Christopher Davies for false expenses claims, and resulted in Davies being removed from the seat.
Dragonfly is a planned spacecraft and mission that will send a mobile robotic rotorcraft lander to Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, in order to study prebiotic chemistry and extraterrestrial habitability at various locations where it will perform vertical-takeoff and landings (VTOL). \c\cTitan is unique in having an abundant, complex, and diverse carbon-rich chemistry on the surface of a water-ice-dominated world with an interior water ocean, making it a high-priority target for astrobiology and origin of life studies. The mission was proposed in April 2017 to NASAs New Frontiers program by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, and it was selected as one of two finalists (out of twelve proposals) in December 2017 to further refine the missions concept. On June 27, 2019, Dragonfly was selected to become the fourth mission in the New Frontiers program.
On August 12, 2017, a car was deliberately driven into a crowd of people who had been peacefully protesting the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one and injuring 28. The driver of the car, 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr., had driven from Ohio to attend the rally. Fields previously espoused neo-Nazi and white supremacist beliefs. He was convicted in a state court of hit and run, the first-degree murder of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, and eight counts of malicious wounding, and sentenced to life in prison. On March 27, 2019, he pled guilty to 29 of 30 federal charges in exchange for the prosecutors not seeking the death penalty. \c\cA memorial service and vigils were organized. The Mayor of Charlottesville, the Virginia Secretary of Public Safety, the Attorney General and the FBI director called the attack an act of domestic terrorism.

She has worked for the German sea rescue organisation Sea-Watch since 2016. \c\cIn June 2019 she is captain of the rescue boat Sea-Watch 3. After the boarding of 53 migrants on the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean, Italy refused permission to approach the island of Lampedusa. Rackete decided to go to the port anyway, where she was arrested by the Italian security authorities
North Korea–United States relations refers to international relations between North Korea and the United States. The political and diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States have been historically hostile, developing primarily during the Korean War. In recent years relations have been largely defined by North Koreas nuclear program – six tests of nuclear weapons, its development of long-range missiles capable of striking targets thousands of miles away, and its ongoing threats to strike the United States and South Korea with nuclear weapons and conventional forces. During his presidency, George W. Bush referred to North Korea as part of "the Axis of Evil" because of the threat of its nuclear capabilities. \c\cRecently, North Korea and the United States of America have started some formal diplomacy after the first Trump-Kim Summit in 2018. Sweden acts as the protecting power of United States interests in North Korea for consular matters. Since the Korean War, the United States has maintained a strong military presence in South Korea. However, the United States has considered, de jure, South Korea as the sole legitimate representative of all of Korea. \c\cSupport among the American public for US forces to defend South Korea has increased steadily. While it was at a mere 26% in 1990, it has now nearly tripled to 62%. A majority of the American public also have a positive view of Moon Jae-in, the South Korean President as of 2017. \c\cIn 2015, according to Gallups annual World Affairs survey, only 9% of Americans have a favorable view of North Korea, while 87% of Americans have a negative view. According to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, only 4% of Americans view North Koreas influence positively with 90% expressing a negative view, one of the most negative perceptions of North Korea in the world. \c\c2017 marked a significant rise of tensions and amplified rhetoric from both sides as Donald Trump took the presidency, after it appeared that North Koreas nuclear weapons program was developing at a faster rate than previously thought. The increasing rhetoric (as well as Trumps more aggressive approach to handling North Korea), missile testing and increasing military presence on the Korean Peninsula sparked speculation of a nuclear conflict. \c\cDespite fears of a massive conflict, a détente began to develop when on March 8, 2018, the White House confirmed that Trump would accept a meeting invitation from Kim Jong-un. At the time, they were supposed to meet in May. On May 15, 2018, North Korea cut off talks with South Korea and threatened to cancel the planned U.S.-North Korea summit, citing military exercises between the United States and South Korea. This cancellation was quickly reversed when Trump received an uncharacteristically friendly reply from Kim. On June 12, 2018, Trump and Kim met at the summit in Singapore, in the first summit meeting between the leaders of the two countries. Over the course of the summit, the two leaders engaged in several discussions and signed a joint statement calling for security, stability, and lasting peace. On February 22, 2019 an armed commando assaulted the North Korean embassy in Madrid, Spain; Spanish media alleged that two of the members were CIA operatives, but this has not been substantiated, and is denied by the CIA. A second summit between Trump and Kim occurred on February 27 and 28, 2019 in Vietnam regarding North Koreas nuclear program, but ended abruptly without an agreement. \c\cOn June 30, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump, together with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, briefly visited North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the Joint Security Area, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to step foot in North Korea. Trump also invited Kim to the White House to resume talks about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.
The tax returns of Donald Trump have been the subject of controversy for the past several years, particularly over making them public due to his political career. \c\cBefore Trump announced his candidacy for president, he had offered in 2011, 2014 ("absolutely") and 2015 to release his tax returns. During his presidential campaign, Trump first said he would release his returns after they were "worked on", then Trump claimed that, because the returns were being audited, he could not make them public, but would do so. No law actually prevents tax returns from being released due to an audit, as emphasized by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Further on during his campaign, he said that voters were not interested in his returns, "theres nothing to learn from them", and that his tax rate is "none of your business". \c\cSince Trumps election, he has refused requests to release the returns, making him one of the few presidents in recent times to not reveal their tax returns. Historians say he has been the first major party nominee since 1976 not to make his tax returns public. Several states have proposed bills that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns in order to be listed on the 2020 ballot; such a bill was passed by the California state senate. \c\cIn May 2019 the New York State Senate passed the TRUST Act which if signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo would amend state law to permit the commissioner of the state Department of Taxation and Finance to release any state tax return requested by the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation for any "specific and legitimate legislative purpose." The New York State Legislature approved the bill on May 22, 2019. \c\cThe United States House Committee on Ways and Means has formally requested from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) six years of Trumps returns. As of April 23, 2019, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has refused to comply with the second deadline given by the committee. On May 10, 2019, committee chairman Richard Neal subpoenaed the Treasury Department and the IRS for the returns and seven days later the subpoenas were defied. On May 20, 2019, a judge upheld the House subpoenas and rejected a lawsuit which Trump filed to keep his tax and financial records secret. The judge also denied a requested stay of his order. A draft IRS legal memo, written in fall 2018 and reported in May 2019, concluded that the IRS must provide the requested tax returns to Congress unless Trump invokes executive privilege, contradicting the administrations justification for defying the earlier subpoena.
The word hijab refers to both the head-covering traditionally worn by some Muslim women and Islamic styles of dress in general. \c\cThe garment has different legal and cultural status in various countries. In the Indonesian Aceh province, Muslim women are required to wear the hijab and all women are required to do so in Iran. \c\cFrance has banned overt religious symbols, including many religious head coverings, in public schools and universities or government buildings. Kosovo (since 2009), Azerbaijan (since 2010), Tunisia (since 1981, partially lifted in 2011) and Turkey (gradually lifted) are the only Muslim-majority countries which have banned the hijab in public schools and universities or government buildings, while Syria banned face veils in universities from July 2010. In other Muslim states such as Morocco, there have been complaints of restriction or discrimination against women who wear the hijab. The hijab in these cases is seen as a sign of political Islam or fundamentalism against secular government. \c\cIslamic dress, notably the variety of headdresses worn by Muslim women, has become a prominent symbol of the presence of Islam in western Europe. In several countries, this adherence to hijab has led to political controversies and proposals for a legal ban. Laws have been passed in France and Belgium to ban face-covering clothing, popularly described as the "burqa ban", although it does not only apply to the Afghan-model burqa. \c\cOther countries are debating similar legislation, or have more limited prohibitions. Some of them apply only to face-covering clothing such as the burqa, boushiya, or niqāb, while other legislation pertains to any clothing with an Islamic religious symbolism such as the khimar, a type of headscarf. Some countries already have laws banning the wearing of masks in public, which can be applied to veils that conceal the face. The issue has different names in different countries, and "the veil" or hijab may be used as general terms for the debate, representing more than just the veil itself, or the concept of modesty embodied in hijab. \c\cAlthough the Balkans and Eastern Europe have Muslim populations, most Muslims in western Europe are members of immigrant communities. The issue of Islamic dress is linked with issues of immigration and the position of Islam in Western Europe. \c\cThere are currently 15 nations that have banned the burqa (not to be confused with the hijab), including Tunisia, Austria, Denmark, France, Belgium, Tajikistan, Latvia, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Gabon, Netherlands, China, Morocco and Sri Lanka.

On 14 July 2019, a Gippsland GA8 Airvan crashed on a river islet in Sweden, killing all nine people on board. Structural failure of a wing is suspected as the cause of the accident. Consequently, the Gippsland GA8 Airvan was grounded by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) in Australia, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in New Zealand and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in the European Union.
Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the United States, currently used by 29 states, the federal government, and the military. Its existence can be traced to the beginning of the American colonies. The United States is the only developed Western nation that applies the death penalty regularly. \c\cIt is one of 54 countries worldwide applying it, and was the first to develop lethal injection as a method of execution, which has since been adopted by five other countries. The Philippines has since abolished executions, and Guatemala has done so for civil offenses, leaving the United States one of 4 countries to use this method, along with China, Thailand, and Vietnam. \c\cThere were no executions in the United States between 1967 and 1977. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment statutes in Furman v. Georgia, reducing all death sentences pending at the time to life imprisonment. \c\cSubsequently, a majority of states passed new death penalty statutes, and the court affirmed the legality of capital punishment in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia. Since then, more than 7,800 defendants have been sentenced to death; of these, 1,500 have been executed. A total of 165 who were sentenced to death in the modern era were exonerated before their execution.  As of April 1, 2018, 2,743 are still on death row.
A mass shooting happened at the Gilroy Garlic Festival at the Christmas Hill Park in Gilroy, about 20 minutes south of San Jose on July 28 2019 at 5:30 PM pacific time. More than a dozen ambulance and fire department crews appeared at the scene, where they were told that there were to prepare up to 11 victims, and that the final count was unknown. The Gilroy fire department said that they do not want private ambulances going to the scene because they did not have tactical gear. A witness reported that the shooter was a white male in his 20s.
A mass shooting occurred at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California, on July 28, 2019, at 5:30 p.m. At least three people died and 12 others are injured.

The United States federal budget comprises the spending and revenues of the U.S. federal government. The budget is the financial representation of the priorities of the government, reflecting historical debates and competing economic philosophies. The government primarily spends on healthcare, retirement, and defense programs. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office provides extensive analysis of the budget and its economic effects. It has reported that large budget deficits over the next 30 years are projected to drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levels—from 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049. The United States has the largest external debt in the world and the 14th largest government debt as % of GDP in the world.

The Papua conflict is an ongoing conflict between Indonesian administration and the indigenous population of Western New Guinea (Papua) in which Indonesia has been accused of conducting a genocidal campaign against the indigenous inhabitants. Subsequent to the withdrawal of the Dutch administration from the Netherlands New Guinea in 1962 and implementation of Indonesian administration in 1963, the Free Papua Movement (Indonesian: Organisasi Papua Merdeka, (OPM), a militant Papuan-independence organisation, has conducted a low-intensity guerrilla war against Indonesia through the targeting of its military and police. \c\cProtests and ceremonies by Papuans raising their flag for independence or federation with Papua New Guinea, and accuse the Indonesian government of indiscriminate violence and of suppressing their freedom of expression. At least 100,000 Papuans have been killed in the violence, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 and the Indonesian governance style has been compared to that of a police state, suppressing freedom of political association and political expression. Indonesia continues to restrict foreign access to the region due to sensitivities regarding its suppression of Papuan nationalism.

Hezbollah officials reported that on early morning 25 August 2019 two Israeli drones crashes into the Dahieh district of Beirut, Lebanon. According to Hezbollah sources one of the drones crashed into the Hezbollah Media Center and damaged it while the second one exploded in the air. The attack came several hour after Israeli airstrikes in Damascus, Syria and it is the first such incident in more than a decade.
2019 Israeli Airstrikes in Iraq began as unidentified drone or aircraft bombings of the Iranian backed Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), bases in Iraq starting on 19 July 2019. Several Iraqi, Iranian and Israeli officials have blamed Israel for the attacks but Israel initially did not confirmed nor denied its role. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted responsibility for the attacks on 20 August 2019, claiming that "Iran is not immune anywhere". Israel confirmed responsibility for the strikes on 22 August 2019, which was later followed by a US confirmation.
Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia according to the Indonesian law Number 10 of 1964. Located on the island of Java, the city was formerly Batavia, the capital during the Dutch East Indies period. In the early 20th century there was an effort by the Dutch East Indies government to relocate the capital from Batavia to Bandung. During Indonesias struggle for independence, the government of Indonesia moved the capital to Yogyakarta and Bukittinggi where it remained for a short time until the restoration in Jakarta. \c\cIndonesian President Joko Widodo announced a plan to relocate the capital to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo during his annual state of union address August 16, 2019 at the parliament. A planned city will be built between Kutai Kartanegara Regency and North Penajam Paser Regency in East Kalimantan. Relocation of the capital is part of the strategy of reducing developmental inequality between island of Java and other islands in Indonesian archipelago in a goal to realize economic equality and justice.

Early on 17 June 2017, the United States Navy destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with MV ACX Crystal, a Philippine-flagged container ship, about 80 nautical miles (150 kilometres; 92 miles) southwest of Tokyo, Japan; 10 nautical miles (19 km; 12 mi) southeast of the city of Shimoda on the Japanese mainland (Honshu). \c\cThe accident killed seven Fitzgerald sailors.  Their bodies were recovered from the flooded berthing compartments of the ship. At least three more of the crew of nearly 300 were injured, including the ships commanding officer, Commander Bryce Benson. The top two senior officers and the top enlisted sailor were relieved of duty and are facing criminal charges; about a dozen other sailors will receive non-judicial punishment.  The owners of the merchant vessel have agreed to pay  $27 million in compensation to the US Navy.

A mass shooting occurred at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, United States, on the morning of August 3, 2019. A gunman shot and killed 22 people and injured 24 others. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a possible hate crime. \c\cPatrick Crusius, a 21-year-old from Allen in the Dallas metropolitan area, was arrested shortly after the shooting and charged with capital murder. Police believe he published a document, described by others as a white nationalist, anti-immigrant manifesto, on 8chan shortly before the attack, citing inspiration from that years Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand and mentioning the white genocide conspiracy theory. \c\cIt is the deadliest mass shooting in the United States in 2019, the seventh deadliest since 1949, and the third deadliest in Texas.
The bilateral relationship between Russia and Ukraine formally started in the 1990s immediately upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, of which both Russia and Ukraine had been founding constituent republics. \c\cInteractions between the two areas of Russia and Ukraine developed on a formal basis from the 17th century (note the Treaty of Pereyaslav between Moscow and Bohdan Khmelnytskys cossacks in 1654), but international-level relations ceased when Catherine the Great liquidated the autonomy of the Cossack Hetmanate in 1764. For a short period of time soon after the communist 1917 October Revolution two states interacted again. \c\cIn 1920, Soviet Russian forces overran Ukraine and relations between the two states transitioned from international to internal ones within the Soviet Union, founded in 1922. After the Soviet Unions dissolution in 1991, Russia and Ukraine have undergone periods of ties, tensions, and outright hostility. \c\cPrior to Euromaidan (2013–2014), under President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych (in office from February 2010 until he was removed from power on 22 February 2014), relations were cooperative, with various trade agreements in place. \c\cOn 1 March 2014, the Federation Council of the Russian Federal Assembly voted unanimously to allow the President of Russia enter the Russian Armed Forces on territory of Ukraine. On 3 March 2014, the Russian representative to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin showed a letter signed by former Ukrainian President Yanukovych on 1 March 2014 and addressed to President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin with a request to enter the Russian Armed Forces on territory of Ukraine. \c\cDuring the February–March 2014 Crimean crisis Ukraine lost control of its government buildings, airports and military bases in Crimea to unmarked soldiers and local pro-Russian militias. This started on 27 February when unmarked armed men seized the Crimean parliamentary building. The same day the Crimean parliament replaced the local government with one who wanted Crimean unification with Russia. This government organized the 2014 Crimean status referendum on 14 March 2014 in which the voters voted overwhelmingly to join Russia. On 17 March 2014, Crimea declared its independence. On 18 March 2014, a treaty on incorporating Crimea and Sevastopol into Russia was signed in Moscow and in five days the "Constitutional Law on admitting to the Russian Federation the Republic of Crimea and establishing within the Russian Federation the New Constituent Entities the Republic of Crimea and the City of Federal Importance Sevastopol" was quickly pushed through the Russian parliament, signed by the Russian President and entered into force. On 19 March 2014 all Armed Forces of Ukraine are withdrawn from Crimea. On 17 April 2014, President Putin stated that the Russian military had backed Crimean separatist militias, stating that Russias intervention was necessary "to ensure proper conditions for the people of Crimea to be able to freely express their will". \c\cThroughout March and April 2014, pro-Russian unrest spread in Ukraine, with pro-Russian groups proclaiming "Peoples Republics" in the oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk, as of 2017 both partially outside the control of the Ukrainian government. In response, Ukraine initiated multiple international-court litigations against Russia, as well as suspending all types of military cooperation and military exports. Many countries and international organizations applied sanctions against the Russian Federation and against Ukrainian citizens involved in and responsible for the escalation. \c\cMilitary clashes between pro-Russian rebels (backed by Russian military) and the Ukrainian Armed Forces began in the east of Ukraine in April 2014. On 5 September 2014 the Ukrainian government and representatives of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic and the Luhansk Peoples Republic signed a tentative truce (ceasefire – the agreement). The ceasefire imploded amidst intense new fighting in January 2015. A new ceasefire agreement has operated since mid-February 2015, but this agreement also failed to stop the fighting. In January 2018 the Verkhovna Rada passed a law defining areas seized by the Donetsk Peoples Republic and the Luhansk Peoples Republic as "temporarily occupied by Russia", the law also called Russia an "aggressor" state. Russia has been accused by NATO and Ukraine of engaging in direct military operations to support the Donetsk Peoples Republic and the Luhansk Peoples Republic. Russia denies this, but in December 2015, Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin admitted that Russian military intelligence officers were operating in Ukraine, insisting though that they were not the same as regular troops. Russia has admitted that Russian "volunteers" are helping the separatists Peoples Republics. \c\cOn 10 February 2015, in response to Russian military intervention, the Ukrainian parliament registered a draft decree on suspending diplomatic relations with Russian Federation. Although this suspension did not materialize, Ukrainian official Dmytro Kuleba (Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the Council of Europe) acknowledged early April 2016 that diplomatic relations had been reduced "almost to zero". Late 2017 Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin stated that "there are no diplomatic relations with Russia in terms of content". \c\cOn 5 October 2016 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine officially recommended that its citizens avoid any type of travel to Russia or transit through its territory. The Ministry cited Russian law enforcers growing number of groundless arrests of Ukrainian citizens who are allegedly often "rudely treated using illegal methods of physical and psychological pressure, torture and other acts violating human rights and dignity". \c\cIn March 2014 Ukraine started to ban several Russian TV channel from broadcast in Ukraine, followed in February 2015 with a ban on showing (on Ukrainian television) of "audiovisual works" that contain "the popularization, agitation for, propaganda of any action of law enforcement agencies, the armed forces, other armed, military or security forces of the occupier state". One year later Russian productions (on Ukrainian television) had decreased by 3 to 4 (times). In 2015 Ukraine started banning Russian artists from entering Ukraine and banning other Russian works of culture from the country also when they were considered "a threat to national security". (Following the Kerch Strait incident) starting 30 November, Ukraine is banning all Russian men between 16 and 60 from entering the country with exceptions for humanitarian purposes, claiming this is a security measure. As another response to the Kerch Strait incident Ukraine imposed a 30-day martial law period that started on 26 November in 10 Ukrainian border oblasts (regions). Martial law was introduced because Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko claimed there was a threat of "full-scale war" with Russia. \c\cRussia has an embassy in Kiev and consulates in Kharkiv, Lviv, and Odessa. Ukraine has an embassy in Moscow and consulates in Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Tyumen and Vladivostok. Ukraine recalled its ambassador to Russia Volodymyr Yelchenko in March 2014. Since then, Ukraine’s highest diplomatic representation in Russia has been its temporary chargé daffaires. Similarly, since July 2016, after the Russian ambassador to Ukraine Mikhail Zurabov was relieved, Russias highest diplomatic representation in Ukraine has also been its temporary chargé daffaires. \c\cSome analysts believe that the current Russian leadership is determined to prevent an equivalent of the Ukrainian Orange Revolution in Russia. This perspective is supposed to explain not only Russian domestic policy but also Moscows sensitivity to events abroad. Many in Ukraine and beyond believe that Russia has periodically used its vast energy resources to bully its smaller neighbours, but the Russian government argues that internal squabbling amongst Ukraines political elite caused energy-supply disputes. The conflict in Ukraine and the alleged role of Russia in it greatly escalated tensions in the relationship between Russia and major Western powers, especially relations between Russia and the United States. The situation caused some observers to characterize frostiness in 2014 as assuming an adversarial nature, or presaging the advent of Cold War II and World War III.

Islamic terrorism in Europe has been carried out by the Islamic State (ISIL) or Al-Qaeda as well as Islamist lone wolves since the late 20th century. \c\cThere was a rise in Islamic terrorist activity in Europe after 2014. The years 2014–16 saw more people killed by Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe than all previous years combined, and the highest rate of attack plots per year. Most of this terrorist activity was inspired by ISIL, and many European states have had some involvement in the military intervention against it. A small number of plots involved people who entered or re-entered Europe as asylum seekers during the European migrant crisis, and some attackers had returned to Europe after fighting in the Syrian Civil War. The Jewish Museum of Belgium shooting in May 2014 was the first attack in Europe by a returnee from the Syrian war. \c\cWhile most earlier Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe were carried out by groups and involved bombs, most attacks since 2014 have been carried out by individuals using guns, knives and vehicles. A notable exception is the Brussels cell, which carried out two of the deadliest attacks of the period. \c\cThe deadliest attacks of this period have been the November 2015 Paris attacks (130 killed), the July 2016 Nice truck attack (86 killed), the June 2016 Atatürk Airport attack (45 killed), the March 2016 Brussels bombings (32 killed), and the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing (22 killed). These attacks and threats have led to major security operations and plans such as Opération Sentinelle in France, Operation Vigilant Guardian and the Brussels lockdown in Belgium, and Operation Temperer in the United Kingdom.
On August 13, 2019, Samoan police confirmed they had foiled an assassination plot to kill Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi. Its the third attempt to assassinate Malielegaoi, after another failed try in 1999 where one of his Cabinet members was killed and another uncovered in December 2010. \c\cThough motives have not yet been established, Samoan police initially arrested two men, and later charged a third. The three of them appeared in an Apia court on September 9, 2019, where two of them entered not-guilty plea, while the other pleaded guilty. Police are now working to extradite a man named Talalelei Pauga, from Brisbane, Australia in connection to the plot.
"Havana Syndrome" is the name popularized by the media in 2018 for purported acoustic attacks on United States and Canadian embassy staff, first reported in Cuba, and then in China. Beginning in August 2017, reports surfaced that American and Canadian diplomatic personnel in Cuba had suffered a variety of health problems, dating back to late 2016, and accusations were made that these were a result of attacks using unspecified technology, possibly acoustic in nature. \c\cThe U.S. government accused Cuba of perpetrating unspecified attacks causing these symptoms. The U.S. reduced staff at their embassy to a minimum, and U.S. President Trump declared in October 2017 that he believed Cuba was responsible for the attacks, but offered no evidence for his claim. Subsequent studies of the affected diplomats found that they had experienced some form of brain injury, but did not determine a cause for the injury. \c\cIn April 2018, U.S. diplomats in China began to report problems similar to those reported in Cuba.
Thomas Cook Group plc was a British, global travel group. It was formed on 19 June 2007 by the merger of Thomas Cook AG, itself the successor to Thomas Cook & Son, and MyTravel Group plc. The group operated in two separate segments, the Tour Operator and the Airline. Thomas Cook was listed on both the London Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The company ceased trading on 23 September 2019.
The September 2019 climate strikes, also known as the Global Week for Future, are a series of international strikes and protests to demand action be taken to address climate change. The strikes' key dates include 20 September, which is three days before the United Nations Climate Summit, and 27 September, together with the full week from 20 to 27 September proposed for a worldwide general climate strike called the Earth Strike. The protests are taking place across 4,500 locations in 150 countries. The event is a part of the school strike for climate movement, inspired by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. \c\cThe 20 September protests were likely the largest climate strikes in world history. Organisers reported that over 4 million people participated in strikes worldwide, including 1.4 million participants in Germany. An estimated 300,000 protesters took part in Australian strikes, a further 300,000 people joined UK protests and protesters in New York—where Greta Thunberg delivered a speech—numbered roughly 250,000. More than 2,000 scientists in 40 countries pledged to support the strikes. \c\cA second wave of protests took place on 27 September, in which an estimated 2 million people took part in over 2,400 protests. There were reported figures of 1 million protesters in Italy, and 170,000 people in New Zealand. In Montreal, where Greta Thunberg spoke, the Montreal school board cancelled classes for its 114,000 students; between 300,000 and 500,000 people joined the strikes. Four leaders of major political parties in Canada joined the strikes.
The 2019 UCI Road World Championships was held between 22 and 29 September 2019 in Yorkshire, United Kingdom. It was the 92nd UCI Road World Championships and the fourth to be held in the United Kingdom. The championships are traditionally hosted by a single town or city but, while each event in 2019 finished in the North Yorkshire town of Harrogate, the whole county of Yorkshire was the official host. Mads Pedersen of Denmark won the mens road race and Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands won the womens road race.
Iraq–Syria relations are the bilateral relations between the Republic of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic. Relations are marked by long-shared cultural and political links, as well as former regional rivalry. The two countries took their present form after the Sykes–Picot Agreement to dismember the Ottoman Empire into British and French spheres of influence after World War I. \c\cBoth countries are largely Arab and Muslim, with Kurdish, Christian and Syrian Turkmen and Iraqi Turkmen minorities. Political relations between them have often been hostile. Ever since King Faisal took the Iraqi throne in the early 1920s, Iraqi leaders have dreamed of unifying the two countries. Even during the thaw in Iraqi-Syrian relations during the last years of Saddam Hussein, relations between the two countries were not good. New diplomatic relations established in November 2006, were heralded as the beginning of an era of close cooperation between Iraq and Syria. \c\cBoth countries are at war with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In the Syrian Civil War, Iraqi volunteers have been fighting in Syria along the SAA. \c\cThe two countries are part of the Russia–Syria–Iran–Iraq coalition which was formed as a consequence of an agreement reached at the end of September 2015 between Russia, Iran, Iraq and Syria to "help and cooperate in collecting information about the terrorist Daesh group (ISIL) to combat the advances of the group, according to the statement issued by the Iraqi Joint Operations Command.
A series of protests by Papuans in Indonesia begun on 19 August 2019, mainly took place across Indonesian Papua as a response to the arrests of 43 Papuan students in Surabaya for allegedly disrespecting the Indonesian flag. Many of the protests involved thousands of participants, and some developed from protesting the incident in Surabaya to demanding an independence referendum for the region. In several locations, the protests turned into general riots, resulting in the destruction of government buildings such as in Wamena, Sorong and Jayapura. Clashes between violent protesters and police resulted in injuries, with over 30 people killed from both the clashes and the rioting. \c\cIn response to the rioting, the Government of Indonesia had implemented an internet blackout in the region. A Reuters reporter from the Jakarta bureau described the unrest as Papuas most serious in years.
During the early afternoon of 3 October 2019, a man stabbed five police employees at the Prefecture of Police on the Île de la Cité in central Paris, killing four of them. Police shot dead the knifeman, a 45-year-old IT specialist who until his death did admin work at the station for 20 years. \c\cThe fatal victims were described as three men and one woman, of whom three were police officers and the fourth was support staff. The fifth victim was critically wounded.
The Trump–Ukraine controversy is an ongoing political scandal in the United States regarding whether U.S. President Donald Trump abused the power of the presidency for his personal political interests, including if he had encouraged foreign interference by Ukraine in the 2020 U.S. elections. Historians and diplomats have called the controversy "unprecedented" in American history. The controversy sparked an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. \c\cThe Trump administration confirmed certain allegations by a whistleblower that Trump had in July 2019 asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate fellow 2020 U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, the company CrowdStrike, and to discuss these matters with Trumps personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. The Trump White House also confirmed the whistleblowers allegation that a non-verbatim memorandum of that conversation was moved to a highly restricted system. The whistleblower also alleged that the call was part of a wider campaign by Trump, his administration and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, which may have included Trump cancelling a scheduled trip to Ukraine by Vice President Mike Pence, and Trump withholding financial aid to Ukraine. Trump confirmed that he had withheld the aid, while offering contradicting reasons for doing so: he first claimed that it was withheld because of corruption in Ukraine, but later said that it was because other nations, including those in Europe, were not contributing enough aid to Ukraine. Meanwhile, as of October 2019, there has been no evidence produced of any alleged wrongdoing by the Bidens. \c\cSerhiy Leshchenko, a former advisor to Zelensky has stated that it was made a "clear fact" to Ukraines government that Trump—and the United States by extension—would only remain in communication with them if they discussed a future investigation of the Bidens. \c\cAfter Trump spoke on the phone with Zelensky, senior White House officials worked to "lock down" the complete official transcript of the call by removing it from the computer system where presidential call transcripts are typically stored and storing it on a highly restricted computer system. It was subsequently revealed that the transcripts of calls with other nations had been placed on the restricted server for political reasons, and not for national security reasons, which is the only valid cause, including that of a call with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in which Trump requested Morrisons assistance in investigating the origins of the Mueller inquiry. \c\cThe whistleblower complaint was filed on August 12, 2019, reportedly by a CIA officer. It was based both on "direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct" and the accounts of more than "half a dozen U.S. officials". Inspector General of the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson received and reviewed the complaint and found it to be credible and urgent, while noting the "subject matter expertise" of the whistleblower, Atkinson forwarded the complaint on August 26 to Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence. Maguire withheld the complaint from congressional intelligence committees, citing the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsels rationale that the whistleblower complaint did not relate to an "intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority" of the acting DNI. Maguire also testified that the whistleblower "followed the law every step of the way". The complaint was released to congressional intelligence committees on September 25, 2019, and a redacted version of the complaint was made public the next day.
During the early afternoon of 3 October 2019, a police employee stabbed five colleagues at the Prefecture of Police on the Île de la Cité in central Paris, killing three male police officers and one female member of the support staff as well as seriously injuring another woman. The three men were stabbed in the office area and the two women on a stairway. Police officers opened fire and killed the attacker. The attack came a day after police went on strike across France over increasing violence towards officers. \c\cFollowing the incident, the police headquarters building was visited by President Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. The Île de la Cité was placed under a lockdown and the Cité station of the Paris Métro, located on the island, was closed to passengers.
The China–United States trade war (simplified Chinese: 中美贸易战; traditional Chinese: 中美貿易戰; pinyin: Zhōngměi Màoyìzhàn) is an ongoing economic conflict between the world’s two largest national economies, China and the United States. President Donald Trump in 2018 began setting tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what the U.S. says are "unfair trade practices". Among those trade practices and their effects are the growing trade deficit, the theft of intellectual property, and the forced transfer of American technology to China. \c\cSince the 1980s, Trump advocated tariffs to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and promote domestic manufacturing, saying the country was being "ripped off" by its trading partners; imposing tariffs became a major plank of his presidential campaign. Although some economists and politicians argue that the United States persistent trade deficit is problematic, many economists argue that it is not a problem, and very few advocate tariffs as a solution, citing historical evidence that escalating tariff conflicts result in no winners. \c\cIn the United States, the trade war has brought struggles for farmers and manufacturers and higher prices for consumers. In other countries it has also caused economic damage, though some countries have benefited from increased manufacturing to fill the gaps. It has also led to stock market instability. The governments of several countries, including China and the United States, have taken steps to address some of the damage. The trade war has been criticized internationally; in the U.S., businesses and agricultural organizations have also been critical, though most farmers continued to support Trump. Among U.S. politicians the response has been mixed. \c\cThe trade war has caused a significant deterioration in China–United States relations as the countries exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs for over a year, with Trump threatening  more to come, with no resolution in sight.
The 2019 Halle synagogue shooting was a shooting incident that occurred on 9 October 2019 in Halle, Germany.
The Burkina Faso mosque attack was an Islamic terrorist attack that occurred on the evening of Friday, 11 October 2019 on a mosque in northern Burkina Faso which left 16 people dead and two injured.

AFP reported that 13 people died on the spot while 3 died later due to the injuries.
The China–United States trade war (simplified Chinese: 中美贸易战; traditional Chinese: 中美貿易戰; pinyin: Zhōngměi Màoyìzhàn) is an ongoing economic conflict between the world’s two largest national economies, China and the United States. President Donald Trump in 2018 began setting tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what the U.S. says are "unfair trade practices". Among those trade practices and their effects are the growing trade deficit, the theft of intellectual property, and the forced transfer of American technology to China. \c\cSince the 1980s, Trump advocated tariffs to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and promote domestic manufacturing, saying the country was being "ripped off" by its trading partners; imposing tariffs became a major plank of his presidential campaign. Although some economists and politicians argue that the United States persistent trade deficit is problematic, many economists argue that it is not a problem, and very few advocate tariffs as a solution, citing historical evidence that escalating tariff conflicts result in no winners. \c\cIn the United States, the trade war has brought struggles for farmers and manufacturers and higher prices for consumers. In other countries it has also caused economic damage, though some countries have benefited from increased manufacturing to fill the gaps. It has also led to stock market instability. The governments of several countries, including China and the United States, have taken steps to address some of the damage.

The 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, code-named by Turkey as Operation Peace Spring (Turkish: Barış Pınarı Harekâtı; Arabic: عملية نبع السلام), is an ongoing military operation conducted by the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) and the Turkish-allied opposition Syrian National Army (SNA) against areas under the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES) and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). \c\cOn 6 October 2019, the Trump administration ordered American troops to withdraw from northeast Syria, where the United States had been supporting its Kurdish allies. The military operation began on 9 October 2019 when the Turkish Air Force launched airstrikes on border towns. \c\cAccording to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the operation is intended to expel the SDF—viewed as a terrorist organization by Turkey due to its ties with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) but considered an ally against ISIL by the United States and its allies—from the border region as well as to create a 30 km-deep (20 mi) "safe zone" in Northern Syria where some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey would resettle. As the proposed settlement zone is heavily Kurdish in demographic makeup, this intention has been criticized by critics as an attempt to force a drastic demographic change, a criticism denied by Turkey by saying that it only intended to "correct" the demographics that Turkish officials asserted were changed by the SDF. \c\cThe Turkish action was condemned by the European Union, the Arab League, Iran, Israel, India and the United Kingdom as an assault on the territory of a sovereign and Arab state and an irresponsible destabilizing action with "potentially terrible" humanitarian consequences. The Syrian government has blamed the Kurds for the Turkish offensive, because of their separatism and not negotiating with the government, but has also condemned the foreign invasion of Syrian territory.

On 14 August 2018, three people were injured when a silver Ford Fiesta hit them near the Palace of Westminster. An ambulance immediately behind the Ford stopped and gave assistance to the injured. The car then went on to crash into the separation barrier of the pavement situated between St Margaret Street / Abingdon Street and Old Palace Yard. The London Metropolitan Police responded within seconds and arrested the driver, Salih Khater, without further incident. Khater was subsequently found guilty of two counts of attempted murder.
The trial of the Catalonia independence leaders, legally named Causa especial 20907/2017 of the Supreme Court of Spain, and popularly known as the Causa del procés, is an oral trial that began on 12 February 2019 in the Supreme Court of Spain. Judge Pablo Llarena coordinated an instruction between October 2017 and July 2018, as a result of which 18 people will be tried, including almost all of Carles Puigdemonts cabinet, political activists Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart, the former Speaker of the Parliament of Catalonia Carme Forcadell and several of its members. Some defendants remained in pre-trial detention without bail since the beginning of the instruction. Amnesty International has expressed strong concerns over this measure and the severity of the charges pressed. \c\cThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on the other hand, has expressed strong concerns over the violence produced the day of the referendum in October 2017. \c\cThe trial proceedings officially ended on June 12, 2019. The court did not announce a date on which the verdict would be delivered, with media outlets reporting that it would most likely be delivered at some time in Fall of 2019. The defendants of the trial have expressed their intention to petition the Constitutional Court of Spain and the European Court of Human Rights, should they deem it necessary to do so following the verdict.

The murder of Kathleen Jo Henry Occurred on September 4, 2019, in Anchorage, Alaska. The murder occurred at a local TownePlace Suites hotel, operated by Marriott International. The murder of Kathleen Henry, who was also sexually assaulted before her death, made international news when it was revealed that her alleged killer, Brian Steven Smith, recorded her death in both still photograph as well as numerous videos which he recorded on an SD card. Henrys remains were found along Alaskas Seward Highway on October 2, 2019. \c\cDetectives with the Anchorage Police Department recognized Smith from a previous investigation involving him, and obtained a warrant for his arrest. On October 8, 2019, Smith was arrested at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where he arrived after returning from a trip. Smith was subsequently booked into an Anchorage jail. Police have stated that they discovered thirty-nine photos and twelve videos related to Henrys assault and murder on the SD card, which was found by a woman on the street in the Fairview section of Anchorage. \c\cOn October 17, 2019, Smith was charged with the murder of s second woman, Veronica Abouchuk, a woman Smith allegedly confessed to killing. Smith allegedly admitted to her death, and told authorities where they could find her body.
The 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, code-named by Turkey as Operation Peace Spring (Turkish: Barış Pınarı Harekâtı), is an ongoing military operation conducted by the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) and the Syrian National Army (SNA) against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Syrian Army in northeastern Syria. \c\cOn 6 October 2019, the Trump administration ordered American troops to withdraw from northeastern Syria, where the United States had been supporting its Kurdish allies. The military operation began on 9 October 2019 when the Turkish Air Force launched airstrikes on border towns. The conflict resulted in the displacement of over 130,000 people and has caused the death of more than 70 civilians in Syria and 20 civilians in Turkey. \c\cAccording to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the operation is intended to expel the SDF—viewed as a terrorist organization by Turkey due to its ties with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), but considered an ally against ISIL by the United States and its allies—from the border region as well as to create a 30 km-deep (20 mi) "safe zone" in Northern Syria where some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey would resettle. As the proposed settlement zone is heavily Kurdish demographically, this intention has been criticized as an attempt to force drastic demographic change, a criticism denied by Turkey by saying that it only intended to "correct" the demographics that Turkish officials asserted were changed by the SDF. \c\cAs a result of the offensive, SDF sources reported that over 750 ISIS affiliates were able to escape due to Turkish bombing near the Ayn Issa prison compound. In contrast, Turkish sources claimed that the SDF released ISIS prisoners at the Tell Abyad prison before the arrival of Turkish forces. This claim was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, but opposed by senior U.S. officials who stated that Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) forces were the ones freeing ISIS prisoners. \c\cThe Turkish operation was condemned by the European Union, the Arab League, Iran, Israel, India and the United Kingdom as an assault on the territory of a sovereign and Arab state and an irresponsible destabilizing action with "potentially terrible" humanitarian consequences. European Union member Hungary initially did not condemn the operation and vetoed the EU declaration, which led to a delay, before a joint declaration was eventually issued. Arab League members Libya, Somalia and Qatar also did not condemn the operation. Various EU states imposed arms embargoes on Turkey, and European Union nations collectively agreed to stop selling arms to Turkey, while the U.S. imposed "severe" sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior government officials in response to the offensive in Syria. Donald Trump also announced his intention to level economic sanctions. \c\cThe Syrian government initially blamed the Kurdish forces for the Turkish offensive, for their separatism and not reconciling with the government, while at the same time also condemning the foreign invasion in Syrian territory. However, a few days later, the SDF reached an agreement with the Syrian government, in which it would allow the Syrian Army to enter the SDF-held towns of Manbij and Kobanî in an attempt to protect the towns from the Turkish offensive. Shortly thereafter, Syrian state broadcaster SANA announced that Syrian Army troops had started to deploy to the countrys north. Turkey and the SNA launched an offensive to capture Manbij on the same day. \c\cOn 17 October 2019, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence announced that the U.S. and Turkey agreed on a deal in which Turkey will agree to a ceasefire in Syria for 5 days in return for a complete withdrawal by the SDF from a safe zone south of the Syria-Turkey border. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that the ceasefire was a temporary pause in the operation for 5 days for SDF to withdraw from the designated 32 km (20 mi) safe zone from the Turkish border, after which if withdrawal was completed the operation would end and if not completed the operation would continue. SDF commander Mazlum Kobane said that they accepted the ceasefire only in the area between Tall Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.
General elections are being held in Bolivia on 20 October 2019. \c\cVoters will elect all 130 members of the Chamber of Deputies and 36 senators and cast ballots for a joint slate of president and vice president. \c\cFor the presidential election, electoral law states that if one presidential candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, or more than 40% with a 10%-lead over his closest rival, he is elected President of Bolivia for a five-year term on the first round. \c\cWith a final vote count of 45% for incumbent president Evo Morales and 38% for his leading challenger, former president Carlos Mesa, neither of those conditions were met. A second-round runoff vote between those two candidates is therefore to be held on 15 December.
Same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland is not legally recognised, with same-sex marriages performed outside Northern Ireland recognised as civil partnerships within its borders. \c\cHowever, legislation requiring the UK Government to issue regulations extending same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland passed the Parliament in July 2019. The regulations will come into effect on 13 January 2020. \c\cBetween 2012 and 2015, the Northern Ireland Assembly had voted on same-sex marriage five times, and although it was passed by a slim majority on the fifth attempt, it was consistently vetoed by the Democratic Unionist Party using the petition of concern. As no Northern Ireland Executive was formed by the deadline of 21 October 2019, provisions in the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019 mandating same-sex marriage by 13 January 2020 have come into effect.
Brexit (/ˈbrɛksɪt, ˈbrɛɡzɪt/; a portmanteau of "British" and "exit") is the scheduled withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU). Following a June 2016 referendum, in which 51.9% of participating voters voted to leave, the UK government formally announced the countrys withdrawal in March 2017, starting a two-year process that was due to conclude with the UK withdrawing on 29 March 2019. As the UK parliament thrice voted against the negotiated withdrawal agreement, that deadline has been extended twice, and is currently 31 October 2019. The Benn Act that passed in Parliament required the government to seek a third extension as no agreement was reached before 19 October. \c\cWithdrawal is advocated by Eurosceptics and opposed by pro-Europeanists, both of whom span the political spectrum. The UK joined the European Communities (EC) in 1973, with continued membership endorsed in a 1975 referendum. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by the political left, e.g. in the Labour Partys 1983 election manifesto. From the 1990s, the eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party grew, and led a rebellion over ratification of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty that established the EU. In parallel with the UK Independence Party (UKIP), and the cross-party Peoples Pledge campaign, it pressured Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to hold a referendum on continued EU membership. Cameron, who had campaigned to remain, resigned after the result and was succeeded by Theresa May. \c\cOn 29 March 2017 the UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, with permission from parliament granted by the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017, formally starting the withdrawal. May called a snap general election in June 2017, which resulted in a Conservative minority government supported by the Democratic Unionist Party. UK–EU withdrawal negotiations began later that month. The UK negotiated to leave the EU customs union and single market. This resulted in the November 2018 withdrawal agreement, but the UK parliament voted against ratifying it three times. The Labour Party wanted any agreement to maintain a customs union, while many Conservatives opposed the agreements financial settlement on the UKs share of EU financial obligations, as well as the "Irish backstop" designed to prevent border controls in Ireland. The Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party and others seek to reverse Brexit through a second referendum. The EU has declined a re-negotiation that omits the backstop. In March 2019, the UK parliament voted for May to ask the EU to delay Brexit until October. Having failed to pass her agreement, May resigned as Prime Minister in July and was succeeded by Boris Johnson. He sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline, with or without an agreement. On 17 October 2019 a revised withdrawal agreement, with a changed backstop, was agreed by EU and the UK government. \c\cMany effects of Brexit depend on how closely the UK will be tied to the EU, or whether it withdraws before terms are agreed – referred to as a no-deal Brexit. The broad consensus among economists is that Brexit will likely reduce the UKs real per capita income in the medium term and long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy. Brexit is likely to reduce immigration from European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the UK, and poses challenges for UK higher education, academic research and security. Following Brexit, EU law and the EU Court of Justice will no longer have supremacy over UK laws or its Supreme Court, except to an extent agreed upon in a withdrawal agreement. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which the UK could then amend or repeal.
From 21 October 2019, protests and marches have been occurring in Bolivia as a response to claims of electoral fraud in the 2019 general election.
Lion Air Flight 610 was a scheduled domestic flight operated by the Indonesian airline Lion Air from Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Jakarta to Depati Amir Airport in Pangkal Pinang. On 29 October 2018, the Boeing 737 MAX 8 operating the route crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 passengers and crew. \c\cIt was the first major accident involving the new Boeing 737 MAX series aircraft, introduced in 2017, and the deadliest involving a 737, surpassing Air India Express Flight 812 in 2010. It is the deadliest accident in Lion Airs 18-year history, surpassing the 2004 crash in Surakarta that killed 25, and the second deadliest aircraft accident in Indonesia behind Garuda Indonesia Flight 152. \c\cThe Indonesian government deployed a search and rescue operation which found debris early the same morning and recovered human remains from a 150-nautical-mile (280 km) wide area. The first victim was identified two days after the crash. The flight data recorder was located on 1 November and recovered for analysis. One member of the volunteer rescue team died during recovery operations. The cockpit voice recorder was found on 14 January 2019. \c\cPreliminary investigations revealed serious flight control problems that traumatized passengers and crew on the aircrafts previous flight, as well as signs of Angle of attack (AoA) sensor and other instrument failures on that and previous flights, tied to a potential design flaw involving the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) of the 737 MAX series. As a result, the United States Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing issued warnings and training advisories to all operators of the 737 MAX series to avoid letting the MCAS cause an abrupt dive similar to the Lion Air flight. \c\cThese advisories were not fully implemented, however, and the design issues are suspected to be involved in the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash on 10 March 2019, leading to the worldwide grounding of all 737 MAX aircraft.
The 2019 Bayonne mosque shooting was a incident on 28 October 2019. An 84-year-old man attacked a mosque in the southern French town of Bayonne. He injured two people by gunfire. The police arrested the suspect. He is said to have taken part in the regional elections 2015 as a candidate of the far-right Front National (today Rassemblement National). \c\cAccording to the french police, the man is said to have tried to lay a kind of incendiary in front of the mosque at around 15,20 local time. He was disturbed by two men and then fired several shots at them. The two men were injured. He then lit a car and fled. Police found a gas canister and a handgun in the car of the suspect. \c\cPolice arrested later the 84-year-old suspect, named locally as Claude Sinké at his home in Saint-Martin-de-Seignanx. He is also accused of trying to burn down the mosque.
The dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 brought an end to the Cold War and created the opportunity for bilateral relations with the New Independent States (NIS) as they began a political and economic transformation. The United States recognized the independence of Armenia on December 25, 1991, and opened an embassy in the capital city of Armenia, Yerevan in February 1992. \c\cThe United States has made a concerted effort to help Armenia and other NIS during their difficult transition from authoritarianism and a command economy to democracy and open markets. The cornerstone of this continuing partnership has been the Freedom for Russia and Emerging Eurasian Democracies and Open Markets (FREEDOM) Support Act, enacted in October 1992. Under this and other programs, the United States to date has provided nearly $2 billion in humanitarian and technical assistance for Armenia. \c\cOn March 27, 2006, Armenia signed a Millennium Challenge Compact with the United States; the agreement entered into force on September 29, 2006. Provided the Armenian Government makes progress on mutually agreed-upon policy performance criteria (corruption, ruling justly, and investing in people), the agreement will provide $235 million to Armenia over five years to reduce rural poverty through the improvement of rural roads and irrigation networks. In 2012 or 2013, the United States and Armenia are planning to hold their first-ever joint military drills, during which Armenian soldiers will be trained for their current multi-national peacekeeping operations. \c\cAccording to the 2016 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 42% of Armenians approve of U.S. leadership, with 31% disapproving and 27% uncertain.
On August 13, 2019, Samoan police confirmed they had foiled an assassination plot to kill/assassinate Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi. Its the third attempt to assassinate Malielegaoi, after another failed try in 1999 where one of his Cabinet members was killed and another uncovered in December 2010. \c\cThough motives have not yet been established, Samoan police initially arrested two men, and later charged a third. The three of them appeared in an Apia court on September 9, 2019, where two of them entered not-guilty plea, while the other pleaded guilty. Police are now working to extradite a man named Talalelei Pauga, from Brisbane, Australia in connection to the plot.
The Allied Democratic Forces insurgency is an ongoing conflict waged by the Allied Democratic Forces in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, against the governments of those two countries. The insurgency began in 1995, intensifying in 2013, resulting in hundreds of deaths. The ADF is known to currently control a number of hidden camps which are home to about 2,000 people; in these camps, the ADF operates as proto-state with "an internal security service, a prison, health clinics, and an orphanage" as well as schools for boys and girls.
From 21 October 2019, protests and marches have been occurring in Bolivia as a response to claims of electoral fraud in the 2019 general election. The claims of fraud were triggered by the sudden suspension of the preliminary vote count, in which incumbent Evo Morales was not leading by a large enough margin (10%) to avoid a runoff, and the subsequent publication of the official count, which Morales won by over 10 percent. International observers expressed concern over the daylong gap in the reporting of results, which was followed by a surge in Morales votes when the count resumed. Morales denied the allegations and invited foreign governments to audit the electoral processes, promising to hold a runoff if any fraud was found. The runner-up, Carlos Mesa, called for protests to continue until a second round was held, stating that he would bring forward proof that fraud occurred. While many demonstrations have been peaceful, violence has erupted, largely overnight.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in the Cook Islands may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Homosexuality is illegal for men in the Cook Islands, the law is not enforced and its legalisation is pending, though female homosexual acts are legal. Same-sex marriage is outlawed. Nevertheless, LGBT people do enjoy some limited legal protections, as employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has been banned since 2013. \c\cHomosexuality and transgender people have been part of Cook Islander culture for centuries. Historically, transgender people (nowadays called akava'ine; literally to behave like a woman) were seen as an important part of the family and the local tribe. The arrival of the missionaries quickly changed societal acceptance, and the first anti-gay laws in the Cook Islands were enacted. Nowadays, in part due to the Cook Islands' close relationship to New Zealand, attitudes towards members of the LGBT community are becoming more accepting, though there are still reports of discrimination. \c\cThe only LGBT advocacy group in the Cook Islands is the Te Tiare Association. The group officially launched in June 2008, and encourages debates on the issue and has organised events with the aim of raising awareness of the lives of LGBT people.
An impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump began after a whistleblower alleged that President Trump and other top government officials had pressured the leaders of foreign nations—most notably Ukraine—to investigate former U.S. vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. These allegations have been corroborated by many witnesses, including U.S. top-envoy-to-Ukraine Bill Taylor, Laura Cooper (the top Pentagon official overseeing Ukraine-related U.S. policy), White House administration official Fiona Hill and at least six additional White House officials. The reports implicate Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani—as well as Gordon Sondland, Kurt Volker, Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman, and others—in taking part in a quid-pro-quo campaign to pressure the Ukrainian government to take actions which would be helpful to Trumps 2020 presidential campaign. Based on Trumps supposed abuse of power of the presidency to advance his personal political interests, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated the impeachment inquiry on September 24, 2019. Additional alleged misconduct was both reported and performed in the days after the announcement, with Trump publicly urging Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens. \c\cThe first whistleblowers complaint was given to Congress on September 25, 2019, and released to the public the next day. A second whistleblower came forward on October 5 with first-hand knowledge of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Trump White House has corroborated several allegations raised by the first whistleblower, including that a record of the call had been stored in a highly restricted system. A non-verbatim transcript of the call confirms that Trump requested investigations into the Bidens and evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election, and repeatedly urged Zelensky to work with Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani on those matters. On October 17, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney stated that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine over its supposed corruption. \c\cThe White House officially responded to the impeachment proceedings in a letter from White House Counsel Pat Cipollone to Pelosi that it would cease all cooperation with the investigation due to a litany of concerns, including that there had not yet been a vote of the full House, and that interviews of witnesses were being conducted behind closed doors. Ambassador Taylor testified that he had been told U.S. military aid to Ukraine and a Trump–Zelensky White House meeting were dependent on Zelensky publicly announcing investigations into the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the National Security Councils Director of European Affairs, testified that he had heard Trumps phone conversation with Zelensky and that he had shared his concerns about the presidents remarks with a White House lawyer.

From 21 October 2019, protests and marches have been occurring in Bolivia as a response to claims of electoral fraud in the 2019 general election. The claims of fraud were triggered by the sudden suspension of the preliminary vote count, in which incumbent Evo Morales was not leading by a large enough margin (10%) to avoid a runoff, and the subsequent publication of the official count, which Morales won by over 10 percent. International observers expressed concern over the daylong gap in the reporting of results, which was followed by a surge in Morales votes when the count resumed. Morales denied the allegations and invited foreign governments to audit the electoral processes, promising to hold a runoff if any fraud was found. The runner-up, Carlos Mesa, called for protests to continue until a second round was held, stating that he would bring forward proof that fraud occurred. While many demonstrations have been peaceful, violence has erupted, largely overnight.

The November 2019 Spanish general election was held on Sunday, 10 November 2019, to elect the 14th Cortes Generales of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies are to be elected, as well as 208 of 265 seats in the Senate. \c\cThe election was held as provided under article 99.5 of the Spanish Constitution, as a result of the failure in government formation negotiations after Pedro Sánchezs failed investiture voting on 23–25 July 2019. On 17 September 2019, King Felipe VI declined to propose any candidate for investiture ahead of the 23 September deadline as a result of the lack of agreement between parties, with a new general election scheduled for 10 November. The failure in PSOE–Unidas Podemos negotiations prompted Podemos founder Íñigo Errejón to turn his regional Más Madrid platform—which had obtained a remarkable result in the 26 May Madrilenian regional election—into a national alliance under the newly-created brand of Más País, comprising a number of regional parties and former Podemos and United Left allies, such as Coalició Compromís, Equo or Chunta Aragonesista.

On 10 November 2019, after 19 days of civil protests following the disputed election results of October 2019, the military and police of Bolivia requested president Evo Morales to resign. Morales complied the same day, and after several other resignations by high-level politicians throughout the day, some citing fears for the safety of their families, the second vice president of the Senate, opposition senator Jeanine Áñez, assumed the interim presidency on 12 November. Morales called for the people to reject her leadership. On 11 November 2019 the Foreign Minister of Mexico Marcelo Ebrard offered political asylum to Morales, which he accepted the following day before boarding a Mexican Air Force plane to Mexico. \c\cThe designation of the terms "coup" and "revolution" to the event has been disputed, with regional and coup studies academics disagreeing with using either term, urging individuals to recognize the complexity of the event instead of disseminating polarizing rhetoric.

The China–United States trade war (simplified Chinese: 中美贸易战; traditional Chinese: 中美貿易戰; pinyin: Zhōngměi Màoyìzhàn) is an ongoing economic conflict between the world’s two largest national economies, China and the United States. President Donald Trump in 2018 began setting tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what the U.S. says are "unfair trade practices". Among those trade practices and their effects are the growing trade deficit, the theft of intellectual property, and the forced transfer of American technology to China. \c\cSince the 1980s, Trump advocated tariffs to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and promote domestic manufacturing, saying the country was being "ripped off" by its trading partners; imposing tariffs became a major plank of his presidential campaign. Although some economists and politicians argue that the United States persistent trade deficit is problematic, many economists argue that it is not a problem, and few advocate tariffs as a solution. \c\cIn the United States, the trade war has brought struggles for farmers and manufacturers and higher prices for consumers. In other countries it has also caused economic damage, though some countries have benefited from increased manufacturing to fill the gaps. It has also led to stock market instability. The governments of several countries, including China and the United States, have taken steps to address some of the damage caused by a deterioration in China–United States relations and tit-for-tat tariffs. \c\cThe trade war has been criticized internationally, including U.S. businesses and agricultural organizations, though most farmers continued to support Trumps tariffs. Among U.S. politicians the response has been mixed, and most agree that pressure needs to be put on China. As of late November 2019, none of the leading Democratic candidates for president said they would remove the tariffs, including Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom agreed the U.S. had to confront Chinas unfair trade policies. While Senator Bernie Sanders had said months earlier that he would use the tariffs as a negotiating tool.

This page documents Catholic Church sex abuse cases by country. The Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Europe has been documented by cases in several dioceses in European nations. Investigation and widespread reporting were conducted in the early 21st century related to dioceses in the United States of America; several American dioceses were bankrupted by settlement of civil lawsuits from victims. A significant number of cases have also been reported in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and countries in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. \c\cIn 2001, lawsuits were filed in the United States and Ireland, alleging that some priests had sexually abused minors and that their superiors had conspired to conceal and otherwise abet their criminal misconduct. In 2004, the John Jay Report tabulated a total of 4,392 priests and deacons in the U.S. against whom allegations of sexual abuse had been made. The numbers of reported abuse allegations and court cases has increased worldwide since then. \c\cThe UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) has asked for detailed information on the full extent of child abuse worldwide by priests, monks and nuns. It has also asked how the Vatican prevents abusers from contacting additional children and how the Vatican ensures that known crimes against children are reported to the police. In the past there were issues over the Church hierarchy failing to report abuse to law enforcement and allowing abusers further contact with children. 1 November 2013 was set as a deadline for receiving the information.

The reason for the two infants' deaths was incorrect preparation of the vaccine by two nurses who mixed vaccine powder with anaesthetic.
An impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump was initiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on September 24, 2019, after a whistleblower alleged that President Donald Trump had abused the power of the presidency by withholding both military aid and a White House meeting as a means of pressuring newly-elected President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky to publicly announce investigations which would be damaging to Trumps political rival Joe Biden in the 2020 election. \c\cIn a July 25 phone call, Trump asked Zelensky to do him two favors in return for already-approved military aid that Trump had put on hold a week before: namely, to pursue investigations of Joe Biden, Bidens son Hunter, and Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company on whose board Hunter had served—and also to support a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind interference in the 2016 presidential election. Believing that critical military aid intended to help its war against Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine would be revoked, Zelensky made plans to announce investigations of the Bidens on the September 13 episode of CNNs Fareed Zakaria GPS. After Trump was told of the whistleblower complaint in late August, and elements of the events had begun to leak, the aid was released on September 11 and the planned interview was cancelled. Trump declassified a non-verbatim transcript of the call on September 24, the day the impeachment inquiry began. The whistleblowers complaint was given to Congress the following day and subsequently released to the public. The White House corroborated several of the allegations, including that a record of the call between Trump and Zelensky had been stored in a highly restricted system in the White House normally reserved for classified information. \c\cIn October, three full Congressional committees (Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs) deposed witnesses including Ukraine ambassador Bill Taylor, Laura Cooper (the top Pentagon official overseeing Ukraine-related U.S. policy), former White House official Fiona Hill, and at least six additional White House officials. Witnesses testified that Trump wanted Zelensky to publicly announce investigations into the Bidens and Burisma and that Ukraine was pressured to release evidence that its government had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. On October 8, in a letter from Counsel Pat Cipollone to Speaker Pelosi, the White House officially responded that it would not cooperate with the investigation due to concerns including that there had not yet been a vote of the full House and that interviews of witnesses were being conducted behind closed doors. On October 17, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said, in response to a reporters allegation of quid pro quo: "We do that all the time with foreign policy. Get over it." He walked back his comments later in the day, asserting that there had been "absolutely no quid pro quo" and that Trump had withheld military aid to Ukraine over concerns of the countrys corruption. \c\cOn October 31, the House voted 232–196 to establish procedures for public hearings, which started on November 13. As hearings began, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Trump may have committed bribery, which is specifically listed as an impeachable offense in the Constitution. Private and public congressional testimony by twelve government witnesses in November 2019 presented a significant body of evidence indicating Trump demanded a quid pro quo of political favors in exchange for official action. The House Judiciary Committee hosted hearings on December 4 with more to follow later in the month. \c\cOn December 5, Nancy Pelosi formally asked the Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against President Trump.
A Naval Air Station Pensacola shooting was a shooting that occurred at the Naval Air Station Pensacola on December 16, 2019. At least two people were killed, including the shooter, and several others were injured.
Crossfire Hurricane was the code name for a covert counterintelligence investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into links between Trump associates and Russian officials and suspected coordination between the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian governments interference in the 2016 United States elections. \c\cThe investigation was officially opened on July 31, 2016, initially due to information on Trump campaign member George Papadopouloss early knowledge of Russians having damaging material on Donald Trumps rival candidate Hillary Clinton. \c\cFrom late July to November 2016, the joint effort between the FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Agency (NSA) examined evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 United States presidential election. The FBIs team enjoyed a large degree of autonomy within the broader interagency probe. \c\cThe FBIs work was taken over on May 17, 2017, by the Special Counsel investigation of 2017–2019, which eventually resulted in the Mueller Report. Mueller concluded that Russian interference occurred in a "sweeping and systematic fashion" and that there were substantial links with the Trump campaign, but that the evidence available to investigators did not establish that the Trump campaign had "conspired or coordinated" with the Russian government. \c\cConspiracy theories circulated among Trump supporters asserting the Crossfire Hurricane investigation was opened on false pretenses for political purposes. The Washington Post reported on November 22, 2019 that a forthcoming Justice Department inspector general report found the investigation was properly predicated on a legal and factual basis.
An independence referendum was held in Bougainville, an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea, between 23 November and 7 December 2019, with results declared 11 December. The referendum question was a choice between greater autonomy within Papua New Guinea, or full independence. The vote was the result of an agreement between the Government of Papua New Guinea and the Autonomous Bougainville Government. The vote is not binding and the Government of Papua New Guinea has the final say on what becomes of Bougainville if the vote is in favour of independence. \c\cThe result was overwhelmingly in favour of independence, with 98.31% voting for independence and only 1.69% voting for greater autonomy.
On December 10, 2019, a mass shooting occurred at a kosher grocery store located in the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey, in which five people, including the two attackers and three civilians, were killed, while another civilian and two police officers were wounded. A Jersey City Police Department detective was shot and killed at a nearby cemetery just before the attack at the grocery store.
The China–United States trade war (Chinese: 中美贸易战; pinyin: Zhōngměi Màoyìzhàn) is an ongoing economic conflict between the world’s two largest national economies, China and the United States. President Donald Trump in 2018 began setting tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what the U.S. says are "unfair trade practices". Among those trade practices and their effects are the growing trade deficit, the theft of intellectual property, and the forced transfer of American technology to China. \c\cSince the 1980s, Trump advocated tariffs to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and promote domestic manufacturing, saying the country was being "ripped off" by its trading partners; imposing tariffs became a major plank of his presidential campaign. Although some economists and politicians argue that the United States persistent trade deficit is problematic, many economists argue that it is not a problem, and few advocate tariffs as a solution. \c\cIn the United States, the trade war has brought struggles for farmers and manufacturers and higher prices for consumers. In other countries it has also caused economic damage, though some countries have benefited from increased manufacturing to fill the gaps. It has also led to stock market instability. The governments of several countries, including China and the United States, have taken steps to address some of the damage caused by a deterioration in China–United States relations and tit-for-tat tariffs. \c\cThe trade war has been criticized internationally, including by U.S. businesses and agricultural organizations, though most farmers continued to support Trump. Among U.S. politicians the response has been mixed, and most agree that pressure needs to be put on China. As of late November 2019, none of the leading Democratic candidates for president said they would remove the tariffs, including Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom agreed the U.S. had to confront what they see as Chinas unfair trade policies. Senator Bernie Sanders said that he would use tariffs as a negotiating tool but criticized Trumps actions as "totally irrational and .. destabilizing the entire world economy".
An impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump was initiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on September 24, 2019, after a whistleblower alleged that President Donald Trump may have abused the power of the presidency by withholding military aid as a means of pressuring newly elected president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky to perform two favors: to pursue investigations of Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and to support a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind interference in the 2016 presidential election. More than a week after Trump had put a hold on the previously approved military aid, he made the aforementioned requests in a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, which the whistleblower alleged was intended to help Trumps reelection bid. \c\cBelieving that critical military aid would be revoked, Zelensky made plans to announce investigations of the Bidens on the September 13 episode of CNNs Fareed Zakaria GPS. After Trump was told of the whistleblower complaint in late August, and elements of the events had begun to leak, the aid was released on September 11 and the planned interview was cancelled.

On December 10, the House Judiciary Committee unveiled their articles of impeachment: one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of Congress. After several days of discussion, the Judiciary Committee voted along party lines, 23-17, to approve both articles of impeachment. The full House is expected to vote on the matter on December 18.
The 2019 Samoa measles outbreak began in September 2019.  As of 16 December, there were 5,267 confirmed cases of measles and 73 deaths, out of a Samoan population of 201,316. Over two percent of the population has been infected. \c\cA state of emergency was declared on 17 November, ordering the closure of all schools, keeping children under 17 away from public events, and making vaccination mandatory. On 14 December, the state of emergency was extended to the 29 December. Samoan anti-vaccination activist Edwin Tamasese was arrested and charged with "incitement against a government order". \c\cOn 2 December 2019, the government imposed a curfew and cancelled all Christmas celebrations and public gatherings. All unvaccinated families have been ordered to display a red flag or red cloth in front of their homes to warn others and to aid mass vaccination efforts. On 5 and 6 December, the government shut down everything other than public utilities to move all civil servants over to the vaccination campaign. This curfew was lifted on 7 December when the government estimated that 90% of the population was reached by the vaccination program. As of 12 December, 93% of the population had been vaccinated.
At 14:11 PST (06:11 UTC) on December 15, 2019 the province of Davao del Sur on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines was struck by an earthquake measuring 6.8 Mw. It had a maximum perceived intensity of IX (heavy) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale. At least seven people were killed and another 37 injured.
The Maguindanao massacre, also known as the Ampatuan massacre after the town where the victims' mass graves were found, occurred on the morning of November 23, 2009, in the town of Ampatuan in Maguindanao province, on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. While the 58 victims were on their way to file a certificate of candidacy for Esmael Mangudadatu, vice mayor of Buluan town, they were kidnapped and killed. Mangudadatu was challenging Datu Unsay mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr., son of the incumbent Maguindanao governor Andal Ampatuan Sr. and member of one of Mindanaos leading Muslim political clans, in the forthcoming Maguindanao gubernatorial election, part of the national elections in 2010. The people killed included Mangudadatus wife, his two sisters, journalists, lawyers, aides, and motorists who were witnesses or were mistakenly identified as part of the convoy. \c\cThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called the Maguindanao massacre the single deadliest event for journalists in history. At least 34 journalists are known to have died in the massacre. Even before the Maguindanao massacre, the CPJ had labeled the Philippines the second most dangerous country for journalists, second only to Iraq.
The Citizenship Amendment Act protests of 2019 in India, or the CAA protests known previously as the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill protests, or the CAB protests are a series of ongoing protests in India against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 12 December 2019. The protests began in Assam, Delhi, Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura on 4 December 2019, and spread to the other parts of India. The reasons given for the protests by participating student organisations, human rights activists, and citizen groups include alleged religious discrimination, illegal immigration and police brutality on university campuses during demonstrations. \c\cThe people of Assam and other northeastern states are opposing the Act for fear that settlement of non-Muslim illegal immigrants in their regions would change the demographic balance. The protests were against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, which was cleared by the Union cabinet on 4 December 2019, and passed by both houses of the Parliament on 11 December turning the bill into an Act of the Parliament. \c\cThe protests started in Assam on 4 December 2019, after the bill was introduced in parliament. Later, protests erupted in all of Northeast India, and subsequently all major cities of India. On 15 December, police forcefully entered the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University, where protests were being held. Police used batons and tear gas on the students. More than two hundred students were injured and around hundred students were detained overnight in the police station. The police brutality was widely criticized, and resulted in students protesting across the country as a response. \c\cThe protests have resulted in more than a thousand arrests and six deaths. Two boys under the age of 18 were among those reported to have been killed due to police firing in Assam. The Act has been criticized and termed unconstitutional by several lawyers such as Soli Sorabjee, Markandey Katju, Kapil Sibal, Mahua Moitra, Jairam Ramesh, P Chidambaram, Abhishek M Singhvi, Ashish Goel, and Suhrith Parthasarathy. Several organisations have petitioned the Supreme Court of India to declare the bill illegal.
The assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, journalist for The Washington Post and former general manager and editor-in-chief of Al-Arab News Channel, occurred on 2 October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey and was perpetrated by agents of the Saudi Arabian government. The exact cause of his death is unknown since his body has not been located or examined. Government officials of several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, believe Khashoggi was murdered. Turkey in particular believes it was premeditated murder, and anonymous Saudi officials have admitted that agents affiliated with the Saudi government killed him. \c\cThe Saudi Royal family denied ordering or sanctioning the killing. On 31 October, Istanbuls chief prosecutor released a statement stating that Khashoggi had been strangled as soon as he entered the consulate building, and that his body was dismembered and disposed of. On 15 November 2018, the Saudi prosecutors office said eleven Saudi nationals had been indicted and charged with murdering Khashoggi and that five of them could face the death penalty, since it had been determined they were directly involved in "ordering and executing the crime". \c\cAlthough Saudi officials continued to deny that the Saudi Royal Family was involved in, ordered, or sanctioned the killing, evidence has mounted that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved. \c\cTurkish officials released an audio recording of Khashoggis killing that they alleged contained evidence that Khashoggi had been assassinated on the orders of  Mohammed bin Salman. Several days later, on 16 November, Central Intelligence Agency members who internally analyzed multiple sources of intelligence concluded that Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggis assassination. On 20 November, US President Donald Trump disputed the CIA assessment and stated that the investigation into Khashoggis death had to continue. Muhammad Bin Salman has denied that he had ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi but said that he bears all responsibility because it happened under his watch.
The diplomatic relationship between the United States of America and Zambia can be characterized as warm and cooperative. Several U.S. administrations cooperated closely with Zambias first president, Kenneth Kaunda, in hopes of facilitating solutions to the conflicts in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia. The United States works closely with the Zambian Government to defeat the HIV/AIDS pandemic that is ravaging Zambia, to promote economic growth and development, and to effect political reform needed to promote responsive and responsible government. The United States is also supporting the governments efforts to root out corruption. Zambia is a beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The U.S. Government provides a variety of technical assistance and other support that is managed by the Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) Threshold Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Treasury, Department of Defense, and Peace Corps. The majority of U.S. assistance is provided through the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), in support of the fight against HIV/AIDS. \c\cIn addition to supporting development projects, the United States has provided considerable emergency food aid during periods of drought and flooding through the World Food Program (WFP) and is a major contributor to refugee programs in Zambia through the UN High Commission for Refugees and other agencies. \c\cAccording to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 59% of Zambians approve of U.S. leadership, with 30% disapproving and 11% uncertain.
Censorship in Turkey is regulated by domestic and international legislation, the latter (in theory) taking precedence over domestic law, according to Article 90 of the Constitution of Turkey (so amended in 2004). \c\cDespite legal provisions, media freedom in Turkey has steadily deteriorated from 2010 onwards, with a precipitous decline following the attempted coup in July 2016. President Tayyip Erdoğan has arrested hundreds of journalists, closed or taken over dozens of media outlets, and prevented journalists and their families from traveling. By some accounts, Turkey currently accounts for one-third of all journalists imprisoned around the world. \c\cSince 2013, Freedom House ranks Turkey as "Not Free". Reporters Without Borders ranked Turkey at the 149th place out of over 180 countries, between Mexico and DR Congo, with a score of 44.16. In the third quarter of 2015, the independent Turkish press agency Bianet recorded a strengthening of attacks on the opposition media during the Justice and Development Party (AKP) interim government. Bianets final 2015 monitoring report confirmed this trend and underlined that once regained majority after the AKP interim government period, the Turkish government further intensified its pressure on the countrys media. \c\cAccording to Freedom House,. \c\cIn 2012 and 2013 the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) ranked Turkey as the worst journalist jailer in the world (ahead of Iran and China), with 49 journalists sitting in jail in 2012 and 40 in 2013. Twitters 2014 Transparency Report showed that Turkey filed over five times more content removal requests to Twitter than any other country in the second half of 2014, with requests rising another 150% in 2015. \c\cDuring its 12-year rule, the ruling AKP has gradually expanded its control over media. Today, numerous newspapers, TV channels and internet portals dubbed as Yandaş Medya ("Partisan Media") or Havuz Medyası ("Pool Media") continue their heavy pro-government propaganda. Several media groups receive preferential treatment in exchange for AKP-friendly editorial policies. Some of these media organizations were acquired by AKP-friendly businesses through questionable funds and processes. Media not friendly to AKP, on the other hand, are threatened with intimidation, inspections and fines. These media group owners face similar threats to their other businesses. An increasing number of columnists have been fired for criticizing the AKP leadership.

The 2019 U.S. embassy attack in Iraq happened in Baghdad, Iraq, on 31 December 2019. Iraqi militiamen, pro-Iran protesters, and supporters of the Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia, attacked the U.S. embassy in response to U.S. airstrikes on 29 December 2019 that killed 25 fighters of Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq. Thousands of protesters and militia fighters chanted "Death to America," threw stones and painted graffiti on the walls. Many of those who participated in the 2019-20 Iraqi protests expressed their condemnation of the U.S. airstrikes on the Kataib Hezbollah and supported the protests at the embassy saying, "emonstrations at  US embassy are a natural response to the US strikes over Hashd positions in Iraq". They condemned the attack on the American embassy by Iraqi supporters of the group saying, "we are staying here in the hub of the peaceful protest movement" and added that the "crowds in the Green Zone do not represent us. We want peaceful change."
Floods occurred throughout Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang, and Bekasi on the early hours of January 1, 2020, due to the overnight rain which dumped nearly 15 inches of rainwater — more than 3 times the average amount. The massive downpour caused the Ciliwung and Cisadane river to overflow.
The 2019–20 Australian bushfire season is an ongoing bushfire event in Australia that has burned an estimated 5.9 million hectares (15 million acres), destroyed over 2,500 buildings (including over 1,300 houses) and killed at least 20 people, with a further 28 missing in the state of Victoria. It is the most destructive bushfire season and the most widespread in Australias recorded history. From November 2019, it heavily impacted various regions of the state of New South Wales, such as, the North Coast, Mid North Coast, the Hunter Region, the Hawkesbury and the Wollondilly in Sydneys far west, the Blue Mountains, Illawarra and the South Coast, with more than 100 fires burnt across the state. \c\cIn Eastern Victoria large areas of forest burnt out of control for four weeks before the fires emerged from the forests in late December, taking lives, threatening many towns and isolating Corryong and Mallacoota. A State of Disaster was declared for East Gippsland. Moderately affected areas were South Eastern Queensland, the Adelaide Hills in South Australia, and southwestern Western Australia, with a few areas in Tasmania and the ACT being mildly impacted. Regarded as one of the worst bushfire seasons in memory, the fires had burned through more land than any other blazes in the past 25 years. \c\cIn December 2019, the state government declared a state of emergency in New South Wales after record-breaking temperatures and prolonged drought exacerbated the bushfires. The political ramifications of the fire season have been significant. A decision by the New South Wales Government to cut funding to fire services based on budget estimates, as well as a holiday taken by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, during a period in which two volunteer firefighters died, and his perceived apathy towards the situation, resulted in controversy. As temperatures were forecast to reach 41 °C (106 °F), the New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian called a fresh seven-day state of emergency with effect from 9am on 3 January 2020. \c\cReinforcements from all over Australia were called in to assist fighting the fires and relieve exhausted local crews in New South Wales. On 11 November it was reported that the Country Fire Authority (CFA) was sending in a large contingent of up to 300 firefighters and support staff from Victoria. More than 100 firefighters had been sent from Western Australia as of 14 November 2019. Contingents were also sent from South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. On 12 November the Federal government announced that the Australian Defence Force was providing air support to the firefighting effort, as well as preparing to provide manpower and logistical support. Firefighters from New Zealand, the United States and Canada helped fight the fires, especially in New South Wales. \c\cOn 12 November 2019, catastrophic fire danger was declared in the Greater Sydney region for the first time since the introduction of this level in 2009 and a total fire ban was in place for seven regions, including Greater Sydney. The Illawarra and Greater Hunter areas also experienced catastrophic fire dangers and other parts of the state, including the already fire ravaged parts of northern New South Wales. As of 1 January 2020, 3.6 million hectares (8.9 million acres) has been burnt or is burning in New South Wales.
The ongoing 2019–20 Australian bushfire season is the most destructive bushfire season and the most widespread in Australias recorded history, having already burned over 5,900,000 hectares of land (estimated), destroyed over 2,500 buildings (including over 1,300 homes) and killed at least 19 people as well as half a billion wild animals and plants. From November, it heavily impacted various regions of New South Wales, such as, the North Coast, Mid North Coast, the Hunter Region, the Hawkesbury and the Wollondilly in Sydneys far west, the Blue Mountains, Illawarra and the South Coast, with more than 100 fires burnt across the state, and Eastern Victoria.

Ukrainian authorities have said a shootdown was one of the "main working theories", while Iranian authorities denied the possibility. UK defence officials agreed with the American assessment of a shootdown. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said evidence suggested the aircraft had been shot down by an Iranian missile.

On 9 January 2020, a large group of apparent jihadists carried out an attack in Niger. They attacked an army post in Chinagodrar, in the west of the country, in Tillabéri Region, eight miles the border with Mali, 130 miles north of Niamey. At least 89 Nigerien soldiers were confirmed to have been killed in the attack with more casualties suspected, but yet to be confirmed. 63 militants were claimed by the Nigerien government to have been killed. \c\cThe Islamist insurgency in the Sahel intensified in the late 2010s. This attack followed those in Niger on 10 December and 25 December.
Presolar grains are interstellar solid matter in the form of tiny solid grains that originated at a time before the Sun was formed (presolar: before the Sun). Presolar stardust grains formed within outflowing and cooling gases from earlier presolar stars. \c\cThe stellar nucleosynthesis that took place within each presolar star gives to each granule an isotopic composition unique to that parent star, which differs from the isotopic composition of our solar systems matter as well as from the galactic average. These isotopic signatures often fingerprint very specific astrophysical nuclear processes that took place within the parent star and prove their presolar origin.
The Houston Astros sign stealing scandal or Houstongate refers to a series of incidents where members of the Houston Astros baseball organization stole signs of opposing teams through means against Major League Baseballs (MLB) rules. The story was originally reported by journalists Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drelich in The Athletic. Mike Fiers, a pitcher who played for the Astros in 2017, told The Athletic that the Astros used a video camera in center field to steal opposing teams' signs. MLBs investigation confirmed that the Astros illegally used a camera system to steal signs during the 2017 regular season and postseason, as well as part of the 2018 season. As a result, the league disciplined the Astros with a $5 million fine, forfeiture of first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021, and one-year suspensions of general manager Jeff Luhnow and field manager A. J. Hinch; both were also fired by the Astros the day their suspensions were announced. \c\cIt was also later found out on January 14, 2020 that other Houston sports teams such as the Texans of the NFL and Rockets of the NBA were found to have filmed opponents strategies. \c\cThis has been called the worst sports scandal in American history, and many baseball fans have compared this scandal to the state sponsored doping program in Russia after other Houston sports teams have been involved in filming opponent strategies.
On 8 January 2020, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex announced their decision on Instagram to "step back as senior members of the Royal Family", splitting their time between the United Kingdom and North America, and to become financially independent; the event was dubbed Megxit (a portmanteau of the words "Meghan" and "exit" and a play on the word "Brexit"), and the term became adopted globally on social and news media, spawning various internet memes, and "Megxit" merchandising. \c\cMegxit led to an "unprecedented" meeting of the Royal Family on 13 January, dubbed the "Sandringham Summit", and a rare first-person statement by the Queen on her family.  The Queen was praised for her handling of the crisis.  On 18 January, an agreement was announced whereby the couple would "no longer be working members of Britain’s royal family", and would not use their "royal highness" titles, and was variously described as a "hard Megxit". \c\cMegxit came to signify the break by the couple from the British royal family and formal royal protocol, and their plans for independence under their new brand, Sussex Royal.  The term also reflects a widely reported assumption that Meghan was the driver of their announcement, and has been alleged to be pejorative.  Broader parallels were drawn with the New York Times noting: "‘Megxit’ Is the New Brexit in a Britain Split by Age and Politics".
The Lobby Day 2020 was a peaceful Gun Rights protest that took place on January 20th, 2020 at the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, Virginia.  The protest is an extension of the Second Amendment sanctuary movement and is organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League.
The 2019 – 2020 China pneumonia outbreak, also known as Wuhan pneumonia (simplified Chinese: 武汉肺炎; traditional Chinese: 武漢肺炎; pinyin: Wǔhàn fèiyán) began in mid-December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in central China, as an emerging cluster of people with pneumonia of unknown cause, linked primarily to stallholders who worked at the Huanan Seafood Market (華南海鮮市場), which sold live animals. Chinese scientists subsequently isolated a new coronavirus, the 2019-nCoV, which has been found to be at least 70% similar in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV, and later mapped and made available its gene sequence. \c\cThe first suspected cases were reported on 31 December 2019, with the first symptoms appearing just over three weeks earlier on 8 December 2019. The market was closed off on 1 January 2020 and people with the symptoms were isolated. Over 700 people, including more than 400 healthcare workers, who came into close contacts with suspected cases were subsequently monitored. With the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, the presence of 2019-nCoV was then confirmed in 41 people in the Wuhan cluster, of which two were later reported to be a married couple, one of whom had not been to the market, and another three who were members of the same family that worked at the markets seafood stalls. On 9 January 2020, the first death occurred in a 61-year-old affected man in Wuhan. On 16 January 2020, Chinese authorities announced that another 69-year-old man in Wuhan, who was confirmed with the illness, had died the previous day. \c\cBecause there is limited evidence of human-to-human transmission, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that a wider outbreak was possible. There were also concerns of further spreading during Chinas peak travel season around Chinese New Year. On 20 January, China reported a sharp rise in cases with nearly 140 new patients, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen. \c\cConfirmed cases outside of China include two women in Thailand and one man in Japan. Based on these developments and assumptions such as international travel statistics, British scientists on 17 January estimated that the true number of infections could be around 1,700. As of 20 January, the number of laboratory-confirmed cases stands at 204, including 201 in China, two in Thailand, and one in Japan.
The 2019–20 novel coronavirus outbreak, also known as the Wuhan coronavirus, the China pneumonia outbreak or the Wuhan pneumonia (simplified Chinese: 武汉肺炎; traditional Chinese: 武漢肺炎; pinyin: Wǔhàn fèiyán) was initially identified during mid-December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in central China, as an emerging cluster of people with pneumonia of unknown cause, linked primarily to stallholders who worked at the Huanan Seafood Market (華南海鮮市場), which also sold live animals. Chinese scientists subsequently isolated a new coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV, which has been found to be at least 70% similar in gene sequence to SARS-CoV. It has not yet however, shown to be of the same severity or as deadly as SARS. \c\cWhether the situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern under International Health Regulations will be discussed on 22 January 2020 by an emergency committee arranged by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO had warned that a wider outbreak was possible, and there were concerns of further spreading during Chinas peak travel season around Chinese New Year. Questions raised have included whether the virus has been circulating for longer than previously thought, whether Wuhan really is the center of the outbreak or simply the place it was first identified with ongoing surveillance and testing, and could there be a possibility that Wuhan is a superspreader event. \c\c20 January 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged decisive and effective efforts to prevent and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. \c\cAs of 22 January 2020, nine deaths have occurred, all in mainland China, and there is evidence of human-to-human spread. Increased testing has revealed more than 400 confirmed cases, some of whom are healthcare workers. Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau and the United States. \c\cThe first suspected cases were reported on 31 December 2019, with the first symptoms appearing just over three weeks earlier on 8 December 2019. The market was closed off on 1 January 2020 and people with the symptoms were isolated. Over 700 people, including more than 400 healthcare workers, who came into close contact with suspected cases were initially monitored.

The first death occurred on 9 January 2020.
A Labour Party leadership election is being held in the United Kingdom in 2020. It was triggered after the current leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said that he intended to resign following the partys poor results at the 2019 general election, where Labour lost 60 seats and achieved their lowest number of seats since 1935. It is being held alongside a deputy leadership election.
The 2019–20 novel coronavirus outbreak, also known as the Wuhan coronavirus, the China pneumonia outbreak or the Wuhan pneumonia (simplified Chinese: 武汉肺炎; traditional Chinese: 武漢肺炎; pinyin: Wǔhàn fèiyán) began in mid-December 2019 in the city of Wuhan on the Yangtze River in central China, as an emerging cluster of people with pneumonia of unknown cause, linked primarily to stallholders who worked at the Huanan Seafood Market (華南海鮮市場), which also sold live animals. Chinese scientists subsequently isolated a new coronavirus, the 2019-nCoV, which has been found to be at least 70% similar in gene sequence to SARS-CoV. As of 21 January 2020, increased testing has shown near to 300 confirmed cases, including some in healthcare workers and some outside China. Six deaths have occured and there is evidence of human-to-human spread. It has not yet however, shown to be of the same severity or as deadly as SARS. Questions raised include whether the virus has been circulating for longer than previously thought, whether Wuhan really is the center of the outbreak or simply the place it was first identified with ongoing surveillance and testing, and could there be a possibility that Wuhan is a superspreader event. Whether the situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern under International Health Regulations will be discussed on 22 January 2020 by an emergency committee arranged by the World Health Organization (WHO). \c\c2019-nCoV does not currently have an effective medicine treatment or vaccine, though efforts to develop some are underway. Its symptoms include, among others, fever, breathing difficulties and coughing, which have been described as "flu-like". To prevent infection, the WHO recommends "regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing..  avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness (such as coughing and sneezing)." Though there are no specific treatments for general human coronaviruses, the U.S. CDC provides generic advice that an infected person can relieve their symptoms by taking regular flu medications, drinking fluids and resting. Some countries require people to report flu-like symptoms to their doctor, especially if they have visited mainland China. \c\cThe first suspected cases were reported on 31 December 2019, with the first symptoms appearing just over three weeks earlier on 8 December 2019. The market was closed off on 1 January 2020 and people with the symptoms were isolated. Over 700 people, including more than 400 healthcare workers, who came into close contact with suspected cases were initially monitored. With the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, the presence of 2019-nCoV was subsequently confirmed in 41 people in the original Wuhan cluster, of which two were later reported to be a married couple, one of whom had not been to the market, and another three who were members of the same family that worked at the markets seafood stalls. The outbreak resulted in initial deaths on 9 January 2020 and 16 January 2020, both in men over 60, a third on 19 January 2020, and three more on 21 January 2020. \c\cChinas National Health Commission confirmed on 20 January 2020 that the new strain of coronavirus can be transmitted between humans. At the time, a number of healthcare workers had also been infected. The WHO had warned that a wider outbreak was possible, and there were concerns of further spreading during Chinas peak travel season around Chinese New Year. \c\cConfirmed cases outside of mainland China include two women in Thailand, one man in Japan, one woman in South Korea and one woman in Taiwan.  Based on these developments and assumptions such as international travel statistics, British scientists on 17 January estimated that the true number of infections could be around 1,700. On 20 January, China reported a sharp rise in cases with nearly 140 new patients, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen. As of 21 January, the number of laboratory-confirmed cases stands at 318, including 312 in mainland China, two in Thailand, one in Japan, one in South Korea, one in Taiwan and one in the United States.
Since June 2019, there have been many large bushfires burning across Australia, especially in the south east where a state of emergency was declared in New South Wales. As of 14 January 2020, fires this season have burnt an estimated 18.6 million hectares (46 million acres; 186,000 square kilometres; 72,000 square miles), destroyed over 5,900 buildings (including approximately 2,683 homes) and killed at least 33 people. An estimated one billion animals were also killed and some endangered species may be driven to extinction. \c\cWhereas these bushfires are regarded by the NSW Rural Fire Service as the worst bushfire season in memory for that state, the 1974 bushfires were nationally much larger consuming 117 million hectares (290 million acres; 1,170,000 square kilometres; 450,000 square miles). However, due to their lower intensity and remote location, the 1974 fires caused around $5 million (about $36.5 million in 2020) in damages. In December 2019 the New South Wales Government declared a state of emergency after record-breaking temperatures and prolonged drought exacerbated the bushfires. \c\cFrom September 2019 fires heavily impacted various regions of the state of New South Wales, such as the North Coast, Mid North Coast, the Hunter Region, the Hawkesbury and the Wollondilly in Sydneys far west, the Blue Mountains, Illawarra and the South Coast, Riverina and Snowy Mountains with more than 100 fires burnt across the state. In eastern and north-eastern Victoria large areas of forest burnt out of control for four weeks before the fires emerged from the forests in late December, taking lives, threatening many towns and isolating Corryong and Mallacoota. A state of disaster was declared for East Gippsland. Significant fires occurred in the Adelaide Hills and Kangaroo Island in South Australia. Moderately affected areas were south-eastern Queensland and areas of south-western Western Australia, with a few areas in Tasmania and the ACT being mildly impacted. \c\cReinforcements from all over Australia were called in to assist fighting the fires and relieve exhausted local crews in New South Wales. On 11 November it was reported that the Victorian Country Fire Authority (CFA) was sending in a large contingent of up to 300 firefighters and support staff to assist. By mid-November 2019, more than 100 firefighters were sent from Western Australia. Contingents were also sent from South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. On 12 November, the Australian Government announced that the Australian Defence Force would provide air support to the firefighting effort, as well as prepare to provide manpower and logistical support. Firefighters and equipment from New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada and the United States, among others, helped fight the fires, especially in New South Wales.

With the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, a number of cases were confirmed in people directly linked to the market and in those who were not directly associated with it. Whether this virus is of the same severity or lethality as SARS is unclear. \c\cOn 20 January 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang urged decisive and effective efforts to prevent and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. As of 23 January 2020, 18 deaths have occurred, all in China, and there is evidence of human-to-human transmission. Extensive testing has revealed over 600 confirmed cases, some of whom are healthcare workers. Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, the United States, Singapore, and Vietnam. \c\cWhether the situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern under International Health Regulations was discussed on 22 January 2020 by an emergency committee organised by the World Health Organization (WHO). The decision was postponed due to lack of information. The WHO had warned that a wider outbreak was possible, and there were concerns of further transmission during Chinas peak travel season around the Chinese New Year. The sudden increase in occurrences of the disease has raised questions relating to wildlife trade, uncertainties surrounding the virus’s ability to spread and cause harm, whether the virus has been circulating for longer than previously thought, its origin and the possibility of the outbreak being a super-spreader event. \c\cThe first suspected cases were reported on 31 December 2019, with the first instances of symptomatic illness appearing just over three weeks earlier on 8 December 2019. The market was closed off on 1 January 2020, and people who showed signs and symptoms of the coronavirus infection were isolated. Over 700 people, including more than 400 healthcare workers who came into close contact with possibly infected individuals, were initially monitored. After the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, the presence of 2019-nCoV was subsequently confirmed in 41 people in the original Wuhan cluster, of which two were later reported to be a married couple, one of whom had not been present in the marketplace, and another three who were members of the same family that worked at the marketplaces seafood stalls. The first confirmed death from the coronavirus infection occurred on 9 January 2020. \c\cOn 23 January 2020, Wuhan was placed under quarantine, in which all public transport in and out of Wuhan have been suspended. The cities of Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang, adjacent to Wuhan, will also be placed under a similar quarantine from 24 January 2020 onwards.
An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, given the designation of 2019-nCoV, started around mid-December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in central China when an emerging cluster of people contracted pneumonia with no clear cause. A majority of the earliest cases were directly associated with stallholders who worked at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals and game meat, though the exact origin of the virus has not been determined. Chinese scientists isolated a new strain of coronavirus which has been found to be at least 70 percent similar in genome sequence to SARS-CoV. With the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, a number of cases were confirmed in people directly linked to the market and in those who were not directly associated with it. There is evidence of human-to-human transmission.  Whether this virus is of the same severity or lethality as SARS is unclear. \c\cOn 20 January 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang has urged decisive and effective efforts to prevent and control the epidemic. On 23 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) decided against declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but said that their emergency committee would quickly reconvene to review the decision if necessary. The WHO had previously warned that a wider outbreak was possible, and there were concerns of further transmission during Chinas peak travel season around the Chinese New Year, Chunyun. Many New Year events have been closed over fear of transmission, including the Forbidden City in Beijing, traditional temple fairs, and other celebratory gatherings. The sudden increase in occurrences of the disease has raised questions relating to its origin, wildlife trade, uncertainties surrounding the viruss ability to spread and cause harm, whether the virus has been circulating for longer than previously thought, and the possibility of the outbreak being a super-spreader event. \c\cThe WHO was notified of the first suspected cases on 31 December 2019, with the first instances of symptomatic illness appearing just over three weeks earlier on 8 December 2019.

Of those 41 people, two were later reported to be a married couple, one of whom had not been present in the marketplace, and another three were members of the same family that worked at the marketplaces seafood stalls. Extensive testing thereafter revealed over 1,900 confirmed cases in China, some of whom were working in healthcare. Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, France, Nepal, Australia, and Malaysia. The first confirmed death from the coronavirus infection occurred on 9 January 2020. By 25 January, the number of deaths due to 2019-nCoV stood at 56, all in China. \c\cOn 23 January 2020, Wuhan was placed under quarantine, in which all public transport in and out of Wuhan has been suspended. Since then, transportation in at least 15 other cities in Hubei province have also been halted in a similar fashion.
The 62nd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony is scheduled for January 26, 2020, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. It will recognize the best recordings, compositions, and artists of the eligibility year, running from October 1, 2018 to August 31, 2019.

On the morning of January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76B helicopter carrying nine occupants, including former professional basketball player Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, crashed in Calabasas, California, around 30 miles west of Los Angeles. All occupants, including the pilot, were killed.
The Trump–Ukraine scandal is an ongoing political scandal in the United States. It revolves around efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to coerce Ukraine and other foreign countries into providing damaging narratives about 2020 Democratic Party presidential primary candidate Joe Biden as well as information relating to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Trump enlisted surrogates within and outside his official administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, to pressure Ukraine and other foreign governments to cooperate in supporting conspiracy theories concerning American politics. Trump blocked but later released payment of a congressionally mandated $400 million military aid package to allegedly obtain quid pro quo cooperation from Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine. A number of contacts were established between the White House and the government of Ukraine, culminating in a July 25, 2019, phone call between Trump and Zelensky. \c\cThe scandal reached public attention in mid-September 2019 due to a whistleblower complaint made in August 2019. The complaint raised concerns about Trump using presidential powers to solicit foreign electoral intervention in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The Trump White House has corroborated several allegations raised by the whistleblower. A non-verbatim transcript of the Trump–Zelensky call confirmed that Trump requested investigations into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a conspiracy theory involving a Democratic National Committee server, while repeatedly urging Zelensky to work with Giuliani and Barr on these matters. The White House also confirmed that a record of the call had been stored in a highly restricted system. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said one reason why Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine was Ukrainian "corruption related to the DNC server", referring to a debunked theory that Ukrainians framed Russia for hacking into the DNC computer system. Trump has also publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens. The Trump administrations top diplomat to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testified that he was told U.S. military aid to Ukraine and a Trump–Zelensky White House meeting were conditioned on Zelensky publicly announcing investigations into the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that he worked with Giuliani at Trumps "express direction" to arrange a quid pro quo with the Ukraine government. \c\cOn September 24, 2019, the House of Representatives began a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, led by six House committees. On October 31, 2019, the House of Representatives voted to approve guidelines for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry. \c\cOn December 3, 2019, as part of the impeachment inquiry, the House Intelligence Committee published a 300-page report detailing that "the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into Joe Biden, one of Trumps domestic political opponents. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine." In January 2020, the Government Accountability Office, a non-partisan watchdog, concluded that the White House broke federal law by withholding Congress-approved military aid to Ukraine.
A new coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV (also known as the Wuhan coronavirus), was identified in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, after people developed pneumonia without a clear cause and for which existing vaccines or treatments were not effective. The virus has shown evidence of human-to-human transmission and its transmission rate (rate of infection) appeared to escalate in mid-January 2020, with several countries other than China reporting cases. The incubation period (time from exposure to developing symptoms) of the virus, which can be fatal, is 1-14 days, and it is infectious during this time. Symptoms include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties. Chinese Health Minister Ma Xiaowei has said that people can spread the virus before they display any symptoms. \c\cWuhan has been placed under quarantine, in which all public transport in and out has been suspended. Thereafter, transportation in at least 15 other cities in Hubei province have also been halted in a similar fashion. Many New Year events have been closed over fear of transmission, including the Forbidden City in Beijing, traditional temple fairs, and other celebratory gatherings. Hong Kong has also raised their infectious disease response level to the highest level and declared an emergency, closed its schools until mid-February and cancelled its New Year celebrations. \c\cA number of countries have put out travel advisories warning against travel to Wuhan and/or Hubei province in China. Travelers who have visited Mainland China have been requested to monitor their health for at least two weeks and contact their healthcare provider to report any symptoms of the virus. Anyone who suspects themselves to carry the virus are advised to wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice by calling a doctor rather than directly visiting the clinic in person. The travel sector has been providing refunds and no-fee cancellation for reservations in Mainland China or by people from Mainland China. Airports and train stations have implemented temperature checks, health declarations and information signage in an attempt to identify carriers of the virus. \c\cOn 20 January 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang has urged efforts to prevent and control the epidemic. Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the new coronavirus quickly, with the genetic sequence being made available for laboratories across the world to independently develop PCR tests that can confirm infection in a person. Of the first 41 people confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing to have been infected, two-thirds were found to have a link with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals. The seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans, 2019-nCoVs genome sequence has been reported to be 75- to 80-percent identical to SARS-CoV, and more than 85-percent similar to several bat coronaviruses. Whether this virus is of the same severity or lethality as SARS is unclear. \c\cAfter the development of a diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, the presence of 2019-nCoV was confirmed in 41 people in the original Wuhan cluster. Of those 41 people, two were later reported to be a married couple, one of whom had not been present in the marketplace, and another three were members of the same family that worked at the marketplaces seafood stalls. Extensive testing thereafter revealed over 2,700 confirmed cases in China, some of whom were working in healthcare. Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, France, Nepal, Australia, and Malaysia. The first confirmed death from the coronavirus infection occurred on 9 January 2020. By 26 January, the number of deaths due to 2019-nCoV stood at 80, all in China.

The seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans, 2019-nCoVs genome sequence has been reported to be 75- to 80-percent identical to SARS-CoV, and more than 85-percent similar to several bat coronaviruses. Whether this virus is of the same severity or lethality as SARS is unclear. \c\cAfter the development of a diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, the presence of 2019-nCoV was confirmed in 41 people in the original Wuhan cluster. Of those 41 people, two were later reported to be a married couple, one of whom had not been present in the marketplace, and another three were members of the same family that worked at the marketplaces seafood stalls. Extensive testing thereafter revealed over 2,700 confirmed cases in China, some of whom were working in healthcare. Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, France, Nepal, Australia, and Malaysia. The first confirmed death from the coronavirus infection occurred on 9 January 2020. By 26 January, the number of deaths due to 2019-nCoV stood at 80, all in China.
Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People, commonly known as the  Trump peace plan, is a peace proposal by the Trump administration intended to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Donald Trump formally unveiled the plan in a 28 January 2020 White House press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; Palestinian representatives were not invited. The plan was authored by a team led by Trumps son-in law, Senior Advisor to the President of the United States Jared Kushner. Various news organizations have referred to the plan as the "deal of the century", although there is no record of U.S. President Donald Trump or the Trump administration using the name. The Palestinian leadership rejected the plan, arguing it too biased in favor of Israel. The plan is divided into two parts, an economic portion and a political portion. On 22 June 2019, the Trump administration released the economic portion of the plan, titled "Peace to Prosperity". The political portion was released in late January 2020. \c\cDuring the press conference announcing the plan, Netanyahu announced that the Israeli government would immediately annex the Jordan Valley and West Bank settlements, and US Ambassador to Israel David M. Friedman confirmed that the Trump administration had given permission for an immediate annexation, stating that “Israel does not have to wait at all” and “we will recognize it.” Opponents of the Trump Peace Plan – including all the leading Democratic presidential candidates – have denounced it as a "smokescreen" for this annexation. \c\cProposed benefits to the Palestinians from the plan are contingent on a list of conditions which have been denounced by opponents of the plan as "impossible" or "fantastic".
Algeria–Bangladesh relations refer to the bilateral relations between Algeria and Bangladesh. Algeria played a key role in Bangladeshs induction into the Organization of the Islamic Conference following the latters independence from Pakistan in 1971. \c\cBangladesh has an embassy in Algiers, whilst Algeria has a non resident ambassador in Islamabad, Pakistan. \c\cAlgerian President Houari Boumediene traveled to Bangladesh to take Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on a special plane to the Islamic Summit in Lahore in 1974.
Fossil fuel divestment or fossil fuel divestment and investment in climate solutions is an attempt to reduce climate change by exerting social, political, and economic pressure for the institutional divestment of assets including stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments connected to companies involved in extracting fossil fuels. Fossil fuel divestment campaigns emerged on campuses in the United States in 2010 with students urging their administrations to turn endowment investments in the fossil fuel industry into investments in clean energy and communities most impacted by climate change. By 2015, fossil fuel divestment was reportedly the fastest growing divestment movement in history. By December 2019, a total of 1,200 institutions and over 58,000 individuals representing $12 trillion in assets worldwide had been divested from fossil fuels.
On 2 February 2020, a man stabbed three people in Streatham, Greater London, in what police have declared a terrorist incident. The attacker was shot dead by Metropolitan Police authorised firearms officers outside the doors of a Boots store on Streatham High Road just after 14:00 GMT (UTC-0). The incident occurred on Streatham High Road about 14:00 GMT (UTC-0). Hours later a similar attack took place in Ghent, Belgium.
The 2019–20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, formally the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is an ongoing viral epidemic primarily affecting Mainland China, along with isolated cases in 27 other countries and territories. In early December 2019 a new coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV, was identified in Wuhan, the capital of Chinas Hubei province, after 41 people developed pneumonia without a clear cause (2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease). The virus is capable of spreading from person to person. The incubation period (time from exposure to onset of symptoms) ranges from 2 to 14 days, but it may be contagious during this period and after recovery. Symptoms include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and the virus can be fatal. An estimate of the death rate in February 2020 was 2% of confirmed cases, higher among those who require admission to hospital. \c\cAs of 6 February 2020,  28,089 cases have been confirmed by the Chinese government, including in every province-level division of China. A larger number of people may have been infected, but not detected (especially mild cases). According to official figures, As of 6 February 2020, 565 deaths have been attributed to the virus since the first confirmed death on 9 January, with 1,387 recoveries. The first local transmission outside China occurred in Vietnam between family members, while the first local transmission not involving family occurred in Germany, on 22 January, when a German man contracted the disease from a Chinese business visitor at a meeting. The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines, where a 44-year-old male from Wuhan died on 1 February. \c\cIn China and around the world, public health authorities are engaged in efforts to contain the spread of the outbreak. In an effort of unprecedented scope, the government of China has introduced travel restrictions to isolate 16 cities, affecting over 57 million people.   A number of countries have issued warnings against travel to Wuhan and Hubei. Travellers who have visited Mainland China have been asked to monitor their health for at least two weeks and contact their healthcare provider to report any symptoms of the virus. Anyone who suspects that they are carrying the virus is advised to wear a protective mask and seek medical advice by calling a doctor rather than directly visiting a clinic in person. Airports and train stations have implemented temperature checks, health declarations and information signage in an attempt to identify carriers of the virus. Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs. In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities announced that the New Year’s holiday is extended to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to re-open until that date. These regions represent 80% of the countrys GDP and 90% of exports. Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. \c\cThe outbreak has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO), based on the possible effects the virus could have if it spreads to countries with weaker healthcare systems. The declaration was the sixth time that the measure has been invoked since the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. \c\cXenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent have been noted due to the outbreak, fuelling fear and hostility across various countries. Misinformation spread primarily online about the coronavirus has led the WHO to declare an "infodemic" on 2 February.
The 2020 Nakhon Ratchasima shooting occurred on 8 February 2020. A soldier shot dead at least 12 people in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima, informally known as Korat. He shot and killed a commander and two others at the military camp he was stationed before stealing a Humvee and opening fire on civilians inside a mall, killing at least 14. In particular, he fired at a cooking gas cylinder at the mall, causing it to explode. After that he took several mallgoers hostage.
The 2020 Nakhon Ratchasima shooting occurred between 8 and 9 February 2020. A soldier of the Royal Thai Army shot dead at least 27 people and wounded at least 63 others in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, informally known as Korat. The rampage began when the suspect shot and killed his commanding officer and two others at Surathamphithak Camp (ค่ายสุรธรรมพิทักษ์), the base where he was stationed. The suspect then stole weapons and a military Humvee and drove to the Terminal 21 Korat mall, where he opened fire on civilians. During the attack, the suspect posted on social media. It is the deadliest mass shooting in the countrys history.
Storm Ciara, also known as Storm Sabine in the German-speaking DACH countries, is an active extratropical cyclone, and the third named storm of the 2019–20 UK and Ireland windstorm season. Ciara has brought heavy rain and severe winds across much of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden.
Storm Dennis, unofficially referred to as Dennis the Menace in the popular media, is an active European windstorm currently affecting parts of North West Europe. Dennis was named by the UK Met Office on 11 February 2020. It is the thirteenth named storm of the 2019–20 European windstorm season and the fourth named storm by the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and Netherlands naming cooperation. It is expected to be one of the most intense storms ever reported in the North Atlantic basin, with pressure predicted to fall as low as 915 hectopascals (27.0 inHg). Despite its intensity, the effects from the Storm are not expected to be as notable as Storm Ciara, with maximum wind gusts predicted of 80 miles per hour (130 km/h). However, heavy rains from this system are expected to cause flooding across parts of the United Kingdom.  Currently, the strongest storm ever observed in this area is the Braer Storm in January 1993, with pressure possibly as low as 910 hectopascals (27 inHg).
The COVID-19 outbreak is an ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in China in December 2019. It causes the novel clinical syndrome known as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019). It has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO).  Public health authorities have been working to contain the spread of the disease since its initial discovery in December 2019. \c\cAs of 15 February 2020, 67,185 cases have been diagnosed, including in every province-level division of China, however, 10,627 people in China have met the clinical criteria for serious disease. Worldwide, expert opinion varies on the possible number of cases. The death toll has surpassed the 2003 SARS outbreak, with 1,527 deaths attributable to the disease. However, there have been only four deaths reported outside mainland China: one each in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan, and France. \c\cChina has introduced travel restrictions, quarantines, and outdoor restrictions – requiring families to stay at home – affecting over 170 million people. A number of countries have issued warnings against travel to Wuhan, Hubei, and China generally. Travellers who have visited Mainland China have been asked to monitor their health for at least two weeks. Anyone who suspects that they are carrying the virus is advised to wear a protective mask and seek medical advice by calling a doctor rather than directly visiting a clinic in person. Airports and train stations have implemented body temperature checks, health declarations and information signage in an attempt to identify carriers of the virus. \c\cMisinformation spread primarily online about the coronavirus which the WHO described as an "infodemic" on 2 February 2020. The epidemic has led to further consequences beyond quarantine measures and its impact on health, including concerns over potential economic instability and cancellation of several events expected to be attended by people traveling from areas with high risk of contagion. Xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent have arisen as a result of the outbreak, with fear and hostility occurring in several countries. \c\cThere are no vaccines or specific treatments for the syndrome, with efforts typically involving management of symptoms and supportive measures.
The Sagamihara stabbings were committed on 26 July 2016 in Midori Ward, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan. Nineteen people were killed and twenty-six others were injured, thirteen severely, at a care home for disabled people. The suspect was a 26-year-old man, identified as Satoshi Uematsu (植松 聖, Uematsu Satoshi), a former employee of the care facility. Uematsu surrendered at a nearby police station with a bag of knives and was subsequently arrested. The attack was described as one of the worst crimes committed on Japanese soil in modern history.
Espionage refers to the idea of using spies in order to obtain governmental or military-related information. \c\cRussian espionage in the United States has occurred since at least during the Cold War, by the Soviet Union, and likely well before. According to the United States government, by 2007 it had reached Cold War levels.
Yukos shareholders v. Russia are several international court and arbitral cases seeking compensation from the government of Russia to the former shareholders of Yukos based on the claim that Russian courts were not acting in good faith in launching tax evasion criminal proceedings against Yukos, which led to the bankruptcy of the company. \c\cThe Yukos Oil Companys former shareholders and management filed a series of claims in courts and before arbitration panels in various countries, seeking compensation for their expropriation. The largest, for over $100 billion, was filed at the international Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2007 and resulted in the arbitrators awarding Yukos majority shareholders over US$50 billion in damages. This decision was appealed by Russia and overturned by the Hagues district court. \c\cObservers note the bad timing of the final rulings on the majority shareholders' claim for Russia amid the Ukrainian crisis. Russia intends to fight these decision of the international courts. \c\cUS and Russian investors, representing about 15 percent and 5 percent of Yukos, respectively, lack the benefit of an investment treaty. The sole remedy of US-based investors in seeking approximately $12 billion in redress is to request the State Department and the Office of the United States Trade Representative to espouse the claim to their Russian counterparts, as it is determined by the Magnitsky Act of 2012; State Department officials have reportedly raised Yukos investors' concerns at deputy prime minister level in the past.

The first confirmed case of the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States was announced on January 21, 2020. As of March 3, 2020, there were 124 confirmed and presumptive cases of coronavirus in the U.S., including nine deaths. \c\cAs of January 31, 2020, the U.S. government requires Americans returning home after traveling in Chinas Hubei Province to submit to a 14-day quarantine. The United States is also denying entry to non-Americans who have traveled in China within the preceding two weeks. The US government has evacuated its employees as well as non-employee citizens from Hubei Province and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in quarantine in Yokohama. \c\cU.S. health authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are urging local governments, businesses, and schools to develop plans like canceling mass gatherings or switching to teleworking so as to be ready when the need arises. To prevent the spread of coronavirus, the CDC recommends washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available), avoiding touching ones eyes, nose, and mouth, covering coughs and sneezes, staying home when one is sick, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and cleaning and disinfecting "frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe."

During the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom. As of 5 March 2020, according to Iranian health authorities, there had been 108 COVID-19 deaths in Iran with a total of around 3500 confirmed infections. As of the same date, Iran has the third highest number of COVID-19 deaths after China and Italy, the highest in Western Asia and the fourth-highest number of SARS-CoV-2 cases, surpassed by only Mainland China, South Korea and Italy. \c\cIn late February 2020, non-Iranian-government sources stated estimates of the numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths that were much higher than official values. On 25 February, University of Toronto researchers estimated statistically about 4,000 to 53,000 SARS-CoV-2 infected people in Iran, with 18,000 as the most likely value. Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani claimed on 24 February that the number of COVID-19 deaths was 50 in Qom. BBC Persian estimated on 28 February, from Iranian hospital sources, a total of 210 COVID-19 deaths in Iran. Iranian officials denied Amirabadis and BBC Persians estimates. The World Health Organizations director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that "the WHO has its own mechanism for checking facts and has not seen problems with Irans reported figures". \c\cMultiple senior Iranian officials have been diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive: deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi, Vice President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar, Chairman of Parliaments National Security and Foreign Affairs Committee Mojtaba Zolnour, head of emergency services Pirhossein Kolivand. Irans first ambassador to the Vatican, Hadi Khosroshahi, Member of Expediency Discernment Council Mohammad Mirmohammadi and diplomat Hossein Sheikholeslam also died from COVID-19. 23 members of the Iranian Parliament, around 8% of all MPs, were reported to have been infected by 3 March 2020.

The 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak was confirmed to have spread to the United Kingdom (UK) on 31 January 2020 from China, when the first two cases with the respiratory disease COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed in Newcastle upon Tyne in two individuals who were members of a family of Chinese nationals staying in a hotel in York. \c\cOn 12 January the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a new coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. The UK subsequently developed a prototype specific laboratory test for the new disease. The four UK Chief Medical Officers (CMO)s raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January, upon the WHOs announcement of the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Guidance on infection prevention and control, and how to detect and diagnose COVID-19 have been issued by the government. \c\cAs soon as cases appeared in the UK on 31 January a public health information campaign was launched to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus. Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to announce the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020. Daily updates, including advice to travellers have been published by the UKs Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). In addition, the NHS set up a COVID-19 drive-through screening centre at multiple hospitals. \c\cAs of 9 AM, 5 March after performing 17,968 tests, there are 115 confirmed cases in mainland UK, as well as 1 case in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar.

The first cases of the 2019–20 coronavirus in Italy were confirmed on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019, caused by SARS-CoV-2. A week later, an Italian man repatriated back to Italy from the city of Wuhan, China, was hospitalized and confirmed to be the third case of the 2019–20 coronavirus in Italy. A cluster of cases were later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February, an additional 60 cases on 22 February, and Italys first deaths reported on the same day. However those cases were not directly related to China. Patient zero is unknown. \c\cAs of beginning of March, Italy was hit harder than anywhere else in the EU by the outbreak, and is the country with the third-highest number of positive cases and the second-highest number of deaths in the world, after China. Eleven municipalities in northern Italy have been identified as the epicentres of the two main Italian clusters and placed under quarantine. The majority of positive cases in the other regions lead back to these two clusters.

The 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak was first manifested by a cluster of mysterious pneumonia in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on  27 December 2019. On 31 December, Wuhan CDC admitted there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to Huanan Seafood Market, after unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention, including that of the National Health Commission (NHC) in Beijing, who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia. The sequence of the virus was soon published on an open-access database. Measures taken by China were widely praised by many including the World Health Organization (WHO). Chinas response appeared to be much more transparent than how the country responded to SARS in 2003. \c\cHowever, delayed and controversial response by the Wuhan and Hubei authorities failed to contain the outbreak in the early stage, which has led to criticism from the public and the media. By 29 January, the virus had been spread to all provinces of mainland China. By 8 February, over 724 had died of the coronavirus infection-associated pneumonia and 34,878 were confirmed to be infected. In Hubei alone, there were 24,953 cases of infections and 699 related deaths. All provinces of mainland China had initiated the highest response level to public health emergency. WHO declared the outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern" on 31 January, for fear that the virus spread beyond China to where there is no robust healthcare system, despite its confidence in Chinas efforts. \c\cChinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping warned of a grave situation facing China. The Party Politburo formed a special leading group for epidemic control led by Premier Li Keqiang. Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled. Passengers were checked for their temperatures. Commands for epidemic control (CEC) have been formed in different regions including Wuhan and Hubei. Many inter-province bus services and railway services have been suspended. By 29th, all Hubei cities had been quarantined. Curfew laws are in practice in Huanggang, Wenzhou and other mainland cities. The region also sees a huge shortage of face masks and other protective gears, despite itself being the worlds manufacturing hub for these products. \c\cWith the increasing reported cases of infections, fear upgraded along with regional discrimination in China and racial discrimination beyond China, despite calls for stopping the discrimination by many governments. Some rumors circulated across Chinese social media, along with counter-rumor efforts by media and governments.
The 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in La Gomera. \c\cOn 24 February, following a COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, Spain confirmed multiple cases related to the Italian clusters, starting from a medical doctor from Lombardy, Italy who was vacationing in Tenerife. Afterwards, multiple COVID-19 cases were detected in Tenerife involving people who had come in contact with the doctor. Other cases involving individuals who visited Italy were also discovered on Spanish mainland. \c\cAs of 10 March 2020, there are 1,592 confirmed active cases, 32 recoveries and 35 deaths in Spain, 1,231 cases in total, according to authorities. The ages of the 30 deceased range from 69 to 99 years. At least 68 hospitalized patients are in critical care. Only 10 provinces out of 50 (Ávila, Córdoba, Cuenca, Granada,Huesca, Lugo, Palencia, Soria, Tarragona, and Zamora) – together with the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, have not yet registered any positive in COVID-19.
The first confirmed case of the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States was announced on January 21, 2020. As of March 9, 2020, there were at least 805 confirmed and presumptive cases in the U.S., including 28 deaths. Eighteen of the deaths were in Washington state, with 13 of them at a nursing home. Confirmed cases had appeared in 37 out of the 50 U.S. states, and Washington, D.C. \c\cOn January 31, 2020, the U.S. government began to require Americans returning home after traveling in Chinas Hubei Province to submit to a 14-day quarantine. The United States is also denying entry to non-Americans who have traveled in China within the preceding two weeks. The US government has evacuated its employees as well as non-employee citizens from Hubei Province and the Diamond Princess cruise ship in quarantine in Yokohama. \c\cOn February 25, American health authorities including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reported that they expected the virus to spread in the United States and they urged local governments, schools, and businesses to develop plans such as canceling mass gatherings or switching to teleworking. Lisa Monaco, a former Homeland Security Advisor, considers the Coronavirus disease a potential pandemic, a threat to national security and among the top threats facing the country that it should prepare for. \c\cOn March 2, the CDC stopped publishing the number of tests performed. In most U.S. locations, testing to date had only been performed on symptomatic people with a history of travel to Wuhan. \c\cOn March 7, CDC officials confirmed that the virus was spreading in the community — that is, being transmitted from person-to-person with unknown source — and that this was likely to continue in the coming days. They said widespread transmission may force large numbers of people to seek hospitalization and other healthcare, which may overload healthcare systems. They also said that workers and students may stay away from childcare centers, schools, and workplaces, and that large gatherings may be postponed or sparsely attended.

The patients, with no known connection to international travel or infected individuals, tested positive for the virus. Both patients were transferred to the Karolinska University Huddinge Hospital for further care, with exposed personnel from S:t Göran quarantined. \c\cOn 10 March, the Public Health Agency of Sweden raised the level of risk of the virus spreading in Sweden from "high" to "very high", which is the highest level. This comes after news that there are indications of ongoing local transmission in the Stockholm and Västra Götaland area. \c\cAs of 11 March 2020, there are 500 confirmed cases in Sweden, the majority of which are in Stockholm County. The first infected person, the woman from Jönköping, is the only officially recovered case. The first death was reported on the 11 of March, a person in their 70s in the Stockholm region. The person has not been abroad or in contact with an infected person. The person is believed to have been infected by community transmission approx. a week prior to their death.
During his career as a film producer, Harvey Weinstein, formerly of Miramax Films and The Weinstein Company (TWC), exploited his influential position to commit criminal sexual acts including rape. \c\cIn October 2017, The New York Times and The New Yorker reported that dozens of women accused Harvey Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse over a period of at least thirty years. Over eighty women in the film industry have since accused Weinstein of such acts. Weinstein denied "any non-consensual sex." Shortly after, he was dismissed from The Weinstein Company (TWC), was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other professional associations, and retired from public view. \c\cCriminal investigations into complaints from at least six women are ongoing in Los Angeles, New York City, and London. On May 25, 2018, Weinstein was arrested in New York, charged with rape and other offenses. On February 24, 2020, the jury found Weinstein guilty of rape in the third degree and a criminal sexual act, and not guilty on three counts including two more serious charges of predatory sexual assault. \c\cThe Times and the New Yorker were awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their coverage of Weinstein. The scandal triggered many similar allegations against powerful men around the world, and led to the ousting of many of them from their positions. It also led a great number of women to share their own experiences of sexual assault, harassment, or rape on social media under the hashtag #MeToo. The scandals impact on powerful men in various industries came to be called the "Weinstein effect".

Any U.S. citizen returning to the United States who has been in the rest of mainland China within the previous 14 days may be required to undergo a health screening and possible self-quarantine. In most U.S. locations, as of March 7, testing had only been performed on symptomatic people with a history of travel to Wuhan. \c\cThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued "Level 3" travel advisories for China, certain European Union countries, Iran, and South Korea, recommending against any non-essential travel to these regions by Americans. The United States is also denying entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in China, Iran, or beginning March 14, certain EU countries, within the past 14 days. \c\cIn late February, the CDC and other public-health agencies reported that they expected the virus to spread in the United States, and urged local governments, schools, and businesses to discourage large gatherings, and employ remote work.

The first confirmed case in the United States of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was announced on January 21, 2020. By March 12, 2020, diagnosed cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the U.S. exceeded 1,000. By March 14, they exceeded 2,000, and 3,000 a day later. Of the 63 deaths in the country, 40 had occurred in the state of Washington, with 27 of those at a nursing home. Cases have been confirmed in 49 out of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. As of March 14, the only state without a confirmed case was West Virginia. President Donald Trump declared the pandemic a national emergency on March 13. \c\cThe government first began testing persons for the virus infection in February, but soon after, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the test kits were defective and gave inaccurate readings, thus rendering them useless. This was followed by the government announcing a series of measures intended to speed up testing. As of March 14, all 50 states were able to perform tests, with a doctors approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs in a state, but the number of available test kits remained very limited, which means that the true number of people currently infected with the virus is impossible to estimate with any reasonable accuracy.  The CDC has suggested that doctors use their own judgment along with certain guidelines before authorizing a test. \c\cThe CDC has issued "Level 3" travel advisories for China, certain European countries, Iran, and South Korea, recommending against any non-essential travel to these regions by Americans. The United States is also denying entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in or through China, Iran, the 26 European countries that comprise the Schengen Area, and beginning March 16, the United Kingdom and Ireland, within the past 14 days. Americans returning home after traveling in Chinas Hubei Province have been required to submit to a 14-day quarantine. Any U.S. citizen returning to the United States who has been in the rest of mainland China within the previous 14 days may be required to undergo a health screening and possible self-quarantine. \c\cResponses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings, including the closure of schools and other educational institutions, the cancellation of trade shows, conventions, music festivals, and the cancellation and suspension of sporting events and leagues—a measure which intensified on March 11 after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic. The CDC warned that widespread transmission may force large numbers of people to seek hospitalization and other healthcare, which may overload healthcare systems.

The four UK Chief Medical Officers (CMO)s raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January, upon the WHOs announcement of the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). \c\cAs soon as cases appeared in the UK on 31 January a public health information campaign was launched to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus. Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to introduce the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 statutory instrument. Guidance on infection prevention and control, how to detect and diagnose COVID-19, and daily updates, including advice to travellers have been published by the UKs Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Public Health England (PHE). In addition, the NHS set up COVID-19 drive-through screening centres at multiple hospitals. Chief Medical Adviser to the UK Government, Chris Whitty has explained a strategy to tackle the outbreak, based upon four aims: contain, delay, research and mitigate. The earliest documented transmission within the UK occurred on 28 February 2020; all of the cases detected previously had been infected abroad.

As of April 3, 2022, there have been 140 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Philippines. Out of the 140 cases, 12 deaths were recorded. The first case was confirmed on January 30, that of a 38-year-old Chinese woman who was confined in the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. The second case was confirmed on February 2, that of a 44-year-old Chinese man who died a day earlier, which was also the first confirmed death from the disease outside mainland China. \c\cThe first case of someone with no travel history abroad was confirmed on March 5, a 62-year-old male who frequented a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan, Metro Manila, raising suspicions that a community transmission of COVID-19 is already underway in the Philippines. The mans wife was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 on March 7, which was also the first local transmission to be confirmed. The largest increase of the number of confirmed cases was on March 14, when 34 new cases were announced. \c\cThe Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila, is the medical facility where suspected cases are being tested for COVID-19 infection since January 30, 2020. Prior to that date, confirmatory tests were made abroad. \c\cSeveral measures were imposed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines, including bans on travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and South Korea. On March 7, 2020, the Department of Health (DOH) raised its "Code Red Sub-Level 1", with a recommendation to the President of the Philippines to impose a "public health emergency" authorizing the DOH to mobilize resources for the procurement of safety gear and the imposition of preventive quarantine measures. On March 9, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Proclamation No. 922, declaring the country under a state of public health emergency.  To prevent the spread of COVID-19, on March 12, 2020, during his public address on the emergency, President Duterte declared "Code Red Sub-Level 2," issuing a partial lockdown on Metro Manila and extending the metropolis class suspensions up to April 12, as recommended by the Inter-Agency Task Force of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). The class suspensions were later extended up to April 14 through a memorandum circular released by Malacañang on March 14. On March 16, the entirety of Luzon has been placed under an "enhanced community quarantine.". \c\cThe Philippine government has repatriated some of its citizens across different international locations, all of whom were later quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac.
The first confirmed case in the United States of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was announced on January 21, 2020. By March 12, 2020, diagnosed cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the U.S. exceeded 1,000.  By March 14, they exceeded 2,000. Of the 51 deaths in the country, 37 had occurred in the state of Washington, with 13 of those at a nursing home. Cases have been confirmed in 49 out of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The only state without a positive case of COVID-19 is West Virginia. President Donald Trump officially declared the pandemic a national emergency on March 13. \c\cThe government first began testing persons for the virus infection in February, but soon after, the CDC found that the test kits were defective and gave inaccurate readings, thus rendering them useless. But as of March 12, all 50 states were able to perform tests, with a doctors approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs in a state. This was followed by the government announcing a series of measures intended to speed up testing. The CDC has suggested that doctors use their own judgment along with certain guidelines before authorizing a test, since the symptoms of coronavirus in many ways resemble those from the flu and common cold. \c\cThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued "Level 3" travel advisories for China, certain European countries, Iran, and South Korea, recommending against any non-essential travel to these regions by Americans. The United States is also denying entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in or through China, Iran, or 26 European countries, within the past 14 days. Americans returning home after traveling in Chinas Hubei Province have been required to submit to a 14-day quarantine. Any U.S. citizen returning to the United States who has been in the rest of mainland China within the previous 14 days may be required to undergo a health screening and possible self-quarantine. \c\cResponses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings, including the closure of schools and other educational institutions, the cancellation of trade shows, conventions, music festivals, and the cancellation and suspension of sporting events and leagues—a measure which intensified on March 11 after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic. The CDC warned that widespread transmission may force large numbers of people to seek hospitalization and other healthcare, which may overload healthcare systems.
The 2020 Major League Baseball season was scheduled to begin on March 26.  On March 12, Major League Baseball (MLB) announced that due to the coronavirus pandemic, the remainder of spring training games were canceled, and the start of the regular season would be delayed by at least two weeks. On March 13, a concluded two-day meeting between the Major League Baseball Players Association and MLB officials hinted that the opening day delay will, in fact, be longer than two weeks, as fears over the ongoing pandemic resulted in players being given the right to skip practice during the season. On March 16, MLB announced that the season will be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks. \c\cPrior to the March 12 announcement, the regular season was scheduled to end on September 27, with the postseason scheduled to begin on September 29. The World Series was set to begin on October 20, with a potential Game 7 set to be played on October 28. The 91st Major League Baseball All-Star Game was scheduled to be held on July 14 at Dodger Stadium.  The entire schedule had been released on August 12, 2019.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are multiple attempts in progress to develop such a vaccine.  In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. By early March 2020, some 30 vaccine candidates were in development.
On the morning of March 18, 2020, a 5.7 magnitude earthquake hit Utah, United States, with an epicenter 6 km (3.7 mi) north-northeast of Magna, Utah. It was the states strongest earthquake since 1992. The earthquake caused power outages near Salt Lake City International Airport. A ground stop was enacted on the airport. The control tower was evacuated and passengers in terminals and concourses were moved onto buses. Cars on the TRAX light rail system were held at their nearest stations. Roughly 55,000 electricity customers lost power throughout the Salt Lake Valley. Over a dozen aftershocks were recorded in the 30 minutes following the main tremor. The largest aftershock was a 4.4 magnitude earthquake that occurred 53 minutes after the primary shock. Intense shaking was felt in Downtown Salt Lake City, and the earthquake was reportedly felt in Wyoming. Items were shaken off of walls and shelves in homes and businesses. Bricks were shed off of façades. The Weber School District cancelled its classes to assess earthquake damage. Earthquakes of similar magnitude impact Utah approximately once every decade.

The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, and was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 20 March, more than 272,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 184 countries and territories, resulting in more than 11,300 deaths  and 90,000 recoveries. \c\cThe virus primarily spreads between people via respiratory droplets, produced during coughing. It may also be spread from touching contaminated surfaces and then touching ones face. It is considered most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear. The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment; treatment is symptom and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected. \c\cEfforts to prevent spreading include travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, event postponements and cancellations, and facility closures. These include a quarantine of Hubei, nationwide quarantines in Italy and elsewhere in Europe, curfew measures in China and South Korea, various border closures or incoming passenger restrictions, screening at airports and train stations, and travel advisories regarding regions with community transmission. Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in at least 115 countries, affecting more than 1.6 billion students. \c\cThe pandemic has led to global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting and cultural events, as well as widespread fears of supply shortages across sectors including pharmaceuticals, electronics, and food. Negative effects include online misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus, xenophobia and racism, and panic buying of basic goods. Some commentators have called the pandemic the biggest global event since World War II.

The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Illinois began on January 24, 2020, when a woman in Chicago, who had just returned from the pandemics place of origin in Wuhan, China, tested positive for the virus. This was the second case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. The womans husband was diagnosed with the disease a few days later, the first known case of human-to-human transmission in the United States. Community transmission was not suspected until March 8, when a case with no connection to other cases or recent travel was confirmed. As of March 20, there were 753 diagnosed cases in the state, and six deaths. \c\cIn mid-March, as the number of known cases rose into the double digits, Governor J. B. Pritzker issued the states equivalent of a state of emergency, a disaster proclamation, to respond to the crisis. The state took measures to halt the spread of the disease by closing all schools and colleges, ordering a stop to eviction enforcements, ordering all bars and restaurants closed to sit-in diners, and otherwise restricting large gatherings of people. As the virus spread further, the state enacted an even stronger shelter in place order between the dates of March 21 and April 7, affecting schools and businesses across the state.

This will be the second time that Japan and specifically Tokyo has hosted the Summer Olympic Games, the first being in 1964, making it the first city in Asia to host the summer Games twice. Overall, these will be the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, which also hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972 (Sapporo) and 1998 (Nagano). The 2020 Games will be the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, the first being the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang County, South Korea, and the next being the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. \c\cThese Games will see the introduction of new and additional competitions at the Summer Olympics, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and Madison cycling, as well as further mixed events. Under new IOC policies that allow the host organizing committee to add sports to the Olympic programme to augment the permanent core Olympic events, these Games will see karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding make their Olympic debuts, as well as the return of baseball and softball for the first time since 2008. \c\cThe worldwide 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic has disrupted preparation for the Games and led to speculation that they may be postponed or cancelled. On 17 March 2020, the International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach expressed its steadfast and full committment to the success of the Tokyo Games.
An ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first confirmed to have spread to the United States in January 2020. Cases have been confirmed in all 50 U.S. states and all inhabited U.S. territories except the American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. Deaths from the pandemic have occurred in 23 states, with 13 having more than one death. Of the 154 deaths in the country prior to March 20, 94 occurred in the state of Washington, with 35 of those at one nursing home. Since then, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States has shifted from Washington to New York. \c\cThe first known case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was confirmed on January 20, 2020, in a 35-year-old man who had returned from Wuhan, China five days earlier. The White House Coronavirus Task Force was established on January 29. Two days later, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and announced restrictions on travelers arriving from China. The government first began testing persons for the virus infection in February, but soon after, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the test kits were defective and gave inaccurate readings, thus rendering them useless. This was followed by the government announcing a series of measures intended to speed up testing. As of March 14, all 50 states were able to perform tests, with a doctors approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs in a state, but the number of available test kits remained very limited, which means that the true number of people currently infected with the virus is impossible to estimate with any reasonable accuracy.  The CDC has suggested that doctors use their own judgment along with certain guidelines before authorizing a test. By March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded 1,000, which doubled every two days to reach more than 17,000 cases by March 20. \c\cThe CDC has advised against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the 26 European countries that comprise the Schengen Area. The United States is also denying entry to foreign nationals who have traveled through China, Iran, or the aforementioned European regions within the past 14 days. Americans returning home after traveling in these regions have been required to undergo a health screening and submit to a 14-day quarantine. \c\cResponses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings, including the closure of schools and other educational institutions, the cancellation of trade shows, conventions, music festivals, and the cancellation and suspension of sporting events and leagues—measures which intensified on March 11 after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic. The CDC warned that widespread transmission may force large numbers of people to seek hospitalization and other healthcare, which may overload healthcare systems, and the U.S. government has advised against any gathering of more than 10 people. As of March 22 the US has the second highest number of active cases in the world (26,382) only after Italy (42,681).

Thirteen cases have been repatriated from the Grand Princess cruise ship. Until March, all cases were linked to recent travel to a country with a substantial number of cases. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5,  and Torontos chief health officer announced on March 16 that there is "some evidence of community transmission". \c\cIn mid-March, all of Canadas provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Most provinces and territories have also implemented school and daycare closures, prohibitions on large gatherings, as well as the closure of various leisure and entertainment venues. On March 16, Canada severely restricted its border access, barring travellers from all countries except the United States; on March 18, travellers from the United States were also banned in a mutual agreement with the US government (with exceptions in place for family members, essential employees who commute across the border and to ensure continued exchange of goods). Travellers entering Canada have been advised to self-isolate for 14 days. This requirement is legally enforced in Saskatchewan, as well as in Newfoundland and Labrador for both international and domestic travellers. The weekend of March 21–22, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island announced screening at all ports of entry, including the bridge to PEI, and inbound travel was banned from the Northwest Territories. \c\cCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau tested positive for the virus on March 12 and she and Trudeau went into self-isolation.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Ontario is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in Canada during the 2019–20 worldwide pandemic occurred in the Canadian province of Ontario, and was confirmed on January 27, 2020, after a man returned to Toronto from travel in China, including Wuhan. As of March 23 at 10:30 a.m. ET, there have been 505 confirmed cases, 8 recoveries, and 6 deaths. Overall 28,506  people have been approved for testing, with 19,586 people (97.5 %) testing negative and 505 people (2.5 %) testing positive, the remaining people are still waiting on their test results due to a backlog in testing. \c\cOn March 17, the Government of Ontario declared a state of emergency, closing bars and restaurants (with the exception of take-out and delivery services), as well as libraries, theatres, cinemas, schools and daycares and all public gatherings of more than 50 people. Furthermore, the government announced on March 17 that Ontario had "some evidence of community transmission" of COVID-19.
The ongoing global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread to the United Kingdom in January 2020. Transmission within the UK was confirmed in February, leading to an epidemic with a rapid increase in cases in March. As of 23 March, after testing 83,945 people, there have been 6,650 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK, and 335 people with confirmed infection have died. \c\cOn 12 January the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was responsible for a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. The UK subsequently developed a prototype specific laboratory test for the new disease. The four UK Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January, upon the WHOs announcement of the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). After cases appeared in the UK on 31 January a public health information campaign was launched to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus. Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to introduce the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 statutory instrument. Guidance on infection prevention and control, how to detect and diagnose COVID-19, and daily updates, including advice to travellers, have been published by the UKs Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Public Health England (PHE). In addition, the NHS set up COVID-19 drive-through screening centres at some hospitals. The Chief Medical Adviser to the UK Government, Chris Whitty explained a four-pronged strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate. \c\cThe earliest documented transmission within the UK occurred on 28 February 2020; all of the cases detected previously had been infected abroad. By 1 March, cases had been detected in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Subsequently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled the Coronavirus Action Plan, and the government declared the outbreak a "level 4 incident". On 11 March, the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. Other responses included some schools in England choosing to close. Airlines announced a number of flight cancellations, and some online retailers reported consumers placing unusually large orders. On 12 March, the UK risk level was raised from moderate to high. Four days later, following the catastrophe in Italy, whose health system shares similar values and organisation as the NHS, and based on evidence including forecasting by epidemiologists at Imperial College London, the government advised on further measures on social distancing and advised people in the UK against "non-essential" travel and contact with others, as well as suggesting people should avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, and work from home if possible. Pregnant women, people over the age of 70, and those with certain health conditions were urged to consider the advice "particularly important", and were asked to self-isolate. On 18 March, it was announced that the UK will close schools to most students, with children of key workers and vulnerable children still able to attend. On 20 March, all restaurants, pubs, clubs and indoor sport and leisure facilities were ordered to close, though delivery and take-out chains were allowed to remain open. On 23 March, the government announced that these measures were to be tightened further, with wide-ranging restrictions made on freedom of movement, enforceable in law.

The 2019–20 Coronavirus Pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Saudi Arabia on March 2, 2020.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was first manifested by a cluster of mysterious, suspected pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to Huanan Seafood Market after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the National Health Commission (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia. The sequence of the virus was soon published on an open-access database. Measures taken by China were praised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and some foreign governments. Chinas response has been more transparent than how the country responded to SARS in 2003. \c\cHowever, delayed and controversial responses by the Wuhan and Hubei authorities failed to contain the outbreak in the early stage which led to criticism from the public and the media. By 29 January, the virus spread to all provinces of mainland China. By 8 February, over 724 died from the coronavirus infection-associated pneumonia and 34,878 were confirmed to have been infected. In Hubei alone, there were 24,953 cases of infections and 699 related deaths. All provinces of mainland China initiated the highest response level to public health emergency. WHO declared the outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern" on 31 January for fear that the virus spread beyond China to where there is no robust healthcare system despite its confidence that China was "doing all that it can". \c\cChinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping warned about a "grave situation" facing China. The Party Politburo formed a special leading group for epidemic control, led by Premier Li Keqiang. The Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled. Passengers across the country have been checked for their temperatures. Commands for epidemic control (CEC) have been formed in different regions including Wuhan and Hubei. Many inter-province bus services and railway services have been suspended. By January 29, all Hubei cities were quarantined. Curfew laws were implemented in Huanggang, Wenzhou, and other mainland cities. The region also sees a huge shortage of face masks and other protective gear despite itself being the worlds manufacturing hub for these products. \c\cOn 25 February, the number of newly confirmed cases outside mainland China exceeded those from within for the first time; the WHO praised the effectiveness of measures taken in the country. By 6 March the reported number of new cases had dropped to well fewer than 100 nationally per day, down from thousands per day at the height of the crisis. On 13 March, the number of newly imported cases passed the number of domestically transmitted new cases for the first time. \c\cWith the increasing reported cases of infections, fear upgraded along with regional discrimination in China and racial discrimination beyond China despite calls for stopping the discrimination by many governments. Some rumors circulated across Chinese social media, along with endorsements and counter-rumor efforts by media and governments. The government has worked to censor and counter reporting and criticism about the crisis, and to portray the official response to the outbreak in a positive light. \c\cOn 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that spread of domestically transmitted epidemic has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 24 March, more than 381,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 190 countries and territories, resulting in more than 16,500 deaths and more than 102,000 recoveries. \c\cThe virus is typically spread from one person to another via respiratory droplets produced during coughing. It primarily spreads when people are in close contact but may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface and then ones face. It is most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear. The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected. \c\cEfforts to prevent the virus spreading include travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, event postponements and cancellations, and facility closures. These include a quarantine of Hubei, nationwide quarantines in Italy and elsewhere in Europe, curfew measures elsewhere in China and South Korea, various border closures or incoming passenger restrictions, screening at airports and train stations, and travel advisories regarding regions with community transmission. Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in more than 124 countries, affecting more than 1.2 billion students. \c\cThe pandemic has led to global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, and cultural events, and widespread fears of supply shortages which have spurred panic buying. Misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus have spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and racism against American, Chinese and other East or Southeast Asian people.
This article documents the impacts of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in Vatican City and may not include all the contemporary major responses and measures. \c\cPope Francis tested negative after having a cold which was rumoured to be the coronavirus. \c\cPope Francis has cancelled his regular appearances in public to stop crowds gathering to see him and will stream them on the Internet because of the outbreak in Italy. \c\cDue to Vatican Citys small population of less than 1,000 people, the countrys 4 confirmed cases give it the second highest ratio of confirmed cases per capita (greater than 0.4%) – second only to San Marino (another microstate geographically inside Italy).
This article documents the impacts of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in Chile, and may not include all the contemporary major responses and measures. As of March 2020 there is a considerable Chile outbreak. While initial cases had been imported from South East Asia and Europe, there is now a sizeable quantity of untracable infections, placing the country within phase 4 of the pandemic as defined by the WHO. The potential for an increase of Coronavirus cases in Chile is vast, especially given the continuing mass protests.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in La Gomera, Canary Islands. \c\cOn 24 February, following a COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, Spain confirmed multiple cases related to the Italian clusters, originating from a medical doctor from Lombardy, Italy, who was on holiday in Tenerife. Afterwards, multiple COVID-19 cases were detected in Tenerife involving people who had come in contact with the doctor. Other cases involving individuals who visited Italy were also discovered in mainland Spain. \c\cAs of 24 March 2020, there have been 39,673 confirmed cases with 3,794 recoveries and 2,696 deaths in Spain according to authorities. At least 2,636 people hospitalised are in intensive care (1,050 in the Community of Madrid) and more than 350,000 tests for COVID-19 have been conducted. Since 13 March 2020, there have been registered cases in the 50 provinces of the country. Only on the islands of La Graciosa (Canary Islands) and Formentera (Balearic Islands) has there been no registered positive cases.
The first case of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in New Zealand was reported on 28 February 2020. A total of 142 cases have been confirmed as of 24 March 2020, along with 13 probable cases. Cases have occurred in the Auckland, Wellington, Waikato, Northland, Taranaki, Bay of Plenty, Manawatū-Whanganui, and Hawkes Bay regions of the North Island, and the Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Marlborough, Tasman, and Southland regions of the South Island.

Two consecutive terrorist shooting attacks occurred at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday Prayer on 15 March 2019. The attacks began at the Al Noor Mosque in the suburb of Riccarton at 1:40 p.m. and continued at Linwood Islamic Centre at about 1:55 p.m. The gunman live-streamed the first attack on Facebook. \c\cThe attacks killed 51 people and injured 49. Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old man from Grafton, New South Wales, Australia, described in media reports as a white supremacist and part of the alt-right, was arrested and initially charged with one murder. Tarrant was later charged with 51 murders, 40 attempted murders, and engaging in a terrorist act; he pleaded not guilty to all charges, with the trial expected to start on 2 June 2020. \c\cThe attacks have been linked to an increase in white supremacism and alt-right extremism globally observed since about 2015. Politicians and world leaders condemned the attacks, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described it as "one of New Zealands darkest days". The government established a royal commission of inquiry into its security agencies in the wake of the attacks, which are the deadliest mass shootings in modern New Zealand history.

The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 27 March, more than 552,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 190 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 25,000 deaths and more than 128,000 recoveries. \c\cThe virus is mainly spread during close contact and via respiratory droplets produced when people cough or sneeze. Respiratory droplets may be produced during breathing but the virus is not considered airborne. People may also catch COVID-19 by touching a contaminated surface and then their faces. It is most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear. The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically around five days, but may range from 2 to 14 days. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, as the virus is killed by soap, which bursts its protective bubble. Other recommendations include covering ones mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected. \c\cEfforts to prevent the virus spreading include travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, event postponements and cancellations, and facility closures. These include the first (arguably successful) quarantine of Hubei, national or regional quarantines elsewhere in the world, curfew measures in China and South Korea, various border closures or incoming passenger restrictions, screening at airports and train stations, and outgoing passenger travel bans. Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in more than 124 countries, affecting more than 1.2 billion students. \c\cThe pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, and cultural events, and widespread fears of supply shortages which have spurred panic buying. Misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus have spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and racism against Chinese and other East and Southeast Asian people.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Michigan is part of the ongoing global viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which first appeared in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10. As of March 28, at least 4,650 cases and 111 deaths have been confirmed. Currently, 57 of Michigans 83 counties have been impacted, located within both the Lower and Upper peninsulas. A majority of the cases are in Metro Detroit, specifically Oakland, Macomb, and Wayne counties, which all have over 400 cases each, the latter of which accounts for nearly half the total number of cases and deaths in the state, while Genesee and Washtenaw counties both have over 100 cases. Forty seven of the cases are under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Corrections, while 15 are residents from out of state seeking treatment in Michigan. \c\cThe national coronavirus outbreak triggered a state of emergency response at the state level on March 10, followed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing the closure of all K–12 school buildings until April 5. On March 16, Governor Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, entertainment venues, and other businesses to partially close for two weeks and later banned events and gatherings of more than 50 from March 17 – April 5. She has also issued a pair of executive orders to prevent price gouging, one to halt tenant evictions, one to help curb the spread of the virus in medical facilities throughout the state, as well as one closing "non-essential personal care service" facilities such as nail and hair salons. On March 24, a statewide stay-at-home order was issued, limiting all non-essential travel and discontinuing all non-essential business services and operations. President Donald Trump approved Governor Whitmers disaster declaration on March 28, a week after it was requested. \c\cAdditionally, major colleges and universities within the state switched instruction to alternate remote learning formats and canceled large social events and gatherings. The outbreak also caused many corporations and businesses to alter capacity and operations in order to adapt to the progression of cases, and many major collegiate and professional sports seasons were postponed or canceled. \c\cThe state legislature approved $125 million to aid in relief efforts, and Governor Whitmer called in the Michigan Army National Guard to assist with supply distribution, which subsequently fueled rumors of a potential shift to martial law within the state. Whitmer later dismissed this as false. \c\cNotable transmission clusters have been identified at singer Sandi Pattys March 8 concert at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, which has so far been linked to three subsequent cases in Berrien County, and within the Detroit Police Department, where nine members have tested positive for the virus, two have died, and a further 280 have been placed under quarantine. Additionally, six other Detroit city employees have tested positive for the virus, as have 18 Wayne County Sheriffs Office employees, with one death reported within the department.
The ongoing global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread to the United Kingdom in January 2020. Transmission within the UK was confirmed in February, leading to an epidemic with a rapid increase in cases in March. As of 27 March, there have been 14,579 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK, and 759 people with confirmed infection have died. \c\cOn 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus had caused a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. The UK subsequently developed a prototype specific laboratory test for the new disease. The four UK Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January, upon the WHOs announcement of the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). After cases appeared in the UK on 31 January a public health information campaign was launched to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus. Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to introduce the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 statutory instrument. Guidance on infection prevention and control, how to detect and diagnose COVID-19, and daily updates, including advice to travellers, have been published by the UKs Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Public Health England (PHE). In addition, the NHS set up COVID-19 drive-through screening centres at some hospitals. The Chief Medical Adviser to the UK Government, Chris Whitty explained a four-pronged strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate. \c\cThe earliest documented transmission within the UK appeared on 28 February 2020; all of the cases detected previously had been infected abroad. By 1 March, cases had been detected in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Subsequently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled the Coronavirus Action Plan, and the government declared the outbreak a "level 4 incident". On 11 March, the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. Other responses included some schools in England choosing to close. Airlines announced a number of flight cancellations, and some online retailers reported consumers placing unusually large orders. On 12 March, the UK risk level was raised from moderate to high. Four days later, following the outbreak in Italy, whose health system shares similar values and organisation to the NHS, and based on evidence including forecasting by epidemiologists at Imperial College London, the government advised on further measures on social distancing and advised people in the UK against "non-essential" travel and contact with others, as well as suggesting people should avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, and work from home if possible. Pregnant women, people over the age of 70, and those with certain health conditions were urged to consider the advice "particularly important", and were asked to self-isolate. \c\cOn 18 March, it was announced that the UK would close schools to most pupils, with children of key workers and vulnerable children still able to attend. On 20 March, all restaurants, pubs, clubs and indoor sport and leisure facilities were ordered to close, though delivery and take-out chains were allowed to remain open. On 23 March, the government announced that these measures were to be tightened further, with wide-ranging restrictions made on freedom of movement, enforceable in law,. \c\cresulting in the Coronavirus Act 2020, the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 and other similar statutory instruments covering other home nations.

The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Belgium on 4 February 2020, when its first COVID-19 case was confirmed in Brussels. The pandemic only started on 1 March, when many skiers who had spent the school holiday around carnival in the North of Italy were allowed to return to work or school. All the latest confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries on the coronavirus outbreak in Belgium can be found on the website of Sciensano. \c\cEfforts to address the coronavirus outbreak in Belgium have to be managed by the nine federal and regional health ministers, Maggie De Block (Open VLD, federal government), Wouter Beke (CD&V, Flemish Community), Christine Morreale  (PS, French Community), Antonios Antoniadis  (SP, German-speaking Community), Bénédicte Linard  (Ecolo, French Community), Valérie Glatigny  (MR, French Community), Alain Maron  (Ecolo, Brussels), Elke Van den Brandt  (Groen, Brussels) and Barbara Trachte  (Ecolo, Brussels). with the support of:. \c\cSciensano, the national public health institute of Belgium,. \c\cother agencies such as the Agency for Care and Health in Flanders and the Agence wallonne pour une vie de qualité (AViQ) in Wallonia and the Common Community Commission in Brussels. \c\cthe Risk Assessment Group (RAG) presided by Sciensano. \c\cthe Risk Management Group (RMG) lead by Paul Pardon MD. \c\ca Coronavirus Scientific Committee (Steven Van Gucht, Marc Van Ranst, Nathalie Bossuyt, Erika Vlieghe and Charlotte Martin). \c\cthe National Crisis Centre (NCCN) lead by Bart Raeymaekers. \c\cUnlike most neighbouring countries (the Netherlands, France, Germany and the UK), the Belgian authorities were initially not willing to provide information or statistics on where the cases are located, beyond statistics for each region: Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia. Sciensano started to publish statistics per province from 18 March onwards and per municipality from 26 March onwards.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic began in Asia in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has spread widely through the continent. \c\cAs of 22 March 2020, at least one case of COVID-19 has been reported in every country in Asia except Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, while North Korea and Yemen have reported suspected cases. The epicenters of the pandemic in Asia are in China and Iran. \c\cSeveral Southeast Asian countries experienced a significant rise in cases following a Tabligh Akbar event from February 27 to March 1 at a mosque in Kuala Lumpur, where many people are believed to have been infected. The event had about 16,000 attendees, including about 1,500 from outside Malaysia. Attendees shared food, sat close together, and held hands at the event. According to guests, the leaders of the event didn't talk about COVID-19 precautions, but most attendees washed their hands during the event. Malaysian authorities were criticized for allowing the event to go forward. Corona virus has now killed more people in the US than the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks.
The first case of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in Israel was confirmed on 21 February 2020, after a female citizen tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 at the Sheba Medical Center after return from quarantine on the Diamond Princess ship in Japan. As a result, a 14-day home isolation rule was instituted for anyone who had visited South Korea or Japan, and a ban was placed on non-residents and non-citizens who were in South Korea for 14 days before their arrival. \c\cOn 11 March, Israel limited gatherings to 100 people. On 15 March, gatherings were limited to 10 people, with attendees advised to keep a distance of 2 m (6 ft 7 in) between one another. On 19 March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a national state of emergency, saying that existing restrictions would henceforth be legally enforceable, and violators would be fined. Israelis were not allowed to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary. Essential services—including food stores, pharmacies, and banks—would remain open. On 20 March, an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor in Jerusalem who suffered from previous illnesses was announced as the countrys first casualty. Restrictions on movement were further tightened on 25 March. \c\cMinister of Health Yaakov Litzman and his wife tested positive for the coronavirus on 2 April; Litzman is the first member of the cabinet to be infected. He is self-quarantining and working from home. Litzman had previously opposed restrictions on gatherings that would have affected Jewish religious services. Other top government leaders who had been in contact with Litzman—including Prime Minister Netanyahu, Director-General of the Ministry of Health Moshe Bar Siman Tov, Mossad Director Yossi Cohen, National Security Council Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat, head of Public Health Services Dr. Sigal Sadetsky, and head of Hadassah Medical Center Prof. Zev Rotstein—all went into self-isolation after his diagnosis was announced. \c\cThe pandemic comes amid the absence of an official government, as no ruling coalition has been formed following the 2020 Israeli legislative election, the third since the dissolution of the government in December 2018. Netanyahu continues to act as prime minister and has been accused of adopting additional powers in the effort to monitor and contain the spread of the virus.

As of mid-March 2020, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a more moderate impact in Taiwan than in many neighboring countries, with relatively few infections overall. The first case was announced on 21 January 2020. \c\cThe Taiwanese government integrated data from the national healthcare system, immigration, and customs authorities to aid in the identification and response to the virus. Government efforts are coordinated through the National Health Command Center (NHCC) of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, established to aid in disaster management for epidemics following the 2004 SARS outbreak. \c\cThe Journal of the American Medical Association states that Taiwan engaged in 124 discrete action items to prevent the spread of the disease, including early screening of flights from Mainland China and the tracking of individual cases. \c\cTaiwans handling of the outbreak has received international praise for its effectiveness in quarantining the people and by using the "electronic fence" to slow down the virus, despite being unable to gather WHO information due to being barred by China, and is seen as the model for other countries to learn from. As of 29 March, 29,915 tests had been conducted in Taiwan with the vast majority not confirming a coronavirus diagnosis. \c\cStarting 19 March foreign nationals were barred from entering Taiwan, with some exceptions, such as those carrying out the term of a business contract, holding valid Alien Resident Certificates, diplomatic credentials, or other official documentation and special permits.

The Mali War, Northern Mali Conflict or Mali Civil War is a series of armed conflicts that started from January 2012 between the northern and southern parts of Mali in Africa. On 16 January 2012, several insurgent groups began fighting a campaign against the Malian government for independence or greater autonomy for northern Mali, an area of northern Mali they called Azawad. The National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), an organization fighting to make this area of Mali an independent homeland for the Tuareg people, had taken control of the region by April 2012. \c\cOn 22 March 2012, President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted in a coup d'état over his handling of the crisis, a month before a presidential election was to have taken place. Mutinous soldiers, calling themselves the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDR), took control and suspended the constitution of Mali. As a consequence of the instability following the coup, Malis three largest northern cities—Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu—were overrun by the rebels on three consecutive days. On 5 April 2012, after the capture of Douentza, the MNLA said that it had accomplished its goals and called off its offensive. The following day, it proclaimed the independence of northern Mali from the rest of the country, renaming it Azawad. \c\cThe MNLA were initially backed by the Islamist group Ansar Dine. After the Malian military was driven from northern Mali, Ansar Dine and a number of smaller Islamist groups began imposing strict Sharia law. The MNLA and Islamists struggled to reconcile their conflicting visions for an intended new state. Afterwards, the MNLA began fighting against Ansar Dine and other Islamist groups, including Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA/MUJAO), a splinter group of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. By 17 July 2012, the MNLA had lost control of most of northern Malis cities to the Islamists. \c\cThe government of Mali asked for foreign military help to re-take the north. On 11 January 2013, the French military began operations against the Islamists. Forces from other African Union states were deployed shortly after. By 8 February, the Islamist-held territory had been re-taken by the Malian military, with help from the international coalition. Tuareg separatists have continued to fight the Islamists as well, although the MNLA has also been accused of carrying out attacks against the Malian military. \c\cA peace deal between the government and Tuareg rebels was signed on 18 June 2013, however on 26 September 2013 the rebels pulled out of the peace agreement and claimed that the government had not respected its commitments to the truce. Fighting is still ongoing even though French forces are scheduled for withdrawal.  A ceasefire agreement was signed on 19 February 2015 in Algiers, Algeria, but sporadic terrorist attacks still occur. \c\cDespite the signing of a peace accord in the capital on 15 April 2015, low-level fighting continues.
On 8 April 2020 at 10.25 am local time, a 260 metre long road bridge on the SS330 road near the town of Aulla  at Albiano Magra mid-way between Genoa and Florence collapsed into the River Magra. The traffic on the bridge was unusually light due to the coronavirus lockdown then in force, and the collapse resulted in only minor injuries to two casualties.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have reached Somalia in March 2020. There is great concern about the possibility of an outbreak in Somalia, due to the countrys lawlessness, lack of control by the central government as well as the lack of healthcare infrastructure.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Michigan is part of the ongoing global viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which first appeared in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10. As of April 8, at least 20,346 cases and 959 deaths have been confirmed. Currently, 72 of Michigans 83 counties have been impacted, located within both the Lower and Upper peninsulas. A majority of the cases are in Metro Detroit, especially  Detroit proper which accounts for over 5,400, with U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams warning that the city is quickly becoming a major hotspot. Oakland, Macomb, and Wayne counties all have over 2,000 cases each, the latter of which accounts for nearly half the total number of cases and deaths in the state. Minor hot spots include Washtenaw and Genesee counties, which both have over 500 cases, as well as Ingham, Livingston, and Kent counties, all of which have over 100 cases. One hundred eighty seven of the cases are inmates under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Corrections, while 74 are residents from out of state seeking treatment in Michigan. \c\cThe national coronavirus outbreak triggered a state of emergency response at the state level on March 10, followed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing the closure of all K–12 school buildings until April 5. Face-to-face instruction for all Michigan schools was later suspended for the remainder of the 2019–20 school year, with guidelines implemented to transition students to home learning formats. On March 16, Governor Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, entertainment venues, and other businesses to partially close for two weeks and later banned events and gatherings of more than 50 from March 17 – April 5. She has also issued a pair of executive orders to prevent price gouging, one to halt tenant evictions, one to help curb the spread of the virus in medical facilities throughout the state, as well as one closing "non-essential personal care service" facilities such as nail and hair salons. On March 24, a statewide stay-at-home order was issued, limiting all non-essential travel and discontinuing all non-essential business services and operations. President Donald Trump approved Governor Whitmers disaster declaration on March 28, a week after it was requested. On April 1, the city of Flint was placed under a mandatory curfew for the month of April, taking place daily from 9pm to 6am. \c\cAdditionally, major colleges and universities within the state switched instruction to alternate remote learning formats and canceled large social events and gatherings. The outbreak also caused many corporations and businesses to alter capacity and operations in order to adapt to the progression of cases, and many major collegiate and professional sports seasons were postponed or canceled. \c\cThe state legislature approved $125 million to aid in relief efforts, and Governor Whitmer called in the Michigan Army National Guard to assist with supply distribution, which subsequently fueled rumors of a potential shift to martial law within the state. Whitmer later dismissed this as false.  The state legislature allocated an additional $150 million for medical supplies on March 30. \c\cNotable transmission clusters have been identified at singer Sandi Pattys March 8 concert at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, which has so far been linked to three subsequent cases in Berrien County, and within the Detroit Police Department, where nine members have tested positive for the virus, two have died, and a further 280 have been placed under quarantine. Additionally, six other Detroit city employees have tested positive for the virus, as have 18 Wayne County Sheriffs Office employees, with one death reported within the department. Within the MDOC reporting cluster, 59 of the cases have been linked to Parnall Correctional Facility, with additional cases present in eight other MDOC prison facilities. Twenty five MDOC employees have also tested positive for the virus, with one employee death.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Harold was an extremely powerful tropical cyclone which caused widespread destruction in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga in early April 2020. Harold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since Cyclone Gita in 2018 and was also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect Vanuatu, behind Cyclone Pam in 2015. The seventh named storm of the 2019–20 Australian region cyclone season, eighth named storm, and fourth severe tropical cyclone of the 2019–20 South Pacific cyclone season, Harold is the most intense tropical cyclone thus far worldwide in 2020. \c\cOn April 1, 2020, a tropical low formed centered between the Solomon Islands and the eastern coast of Papua New Guinea. The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the Solomon Sea, developing tightly curved convective banding. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the Fiji Meteorological Services area of responsibility on April 2 and began to explosively intensify by April 3, reaching Category 4 status by April 4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on Espiritu Santo on April 6. Shortly afterwards, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson scale. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.
The 2019–20 South Pacific cyclone season is the period of the year when most tropical cyclones form within the South Pacific Ocean to the east of 160°E. The season officially runs from November 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, however a tropical cyclone could form at any time between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones will be  officially monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers in Brisbane, Australia and Wellington, New Zealand. The United States Armed Forces through the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) will also monitor the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. RSMC Nadi attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and TCWC Brisbane all use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale and estimate windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS).
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Michigan is part of the ongoing global viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which first appeared in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10. As of April 8, at least 20,346 cases and 959 deaths have been confirmed.  Michigan has the third most amount of cases in the U.S., after New York and New Jersey. Currently, 72 of Michigans 83 counties have been impacted, located within both the Lower and Upper peninsulas. A majority of the cases are in Metro Detroit, especially  Detroit proper which accounts for over 5,800, with U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams warning that the city is quickly becoming a major hotspot. Oakland, Macomb, and Wayne counties all have over 2,600 cases each, the latter of which accounts for nearly half the total number of cases and deaths in the state with more than 9,600. Minor hot spots include Washtenaw and Genesee counties, which both have over 600 cases, as well as Ingham, Livingston, and Kent counties, all of which have over 100 cases. One hundred eighty seven of the cases are inmates under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Corrections, while 74 are residents from out of state seeking treatment in Michigan. As of April 3, 56 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. \c\cThe national coronavirus outbreak triggered a state of emergency response at the state level on March 10, followed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing the closure of all K–12 school buildings until April 5. Face-to-face instruction for all Michigan schools was later suspended for the remainder of the 2019–20 school year, with guidelines implemented to transition students to home learning formats. On March 16, Governor Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, entertainment venues, and other businesses to partially close for two weeks and later banned events and gatherings of more than 50 from March 17 – April 5. She has also issued a pair of executive orders to prevent price gouging, one to halt tenant evictions, one to help curb the spread of the virus in medical facilities throughout the state, as well as one closing "non-essential personal care service" facilities such as nail and hair salons and one banning non-essential veterinary visits. On March 24, a statewide stay-at-home order was issued, limiting all non-essential travel and discontinuing all non-essential business services and operations. President Donald Trump approved Governor Whitmers disaster declaration on March 28, a week after it was requested. On April 1, the city of Flint was placed under a mandatory curfew for the month of April, taking place daily from 9pm to 6am. \c\cAdditionally, major colleges and universities within the state switched instruction to alternate remote learning formats and canceled large social events and gatherings. The outbreak also caused many corporations and businesses to alter capacity and operations in order to adapt to the progression of cases, and many major collegiate and professional sports seasons were postponed or canceled. \c\cThe state legislature approved $125 million to aid in relief efforts, and Governor Whitmer called in the Michigan Army National Guard to assist with supply distribution, which subsequently fueled rumors of a potential shift to martial law within the state. Whitmer later dismissed this as false.  The state legislature allocated an additional $150 million for medical supplies on March 30. \c\cNotable transmission clusters have been identified at singer Sandi Pattys March 8 concert at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, which has so far been linked to three subsequent cases in Berrien County, and within the Detroit Police Department, where nine members have tested positive for the virus, two have died, and a further 280 have been placed under quarantine. Additionally, six other Detroit city employees have tested positive for the virus, as have 18 Wayne County Sheriffs Office employees, with one death reported within the department. Within the MDOC reporting cluster, 59 of the cases have been linked to Parnall Correctional Facility, with additional cases present in eight other MDOC prison facilities. Twenty five MDOC employees have also tested positive for the virus, with one employee death.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Michigan is part of the ongoing global viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which first appeared in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10.

Parliamentary elections in Kiribati were originally planned on 7 April 2020, with a second round of voting to be held on 15 April 2020. However, in late March the Electoral Commission changed the voting date to 14 April 2020, with a second round on 21 April 2020.
A series of destructive tornadoes affected the Southeastern United States on Easter Sunday, April 12, 2020, and Monday, April 13. Several were responsible for prompting tornado emergencies, including the first one to be issued by the National Weather Service in Charleston. A large squall line formed and tracked through the Mid-Atlantic on April 13, prompting multiple tornado warnings and watches. With at least 30 fatalities reported, it was the deadliest tornado outbreak in the U.S. since April 2014.
The 2020 Chernobyl Exclusion Zone wildfires were a series of wildfires that began burning inside Ukraines Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in April 2020. The fires were largely extinguished within two weeks, at least one suspect was arrested for alleged arson.
The 2020 Chernobyl Exclusion Zone wildfires were a series of wildfires that began burning inside Ukraines Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in April 2020. \c\cA 27-year-old local resident was arrested for arson. It is unclear if the man, who has confessed to starting fires "for fun", is partly or fully responsible for the wildfires.
The first confirmed case of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 in Nigeria was announced on 27 February 2020, when an Italian citizen in Lagos tested positive for the virus, caused by SARS-CoV-2. On 9 March 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro, Ogun State, a Nigerian citizen who had contact with the Italian citizen.
The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread to the United Kingdom in early 2020. The first cases were identified in late January, transmission within the UK was confirmed in late February, and the number of cases increased rapidly in March. As of 15 April, there have been 98,476 confirmed cases in the UK and 12,868 people with confirmed infection have died; a rate of about 200 deaths per million citizens. More than 90% of those dying are elderly or have underlying illnesses. There are large regional variations in the pandemics severity. The capital, London, has the highest number and highest rate of infections. England and Wales are the countries with the highest recorded death rate per capita, while Northern Ireland has the lowest recorded death rate. Freedom of movement and assembly are restricted for the whole population, and most public venues are closed. \c\cOn 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus had caused a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, China. The UK subsequently developed a prototype specific laboratory test for the disease. The four UK Chief Medical Officers raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January, upon the WHOs announcement of the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). After confirmed cases appeared in the UK on 31 January a public health information campaign was launched to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus. Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to introduce the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020. Guidance on infection prevention and control, how to detect and diagnose COVID-19, and daily updates, including advice to travellers, have been published by the UKs Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Public Health England (PHE). In addition, the National Health Service (NHS) set up COVID-19 drive-through screening centres at some hospitals. The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, explained a four-pronged strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate. \c\cThe earliest documented transmission within the UK appeared on 28 February 2020; all of the cases detected previously are believed to have been infected abroad. By 1 March, cases had been detected in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Subsequently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled the Coronavirus Action Plan, and the government declared the outbreak a "level 4 incident". On 11 March, the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. Other responses included some schools in England choosing to close. Airlines announced flight cancellations, and some online retailers reported consumers placing unusually large orders. On 12 March, the UK risk level was raised from moderate to high. Four days later, following the outbreak in Italy, whose health system shares similar values and organisation to the NHS, and based on evidence including forecasting by epidemiologists at Imperial College London, the government advised further social distancing measures and advised against "non-essential" travel and contact with others, as well as suggesting people should avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, and work from home if possible. Pregnant women, people over the age of 70, and those with certain health conditions were asked to self-isolate. \c\cOn 18 March, it was announced that the UK would close all schools except for children of key workers and vulnerable children. On 20 March, all restaurants, pubs, clubs, and indoor sport and leisure facilities were ordered to close, though delivery and take-out chains were allowed to remain open. On 23 March, the government announced that to protect the NHS, these measures were to be tightened further, with wide-ranging restrictions made on freedom of movement, enforceable in law,. \c\cresulting in the Coronavirus Act 2020, the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 and other similar statutory instruments covering the other home nations. \c\cIn late March, Boris Johnson tested positive for the virus. On 5 April, he was hospitalised due to the disease and was moved to an intensive care unit the following day. He nominated his First Secretary of State, Dominic Raab, to deputise for him. Johnson left hospital on 12 April.

A spree killing comprised of shootings and arsons took place in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada, between April 18 and 19, 2020. A man, 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, killed at least thirteen people, including a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer, before another officer killed him following a car chase. It was the deadliest shooting in Canada in 30 years.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic has impacted religion in various ways, including the cancellation of the worship services of various faiths, the closure of Sunday Schools, as well as the cancellation of pilgrimages surrounding observances and festivals. Many churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples have offered worship through livestream amidst the pandemic. Relief wings of religious organisations have dispatched disinfection supplies, powered air-purifying respirators, face shields, gloves, coronavirus nucleic acid detection reagents, ventilators, patient monitors, syringe pumps, infusion pumps, and food to affected areas. Other churches have offered free COVID-19 testing to the public. Adherents of many religions have gathered together to pray for an end to the COVID-19 pandemic, for those affected by it, as well as for wisdom for physicians and scientists to combat the disease. In the United States, President Donald Trump designated 15 March 2020 as a National Day of Prayer for "Gods healing hand to be placed on the people of our Nation".
Cannabis in Lebanon is illegal for personal use, however its cultivation for medical use is legal. Large amounts of cannabis are grown within the country, specially in the Bekka Valley, and consumed for personal use in private. \c\cThe Parliament speaker stated, "The Lebanese Parliament is preparing to study and adopt the legislation necessary to legislate the cultivation of cannabis and its manufacture for medical uses in the manner of many European countries and some US states." This announcement comes after the release of a five-year study by McKinsey & Company to boost economic development. With the worlds third highest debt, proponents for legalization argue that fostering the marijuana industry could help to reform the countrys economy  Some growers that oppose the reform, such as Abu Jafaar of the Bekka Valley (Lebanons most well known growing area), fear that government intervention will take revenue away from them and into the hands of politicians. \c\cOn April 21st 2020, the Parliament passes law legalizing cannabis cultivation for medical use.
The Nova Scotia killings were a series of homicides that took place over a thirteen-hour period during April 18–19, 2020, in various locations throughout the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The perpetrator, Gabriel Wortman, shot and killed at least 22 people and set fire to at least five buildings before being killed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). It is the deadliest attack involving the use of firearms in Canadian history, surpassing the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre, during which 15 people were killed. The RCMP has not yet established a motive.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was reported to have spread to Indonesia on 2 March 2020, when a dance instructor and her mother were infected from a Japanese national. By 9 April, the pandemic had spread to all provinces in Indonesia after Gorontalo confirmed its first case, with Jakarta, West Java, and East Java being the worst-hit provinces. \c\cSo far, Indonesia has recorded 7,775 cases, the second highest in Southeast Asia, only below Singapore. With 647 deaths, its fatality rate is also one of the highest in the world. Researchers suggest the main reason for the high rate is probably a lack of testing, resulting in many cases going undetected.
On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting occurred at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, United States. A gunman shot and killed 23 people and injured 23 others. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a possible hate crime. The shooting has been described as the deadliest attack on Latinos in modern American history. \c\cPatrick Crusius, a 21-year-old from Allen, Texas, was arrested shortly after the shooting and charged with capital murder. Police believe a manifesto with white nationalist and anti-immigrant themes, posted on the online message board 8chan shortly before the attack, was written by Crusius; it cites the years earlier Christchurch mosque shootings and the right-wing conspiracy theory known as the Great Replacement as inspiration for the attack.
On the afternoon of 28 April 2020, a truck bombing occurred in Afrin, Aleppo Governorate, Syria. A bomb in a tank truck was detonated at an open air market in Souk Ali in the city centre. The attack killed at least 46 civilians, including 11 children and injured over 50 others. Turkey blame the Peoples Protection Units (YPG), which it says is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party.
The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread to the United States in January 2020. The first U.S. case was identified on January 20, in a man who had returned from Wuhan, China to Snohomish County, Washington on January 15. The first report of a U.S. death came on February 29. An earlier U.S. death, on February 6, was determined in late April, and is believed to be community transmission. By the end of March, cases had occurred in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and all inhabited U.S. territories except American Samoa. By April 11, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and inhabited territories except American Samoa. As of April 24, the U.S. death rate was 152 per million people, the tenth highest rate globally. And by 29 April, according to Johns Hopkins University at a minimum 58,356 people have died as a result of COVID-19, more than those Americans who had died during the Vietnam War. \c\cThe Trump administration declared a public health emergency on January 31, then on February 2 implemented a ban of most foreign nationals who had recently traveled to China. The initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, or testing for the virus. A lack of mass testing obscured the true extent of the outbreak. For much of February, manufacturing defects rendered many government-developed test kits unusable, commercial tests were disallowed by regulations, and strict testing requirements were in place. The U.S. tested fewer than 10,000 people by March 10. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump was optimistic, dismissing the threat posed by coronavirus and claiming the outbreak was under control. February 25 was the first time that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned the American public to prepare for a local outbreak. \c\cA national emergency was declared on March 13. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by early March began allowing public health agencies and private companies to develop and administer tests, and loosened requirements to allow anyone with a doctors order to be tested. By the end of the month, over 1 million people had been tested (1 per 320 inhabitants). The Trump administration largely waited until mid-March to start purchasing large quantities of medical equipment. In late March, the administration started to use the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. Federal health inspectors surveyed hospitals in late March, reporting shortages of test supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results. By April 20, the United States had processed more than four million tests (approximately 1 per 82 inhabitants). \c\cThe CDC warned that widespread disease transmission may force large numbers of people to seek healthcare, which could overload healthcare systems and lead to otherwise preventable deaths. On March 16, the White House advised against any gatherings of more than ten people. Since March 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of State has advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel. Travel restrictions on most foreign nationals who had recently traveled to Iran or 28 European countries were implemented in March. State and local responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including cultural events, exhibitions, and sporting events), restrictions on commerce and movement, and the closure of schools and other educational institutions. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among African-American populations, and there have been reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans.
The Sinai insurgency is an ongoing conflict in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, between Islamist militants and Egyptian security forces, which has included attacks on civilians. The insurgency began after the start of the Egyptian Crisis, which saw the overthrow of longtime Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian revolution of 2011. \c\cThe Sinai insurgency initially consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and proclaimed themselves Sinai Province, and a part of ISIL. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with the Sinai Province group and have blamed the porous border and ongoing civil war for the increase in sophisticated weapons available to the Islamist groups. \c\cThe Egyptian authorities have attempted to restore their presence in the Sinai through both political and military measures. Egypt launched two military operations, known as Operation Eagle in mid-2011 and then Operation Sinai in mid-2012. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup détat, which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred. \c\cThe fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share the same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services. Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. In November 2017, more than 300 Sufist worshippers were killed and over 100 injured in an attack on a mosque west of the city of Al-Arish.
The Ituri conflict (French: Guerre dIturi) was a major conflict between the agriculturalist Lendu and pastoralist Hema ethnic groups in the Ituri region of the north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). While the two groups had fought since as early as 1972, the name Ituri conflict refers to the period of intense violence between 1999 and 2003. Armed conflict continues to the present day. \c\cThe conflict was largely set off by the Second Congo War, which had led to increased ethnic consciousness, a large supply of small arms, and the formation of various armed groups. More long-term factors include land disputes, natural resources, and the existing ethnic tensions throughout the region. The Lendu ethnicity was largely represented by the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) while the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) claimed to be fighting for the Hema. \c\cThe conflict was extremely violent. Large-scale massacres were perpetrated by members of both ethnic factions. In 2006, the BBC reported that as many as 60,000 people had died in Ituri since 1998. Médecins Sans Frontières said "The ongoing conflict in Ituri, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has led to more than 50,000 deaths, more than 500,000 displaced civilians and continuing, unacceptably high, mortality since 1999." Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes, becoming refugees. \c\cIn June 2003, the European Union began Operation Artemis, sending a French-led peacekeeping force to Ituri. The EU force managed to take control of the regional capital of Bunia. Despite this, fighting and massacres continued in the countryside. In December 2003, the Hema-backed UPC split and fighting decreased significantly. \c\c"ong-dormant" land disputes between "Hema herders and Lendu farmers" were re-ignited in December 2017 resulting in a surge of massacres with entire Hema villages razed and over a hundred casualties. Tens of thousands fled to Uganda. While the massacres by Lendu militia ceased in mid-March 2018, "crop destruction, kidnappings, and killings" continued. The UN estimated that as many as 120 Hema villages were attacked by Lendu militia from December 2017 through August 2018.
The Visakhapatnam gas leak, also referred to as the Vizag gas leak, was an industrial accident that occurred at the LG Polymers chemical plant in R. R. Venkatapuram village (near Gopalapatnam) on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India on the early morning of 7 May 2020. The leaked gas spread over a radius of about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi), affecting the nearby areas and villages. As of 5pm (UTC) 8 May, the final death toll rose to 13, and more than 1,000 people were affected. \c\cAccording to preliminary reports, styrene gas is suspected as the cause.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Afghanistan when its index case, in Herat, was confirmed on 24 February 2020. \c\cAs of 9 May 2020, there have been 4,033 positive cases, with 502 recoveries and 115 deaths across all 34 provinces in the country. Kabul Province has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan at 979, followed by Herat with 835 cases, and then Kandahar with 481 cases.

The Insurgency in Cabo Delgado is an ongoing conflict in Cabo Delgado Province, Mozambique, mainly fought between Islamist militants attempting to establish an Islamic state in the region, and Mozambican security forces. Civilians have been the main targets of attacks by Islamist militants. The main insurgent faction is Ansar al-Sunna, a native extremist faction with tenuous international connections. From mid-2018, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has allegedly become active in northern Mozambique as well, and claimed its first attack against Mozambican security forces in June 2019. In addition, bandits have exploited the rebellion to carry out raids. \c\cAnsar al-Sunna (English: Supporters of the tradition) is similar to the name of an Iraqi Sunni insurgent group that fought against US troops between 2003 and 2007. Locals call them "al-Shabaab" but they are a separate organization from Somali al-Shabaab. The militants are known to speak Portuguese, the official language of Mozambique, Kimwane, the local language, and Swahili, the lingua franca language spoken in the Great Lakes region. Reports also state that members are mostly Mozambicans from Mocimboa da Praia, Palma and Macomia districts, but also include foreign nationals from Tanzania and Somalia.
The COVID-19 pandemic first appeared in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of May 15, 50,079 cases of COVID-19 have been reported by the state, causing 4,825 deaths. The state passed 50,000 cases on May 15. Michigan has the seventh highest number of cases in the United States, and the fourth most amount of deaths. Currently, 79 of Michigans 83 counties have been impacted, with 59 of them reporting deaths. On March 27, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams dubbed Metro Detroit, which has a large majority of the cases, a “hot spot”. As of May 8, 22,686 people in the state have recovered. With more than 10,000 cases, the city of Detroit has over 20% of the states cases. \c\cThe national coronavirus outbreak triggered a state of emergency response at the state level on March 10 (Executive Order 2020-04), followed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing the closure of all K–12 school buildings until April 5. Face-to-face instruction for all Michigan schools was later suspended for the remainder of the 2019–20 school year, with guidelines implemented to transition students to home learning formats. On March 16, Governor Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, entertainment venues, and other businesses to partially close for two weeks and later banned events and gatherings of more than 50 from March 17 – April 5. She has also issued a pair of executive orders to prevent price gouging, one to halt tenant evictions, one to help curb the spread of the virus in medical facilities throughout the state, as well as one closing "non-essential personal care service" facilities such as nail and hair salons and one banning non-essential veterinary visits. On March 24, a statewide stay-at-home order was issued, limiting all non-essential travel and discontinuing all non-essential business services and operations. It was originally set to expire on April 13, but was extended until April 30 with several new social distancing restrictions. The order was later extended to May 15, with some restrictions lifted and others added, such as mandatory face covering usage in public buildings and businesses. The order was later extended again until May 28 and added modifications of the restrictions from previous orders. The face mask requirement was a factor in the killing of a security guard at a Family Dollar store in Flint, after a woman refused to wear a mask and was denied entry, leading to the arrests of a family of four people, in which a 23-year-old man was charged with first degree murder. \c\cAdditionally, major colleges and universities within the state switched instruction to alternate remote learning formats and canceled large social events and gatherings. The outbreak also caused many corporations and businesses to alter capacity and operations in order to adapt to the progression of cases, and many major collegiate and professional sports seasons were postponed or canceled. \c\cThe state legislature approved $125 million to aid in relief efforts on March 17, and Governor Whitmer called in the Michigan Army National Guard to assist with supply distribution the next day, which subsequently fueled rumors of a potential shift to martial law within the state. Whitmer later dismissed this as false.  The state legislature allocated an additional $150 million for medical supplies and personal protective equipment for hospitals on March 30. Governor Whitmer requested a major disaster declaration on March 26, which President Donald Trump granted on March 28. On May 13, the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency reported 1.375 million people have received benefits since the state of emergency was declared two months prior.

On 12 May 2020, attacks were carried out on a hospitals maternity ward in Kabul and on a funeral in Kuz Kunar, Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of 56 people, including newborn babies, mothers, nurses, and mourners. \c\cThe Afghan government blamed the Taliban as the main perpetrators behind the attacks, and immediately ordered the military to resume its offensives against insurgent groups. The Taliban, however, denied responsibility. The U.S. government said that ISIL–KP conducted the 12 May attacks, not the Taliban, but this assertion was rejected by Afghan officials. \c\cThe Taliban announced that it would conduct revenge attacks against the Afghan government for blaming it for the 12 May attacks. On 14 May, a Taliban suicide truck bomber killed five civilians near a court in Gardez, Paktia Province, Afghanistan. On 18 May, a suicide Humvee bomber affiliated with the Taliban killed nine intelligence personnel at the National Directorate of Security (NDS) unit in Ghazni, Afghanistan, also damaging the citys Islamic affairs office. In another attack on 17 May, insurgents killed three civilians and two policemen as they were traveling in the Qayaq valley of Jaghatū District, Ghazni Province, and set their dead bodies on fire inside the car. \c\cLate on 18 May, a roadside IED planted by militants in Mezana District, Zabul Province killed four civilians. On 19 May, the Taliban killed one policeman and one civilian in a motorbike bomb in Kunduz, Afghanistan. On the same day, the Taliban attempted to capture Kunduz, attacking several government posts but were repelled by the Afghan security forces. The Taliban were forced to flee the city, leaving ten dead bodies behind. Eight Afghan soldiers and three civilians were killed during the Taliban attack. A clinic in the nearby Chardara District of Kunduz Province, where Taliban militants were also being treated, was partially damaged in an airstrike. Also on 19 May, gunmen attacked a mosque in Charikar, Parwan Province, killing nine worshipers when they were offering the evening prayer after breaking their Ramadan fast.

Piracy in the Gulf of Guinea  affects a number of countries in West Africa as well as the wider international community.  By 2011, it had become an issue of global concern.  Pirates in the Gulf of Guinea are often part of heavily armed criminal enterprises, who employ violent methods to steal oil cargo. In 2012, the International Maritime Bureau, Oceans Beyond Piracy and the Maritime Piracy Humanitarian Response Program reported that the number of vessels attacks by West African pirates had reached a world high, with 966 seafarers attacked during the year. According to the Control Risks Group, pirate attacks in the Gulf of Guinea had by mid-November 2013 maintained a steady level of around 100 attempted hijackings in the year, a close second behind Southeast Asia. \c\cPiracy in the Gulf of Guinea continues to be a concern to the shipping industry, which is affected significantly. At the same time, governments in the region generally highlight that the fight against piracy requires a broad understanding of maritime security throughout the Gulf of Guinea.
The Kyoto Animation arson attack (Japanese: 京都アニメーション放火殺人事件, Hepburn: Kyōto Animēshon hōka satsujin jiken) occurred at Kyoto Animations Studio 1 building in the Fushimi ward of Kyoto, Japan, on the morning of 18 July 2019. The arson killed at least 36 people, injured an additional 33, and destroyed most of the materials and computers in Studio 1. It is one of the deadliest massacres in Japan since the end of World War II and the deadliest building fire in Japan since the 2001 Myojo 56 building fire. It was considered "suicidal terrorism" by one criminology professor at Rissho University, as the attack was reportedly intended to be a suicide mission by the suspect. \c\cShinji Aoba, the suspect who did not work for the studio, entered the front door and doused the area and several employees with gasoline before igniting it. After setting himself on fire while lighting the gasoline, the suspect attempted to flee but was apprehended by police about 100 metres (330 ft) from the building. Witnesses stated they heard him accusing the studio of plagiarism. The police arrested Aoba on suspicion of murder and other offenses on May 27, 2020, after awaiting his recovery from life-threatening burns for more than 10 months. \c\cIn addition to condolences and messages of support from world and national leaders, fans and businesses raised over ¥3.3 billion in Japan and over US$2.3 million outside of Japan to help the studio and its employees recover. As a result of the incident, some works and collaborations by the studio were delayed, and several events were cancelled or suspended.

The Insurgency in the Maghreb refers to Islamist militant and terrorist activity in the Maghreb and Sahel regions of North Africa since 2002. The conflict succeeded the conclusion of the Algerian Civil War as the militant group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) allied itself with al-Qaeda to eventually become al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Algeria and other Maghreb states affected by the activity have been offered assistance in fighting extremist militants by the United States and the United Kingdom since 2007, when Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara began. \c\cThe Arab Spring in 2011 presented an opportunity for militant Islamists to put increasing pressure on governments and engage in full-scale warfare. In 2012, AQIM and Islamist allies captured the northern half of Mali, until being fought back less than a year later following a French-led foreign intervention, which was succeeded by the Sahel-wide Operation Barkhane. In Libya the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has been able to control some limited territory in the ongoing civil war since 2014, amid allegations of local collaboration between the otherwise rivalling AQIM and ISIL.

China–India relations, also called Sino–Indo relations or Indian–Chinese relations, refers to the bilateral relationship between China and India. Although the relationship has been cordial, there have been border disputes. The modern relationship began in 1950 when India was among the first countries to end formal ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan) and recognize the Peoples Republic of China as the legitimate government of Mainland China. China and India are the two most populous countries and fastest growing major economies in the world. Growth in diplomatic and economic influence has increased the significance of their bilateral relationship. \c\cCultural and economic relations between China and India date back to ancient times. The Silk Road not only served as a major trade route between India and China, but is also credited for facilitating the spread of Buddhism from India to East Asia. During the 19th century, Chinas growing opium trade with the British East India Company triggered the First and Second Opium Wars. During World War II, British-occupied India and China both played a crucial role in halting the progress of Imperial Japan. \c\cRelations between contemporary China and India have been characterised by border disputes, resulting in three military conflicts – the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the Chola incident in 1967, and the 1987 Sino-Indian skirmish. In early 2017, the two countries clashed at the Doklam plateau along the disputed Sino-Bhutanese border. However, since the late 1980s, both countries have successfully rebuilt diplomatic and economic ties. In 2008, China became Indias largest trading partner and the two countries have also extended their strategic and military relations. Apart from trade and commerce, there are some other areas of mutual interest on which China and India have been cooperating of late. In the words of Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy, "Currently, the two countries are cooperating on a range of international like trade, climate change and reform of the global financial order, among others, to promote common interest". \c\cDespite growing economic and strategic ties, there are a lot of hurdles for India and the PRC to overcome. India faces trade imbalance heavily in favour of China. The two countries failed to resolve their border dispute and Indian media outlets have repeatedly reported Chinese military incursions into Indian territory. Both countries have steadily established military infrastructure along border areas. Additionally, India remains wary about Chinas strong strategic bilateral relations with Pakistan, while China has expressed concerns about Indian military and economic activities in the disputed South China Sea. \c\cIn June 2012, China stated its position that "Sino-Indian ties" could be the most "important bilateral partnership of the century". That month Wen Jiabao, the Premier of China and Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India set a goal to increase bilateral trade between the two countries to US$100 billion by 2015. \c\cBilateral trade between China and India touched US$89.6 billion in 2017–18, with the trade deficit widening to US$62.9 billion in Chinas favour. In 2017, the volume of bilateral trade between India & China stands at US$84.5 billion. This figure excludes bilateral trade between India & Hong Kong which stands at another US$34 billion. \c\cAccording to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, 23% of Indians view China positively, with 47% expressing a negative view, whereas 27% of Chinese people view India positively, with 35% expressing a negative view. A 2014 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed 72% of Indians were concerned that territorial disputes between China and neighbouring countries could lead to a military conflict. \c\cThe CCP General Secretary and President of China, Xi Jinping, was one of the top world leaders to visit New Delhi after Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister of India in 2014. Indias insistence to raise South China Sea in various multilateral forums subsequently did not help that beginning once again, the relationship facing suspicion from Indian administration and media alike. In 2020, the 70th anniversary of India-China diplomatic ties, 70 events will be held in celebration by the two countries. Various other activities are also planned.

The city of Detroit has a majority of the states cases (20% of the total cases and 25% of the deaths). African Americans make up 31% of the states total cases and 40% of deaths. \c\cThe national coronavirus outbreak triggered a state of emergency response at the state level on March 10 followed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing the closure of all K–12 school buildings until April 5. Face-to-face instruction for all Michigan schools was later suspended for the remainder of the 2019–20 school year, with guidelines implemented to transition students to home learning formats. On March 16, Governor Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, entertainment venues, and other businesses to partially close for two weeks and later banned events and gatherings of more than 50 from March 17 – April 5. On March 24, a statewide stay-at-home order was issued, limiting all non-essential travel and discontinuing all non-essential business services and operations.

The order was later extended to May 15, with some restrictions lifted and others added, such as mandatory face covering usage in public buildings and businesses. The order was later extended again until May 28 and added modifications of the restrictions from previous orders. The face mask requirement was a factor in the killing of a security guard at a Family Dollar store in Flint, after a woman refused to wear a mask and was denied entry, leading to the arrests of a family of four people, in which a 23-year-old man was charged with first degree murder.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Israel are the most developed in the Middle East, and among the most tolerant in Asia. Although same-sex sexual activity was legalized in 1988, the former law against sodomy had not been enforced since a court decision in 1963. Israel became the first country in Asia to recognize unregistered cohabitation between same-sex couples, making it the first country in Asia to recognize same-sex unions in any capacity. Although same-sex marriages are not performed in the country, Israel recognizes same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. Discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation was prohibited in 1992. Same-sex couples are allowed to jointly adopt, following a landmark court decision in 2008. Previously, stepchild adoption as well as limited co-guardianship rights for non-biological parents were permitted. LGBT people are also allowed to serve openly in the military. \c\cTel Aviv has frequently been referred to by publishers as one of the most gay-friendly cities in the world, famous for its annual Pride parade and gay beach, earning it the nickname "the gay capital of the Middle East" by Out magazine. According to LGBT travelers, it was ranked as the best gay city in 2011, despite reports of some anti-LGBT violence during the 2000s, which were criticized by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres. A monument dedicated to the gay victims of the Holocaust was erected in Tel Aviv in 2014. Opinion polls have found that a majority of Israelis support the legalization of same-sex marriage, as well as adoption and surrogacy rights for same-sex couples. This year, during International Pride Mounth on June 21, 2020, Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality announced that same-sex couples will have exactly the same rights than opposite-sex marriages inside the city.

The 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal or 1MDB scandal is an ongoing political scandal occurring in Malaysia. In 2015, Malaysias then-Prime Minister Najib Razak was accused of channelling over RM 2.67 billion (≈ US$700 million) from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a government-run strategic development company, to his personal bank accounts. The event triggered widespread criticism among Malaysians, with many calling for Najib Razaks resignation – including Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, one of Najibs predecessors as Prime Minister, who eventually defeated Najib to return to power after the 2018 general election. \c\cPolitical leader Anwar Ibrahim has openly questioned the credentials of 1MDB. He told Parliament that according to the records held by the companies commission, the company "has no business address and no appointed auditor." According to its publicly filed accounts, 1MDB has nearly RM 42 billion (US$11.73 billion) in debt. Some of this debt resulted from a $3 billion state-guaranteed 2013 bond issue led by Goldman Sachs, who is believed to have made as much as $300 million in fees from that deal alone, although it disputes this figure. Conference of Rulers in Malaysia has called for the investigations by the government to be completed as soon as possible, saying that the issue is causing a crisis of confidence in Malaysia. \c\cAfter the 2018 election, the newly elected Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, said there was enough evidence to reopen a probe into the 1MDB scandal. In the months after the election, Malaysian authorities barred Najib Razak from leaving the country, seized a huge haul of cash and valuable items from premises linked to him, and charged him with criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power, while Jho Low was charged with money laundering. Having filed complaints alleging that more than US$4.5 billion was diverted from 1MDB by Jho Low and other conspirators including officials from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the U.S. Department of Justice said it would continue to pursue investigations into 1MDB and looked forward to working with Malaysian authorities. \c\cThe whistle-blower was the Swiss banker and former director of PetroSaudi, Xavier Justo.

On August 9, 2014, Michael Brown Jr., an 18-year-old black man, was fatally shot by 28-year-old white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the city of Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.  Brown was accompanied by his 22-year-old friend Dorian Johnson. Wilson said that an altercation ensued when Brown attacked Wilson in his police vehicle for control of Wilsons gun until it was fired. Johnson claimed that Wilson initiated a confrontation by grabbing Brown by the neck through his car window, threatening him and then shooting at him. At this point, both Wilson and Johnson state that Brown and Johnson fled, with Wilson pursuing Brown shortly thereafter. Wilson stated that Brown stopped and charged him after a short pursuit. Johnson contradicted this account, stating that Brown turned around with his hands raised after Wilson shot at his back.  According to Johnson, Wilson then shot Brown multiple times until Brown fell to the ground. In the entire altercation, Wilson fired a total of twelve bullets, including twice during the struggle in the car; the last was probably the fatal shot. Brown was struck six times, all in the front of his body. \c\cThis event ignited unrest in Ferguson. A subsequent FBI investigation found that there was no evidence that Brown had his hands up in surrender or said "dont shoot" before he was shot. However, protesters claimed that he had done so, and later used the slogan "Hands up, dont shoot". Protests, both peaceful and violent, continued for more than a week in Ferguson; police later establishing a nightly curfew. \c\cThe response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests was strongly criticized by both the media and politicians. Concerns were raised over insensitivity, tactics, and a militarized response. Missouri governor Jay Nixon ordered local police organizations to cede much of their authority to the Missouri State Highway Patrol. \c\cA grand jury was called and given extensive evidence from Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County Prosecutor. On November 24, 2014, McCulloch announced the St. Louis County grand jury had decided not to indict Wilson. In March 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice reported the conclusion of its own investigation and cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. It found forensic evidence supported Wilsons account, and that witnesses who corroborated the officers account were credible. Witnesses who had incriminated him were found to be not credible, with some admitting they had not directly seen the events. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Wilson shot Brown in self-defense.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Iran is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 19 February 2020, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of infections in Qom. The virus may have been brought to the country by a merchant from Qom who had travelled to China. \c\cIn response to the coronavirus the government cancelled public events and Friday prayers; closed schools, universities, shopping centres, bazaars, and holy shrines; and banned festival celebrations. Economic measures were also announced to help families and businesses, and the pandemic is credited with compelling the government to make an unprecedented request for an emergency loan of five billion US dollars from the International Monetary Fund.  The government initially rejected plans to quarantine entire cities and areas, and heavy traffic between cities continued ahead of Nowruz, despite the governments intention to limit travel. The government later announced a ban on travel between cities following an increase in the number of new cases. Government restrictions were gradually eased starting in April. The number of new cases fell to a low on 2 May, but increased again in May as restrictions were eased, with a new peak of cases reported on 4 June, and new peaks in the number of deaths reported in July. \c\cSome early outside estimates of the numbers of COVID-19 deaths are much higher than those from government sources, while the Peoples Mujahedin of Iran has consistently claimed a high death toll, which reached over 73,000 deaths in July when the official figure was around 14,000. The government has also been accused of cover-ups, censorship, and mismanagement. However, the World Health Organization says that it has not seen problems with Irans reported figures, although a WHO official later said that due to limited testing in the early months, the number of cases reported in Iran may represent only about 20% of the real number until more tests could be conducted.  Later increase in the number of cases in May was attributed to increased testing by the Iranian government.  The official number of cases surpassed 200,000 with over 10,000 deaths recorded by June 2020. President Rouhani, however, estimated that 25 million may have become infected by July 2020, considerably higher than the official count. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran account for around a quarter of all cases in the MENA region by mid-July. \c\cMultiple government ministers and senior officials have been diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 positive, as well as 23 members of the Parliament (around 8% of all MPs) by 3 March. At least 17 Iranian politicians and officials had died from the virus by 25 March. Notable Iranians reported to have died from COVID-19 include Hadi Khosroshahi, Mohammad Mirmohammadi, Hossein Sheikholeslam, Fatemeh Rahbar, Reza Mohammadi Langroudi, Mohammad-Reza Rahchamani, Nasser Shabani, Hashem Bathaie Golpayegani, and Hamid Kahram.
Parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka are currently held on 5 August 2020. \c\cIn November 2018, the date was briefly moved forward by more than a year to 5 January 2019 due to President Maithripala Sirisena dissolving parliament during a constitutional crisis and calling for a snap election. The Supreme Court later suspended the dissolution and ordered a halt to the snap election, effectively moving the elections date back to 2020. \c\cOn 19 March, Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya revealed that the election would be postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sri Lankan government initially insisted that scheduled forthcoming the election would proceed as planned on 25 April despite the COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka, and the authorities banned election rallies and meetings. During the video conference with SAARC leaders, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa initially confirmed that the parliamentary elections would be held as scheduled. Even the presidents comments holding the elections as scheduled, the elections commission in Sri lanka put off the date to 20 June 2020, using its powers. Thus making a crisis between the presidents office and the constitutions and the matter went to the courts. \c\cOn 10 June 2020, Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya confirmed that the postponed parliamentary elections would be held on 5 August 2020 with strict health measures and guidelines. Initial exit poll reports and opinions stated that Mahinda Rajapaksa led SLPP is more likely and favourites to emerge victorious in the elections mainly owing to the predominant success in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic and due to the negative publicity about the UNP led government which was accused of a major intelligence failure which was triggered aftermath the 2019 Easter attacks. \c\cAccording to the sources, vote turnout initially had a slow start mainly due to the virus fears and despite the slow start, the voting numbers started to pick up gradually in late morning. This was the first time that a general election was held in Sri Lanka amid an outbreak of a disease and voters were recommended by the Election Commission to bring either a blue or black ballpoint pen from their homes in order to make the proceedings easier along with precautionary distancing guidelines. \c\cDuring the election day, the Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya also casted his vote by visiting to the polling station rather than opting for a postal vote. This also marked his first voting appearance in a polling station after nine years.

Interstate relations between the United States and Belarus began in 1991 upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, of which Belarus had been a part.  However, the relations have turned sour due to accusations by the United States that Belarus has been violating human rights.

The COVID-19 recession, also known as the Coronavirus recession, the  Great Shutdown, the Great Lockdown, or the Coronavirus crash is a major global recession which arose as an economic consequence of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first major sign of the recession was the 2020 stock market crash on 20 February, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported on 14 April that all of the G7 nations had already entered or were entering into a "deep recession" and that there had already been a significant slowdown of growth in emerging economies. IMF projections suggest that this recession will be the most severe global economic downturn since the Great Depression, and that it will be "far worse" than the Great Recession of 2008-2009. \c\cThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than a third of the worlds population being placed on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19. It has caused severe repercussions for economies across the world, following soon after a global economic slowdown during 2019 that saw stagnation of stock markets and consumer activity worldwide. \c\cThis recession has seen unusually high and rapid increases in unemployment in many countries, and the inability in the United States for state-funded unemployment insurance computer systems and processes to keep up with applications. The United Nations (UN) predicted in April 2020 that global unemployment will wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020—equivalent to 195 million full-time workers. In some countries, unemployment is expected to be at around 10%, with more severely affected nations from the COVID-19 pandemic having higher unemployment rates. The developing world is also being affected by a drop in remittances, exacerbating the global food crisis. \c\cThe recession saw a drop in the price of oil triggered by the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, the collapse of tourism, the hospitality industry, the energy industry and a significant downturn in consumer activity in comparison to the previous decade. Global stock markets crashed around 20 to 30% during late February and March 2020, respectively. During the crash, global stock markets made unprecedented and volatile swings, mainly due to extreme uncertainty in the markets.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced the election date as Thursday 17th October 2020. \c\cVoters will elect 120 members to the House of Representatives under New Zealands mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system, a proportional representation system in which 72 members are elected from single-member electorates and 48 members are elected from closed party lists. As of 31 July 2020, around 3.28 million people are registered to vote in the election out of an estimated eligible population of 3.77 million. \c\cAfter the previous election, the centre-left Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, formed a minority coalition government with the New Zealand First party, with confidence and supply from the Green Party. The main opponent to the Labour–NZ First government is the centre-right National Party, led by Judith Collins. The ACT Party is the sole other party in Parliament, represented by a single MP. It will be the second general election (the first being 1999) where both major parties have female leaders. \c\cA referendum on personal cannabis consumption is planned to be held at the same time, along with a referendum on euthanasia due to the End of Life Choice Bill passing its third reading in parliament.
The COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in New Zealand was reported on 28 February 2020. As of 16 August 2020, the country has had a total of 1,622 cases (1,271 confirmed and 351 probable) and 22 people have died from the virus, with cases recorded in all twenty district health board (DHB) areas. The pandemic peaked in early April, with 89 new cases recorded per day and 929 active cases. As of 16 August 2020, the country has 69 active cases, the majority from an active cluster in Auckland. \c\cAll borders and entry ports of New Zealand were closed to all non-residents at 11:59 pm on 19 March 2020, with returning citizens and residents being required to self-isolate. Since 10 April, all New Zealanders returning from overseas must go into two weeks of managed isolation. \c\cA four-level alert level system was introduced on 21 March to manage the outbreak within New Zealand. The Alert Level was initially set at Level 2, but was subsequently raised to Level 3 on the afternoon of 23 March. Beginning at 11:59 pm on 25 March, the Alert Level was moved to Level 4, putting the country into a nationwide lockdown. The Alert Level was moved back down to Level 3 at 11:59 pm on 27 April, partially lifting some lockdown restrictions, and down to Level 2 at 11:59 pm on 13 May, lifting the rest of the lockdown restrictions while maintaining physical distancing and gathering size limits. The country moved down to Level 1 at 11:59 pm on 8 June, removing all remaining restrictions except border controls. \c\cOn 11 August, four cases of COVID-19 from an unknown source were reported in Auckland, the first from an unknown source in 102 days. At noon the following day, the Auckland Region moved up to alert level 3, while the rest of the country was moved to level 2.
On 18 August 2020, elements of the Malian Armed Forces staged an ongoing mutiny. Soldiers on pick-up trucks stormed the Soundiata military base in the town of Kati, where gunfire was exchanged before weapons were distributed from the armory and senior officers arrested. Tanks and armoured vehicles were seen on the towns streets, as well as military trucks heading for the capital, Bamako. \c\cThe mutineers, allegedly led by Colonel Sadio Camara, reportedly arrested Minister of Finance Abdoulaye Daffe, the Chief of Staff of the National Guard, and Moussa Timbiné, speaker of the National Assembly. A mutiny leader later claimed that President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta and Prime Minister Boubou Cissé had been arrested at the formers residence in Bamako. As news of the mutiny spread, hundreds of protestors gathered at Bamakos Independence Monument to demand Keïtas resignation. Protestors also set a building belonging to the Ministry of Justice ablaze.
The ongoing 2020 Malian protests started on 5 June 2020 when protesters gathered in the streets of Bamako, Mali, calling for Ibrahim Boubacar Keita to resign as president of Mali.
On 14 February 2005, former Prime Minister of Lebanon Rafic Hariri was killed along with 21 others in an explosion in Beirut, Lebanon. Explosives equivalent to around 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) of TNT were detonated as his motorcade drove near the St. George Hotel. Among the dead were several of Hariris bodyguards and former Minister of the Economy, Bassel Fleihan. \c\cHariri had been part of the anti-Syrian opposition in Lebanon. His assassination triggered the Cedar Revolution, a popular movement which forced Syria to withdraw all its troops in Lebanon by April 2005. The killing also led the United Nations to set up the Special Tribunal for Lebanon to investigate the killing. The Special Tribunal, along with an independent investigation carried out by Lebanese brigadier general Wissam Al-Hassan, found compelling evidence for the responsibility of Lebanese group Hezbollah in the assassination.

The 2020 Northern Territory general election was held on 22 August 2020 to elect all 25 members of the Legislative Assembly in the unicameral Northern Territory Parliament. \c\cMembers were elected through full preferential instant-runoff voting in single-member electorates, after the optional preferential voting system introduced for the 2016 election was abolished by the Electoral Legislation Amendment Act 2019 in April 2019. The election was conducted by the Northern Territory Electoral Commission, an independent body answerable to Parliament. \c\cThe incumbent centre-left Labor Party (ALP) majority government, led by Chief Minister Michael Gunner, is attempting to win a second consecutive term of government. It is being challenged by the centre-right Country Liberal Party (CLP) opposition, led by Opposition Leader Lia Finocchiaro, and the centrist Territory Alliance (TA) party, led by former Chief Minister Terry Mills. \c\cABC election analyst Antony Green called the election for the Labor Party nearly three hours after the polls closed. On 24 August, Green called the seats of Arnhem and Fong Lim for Labor, giving them at least 13 seats and a majority in the parliament.
Austria–Russia relations (Russian: Российско-австрийские отношения or Австрийско-российские отношения, German: Österreichisch-russische Beziehungen) refers to the bilateral relationship between Austria and Russia and their predecessor states. Since October 1955, the Republic of Austria maintains the constitutionally-mandated status of neutrality; the country is a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OEEC). Austria joined the EU in 1995. Russia is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a partner of ASEAN, a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the G20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), as well as the leading member state of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU).  Both countries are members of the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the World Trade Organization (WTO).
On August 23, 2020, Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old black man, was shot from behind seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Protests occurred in response, as part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high-profile police killings in 2020, including those of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.
There have been a number of sanctions against Iran imposed by a number of countries, especially the United States, and international entities. The first sanctions were those imposed by the United States in November 1979 after a group of radical students seized the American Embassy in Tehran and took the people inside hostage. The sanctions by Executive Order 12170 included freezing about $12 billion in Iranian assets, including bank deposits, gold and other properties, and a trade embargo. These sanctions were lifted in January 1981 as part of the Algiers Accords, which was a negotiated settlement of the hostages’ release. \c\cThe second sanctions by the United States were imposed under Ronald Reagan in 1987 because of Irans actions from 1981 to 1987 against the U.S. and other shipping vessels in the Persian Gulf and support for terrorism. The sanctions were expanded in 1995 to include firms dealing with the Iranian government. \c\cThe third sanctions were imposed in December 2006 pursuant to UNSC Resolution 1737 after Iran refused to comply with UNSC Resolution 1696 which demanded that Iran halt its uranium enrichment program. Initially, U.S. sanctions targeted investments in oil, gas, and petrochemicals, exports of refined petroleum products, and business dealings with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). It encompassed banking and insurance transactions (including with the Central Bank of Iran), shipping, web-hosting services for commercial endeavors, and domain name registration services. Subsequent UN Resolutions have expanded sanctions against Iran. \c\cOver the years, sanctions have taken a serious toll on Irans economy and people. Since 1979, the United States has led international efforts to use sanctions to influence Irans policies, including Irans uranium enrichment program, which Western governments fear is intended for developing the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Iran counters that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, including generating electricity and medical purposes. \c\cWhen nuclear talks between Iran and Western governments were stalled and seen as a failure, US senators cited them as a reason to enforce stronger economic sanctions on Iran. On 2 April 2015, the P5+1 and Iran, meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, reached a provisional agreement on a framework that, once finalized and implemented, would lift most of the sanctions in exchange for limits on Irans nuclear programs extending for at least ten years. The final agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was adopted on 18 October 2015. As a result, UN sanctions were lifted on 16 January 2016. \c\cOn 8 May 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. Following the U.S. withdrawal, the EU enacted an updated blocking statute on 7 August 2018 to nullify US sanctions on countries trading with Iran. \c\cThe fourth sanctions by the United States came into effect in November 2018, and were intended to force Iran to dramatically alter its policies in the region, including its support for militant groups in the region and its development of ballistic missiles. In September 2019, a U.S. official stated that the United States will sanction whoever deals with Iran or purchases its oil. Also in September 2019, in response to a suspected Iranian attack on key Saudi Arabian oil facilities, Trump said that he directed the Treasury Department to "substantially increase" sanctions on Iran. The new sanctions targeted the Iranian national bank. A Senior Trump Administration official said the new sanctions targeted the financial assets of the Supreme leaders inner circle. However, according to the New York Times, Tehran has disclaimed playing any part in the attacks that affected the Saudi oil facilities. \c\cOn 21 February 2020, Iran was placed on the FATF blacklist. On 14 August 2020, the United Nations Security Council rejected a resolution proposed by the United States to extend the global arms embargo on Iran, which is set to expire on 18 October 2020. \c\cAs a response to US sanctions on persons who have visited Iran after 2011, while promoting tourism, Iran ceased affixing  visas in passports and stamping passports on entry of foreigners. In November 2018, Iran again ceased stamping passports or putting visa stickers in passports of foreign tourists. \c\cIn August of 2020, the Trump Administration tried to extend the arms embargo on Iran with no success.  With this event, the U.S. moved to unilaterally trigger snapback sanctions despite having walked away from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.  This drew skepticism and alarm from allies and experts warned it could end the agreement. Former Deputy Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Mick Mulroy said that by unilaterally pulling out of the JCPOA, the U.S. "alienated many of our partners and allies—the same ones we need to work with to counter Iran’s malign activity and prevent them from ever acquiring a nuclear weapon”. \c\cOn August 25, the United Nations blocked the effort of the US to re-impose snapback sanctions on Iran, with the Security Council saying it could not proceed with the move. The President of the UN Security Council, Indonesias ambassador Dian Triansyah Djani, stated he is "not in a position to take further action" on USs request, citing a lack of consensus in the Security Council on the US strategy as the main reason.
A public health effort to permanently eliminate all cases of poliomyelitis (polio) infection around the world began in 1988, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) and the Rotary Foundation.  These organizations, along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Gates Foundation, have spearheaded the campaign through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). Successful eradication of infectious diseases has been achieved twice before, with smallpox and bovine rinderpest. \c\cPrevention of disease spread is accomplished by vaccination. There are two kinds of polio vaccine—oral polio vaccine (OPV), which uses weakened poliovirus, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is injected.  The OPV is less expensive and easier to administer, and can spread immunity beyond the person vaccinated, creating contact immunity. It has been the predominant vaccine used. However, under conditions of long-term vaccine virus circulation in under-vaccinated populations, mutations can reactivate the virus to produce a polio-inducing strain, while the OPV can also, in rare circumstances, induce polio or persistent asymptomatic infection in vaccinated individuals, particularly those who are immunodeficient. Being inactivated, the IPV is free of these risks but does not induce contact immunity. IPV is more costly and the logistics of delivery are more challenging. \c\cThe 175 diagnosed wild polio virus (WPV) cases worldwide in 2019 represented the highest number of cases since 2014, but still a 76% reduction from the 719 diagnosed cases in 2000 and a 99.95% reduction from the estimated 350,000 cases when the eradication effort began in 1988. Of the three strains of polio virus, the last recorded wild case caused by type 2 (WPV2) was in 1999, and WPV2 was declared eradicated in 2015. Type 3 (WPV3) is last known to have caused polio in 2012, and was declared eradicated in 2019. All wild-virus cases since that date have been due to type 1 (WPV1).  All three types are represented among the periodic cases arising from mutated oral vaccine strains, so-called circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). India is the latest country to have officially stopped endemic transmission of polio, with its last reported case in 2011. Two countries remain where the disease is still classified as endemic—Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Egyptian–Greek relations refer to bilateral relations between Egypt and Greece.  Due to the strong cultural and historical ties between the two nations, Egypt and Greece today enjoy friendly relations. Modern diplomatic relations between the two countries were established after Greece gained its independence in 1821, and are today regarded as cordial. Both countries are members and partners in several international organizations such as UN, IMF, OSCE, and the Union for the Mediterranean, among others.
Two consecutive mass shootings occurred at mosques in a terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday Prayer on 15 March 2019. The attack, carried out by a single gunman who entered both mosques, began at the Al Noor Mosque in the suburb of Riccarton at 1:40 p.m. and continued at Linwood Islamic Centre at 1:52 p.m. He killed 51 people and injured 40. \c\cBrenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old man from Grafton, New South Wales, Australia, was arrested shortly afterward. He was described in media reports as a white supremacist and part of the alt-right. He had live-streamed the first shooting on Facebook, and prior to the attack, had published an online manifesto which many considered equivalent to shitposting; both the video and manifesto were subsequently banned in New Zealand. After police investigation, he was charged with 51 murders, 40 attempted murders, and engaging in a terrorist act. He initially pleaded not guilty to all charges, with the trial expected to start on 2 June 2020. On 26 March 2020, he changed his plea to guilty on all charges and was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on 27 August 2020. \c\cThe attack was linked to an increase in white supremacy and alt-right extremism globally observed since about 2015. Politicians and world leaders condemned it, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described it as "one of New Zealands darkest days". The government established a royal commission of inquiry into its security agencies in the wake of the shootings, which was the deadliest in modern New Zealand history.
The 2020 Liberal Democratic Party of Japan leadership election will be held around 15 September 2020 that is to be determined to elect the next president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan for a 3-year term. Initially scheduled to be held in September 2021, incumbent party president and the longest-serving Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, suddenly resigned on 28 August 2020, citing recent health concerns.
McDonalds has been involved in a number of lawsuits and other legal cases in the course of the fast food chains 70-year history.

The  2014 al-Dalwah attack occurred on 3 November 2014 at al-Dalwah village in the eastern province of al-Ahsa, when three masked gunmen shot at a group of people, killing at least seven and injuring dozens. The attack occurred on Ashura and is thought to be targeting Shi’ite Muslims. Six people have since been arrested and one suspect has been killed. \c\cOn 4 November, two police officers and two gunmen were killed in operation, after five people were shot dead and another wounded.   According to Saudi security, the leader of the gunmen had previously slipped back into the kingdom after fighting in Iraq and Syria. \c\cWhile the government and the official media and religious establishment strongly condemned the attack, a handful of articles in the Saudi press  argued that the attack "had not come out of nowhere", that there was anti-Shiite incitement in the kingdom on the part of "the religious establishment, preachers, and even university lecturers – and that it was on the rise".
On March 23, 2020, Daniel Prude was fatally injured after being physically restrained by Rochester, New York, police officers. Prude had been suffering from a mental health episode and was running naked in the citys streets. The officers put a spit hood over his head after he began spitting. They held him face down on the pavement for two minutes. Prude received CPR on the scene and later died of complications from asphyxia after being taken off life support. The autopsy report ruled Prudes death a homicide and also included the contributing factors to his death as "excited delirium and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or PCP." The killing first received attention in September 2020 when the police body camera video and written reports were released along with the autopsy report. Following the reports release, protesters demonstrated outside the Rochester police headquarters.

Michael Forest Reinoehl was shot dead by US Marshals and FBI agents on the evening of September 3rd, 2020, outside Portland. Reinoehl, a protester in Portland who described himself as an anti-fascist, was a suspect in the killing of right-wing protester Aaron Danielson in Portland five days earlier. According to witnesses, officers approached Reinoehl in unmarked SUVs, and he drew an automatic weapon and fired at them. Officers returned fire, killing Reinoehl. No officers were injured in the incident.
Israel–Kosovo relations refer to bilateral relations between Israel and Kosovo. Although Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, Israel had not recognized Kosovo until 4 September 2020, when it was announced by the 45th President of the United States Donald Trump that Israel had formally recognized Kosovo and diplomatic relations would soon be established between the two countries.

Sudan flood 2020 Rains fell profusely and continuously in Sudan, as of early September 2020, which led to a devastating flood in at least 16 Sudanese states. The flood affected more than 500,000 people and destroyed more than 100,000 homes. Government agencies announced the killing of about 101 people.
The Argentine debt restructuring is a process of debt restructuring by Argentina that began on January 14, 2005, and allowed it to resume payment on 76% of the US$82 billion in sovereign bonds that defaulted in 2001 at the depth of the worst economic crisis in the nations history.  A second debt restructuring in 2010 brought the percentage of bonds under some form of repayment to 93%, though ongoing disputes with holdouts remained. Bondholders who participated in the restructuring settled for repayments of around 30% of face value and deferred payment terms, and began to be paid punctually; the value of their nearly worthless bonds also began to rise. The remaining 7% of bondholders later won the right to be repaid in full. \c\cAs part of the restructuring process, Argentina drafted agreements in which repayments would be handled through a New York corporation and governed by United States law. The holdout bondholders found themselves unable to seize Argentine sovereign assets in settlement, but realized that Argentina had omitted to provide for holdout situations and had instead deemed all bonds repayable on pari passu (equal) terms that prevented preferential treatment among bondholders. The holdout bondholders therefore sought, and won, an injunction in 2012 that prohibited Argentina from repaying the 93% of bonds that had been renegotiated, unless they simultaneously paid the 7% holdouts their full amount due as well. Together with the agreements rights upon future offers ("RUFO") clause, this created a deadlock in which the 93% of renegotiated bondholders could not be paid without paying the 7% holdouts, but any payment to the holdouts would potentially (according to Argentina) trigger the 93% being due repayment at full value too; a sum of around $100 billion that Argentina could not afford. The courts ruled that as Argentina had itself drafted the agreement, and chosen the terms it wished to propose, it could not now claim the terms were unreasonable or unfair, and that this could not be worked around by asserting sovereign status since the injunction did not affect sovereign assets, but simply ruled that Argentina must not give preferential treatment of any group of bondholders over any other group when making repayments. \c\cSubsequently, though Argentina wanted to repay some creditors, the judgment prevented Argentina from doing so, because being forced to repay all creditors, including the holdouts, would have totaled around $100 billion. The country was therefore categorized as being in selective default by Standard & Poors and in restricted default by Fitch. The ruling affected New York law Argentine bonds; Argentine bonds issued under Buenos Aires and European law were not affected. \c\cProposed solutions include seeking waivers of the RUFO clause from bondholders, or waiting for the RUFO clause to expire at the end of 2014. The dilemma raised concerns internationally about the ability of a small minority to forestall an otherwise-agreed debt restructuring of an insolvent country, and the ruling that led to it was criticized. \c\cAlthough the media widely reported that the default ended with payments to the principal bondholders in early 2016, during the presidency of Mauricio Macri, several hundred million dollars in outstanding defaulted bonds remained unpaid, which resulted in continuation of litigation.  In November 2016 Argentina announced that it had settled with additional creditors for US$475 million.
On 18 August 2020, elements of the Malian Armed Forces began a mutiny. Soldiers on pick-up trucks stormed the Soundiata military base in the town of Kati, where gunfire was exchanged before weapons were distributed from the armory and senior officers arrested. Tanks and armoured vehicles were seen on the towns streets, as well as military trucks heading for the capital, Bamako. The soldiers detained several government officials including the President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta who resigned and dissolved the government. This is the countrys second coup in less than 10 years, following the 2012 coup d'état.
At 01:15 am local time on 1 January 2017 a gunman shot and killed 39 people and wounded 79 others at the Reina nightclub in the Ortaköy neighbourhood of Istanbul, Turkey, where hundreds had been celebrating New Years Day. Uzbekistan-born Abdulkadir Masharipov was arrested in Istanbul on 17 January 2017. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed credit for his actions. The first hearing in the trial of Masharipov and 51 accused accomplices was held on 11 December 2017, and the next hearing was held on 26 March 2018.
The assassination of Jamal Khashoggi—a Saudi dissident, journalist for The Washington Post, former general manager and editor-in-chief of the Al-Arab News Channel—occurred on 2 October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, and was perpetrated by agents of the Saudi government. Lured to the consulate building on the pretext of providing him papers for his upcoming wedding, Khashoggi was ambushed, suffocated, and dismembered by a 15-member squad of Saudi assassins. Khashoggis final moments are captured in audio recordings, transcripts of which were subsequently made public. The Turkish investigation concluded that Khashoggi had been strangled as soon as he entered the consulate building, and that his body was dismembered and disposed of. Turkish investigators, as well as investigations by the New York Times, concluded that some of the 15 members of the Saudi hit team were closely connected to Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and that the team had traveled to Istanbul specifically to commit the murder. \c\cThe Saudi government engaged in an extensive effort to cover-up the killing, including destroying evidence. After repeatedly shifting its account of what happened to Khashoggi in the days following the killing, the Saudi government admitted that Khashoggi had been killed in a premeditated murder, but denied that the killing took place on the orders of bin Salman, who said he accepted responsibility for the killing "because it happened under my watch" but asserted that he did not order it. Turkish officials released an audio recording of Khashoggis killing that they alleged contained evidence that Khashoggi had been assassinated on the orders of  Mohammed bin Salman. By November 2018, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, based on multiple sources of intelligence, had concluded that bin Salman had ordered Khashoggis assassination. In the same month, the United States sanctioned 17 Saudi individuals under the Magnitsky Act over the Khashoggi murder, including former bin Salman advisor Saud Al-Qahtani, but did not sanction bin Salman himself. U.S. President Donald Trump disputed the CIA assessment, expressed support for bin Salman, and stated that the investigation into Khashoggis death had to continue. \c\cThe murder prompted intense global scrutiny and criticism of the Saudi government. A June 2019 report issued by Agnès Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, concluded that Khashoggis murder was "a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated." Callamard determined that responsibility for Khashoggis killing, and the elaborate campaign to cover it up, rests with the highest officials of the Saudi royal court and that "credible evidence" called for the "investigation of high-level Saudi officials individual liability, including the crown princes." Callamards report also detailed the role of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul in coordinating the killing, undercutting the claim that the murder was an unauthorized act by rogue operatives. The special rapporteur called for a criminal investigation to be undertaken by the UN and, because Khashoggi was a resident of the United States, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. \c\cIn January 2019, the Saudi government began trials against 11 Saudis accused of involvement in Khashoggis murder. In December 2019, following proceedings shrouded in secrecy, a Saudi court acquitted three defendants; sentenced five defendants to death; and sentenced three defendants to prison terms. The acquitted defendants, Saud al-Qahtani and Ahmed al-Asiri, were high-level Saudi security officials, while the five men sentenced to death were "essentially foot soldiers in the killing" and were eventually legally pardoned in May 2020 by Khashoggis children. Saudi prosecutors rejected the findings of the UN investigation and asserted that the killing "was not premeditated" but the decision to commit it was instead  "taken at the spur of the moment." UN special rapporteur Callamard said the Saudi verdict was a "mockery" because "the masterminds not only walk free, they have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial." Human rights group Amnesty International called the verdict a "whitewash" and the Turkish government said that the trials had fallen far short of "justice being served and accountability."
The Pakistan Penal Code, the main criminal code of Pakistan, punishes blasphemy (Urdu: قانون توہین رسالت) against any recognized religion, providing penalties ranging from a fine to death. From 1967 to 2014, over 1,300 people have been accused of blasphemy, with Muslims constituting most of those accused. \c\cPakistan inherited blasphemy laws enacted by British colonial authorities and made them more severe between 1980 and 1986, when a number of clauses were added by the military government of General Zia-ul Haq, in order to "Islamicise" the laws and deny the Muslim character of the Ahmadi minority. Before 1986, only 14 cases of blasphemy were reported. Parliament through the Second Amendment to the Constitution on 7 September 1974, under Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, declared Ahmadi Muslims as non-Muslims. In 1986 it was supplemented by a new blasphemy provision also applied to Ahmadi Muslims (See Persecution of Ahmadis).  Between 1987 and 2017 at least 1,500 people were charged with blasphemy and at least 75 people involved in accusations of blasphemy were killed in Pakistan according to the Center for Social Justice. \c\cMany people accused of blasphemy have been murdered before their trials were over, and prominent figures who opposed the blasphemy law have been assassinated. \c\cSince 1990, 62 people have been murdered following blasphemy allegations. According to one religious minority source, an accusation of blasphemy commonly exposes the accused, police, lawyers, and judges to harassment, threats, attacks and rioting. Critics complain that Pakistans blasphemy laws are "overwhelmingly being used to persecute religious minorities and settle personal vendettas," but calls for change in blasphemy laws have been strongly resisted by Islamic parties - most prominently the Barelvi school of Islam. Many atheists in Pakistan have been lynched and imprisoned over unsubstantiated allegations of blasphemy. When the state initiated a full-fledged crackdown on atheism since 2017,  it has become worse with secular bloggers being kidnapped and the government running advertisements urging people to identify blasphemers among them and the highest judges declaring such people to be terrorists. \c\cCases under blasphemy law have also been registered against Muslims who have harassed non-Muslims. \c\cIn 2020, the European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS) in a report entitled, Guilty until proven innocent: The sacrilegious nature of blasphemy laws Pakistan, recommended wide-ranging changes to Pakistans laws and legal systems.
The war on terror, also known as the global war on terrorism, is an international military campaign launched by the United States government after the September 11 attacks. The targets of the campaign are primarily Sunni Islamic fundamentalist armed groups located throughout the Muslim world, with the most prominent groups being Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, the Taliban, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, and the various franchise groups of the former two organizations. The naming of the campaign uses a metaphor of war to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined. U.S. president George W. Bush first used the term "war on terrorism" on 16 September 2001, and then "war on terror" a few days later in a formal speech to Congress. In the latter speech, George Bush stated, "Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them." The term was originally used with a particular focus on countries associated with al-Qaeda. The term was immediately criticised by such people as Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and more nuanced terms subsequently came to be used by the Bush administration to publicly define the international campaign led by the U.S. While it was never used as a formal designation of U.S. operations in internal government documentation, a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal was issued. \c\cU.S. President Barack Obama announced on 23 May 2013 that the Global War on Terror was over, saying the military and intelligence agencies will not wage war against a tactic but will instead focus on a specific group of networks determined to destroy the U.S. On 28 December 2014, the Obama administration announced the end of the combat role of the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan. The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) led to Operation Inherent Resolve. \c\cCriticism of the war on terror focused on its morality, efficiency, and cost; some, including later president Barack Obama, objected to the phrase itself as a misnomer. The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives, reduce civil liberties, and infringe upon human rights. Critics also assert that the term "war" is not appropriate in this context (much like the term "War on Drugs") since terror is not an identifiable enemy and it is unlikely that international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on 25 January 2020 with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It has since spread elsewhere in the region, although many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. As of 29 August, ten Oceania sovereign states have yet to report a case: Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of September 11, 2020, 110,832 cases have been confirmed, causing 6,578 deaths. As of September 4, 80,678 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. \c\cThe state legislature approved $125 million to aid in relief efforts on March 17, and Governor Gretchen Whitmer called in the Michigan Army National Guard to assist with supply distribution the next day. The state legislature allocated an additional $150 million for medical supplies and personal protective equipment for hospitals on March 30. Governor Whitmer requested a major disaster declaration on March 26, which President Donald Trump granted on March 28. On March 27, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams dubbed Metro Detroit, which has a large majority of the cases, a “hot spot”. A separate study by the Harvard Global Health Institute deemed Macomb County as a hot spot in early August 2020.  The city of Detroit has 20% of the total cases and 25% of the deaths. African Americans make up 31% of the states total cases and 40% of deaths. \c\cThe national coronavirus outbreak triggered a state of emergency response at the state level on March 10 followed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing the closure of all K–12 school buildings until April 5. Face-to-face instruction for all Michigan schools was later suspended for the remainder of the 2019–20 school year, with guidelines implemented to transition students to home learning formats. On March 16, Governor Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, entertainment venues, and other businesses to partially close for two weeks and later banned events and gatherings of more than 50 from March 17 – April 5. On March 24, a statewide stay-at-home order was issued, limiting all non-essential travel and discontinuing all non-essential business services and operations. It was originally set to expire on April 13, but was extended until April 30 with several new social distancing restrictions. The order was later extended to May 15, with some restrictions lifted and others added, such as mandatory face-covering usage in public buildings and businesses. The order was later extended again until May 28 and added modifications of the restrictions from previous orders. The face mask requirement was a factor in the killing of a security guard at a Family Dollar store in Flint after a woman refused to wear a mask and was denied entry, leading to the arrests of a family of four people, in which a 23-year-old man was charged with first-degree murder. Governor Whitmer has since extended the face mask requirement until July 15. On July 10, she extended the requirement and added a provision in which businesses can be fined $500 for not enforcing it and customers may be refused service for failing to wear one. \c\cSeveral of the restrictions on businesses and medical facilities were lifted in late May. On May 22, Governor Whitmer extended the stay-at-home order until June 12 and the state of emergency until June 19. Governor Whitmer later extended the state of emergency another month until July 16. It was again extended until August 11. A month later Whitmer issued a new order which expires September 4. It was later extended yet again until October 1.  On June 1, the Governor announced that the stay at home order was partially lifted and that Michigan was in stage four of its six-stage re-opening plan. Outdoor crowds of up to 100 people are allowed starting June 1. Restaurants and bars began re-opening for indoor dining services starting June 8, and other restrictions on businesses were loosened. Hair and nail salons, barbershops, and tattoo and massage parlors were allowed to reopen on June 15. Starting July 31, indoor gatherings will be limited to 10 people and bars will be closed for indoor service and outdoor gatherings to 100. On August 14, Governor Whitmer announced four million masks will be distributed to vulnerable populations in Michigan.
France–Greece relations, or Franco-Greek relations, are foreign relations between France and Greece. In modern times, both countries established diplomatic relations in 1833, three years after Greek Independence. France and Greece, due to strong cultural and historical ties, have had a traditionally strong and special relationship and strategic alliance for decades and today enjoy strong diplomatic relations also. \c\cThe two countries are EU, UN and NATO member states and cooperate in many other multilateral organizations, such as the La Francophonie, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Union for the Mediterranean.
The death of Jennifer Laude occurred on October 11, 2014, in Olongapo, Philippines, when the 26-year-old Filipina trans woman was killed by 19-year-old Joseph Scott Pemberton. \c\cThis is the second reported criminal case involving a United States Marine in the Philippines under the Philippines–United States Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and the first since the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). The murder spawned protests in the Philippines by transgender rights and other activists.
The effects of global warming in the Arctic, or climate change in the Arctic include rising air and water temperatures, loss of sea ice, and melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a related cold temperature anomaly, observed since the 1970s. Related impacts include ocean circulation changes, increased input of freshwater, and ocean acidification. Indirect effects through potential climate teleconnections to mid latitudes may result in a greater frequency of extreme weather events (flooding, fires and drought), ecological, biological and phenology changes, biological migrations and extinctions, natural resource stresses and as well as human health, displacement and security issues. Potential methane releases from the region, especially through the thawing of permafrost and methane clathrates, may occur. Presently, the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. The pronounced warming signal, the amplified response of the Arctic to global warming, is often seen as a leading indicator of global warming. The melting of Greenlands ice sheet is linked to polar amplification. According to a study published in 2016, about 0.5 °C (0.90 °F) of the warming in the Arctic has been attributed to reductions in sulfate aerosols in Europe since 1980.
The United States government holds tens of thousands of immigrants in detention under the control of Customs and Border Protection (CBP; principally the Border Patrol) and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Immigrants are detained for unlawful entry to the United States, when their claims for asylum are received (and prior to release into the United States by parole), and in the process of deportation and removal from the country. During Fiscal Year 2018, 396,448 people were booked into ICE custody: 242,778 of whom were detained by CBP and 153,670 by ICEs own enforcement operations. A daily average of 42,188 immigrants (40,075 adult and 2,113 in families) were held by ICE in that year. In addition, over twelve thousand immigrant children are housed by facilities under the supervision of the Office of Refugee Resettlements program for Unaccompanied Alien Children. Prior to referral to these other agencies, the CBP holds immigrants at processing centers; between mid-May and mid-June 2019, it held between 14,000 and 18,000 immigrants. \c\cMandatory detention was officially authorized by President Bill Clinton in 1996, with the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility acts. From 1996 to 1998, the number of immigrants in detention increased from 8,500 to 16,000 and by 2008 this number increased to more than 30,000. According to the Global Detention Project, the United States possesses the largest immigration detention system in the world. In 2003, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) was created under the Department of Homeland Security. ICE enforces the United States immigration and customs laws, uses investigative techniques to apprehend and detain those suspected of violating them, and then deports many of these individuals. The Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO), housed within ICE, oversees the detention and deportation of immigrants taken into custody by ICE. Currently, ICE detains immigrants in over 200 detention centers (including privatized facilities), in state and local jails, in juvenile detention centers, and in shelters. \c\cSeveral human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and a series of reports made by the New York Times have cited concerns with ICEs management of these detention centers. Reports refer to instances of human rights abuse and inadequate or unprofessional medical care in these detention facilities. Such reports have also publicized the death of several immigrants in detention and have accused ICE of covering up this information. ICE, in response, has released a list of 166 people who died under ICE detention between 2003–2016. ICE has publicly stated that the agency provides "state-of-the-art medical care" and "do everything possible to maintain the best quality of life for the detainees in...custody." In May 2008 the Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008 (H.R. 5950) was introduced to the United States Congress by Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), though no further steps have been taken to enact the bill.
Hurricane Sally is currently a weakening tropical cyclone that is impacting the Gulf Coast of the United States. The nineteenth tropical depression, eighteenth named storm, and seventh hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Sally formed out of an area of disturbed weather which was first monitored over the Bahamas on September 10. The system grew a broad area of low-pressure on September 11, and was designated as a tropical depression at late that day. Early the next day, the depression made landfall near Miami, Florida, and subsequently strengthened into Tropical Storm Sally that afternoon. Moderate northwesterly shear prevented significant intensification for the first two days, but convection continued to grow towards the center and Sally slowly intensified. On September 14, a center reformation into the center of the convection occurred, and data from a hurricane hunter reconnaissance aircraft showed that Sally rapidly intensified into a strong Category 1 hurricane. It further intensified into a Category 2 hurricane that evening. However, an increase in wind shear and upwelling of colder waters weakened Sally slightly back down to Category 1 on September 15. Despite this increase in wind shear, it unexpectedly re-intensified, reaching Category 2 status again early on September 16 before making landfall at peak intensity at 09:45 UTC on September 16 near Gulf Shores, Alabama with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h).
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of September 17, 2020, 114,692 cases have been confirmed, causing 6,632 deaths. As of September 11, 85,513 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. \c\cThe state legislature approved $125 million to aid in relief efforts on March 17, and Governor Gretchen Whitmer called in the Michigan Army National Guard to assist with supply distribution the next day.

The document leak includes 2100 suspicious activity reports, reports required to be filed by financial institutions when they suspect their clients are engaging in financial crime..
The FinCEN Files are a set of 2,657 documents leaked from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury that collects and analyses information to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, evasion of economic sanctions and other financial crimes. The files were leaked to Buzzfeed News and then forwarded to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The document leak includes 2,121 suspicious activity reports (SARs), reports required to be filed by financial institutions when they suspect their clients are engaging in financial crime. The reports describe over 200,000 suspicious transactions valued at over US$2 trillion that occurred from 1999 to 2017 across multiple global financial institutions. The BBC describes the importance of the files as showing how the: "worlds biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world".
The 2012 Burgas bus bombing was a terrorist attack carried out by a suicide bomber on a passenger bus transporting Israeli tourists at the Burgas Airport in Burgas, Bulgaria, on 18 July 2012. The bus was carrying 42 Israelis, mainly youths, from the airport to their hotels, after arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv. The explosion killed the Bulgarian bus driver and five Israelis and injured 32 Israelis, resulting in international condemnation of the bombing. \c\cIn February 2013, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, the Bulgarian Interior Minister, said there was "well-grounded" evidence that Hezbollah was behind the attack. Tsvetanov stated that the two suspects had Canadian and Australian passports and lived in Lebanon. According to the Europol, forensic evidence and intelligence sources all point to Hezbollahs involvement in the blast. Both Iran and Hezbollah have denied any involvement. On 5 June 2013, new Bulgarian Foreign Affairs Minister Kristian Vigenin stated that: "There is no conclusive evidence for the implication of Hezbollah in the July 2012 bombing in Burgas. The authorities continue to gather evidence." However, two weeks later a Bulgarian representative to the European Union revealed that investigators discovered new evidence that implicates Hezbollah operatives were connected to the terrorist attacks. Investigators found that the forged documents used by the perpetrators of the attack were facilitated by a man with ties to Hezbollah. In July 2013, the newly appointed Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetlin Yovchev stated: "there are clear signs that say Hezbollah is behind the Burgas bombing.". \c\cOn 25 July 2013, the Bulgarian Interior Ministry released photographs of two Hezbollah operatives suspected in the bombing: Australian citizen Malid Farah (also known as "Hussein Hussein"), and Canadian citizen Hassan al-Haj. In 2013, and partly in response to the bombing, the EU unanimously voted to list the military branch of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. \c\cOn 18 July 2014, Bulgaria announced that they identified the bomber as a dual Lebanese-French citizen named Mohamad Hassan El-Husseini.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus reached the country in late January 2020. As of 10 September 2020 there have been 358,138 confirmed cases and 41,608 deaths of confirmed cases, the worlds sixth-highest death rate per hundred thousand population. There were 57,328 deaths where the death certificate mentioned COVID-19 by 28 August (see Statistics). More than 90% of those dying had underlying illnesses or were over 60 years old. The infection rate is higher in care homes than in the community. There has been large regional variation in the outbreaks severity. \c\cThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) launched a public health information campaign to help slow the viruss spread, and began posting daily updates in early February. In February, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, introduced the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 for England, and hospitals set up drive-through screening. The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, outlined a four-pronged strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate. \c\cIn March, the UK government imposed a stay-at-home order, dubbed "Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives", banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside ones home (including family and partners), and shutting almost all schools, business, venues, facilities, amenities and places of worship. Those with symptoms, and their households, were told to self-isolate, while those with certain illnesses were told to shield themselves. People were told to keep apart in public. Police were empowered to enforce the measures, and the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave the government emergency powers not used since the Second World War. It was forecast that lengthy restrictions would severely damage the UK economy, worsen mental health and suicide rates, and cause additional deaths due to isolation, delays and falling living standards. \c\cAll four national health services worked to raise hospital capacity and set up temporary critical care hospitals. By mid-April it was reported that social distancing had "flattened the curve" of the epidemic. In late April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the UK had passed the peak of its outbreak. Daily cases and deaths slowly declined in May and June. The total number of excess deaths in the UK from the start of the outbreak to mid-June was just over 65,000.
On 25 September 2020 an air crash took place at Chuhuiv, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine. An AN-26Sh military plane (tail number 76) of 203rd Training Aviation Brigade (A4104 military unit) crashed during a training flight. 25 people died as a result of crash.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of September 2020, there were over 7,000,000 cases of COVID-19 and 200,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and the US outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing for the virus. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump downplayed the threat posed by the virus and claimed the outbreak was under control. \c\cThe first known American deaths were reported in February. By the end of March, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and all inhabited U.S. territories except American Samoa. \c\cOn March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency. The Trump administration largely waited until mid-March to start purchasing large quantities of medical equipment. In late March, the administration started to use the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories. A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states. \c\cState and local responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and the closure of schools. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas. \c\cAs of September 22, the US death rate had reached 611 per million people, the eleventh-highest rate globally, and ninth-highest if European microstates are excluded. However, The New York Times reported that 200,000 more people had died than was usual between March and early August (about 605 per million). The Times said this "suggests that the official death counts may be substantially underestimating the overall effects of the virus, as people die from the virus as well as by other causes linked to the pandemic".
The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is an ethnic and territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts, which are de facto controlled by the self-declared Republic of Artsakh, but are internationally recognized as de jure part of Azerbaijan. The conflict has its origins in the early 20th century. Under the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin decided to make the Nagorno-Karabakh region an autonomous oblast of Soviet Azerbaijan. The present conflict began in 1988, when the Karabakh Armenians demanded that Karabakh be transferred from Soviet Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war in the early 1990s. \c\cA ceasefire signed in 1994 provided for two decades of relative stability, which significantly deteriorated along with Azerbaijans increasing frustration with the status quo, at odds with Armenias efforts to cement it. A four-day escalation in April 2016 became the deadliest ceasefire violation to date.
Vanuatu maintains relations with more than 65 countries, and has a small network of diplomatic missions. Australia, France, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the Peoples Republic of China and the United Kingdom maintain embassies, high commissions, or missions in Port Vila. The British High Commission maintained a continued presence for almost a century, though closed from 2005 until reopening in 2019. \c\cThe governments main concern has been to bolster the economy. In keeping with its need for financial assistance, Vanuatu has joined the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to ABC Radio Australia, "Foreign policy issues that feature in Vanuatu include wide support for the Free West Papua Movement and broadly for independence throughout Melanesia, the One China Policy and relations with Australia and New Zealand." On the latter topic, guest worker programmes feature prominently.
An exoplanet (extrasolar planet) is a planet located outside the Solar System. The first evidence of an exoplanet was noted as early as 1917, but was not recognized as such until 2016. No planet discovery has yet come from that evidence. However, the first scientific detection of an exoplanet began in 1988. Afterwards, the first confirmed detection came in 1992, with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. The first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star was made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby star 51 Pegasi. Some exoplanets have been imaged directly by telescopes, but the vast majority have been detected through indirect methods, such as the transit method and the radial-velocity method. As of 1 April 2022, there are 4,984 confirmed exoplanets in 3,673 planetary systems, with 815 systems having more than one planet. This is a list of the most notable discoveries.
On 4 August 2020, a large amount of ammonium nitrate stored at the port of the city of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, exploded, causing at least 200 deaths, 3 reported missing, 6,500 injuries, US$10–15 billion in property damage, and leaving an estimated 300,000 people homeless. Around 2,750 tonnes of the substance (equivalent to around 1.1 kilotons of TNT) had been stored in a warehouse without proper safety measures for the previous six years, after having been confiscated by the Lebanese authorities from the abandoned ship MV Rhosus. The explosion was preceded by a fire in the same warehouse, but as of October 2020, the exact cause of the detonation  is still under investigation. \c\cThe explosion was felt in Turkey, Syria, Israel, Palestine and parts of Europe, and was heard in Cyprus, more than 250 km (160 mi) away. It was detected by the United States Geological Survey as a seismic event of magnitude 3.3, and is considered one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosions in history. \c\cThe Lebanese government declared a two-week state of emergency in response to the disaster. In its aftermath, protests erupted across Lebanon against the government for their failure to prevent the disaster, joining a larger series of protests which have been taking place in the country since 2019. On 10 August 2020, Prime Minister Hassan Diab and the Lebanese cabinet resigned due to mounting political pressure exacerbated by the event, though Diab remains as interim prime minister until a new government is formed.
On the night of October 1, 2017, Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old man from Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire upon the crowd attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada. Between 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. PDT, he fired more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition from his 32nd floor suites in the Mandalay Bay Hotel, killing 60 people and wounding 411, with the ensuing panic bringing the injury total to 867. About an hour later, Paddock was found dead in his room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His motive remains officially undetermined. \c\cThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in modern United States history. It focused attention on firearms laws in the U.S., particularly with regard to bump stocks, which Paddock used to fire shots in rapid succession, at a rate of fire similar to automatic weapons. As a result, bump stocks were banned by the U.S. Justice Department in December 2018, with the regulation in effect as of March 2019.
Islam is the second-most widely professed religion in France behind Christianity. \c\cFrance has one of the largest number of Muslims in the Western world primarily due to migration from Maghrebi, West African, and Middle Eastern countries. A 2017 Pew Research report estimates the Muslim population of France to be 5,760,000 or 8.8% of the total population. \c\cThe majority of Muslims in France belong to the Sunni denomination. The vast majority of French Muslims are of immigrant origin, while an estimated 100,000 are converts to Islam of indigenous ethnic French background. The French overseas region of Mayotte has a majority Muslim population. \c\cThirty-nine percent of Muslims surveyed by the polling group IFOP said they observed Islam’s five prayers daily, a steady rise from 31 percent in 1994, according to the study published in the Catholic daily La Croix. \c\cMosque attendance for Friday prayers has risen to 23 percent in 2008, up from 16 percent in 1994, while Ramadan observance has reached 70 percent in 2008 compared to 60 percent in 1994, it said. Drinking alcohol, which Islam forbids, has also declined to 34 percent from 39 percent in 1994, according to the survey of 537 people of Muslim origin. and 70% said they "observe Ramadan".
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the Solomon Islands on 3 October 2020.
In September and October 2020, multiple individuals at the White House tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. On October 1, 2020, President Donald Trump, his wife Melania Trump, press advisor Hope Hicks, presidential campaign manager Bill Stepien, and former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway tested positive for the coronavirus. That same day, it was revealed that Senators Thom Tillis, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson tested positive, as well as University of Notre Dame president John I. Jenkins. Three members of the White House press corps, including Michael D. Shear, also tested positive. On October 2, Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Also on October 2, many individuals connected to the White House were diagnosed with COVID-19.
The War in Darfur, also nicknamed the Land Cruiser War, is a major armed conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan that began in February 2003 when the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel groups began fighting the government of Sudan, which they accused of oppressing Darfurs non-Arab population. The government responded to attacks by carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Darfurs non-Arabs. This resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the indictment of Sudans president, Omar al-Bashir, for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. \c\cOne side of the conflict is mainly composed of the Sudanese military, police and the Janjaweed, a Sudanese militia group whose members are mostly recruited among Arabized indigenous Africans and a small number of Bedouin of the northern Rizeigat; the majority of other Arab groups in Darfur remained uninvolved. \c\cThe other side is made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit ethnic groups. The African Union and the United Nations also have a joint peacekeeping mission in the region, named UNAMID. Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supported the Janjaweed, evidence supports claims that it provided financial assistance and weapons and coordinated joint attacks, many against civilians. Estimates of the number of human casualties range up to several hundred thousand dead, from either combat or starvation and disease. Mass displacements and coercive migrations forced millions into refugee camps or across the border, creating a humanitarian crisis. Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell described the situation as a genocide or acts of genocide. \c\cThe Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue peace. The JEM has the most to gain from the talks and could see semi-autonomy much like South Sudan. However, talks were disrupted by accusations that the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the Tolu agreement. The JEM, the largest rebel group in Darfur, vowed to boycott negotiations. \c\cThe August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, signed by military and civilian representatives during the Sudanese Revolution, requires that a peace process leading to a peace agreement be made in Darfur and other regions of armed conflict in Sudan within the first six months of the 39-month transition period to democratic civilian government. \c\cA comprehensive peace agreement was signed on 31 August 2020 between the Sudanese authorities and several rebel factions to end armed hostilities.
An independence referendum was held in New Caledonia on 4 October 2020. Independence was rejected, with 53.26% of voters against.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Iceland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Iceland in February 2020. As of 4 October 2020, the total number of cases registered was 2,980, of which 2,300 had recovered and 10 deaths had occurred. With a total population of 366,130 (as of 31 March 2020), the infection rate is 1 case per 123 inhabitants; the infection rate was one of the highest in the world throughout March and April, though this was attributed to more tests having been carried out per capita in Iceland than any other country, including a screening of the general population run by Icelandic biotech company deCODE genetics to determine the true spread of the virus in the community. \c\cOn 8 April, as the cases surged over 1,600 and more recoveries than new infections were recorded for the second day in a row, Icelands head epidemiologist, announced that it was highly likely that the country had reached the peak of its outbreak.
Paleontology or palaeontology is the study of prehistoric life forms on Earth through the examination of plant and animal fossils. This includes the study of body fossils, tracks (ichnites), burrows, cast-off parts, fossilised feces (coprolites), palynomorphs and chemical residues. Because humans have encountered fossils for millennia, paleontology has a long history both before and after becoming formalized as a science. This article records significant discoveries and events related to paleontology that occurred or were published in the year 2020.
The global COVID-19 pandemic struck the U.S. state of Wisconsin in early February 2020.  As of October 7, 2020, Wisconsin public health authorities reported 2,319 new cases of COVID-19, for a cumulative total of 138,698 cases.  One hundred and forty-one hospitalizations and 16 deaths were reported over the past 24 hours; increasing the statewide death toll to 1,415.  Although Wisconsin has so far experienced just 243 deaths per million residents, compared to the national average of 653 deaths, COVID-19 is on track to be one of the leading causes of death in Wisconsin in 2020.  October 3rds 2,892 COVID-19 cases set a new single day record since the start of the pandemic.  September 30s 27 COVID-19 deaths set Wisconsins single day death record. \c\cA steady upward trend of new COVID-19 cases in late June/early July accelerated in mid July, with several new single day records reported in late July.  In response to Julys rising case and death tolls, Governor Tony Evers issued a face mask mandate for all citizens over age 5 while in any building that is not a private home.  The results of the mask mandate were mixed, with an initial drop in cases in August, but as of late September an overwhelming majority of counties in the state show significant spikes in new COVID-19 cases.  Unfortunately compliance with the mask mandate has been spotty in Wisconsin, and the state has never achieved the level of control seen in New York and other states that were initially hard hit, and where mask compliance remains very high. \c\cThe seven-day moving average of new COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin on October 7 was 2,346; the average rate of new cases nearly tripling over the past month.  The August 7-16 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota may have been an important cause of the recent surge in cases in Wisconsin; San Diego State epidemiologists estimated that the rally resulted in 266,000 new COVID-19 cases in the US, including many in Wisconsin.
On October 8, 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investigation thwarted an attempt by six armed militia members to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, Governor of Michigan. The attorney general of Michigan, Dana Nessel, called the aborted plot "one of the largest cases in recent history," and labeled the case as "rather unprecedented" in nature. The gunmen were tied to a militia group called the Wolverine Watchmen. Nessel has charged seven other people with plotting to target law enforcement and attack the state Capitol building.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of October 10, 2020, 134,656 cases have been confirmed, causing 6,891 deaths. As of October 9, 104,271 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. The state defines recovery as "still alive 30 days after onset of illness". \c\cThe state legislature approved $125 million to aid in relief efforts on March 17, and Governor Gretchen Whitmer called in the Michigan Army National Guard to assist with supply distribution the next day. The state legislature allocated an additional $150 million for medical supplies and personal protective equipment for hospitals on March 30. Governor Whitmer requested a major disaster declaration on March 26, which President Donald Trump granted on March 28. On March 27, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams dubbed Metro Detroit, which has a large majority of the cases, a “hot spot”. A separate study by the Harvard Global Health Institute deemed Macomb County as a hot spot in early August 2020.  The city of Detroit has 20% of the total cases and 25% of the deaths. African Americans make up 31% of the states total cases and 40% of deaths. \c\cThe national coronavirus outbreak triggered a state of emergency response at the state level on March 10 followed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing the closure of all K–12 school buildings until April 5. Face-to-face instruction for all Michigan schools was later suspended for the remainder of the 2019–20 school year, with guidelines implemented to transition students to home learning formats. On March 16, Governor Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, entertainment venues, and other businesses to partially close for two weeks and later banned events and gatherings of more than 50 from March 17 – April 5. On March 24, a statewide stay-at-home order was issued, limiting all non-essential travel and discontinuing all non-essential business services and operations. It was originally set to expire on April 13, but was extended until April 30 with several new social distancing restrictions. The order was later extended to May 15, with some restrictions lifted and others added, such as mandatory face-covering usage in public buildings and businesses. The order was later extended again until May 28 and added modifications of the restrictions from previous orders. The face mask requirement was a factor in the killing of a security guard at a Family Dollar store in Flint after a woman refused to wear a mask and was denied entry, leading to the arrests of a family of four people, in which a 23-year-old man was charged with first-degree murder. Governor Whitmer has since extended the face mask requirement until July 15. On July 10, she extended the requirement and added a provision in which businesses can be fined $500 for not enforcing it and customers may be refused service for failing to wear one. \c\cSeveral of the restrictions on businesses and medical facilities were lifted in late May. \c\cGovernor Whitmer has issued several states of emergency, the latest of which expires on October 27. On June 1, the Governor announced that the stay at home order was partially lifted and that Michigan was in stage four of its six-stage re-opening plan. Outdoor crowds of up to 100 people are allowed starting June 1. Restaurants and bars began re-opening for indoor dining services starting June 8, and other restrictions on businesses were loosened. Hair and nail salons, barbershops, and tattoo and massage parlors were allowed to reopen on June 15. Starting July 31, indoor gatherings will be limited to 10 people and bars will be closed for indoor service and outdoor gatherings to 100. On August 14, Governor Whitmer announced four million masks will be distributed to vulnerable populations in Michigan. Movie theaters and other entertainment venues will be allowed to re-open on October 9.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the French overseas collectivity of French Polynesia in March 2020.
The Yemeni Civil War (Arabic: الحرب الأهلية اليمنية, al-ḥarb al-ʾahlīyah al-yamanīyah) is an ongoing multi-sided conflict that began in late 2014 mainly between two factions: the Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi-led Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement, along with their supporters and allies. Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. \c\cThe civil war began in September 2014 when Houthi forces took over the capital city Sanaa, which was followed by a rapid Houthi takeover of the government. On 21 March 2015, the Houthi-led Supreme Revolutionary Committee declared a general mobilization to overthrow Hadi and expand their control by driving into southern provinces. The Houthi offensive, allied with military forces loyal to Saleh, began fighting the next day in Lahij Governorate. By 25 March, Lahij fell to the Houthis and they reached the outskirts of Aden, the seat of power for Hadis government. Hadi fled the country the same day. Concurrently, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched military operations by using air strikes to restore the former Yemeni government. Although there was no direct intervention by Iran, who support the Houthis, the conflict has been widely seen as an extension of the Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict and as a means to combat Iranian influence in the region. \c\cHouthi forces currently control the capital Sanaʽa and all of North Yemen except Maʼrib Governorate. They have clashed with Saudi-backed pro-government forces loyal to Hadi. Since the formation of the Southern Transitional Council in 2017 and the subsequent capture of Aden by the STC in 2018, the anti-Houthi coalition has been fractured, with regular clashes between pro-Hadi forces backed by Saudi Arabia and southern separatists backed by the UAE. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have also carried out attacks against both factions, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast. \c\cAccording to ACLED, over 100,000 people have been killed in Yemen, including more than 12,000 civilians, as well as estimates of more than 85,000 dead as a result of an ongoing famine due to the war. In 2018, the United Nations warned that 13 million Yemeni civilians face starvation in what it says could become "the worst famine in the world in 100 years." The crisis has only begun to gain as much international media attention as the Syrian Civil War in 2018. \c\cThe international community has sharply condemned the Saudi Arabian-led bombing campaign, which has included widespread bombing of civilian areas. According to the Yemen Data Project, the bombing campaign has killed or injured an 17,729 civilians as of March 2019. \c\cThe United States provided intelligence and logistical support for the Saudi-led campaign. In March 2019, both houses of the United States Congress voted to pass a resolution to end US support to the Saudi Arabia war effort. It was vetoed by President Donald Trump, and in May, the Senate failed to override the veto.

Biden-Ukraine conspiracy theory are a series of allegations alleging that former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden coordinated efforts against anti-corruption investigations in Ukraine into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, which Hunter Biden served on the board of directors from 2014–2019.
In the aftermath of the August 2020 police shooting of Jacob Blake, protests and civil unrest occurred in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and around the United States as part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement and ongoing responses to high-profile killings by police officers in 2020. In addition to street protests, marches, and demonstrations, the shooting also led to the 2020 American athlete boycotts. \c\cThe demonstrations were marked by daily peaceful protesting followed by confrontations with law enforcement and rioting at night. A state of emergency was declared on August 23, and the National Guard was activated the following day. Further confrontations arose when armed militia members, whom Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth described as "like a group of vigilantes", arrived with the expressed intent of protecting businesses in the city. \c\cOn August 25, two protesters were fatally shot and a third was injured by Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois. Rittenhouse was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and other charges; his attorneys have said his actions were in self-defense.
Since 2016, U.S. president Donald Trump and his allies have promoted several conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal. One such theory seeks to blame Ukraine, instead of Russia (as supported by all reliable sources), for interference in the 2016 United States presidential election. Also among the conspiracy theories are baseless accusations against Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, and several elements of the right-wing Russia investigation origins counter-narrative. American intelligence believes that Russia engaged in a yearslong campaign to frame Ukraine for the 2016 election interference, that the Kremlin is the prime mover behind promotion of the fictitious alternative narratives, and that these are harmful to the United States. FBI director Christopher A. Wray stated to ABC News that "We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election" and that "as far as the  election itself goes, we think Russia represents the most significant threat.". \c\cOn August 18, 2020, the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee released its final report on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, finding that while he was Trumps campaign manager, Paul Manafort worked with a close associate who was a Russian intelligence officer "on narratives that sought to undermine evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election" and to direct such suspicions toward Ukraine.

The 2020 NFL season is the 101st season of the National Football League (NFL). The regular season started with the NFL Kickoff Game on September 10, with defending Super Bowl LIV champion Kansas City defeating Houston. The season is scheduled to conclude with Super Bowl LV, the leagues championship game at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida on February 7, 2021. \c\cThis is the first season with a 14-team playoff format, adding a third wild card team for each conference, and only awarding each conferences top seed a first round bye. \c\cThe Oakland Raiders became the Las Vegas Raiders following their relocation to the Las Vegas area, becoming the first NFL team based in the state of Nevada. The Washington Redskins, following the decades-long controversy regarding their name and logo, retired both in the offseason and became the Washington Football Team until a permanent name is chosen after the season. \c\cThe season has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, though the regular season began as scheduled. The most prominent changes were the cancellation of all preseason games, the suspension of international games for the year, an allowance for players to opt out of playing the season without violating their contracts (66 players opted out), the playing of games with either a greatly reduced audience or no fans at all with artificial crowd noise being used in their place, and the postponement of multiple games due to COVID-19 cases among players and staff, and the cancellation of the 2021 Pro Bowl.

On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the arrests of 13 domestic terrorism suspects accused of plotting to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, Governor of Michigan, and otherwise violently overthrow the state government. The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged with federal crimes, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was charged in state court.

The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on 25 January 2020 with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It has since spread elsewhere in the region, although many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. As of 3 October, nine Oceania sovereign states have yet to report a case: Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
Sudan–United States relations are the bilateral relations between Sudan and the United States. The United States government has been critical of Sudans human rights record and has dispatched a strong UN Peacekeeping force to Darfur.
End Special Anti-Robbery Squad (End SARS) or #EndSARS is a  decentralized social movement against police brutality in Nigeria. The slogan calls for an end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a controversial unit of the Nigerian Police Force with a long record of abuses. The protests started in 2017 as a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #ENDSARS to demand the Nigerian government eliminate the force. After experiencing a revitalization in October 2020, mass demonstrations were occurring throughout Nigeria in major cities, and the hashtag had 28 million tweets. Nigerians have shared both stories and video evidence of how members of SARS engaged in kidnapping, murder, theft, rape, torture, unlawful arrests, humiliation, unlawful detention, extrajudicial killings, and extortion in Nigeria. SARS officers have been alleged to profile youths based on fashion choices, mount illegal road blocks and searches, conduct unwarranted temperature checks, arrest without warrant, rape women, and extort young Nigerians for driving exotic vehicles and using iPhones. \c\cWithin a few days of renewed protests, some claimed victory as the Nigerian Police Force announced it was dissolving SARS on Sunday, 11 October 2020. However, many noted similar promises had been made in recent years, and that the government planned to reassign and review SARS officers to medical centres rather than remove them entirely. Protests have continued accordingly, and the Nigerian state has maintained a pattern of violent repression, including the killing of demonstrators. There have been international demonstrations in solidarity with those happening in the country, and the scope of the movement has also grown increasingly critical of the Muhammadu Buhari-fronted Nigerian state and society as a whole.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of October 22, 2020, 152,862 cases have been confirmed, causing 7,129 deaths. As of October 16, 109,539 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. The state defines recovery as "still alive 30 days after onset of illness".
Abortion in Poland is illegal except in cases of rape and when the womans life or any form of health is in jeopardy. \c\cIn 2016, with proposed legislation to completely outlaw abortion, 30,000 women went on strike and marched in cities across the country to protest the legislation, leading high-ranking politicians to distance themselves from the proposed law. Just three days after the strike, lawmakers voted against the new law. \c\cIn 2020, Poland’s constitutional court ruled that abortion due to fetal defects was unconstitutional. \c\cPoland is one of the few countries in the world to outlaw abortion after decades of liberal  legislation (during Communist rule). Polish women often seek abortion in neighboring countries due to the strict restraints in their own country. \c\cPoland has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, along with a group of other traditionally Catholic countries of the region (Malta, San Marino, Liechtenstein, Vatican, Monaco and Andorra).
The Israel–Sudan normalization agreement is an agreement that took place on October 23, 2020, whereby Israel and Sudan agreed to normalize relations. It is not clear if the deal establishes full diplomatic relations between the two nations. The agreement came after the agreements of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates signed with Israel in September 2020. This made Sudan the fifth Arab country to recognize Israels right to exist, after Egypt in 1979, Jordan in 1994, and Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in 2020. Unlike the latter two, Sudan had sent troops to fight the Israeli forces in all Arab-Israeli major wars and considered Israel an enemy state.
Pope Francis (r. 2013–present) has created cardinals at six consistories held at roughly annual intervals beginning in 2014, most recently on 5 October 2019. He has created 88 cardinals from 56 countries, 17 of which had never been represented in the College of Cardinals, and the first Scandinavian since the Reformation. \c\cFollowing the 2019 consistory, 67 of the cardinal electors had been appointed by Francis, 42 by Pope Benedict XVI, and 19 by Pope John Paul II. Each set of Francis' appointments has increased the number of cardinal electors beyond the set limit of 120, as high as 125 in both 2015 and 2018 and 128 in 2019. The number exceeded 120 for almost a year following the 5 October 2019 consistory (until 29 September 2020), the longest such time period during Francis' papacy. \c\cOn 25 October 2020, Pope Francis announced he would create thirteen new cardinals, nine of them young enough to be cardinal electors, at a consistory scheduled for 28 November 2020.
The 2020 British Columbia general election (formally the 42nd British Columbia general election) was held on October 24, 2020, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The New Democratic Party of British Columbia won a majority government, making John Horgan the first leader in the history of the British Columbia New Democratic Party to win a second consecutive term as Premier. \c\cMr. Horgan called a snap election on September 21, 2020, the first early election in the province since the 1986 election. Horgan portrayed the call for an early election as required for stability given the fact that the BC NDP was governing with a minority of seats in the Legislative Assembly, but his decision was criticized by both the NDPs confidence and supply partner, the British Columbia Green Party, and the provinces Official Opposition, the British Columbia Liberal Party, as opportunistic.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cAustralian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March. Social distancing rules were imposed on 21 March, and state governments started to close non-essential services. "Non-essential services" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories. The number of new cases initially grew sharply, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22 March, and started falling at the beginning of April to under 20 cases per day by the end of the month. \c\cA second wave of infections in Victoria, which was attributed to an outbreak at a Melbourne hotel, emerged during the period of May to June and is currently ongoing. \c\cAs of 25 October 2020, Australia has reported 27,520 cases, 25,032 recoveries, and 905 deaths, with Victoria reporting the highest number of cases.
The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is an ongoing tropical cyclone season which has featured tropical cyclone formation at a record-breaking rate. So far, there have been a total of 28 tropical or subtropical cyclones, 27 named storms, 11 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. With 27 tropical or subtropical storms, it is the second most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, behind only the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It is also only the second tropical cyclone season to feature the Greek letter storm naming system, with the other season also being 2005. The season officially started on June 1 and will officially end on November 30; however, formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time, as illustrated by the formations of Tropical Storms Arthur and Bertha, on May 16 and 27, respectively. This marked the record sixth consecutive year with pre-season systems. During the season, Tropical Storm Cristobal and 23 later systems have broken the record for the earliest formation by storm number. Of the 27 named storms, 10 made landfall in the contiguous United States, breaking the record of nine set in 1916. In addition, the season is the first to see seven named tropical cyclones make landfall in the continental United States before September. This unprecedented activity has been fueled by an ongoing La Niña. \c\cIn June, Cristobal formed, killing 15 people and causing $665 million in damage. In July, Edouard formed, followed by Tropical Storm Fay, which caused moderate damage and killed six in the Northeastern United States, then Tropical Storm Gonzalo. Two weeks later, Hanna, the seasons first hurricane, made landfall in South Texas. This was followed by Hurricane Isaias, which made landfall in The Bahamas and North Carolina, both times as a Category 1 hurricane, and brought heavy impacts and a destructive tornado outbreak, causing an overall $4.725 billion in damage. In August, Laura became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in terms of wind speed to make landfall in Louisiana, alongside the 1856 Last Island hurricane. Overall, Laura caused at least $14.1 billion in damage and 77 deaths. September was the most active month on record in the Atlantic, with ten named storms, starting with Nana, Omar, Paulette, and Rene. Hurricane Paulette made landfall in Bermuda, the first storm to do so since 2014. Hurricane Sally severely impacted the US Gulf Coast, while a massive Hurricane Teddy affected Atlantic Canada as an extratropical cyclone, while also becoming the fourth largest tropical cyclone by gale-force winds on record. The Greek alphabet started with Alpha, the first subtropical storm on record to hit Portugal. Finally, Tropical Storm Beta affected Texas, causing moderate flooding. \c\cIn October, Tropical Storm Gamma and Hurricane Delta struck Mexicos Yucatán Peninsula. Delta would later impact Louisiana, becoming the 10th storm to strike the continental U.S. this season. Additionally, Hurricane Epsilon formed southeast of Bermuda and grew into the seasons 4th major hurricane, while Hurricane Zeta passed through the Yucatán Peninsula before heading towards the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast. \c\cEarly on, officials in the United States expressed concerns the hurricane season could potentially exacerbate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for U.S. coastal residents. As expressed in an op-ed of the Journal of the American Medical Association, "there exists an inherent incompatibility between strategies for population protection from hurricane hazards: evacuation and sheltering (i.e., transporting and gathering people together in groups)," and "effective approaches to slow the spread of COVID-19: physical distancing and stay-at-home orders (i.e., separating and keeping people apart)."
On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the arrests of 13 suspects accused of plotting to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Governor of Michigan, and otherwise violently overthrow the state government. The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court.

Hurricane Paulette made landfall in Bermuda, the first storm to do so since 2014. Hurricane Sally severely impacted the US Gulf Coast, while Hurricane Teddy affected Atlantic Canada as an extratropical cyclone, shortly after also becoming the fourth largest tropical cyclone (by diameter of gale-force winds) on record in the Atlantic. The Greek alphabet started with Alpha, the first subtropical storm on record to make landfall in Portugal. Tropical Storm Beta affected Texas, causing moderate flooding and gusty winds. In October, Tropical Storm Gamma and Hurricane Delta struck Mexicos Yucatán Peninsula. Delta would later impact Louisiana, becoming the 10th storm to strike the continental U.S. this season. Just weeks later, Hurricane Zeta passed through the Yucatán Peninsula before becoming the record-breaking fifth storm of the season to make landfall in Louisiana. \c\cEarly on, officials in the United States expressed concerns the hurricane season could potentially exacerbate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for U.S. coastal residents.

Allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party of the United Kingdom (UK) have been made since Jeremy Corbyn was elected as leader of the party in September 2015. After comments by Naz Shah in 2014 and Ken Livingstone in 2016 resulted in their suspension from membership pending investigation, Corbyn established the Chakrabarti Inquiry, which concluded that the party was not "overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism", although there was an "occasionally toxic atmosphere" and "clear evidence of ignorant attitudes". The Home Affairs Select Committee of Parliament held an inquiry into antisemitism in the UK in the same year and found "no reliable, empirical evidence to support the notion that there is a higher prevalence of antisemitic attitudes within the Labour Party than any other political party", though the leaderships lack of action "risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally antisemitic". \c\cIn 2017, Labour Party rules were changed to make hate speech, including antisemitism, a disciplinary matter. In 2018, Corbyn was challenged for querying in 2012 the removal of Freedom for Humanity, an allegedly antisemitic mural, in response to a Facebook post from the artist, and for having been a member of Facebook groups, mainly pro-Palestinian, containing antisemitic posts. In July of that year, Labours National Executive Committee (NEC) adopted a definition of antisemitism, for disciplinary purposes, that included the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition, with modified examples relating to how criticism of Israel could stray into antisemitism. In September of that year, the NEC added all 11 IHRA examples, unamended, to the definition of antisemitism, and included them in the Partys code of conduct. \c\cIn February and July 2019, Labour issued information on investigations into complaints of antisemitism against individuals, with around 350 members resigning, being expelled or receiving formal warnings, equating to around 0.08% of the membership. Also in February 2019, nine MPs resigned from the party, citing Labours leftward political direction and its handling of allegations of antisemitism and of Brexit – most of them then formed The Independent Group. In May 2019, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced an inquiry into whether Labour had "unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish". In July, the party published online educational material on combatting antisemitism and promoted it to all members. \c\cIn April 2020, an 860-page report into the handling of antisemitism by the party concluded that there was "no evidence" that antisemitism complaints were treated any differently than other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being "motivated by antisemitic intent".
The New Zealand End of Life Choice referendum was a binding referendum  held on 17 October 2020, with early voting taking place from 3 October, in conjunction with the 2020 general election and cannabis referendum, on the question of whether the End of Life Choice Act 2019 should come into force. The Act would legalise voluntary euthanasia for those with a terminal illness and less than six months left to live, if confirmed to be eligible by two doctors. If the majority of voters support the legislation, it will come into force 12 months after the final vote count is announced. \c\cNew Zealand is the first country to put euthanasia legalisation to a referendum. \c\cPreliminary results for the referendum were released by the Electoral Commission on 30 October 2020, while official results are expected to be released on 6 November 2020. In the preliminary results, 65.2% of people supported the End of Life Choice Act while 33.8% were opposed.

The 2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum was a non-binding referendum held on 17 October 2020 in conjunction with the 2020 general election and a euthanasia referendum, on the question of whether to legalise the sale, use, possession and production of cannabis. The form of the referendum was a vote for or against the proposed "Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill". Preliminary results for the referendum were released by the Electoral Commission on 30 October 2020, while official results are expected to be released on 6 November 2020. In the preliminary results, 53.1% of people opposed legalising cannabis while 46.1% were in support. \c\cThe results of the cannabis referendum will not affect the legal status of medicinal cannabis and hemp production, both of which are already legal. They will also not affect laws regarding driving under the influence of cannabis, which will remain illegal, or workplace health and safety issues (e.g. consumption or being under the infuence of cannabis at work).

On October 26, 2020, Walter Wallace Jr., a 27-year-old African-American man, was fatally shot by police in Cobbs Creek, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Two Philadelphia Police Department officers arrived in the area to respond to a domestic dispute. When they arrived, Wallace moved towards them carrying a knife. The two officers backed away while telling him to drop the knife, and as Wallace advanced towards them, each officer fired several rounds at Wallaces shoulder and chest. He later died in the hospital. Wallaces family stated Wallace was having a mental health crisis. \c\cIn response to the killing, demonstrations occurred throughout Philadelphia on October 26 and 27, many of which escalated into violence and looting, leading to arrests, injuries to police, deployment of the Pennsylvania National Guard, and a citywide curfew.

The 2020 Vienna attacks were a series of shooting incidents on 2 November 2020 in Vienna, Austria. They involved multiple gunmen across six different locations in Vienna, the capital of Austria, opening fire with assault rifles. The deaths of three civilians and one perpetrator were confirmed in the hours after the attack, but additional fatalities were suspected; several more were injured, with one of them being a police officer. The Vienna Police Department said that the attacker who was killed was an Islamic State sympathizer, and that the attack was motivated by Islamic extremism. \c\cAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz referred to the events as a "repulsive terrorist attack". The other attackers were reported to be on the loose, and being hunted by Austrian special forces (EKO Cobra and WEGA). The attacks occurred just hours before Austria entered a second nationwide partial lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19.

On June 1, 2017, United States President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would cease all participation in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation, and begin negotiations to re-enter the agreement "on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers," or form a new agreement. In withdrawing from the agreement, Trump stated that "The Paris accord will undermine (the U.S.) economy," and "puts (the U.S.) at a permanent disadvantage." Trump stated that the withdrawal would be in accordance with his America First policy. \c\cIn accordance with Article 28 of the Paris Agreement, a country cannot give notice of withdrawal from the agreement before three years of its start date in the relevant country, which was on November 4, 2016 in the case of the United States. On November 4, 2019, the administration gave a formal notice of intention to withdraw, which takes 12 months to take effect. The White House later clarified that the U.S. will abide by the four-year exit process. Until the withdrawal takes effect, the United States may have been obligated to maintain its commitments under the Agreement, such as the requirement to continue reporting its emissions to the United Nations. The withdrawal took effect on November 4, 2020, one day after the 2020 U.S. presidential election. \c\cWhile celebrated by some members of the Republican Party, international reactions to the withdrawal were overwhelmingly negative from across the political spectrum, and the decision received substantial criticism from religious organizations, businesses, political leaders of all parties, environmentalists, and scientists and citizens from the United States and internationally. \c\cFollowing Trumps announcement, the governors of several U.S. states formed the United States Climate Alliance to continue to advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement at the state level despite the federal withdrawal. As of July 1, 2019, 24 states and Puerto Rico have joined the alliance, and similar commitments have also been expressed by other state governors, mayors, and businesses. \c\cTrumps withdrawal from the Paris agreement will impact other countries by reducing its financial aid to the Green Climate fund. The termination of the $3 billion U.S funding will ultimately impact climate change research and decrease societys chance of reaching the Paris Agreement goals, as well as omit U.S contributions to the future IPCC reports. Trumps decision will also affect the carbon emission space as well as the carbon price. The U.Ss withdrawal will also mean that the spot to take over the global climate regime will be obtainable for China and the EU.
The White House COVID-19 outbreak was a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections in September and October 2020 among people, including many US government officials, who were in close contact during the COVID-19 pandemic in Washington, D.C. Numerous high-profile individuals were infected, including President Donald Trump, who was hospitalized for three days. At least 36 White House staff members or associates, closely working with White House personnel, have tested positive for the coronavirus. The White House resisted efforts to engage in contact tracing, leaving it unclear how many people were infected in total and what the origins of the spread were. \c\cMany of the infections appeared to be related to a ceremony held on September 26 in the White House Rose Garden for the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, where seating was not socially distanced and participants were mostly unmasked. Trump himself may have been infectious at that point, but he and his entourage attended several subsequent events unmasked, including the first presidential debate against Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio on September 29. The next day, press advisor Hope Hicks was placed in quarantine aboard Air Force One while returning with Trump from a campaign event in Minnesota. Following that, the president proceeded on schedule to an October 1 New Jersey fundraiser where he mingled, unmasked, with donors. \c\cOther infections included First Lady Melania Trump; GOP Senators Thom Tillis, Mike Lee, and Ron Johnson; Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien; RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel; former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway; former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie; Notre Dame president John I. Jenkins; press secretary Kayleigh McEnany; and presidential advisor Stephen Miller. As of October 6, at least 35 people had tested positive. At least one person, White House security office head Crede Bailey, was reported as "gravely ill," having fallen sick in September prior to the Rose Garden event. \c\cThe cluster emerged in the final weeks of Trumps campaign for the 2020 presidential election, a little more than a month before the last day of voting, November 3. Commentators were critical of the White House for providing conflicting information about Trumps condition and the timeline of his infection, as well as delaying the disclosure of the initial diagnoses of White House staffers. \c\cThe outbreak at the White House could have been prevented, according to public health experts such as Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of November 7, 2020, 207,794 cases have been confirmed, causing 7,578 confirmed deaths. As of November 6, 128,981 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. The state defines recovery as "still alive 30 days after onset of illness".
According to human rights organisations, the government of the UAE violates a number of fundamental human rights. The UAE does not have democratically elected institutions and citizens do not have the right to change their government or to form political parties. There are reports of forced disappearances in the UAE, many foreign nationals and Emirati citizens have been abducted by the UAE government and illegally detained and tortured in undisclosed locations. In numerous instances, the UAE government has tortured people in custody (especially expats and political dissidents),. \c\cand has denied their citizens the right to a speedy trial and access to counsel during official investigations. \c\cFlogging and stoning are legal forms of judicial punishment in the UAE due to Sharia courts. The government restricts freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and the local media are censored to avoid criticising the government, government officials or royal families. Freedom of association and freedom of religion are also curtailed. \c\cDespite being elected to the UN Council, the UAE has not signed most international human-rights and labour-rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. \c\cIn November 2020, the United Arab Emirates overhauled its legal system to loosen restrictions on alcohol consumption, permit cohabitation, and criminalize honor killings, among other changes.
The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020. The Democratic ticket of former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator from California Kamala Harris defeated the Republican ticket of incumbent President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Voters selected presidential electors of the Electoral College who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020 to elect the new president and vice president. This was the first election since 1992 in which an incumbent president failed to win re-election to a second term. Biden received the most votes ever cast for a presidential candidate in an American election, beating Barack Obamas record of 69.5 million votes from 2008, as did Trump. \c\cTrump secured the Republican nomination without any serious opposition, while Biden secured the Democratic nomination over his closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, in a competitive primary that featured the largest field of presidential candidates for any political party in the modern era of American politics. Bidens running mate Senator Kamala Harris is the first African American, first Asian American, and third female vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket. \c\cCentral issues of the election included the public health and economic impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, civil unrest in reaction to the police killing of George Floyd and others and the future of the Supreme Court following the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett. \c\cThe election saw a record number of ballots cast early and by mail, due to many states relaxing restrictions on mail-in voting in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the large number of mail-in ballots, some swing states saw delays in vote counting and reporting, leading to major news outlets not projecting a winner until four days later on November 7. On election night, and after Biden was declared winner, Trump made frequent false claims intended to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election, and refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. By November 7, Biden and Harris were declared winners by all major news outlets projecting the results, including ABC, the Associated Press, CNN, Fox, NBC, The New York Times, and Reuters. Counting continues to determine the final results. Biden and Harris are scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021. Trump has yet to concede.
The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020. Voters selected presidential electors who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020, to either elect a new president and vice president or reelect the incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence, respectively. The series of presidential primary elections and caucuses were held from February to August 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political partys nominating convention, who then elect their parties' nominees for president and vice president. The major two-party candidates were Republican incumbent President Trump and Democratic former vice president Joe Biden. The 2020 Senate elections and the 2020 House elections, along with various other local elections, were held concurrently with the presidential election. All major news outlets projecting the race have projected that Biden has won the election, including ABC News, the Associated Press, Business Insider, CNN, Decision Desk HQ, Fox News, MSNBC, NBC News, The New York Times, Reuters, and Vox. Counting continues to determine the final results. \c\cCentral issues of the election included the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has left more than 230,000 Americans dead; the economy and how to revive it after its pandemic-induced recession; police brutality and protests in reaction to the police killing of George Floyd and others; the death of Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett; climate change regulations, particularly the Paris Agreement from which Trump withdrew on November 4; and the future of the Affordable Care Act, with Biden arguing for protecting and expanding the scope of the legislation, and Trump pushing for its repeal. In the lead-up to the election, as well as on election night and after the election was called for Biden, Trump made frequent false claims intended to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election, as well as refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. \c\cTrump secured the Republican nomination without any serious opposition alongside incumbent vice president Pence. Former vice president Joe Biden secured the Democratic nomination over his closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, in a competitive primary that featured the largest field of presidential candidates for any political party in the modern era of American politics. On August 11, 2020, Biden announced that his running mate would be Senator Kamala Harris, making her the first African American, first Asian American, and third female vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket. Jo Jorgensen secured the Libertarian nomination with Spike Cohen as her running mate, and Howie Hawkins secured the Green nomination with Angela Nicole Walker as his running mate. \c\cJoe Biden, the presumptive winner of the 2020 presidential election, pending the formal voting by the Electoral College in mid-December, is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021. He received the most popular votes of any presidential candidate in the history of the United States. Biden will become the oldest president upon being inaugurated, at 78 years old, and the first one from Delaware, although being born in Pennsylvania. This was the first presidential election in which both the major candidates are over 70. Biden became the first candidate to defeat an incumbent president in 28 years (of two Democratic and two Republican attempts), the first presidential nominee in 60 years to win without carrying Ohio, and the second non-incumbent vice president to be elected president. He will also be the second Roman Catholic to be elected president, after John F. Kennedy in 1960, and the first elected president since George H. W. Bush to serve two full terms as vice president before winning in the Electoral College. In addition, his running mate, Harris, will become the first woman, first black person, and first Asian American to be elected vice president. Douglas Emhoff, Harriss husband, will become the first male Second Spouse of the United States.

In the lead-up to the election, as well as on election night, Trump made frequent false claims intended to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election, as well as refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. \c\cTrump secured the Republican nomination without any serious opposition alongside incumbent vice president Pence. Former vice president Joe Biden secured the Democratic nomination over his closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, in a competitive primary that featured the largest field of presidential candidates for any political party in the modern era of American politics. On August 11, 2020, Biden announced that his running mate would be Senator Kamala Harris, making her the first African American, first Asian American, and third female vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket. Jo Jorgensen secured the Libertarian nomination with Spike Cohen as her running mate, and Howie Hawkins secured the Green nomination with Angela Nicole Walker as his running mate. \c\cThe winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021. Biden will be the oldest president at the time of inauguration, at 78 years old. Biden would also immediately become the oldest president overall. Biden became the first candidate to defeat an incumbent president in 28 years (of two Democratic and two Republican attempts),  the first presidential nominee in 60 years to win without carrying Ohio, and the second non-incumbent vice president to be elected president. He also will be only the second Roman Catholic to be elected president, after John F. Kennedy in 1960. In addition, his running mate, Harris, will become the first woman and second person with non-European ancestry to serve as vice president.
The Insurgency in Cabo Delgado (also known as the Cabo Delgado Civil War) is an ongoing conflict in Cabo Delgado Province, Mozambique, mainly fought between Islamist militants attempting to establish an Islamic state in the region, and Mozambican security forces. Civilians have been the main targets of attacks by Islamist militants. The main insurgent faction is Ansar al-Sunna, a native extremist faction with tenuous international connections. From mid-2018, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has allegedly become active in northern Mozambique as well, and claimed its first attack against Mozambican security forces in June 2019. In addition, bandits have exploited the rebellion to carry out raids. The insurgency is thought to be intensifying, as in the first half of 2020 there were nearly as many attacks carried out as in the whole of 2019. \c\cAnsar al-Sunna (English: Supporters of the tradition) is similar to the name of an Iraqi Sunni insurgent group that fought against US troops between 2003 and 2007. Locals call them "al-Shabaab" but they are a separate organization from Somali al-Shabaab. The militants are known to speak Portuguese, the official language of Mozambique, Kimwane, the local language, and Swahili, the lingua franca language spoken in the Great Lakes region. Reports also state that members are mostly Mozambicans from Mocimboa da Praia, Palma and Macomia districts, but also include foreign nationals from Tanzania and Somalia.
The Battle of Shusha (Azerbaijani: Şuşa döyüşü; Şuşa uğrunda döyüş, Armenian: Շուշիի ճակատամարտ, romanized: Shushii chakatamart), referred to by Azerbaijanis as Liberation of Shusha (Azerbaijani: Şuşanın azad edilməsi; Şuşanın qurtuluşu), was a battle fought between the forces of Azerbaijan and the breakaway Republic of Artsakh, supported by Armenia, over control of the city of Shusha (Azerbaijani: Şuşa, Armenian: Շուշի, romanized: Shushi) and its surrounding villages and heights, during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. The region is de facto controlled by the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh, but de jure part of Azerbaijan. \c\cAdvancing from the city of Jabrayil, the Azerbaijani military captured the town of Hadrut in mid-October. Azerbaijani forces then advanced further north, entering Shusha District. Although Shusha had been under bombardment since the beginning of the conflict, local warfare erupted near the city on 29 October. Azerbaijan seized control of the village of Çanaqçı, followed by part of the strategic Shusha–Lachin road on 4 November, with Armenian forces subsequently closing the road to civilians. Le Monde reported that the battle had turned in favour of Azerbaijan on 6 November, despite Artsakhs denial. On 8 November, President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, claimed that Azerbaijani forces had taken control of the city; Armenia issued a denial. The next day, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defence released a video from the city, confirming full Azerbaijani control.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Malaysia in late January 2020, when it was detected on travellers from China arriving in Johor via Singapore on 25 January, following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. Reported cases remained relatively low at first and were largely confined to imported cases, until localised clusters began to emerge in March; the largest cluster at that time was linked to a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering held in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur in late February and early March, leading to massive spikes in local cases and an exportation of cases to neighbouring countries. Within a few weeks, Malaysia had recorded the largest cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in Southeast Asia, breaching the 2,000 active cases mark by the end of March, from fewer than 30 cases at the beginning of the month. By 16 March, the virus was reported in every state and federal territory in the country. \c\cThe medical response to the outbreak is overseen by Director-General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah under the Health Ministry of two successive governments. Preparations to stockpile equipment, detect and monitor cases, and treat COVID-19 patients were reported to have been initiated as early as 6 January 2020, following a World Health Organization (WHO) report on a late-December 2019 outbreak of "pneumonia of unknown cause" in the city of Wuhan, Hubei. As jumps in cases began to occur in early March and the Yang di-Pertuan Agong expressed great concern over the escalation of the outbreak, measures to combat the outbreak were later announced by the Prime Minister of Malaysia via live nationwide telecast on 13 March 2020. By 16 March, a nationwide "Movement Control Order" (MCO), intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing, was announced to be in effect between 18 and 31 March. The Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC) also published a federal gazette on 18 March 2020 that restricts individuals from travelling to other states that have been declared as coronavirus-affected areas. On 25 March, the MCO was extended by an addition two weeks, until 14 April, as the rate of new cases per day remained consistently high. The MCO was further announced to be extended until 28 April on 10 April, and to 12 May on 23 April. A gradual easing of restrictions was implemented, first phase after the lockdown is the "Conditional Movement Control Order" (CMCO) on 1 May, which allows most businesses to open on 4 May, followed by a "Recovery Movement Control Order" (RMCO) as the second phase from 10 June. Originally slated to expire on 31 August, the RMCO has been further extended to 31 December 2020, with selected sectors remaining closed and strict travel restrictions from multiple countries remaining in effect due to continued detection of imported cases. With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia as second wave, it was downgraded to Phase 1 of the post-lockdown for all states from November 9 to December 6, and Sabah is planning to go to the lockdown mode. \c\cInitially reporting the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia in March and early-April, daily active cases in Malaysia have declined steadily from a peak of 2,596 in early April to a fluctuation of less than 250 cases by late June. The countrys case count has since been eclipsed by other Southeast Asian countries of the Philippines (on 14 April), Indonesia (on 15 April), Singapore (on 18 April), and Myanmar (on 28 September), but the extent of its outbreak remains more severe than several other Southeast Asian countries of Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and East Timor, with a higher fatality count than in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and East Timor. Periodic case spikes from subsequent clusters within local communities, immigrant enclaves, immigration detention centres, prisons, and health facilities continue to be reported since the initial outbreak, of which the most serious since mid-2020 is an outbreak originating in Sabah in September 2020 with the state already having more than 10,000 positive cases by October of the same year.
The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war was an armed conflict between Azerbaijan, supported by Turkey, and the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh, supported by Armenia, in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. It was the latest escalation of the unresolved conflict over the territory, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but mostly governed by Artsakh, a breakaway state with an Armenian ethnic majority of 99.7%. \c\cClashes began on the morning of 27 September 2020 along the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact, which had been established in the aftermath of the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In response to the clashes, Armenia and Artsakh introduced martial law and total mobilization, while Azerbaijan introduced martial law and a curfew, later declaring partial mobilization on 28 September. \c\cInternational analysts believe that fighting likely began with an Azerbaijani offensive, and that the primary goals of the offensive were to reclaim districts in southern Nagorno-Karabakh that are less mountainous and thus easier to take than the regions well-fortified interior. The war was marked by the deployment of drones, sensors, long-range heavy artillery and missile strikes, as well as by state propaganda and the use of official social media accounts in online information warfare. Total casualties on both sides may be in the low thousands. \c\cTurkey provided military support to Azerbaijan, although the extent of this support was disputed. Turkeys involvement is thought to have been an attempt to extend its sphere of influence, both by increasing the standing of Azerbaijan in the conflict and by marginalizing Russias influence over the region. \c\cNumerous countries and the United Nations strongly condemned the fighting and called on both sides to de-escalate tensions and resume meaningful negotiations without delay. A humanitarian ceasefire brokered by Russia, facilitated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and agreed to by both Armenia and Azerbaijan, formally came into effect on 10 October, but was completely disregarded by both sides, halting a planned return of the dead and exchange of wounded and prisoners. \c\cFollowing the capture of Shusha, the second-largest settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh, a peace agreement was signed between the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, ending all hostilities in the area from 00:00, 10 November 2020 Moscow Time. The President of Artsakh, Arayik Harutyunyan, also agreed to end the hostilities. According to the agreement, each warring side would maintain currently held territories, while Armenia agreed to return other occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan will also gain land access to its Nakhchivan exclave bordering Turkey and Iran. Almost 2,000 Russian soldiers will be deployed as peacekeeping forces to protect the land corridor between Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh region for a mandate of at least five years. The end of the war was widely celebrated in Azerbaijan.
On 20 June 2020 shortly before 19:00 BST, a man with a knife attacked people socialising in Forbury Gardens, Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom. Three men died from their wounds, and three other people were seriously injured. A 25-year-old Libyan male refugee was arrested nearby shortly afterwards. On 29 June 2020, the suspect appeared by video link at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder. On 11 November, he pleaded guilty to all charges.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Canada was announced on January 25, 2020, involving a traveler who had recently returned to Toronto from travel in China, including Wuhan.  As of November 10, 2020, Ontario has the second-largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among Canadas provinces and territories, behind only Quebec. \c\cWith increasing transmission province-wide, a state of emergency was declared by Premier Doug Ford on March 17, 2020, including the gradual implementation of restrictions on gatherings and commerce. On April 3, the province released modelling projecting that over the full course of the pandemic with no mitigation measures 100,000 deaths would have occurred, and with the then-current measures 3,000 to 15,000 deaths would occur. Projections for test-confirmed cases by April 30 were 12,500 (best case scenario), 80,000 (expected case scenario), and 300,000 (worst-case scenario). \c\cFrom late spring to early summer, the majority of the deaths were residents of long-term care homes. In late April, one out of five of all long-term care homes in Ontario had an outbreak and 70% to 80% of all COVID-19 deaths had been in retirement and long-term care homes. Following medical assistance and observation by the Canadian Armed Forces, the military released a report detailing "a number of medical, professional and technical issues" amongst for-profit long-term-care homes including neglect and lack of equipment and allegations of elder abuse. \c\cFrom May through August, the province instituted a three-stage plan to lift economic restrictions, subject to the employment of social distancing and other guidelines, and continued restrictions on the sizes of gatherings. A plan was implemented for the return-to-class of public schools, involving more than 2 million children. \c\cIn early-September, the province showed a significant increase in new cases, along with similar spikes across the country in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba (or a 25% increase nationwide). Throughout the month of October, Ontario began to reintroduce some restrictions, with a focus on controlling spikes in the hotspots of Toronto, Peel Region, York Region and Ottawa. The province later rolled back its reopening in hotspot regions with temporary measures in a modified Stage 2 of the previous economic reopening system. In early November, the province unveiled a new five-tiered colour-coded level system, abandoning its previous reopening stage system.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus reached the country in late January 2020. As of 2 November 2020 there have been 1,034,914 confirmed cases and 46,717 deaths, the worlds eighth-highest death rate per hundred thousand population. There were 61,783 deaths where the death certificate mentioned COVID-19 by 30 October (see Statistics). More than 90% of those dying had underlying illnesses or were over 60 years old. The infection rate is higher in care homes than in the community. There has been large regional variation in the outbreaks severity. Health care in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each having their own systems of publicly funded healthcare, funded by devolved block grants via the Barnett formula and accountable to separate governments and parliaments, together with smaller private sector and voluntary provision. \c\cThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for England launched a public health information campaign to help slow the viruss spread, and began posting daily updates in early February. In February, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, introduced the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 for England, and hospitals set up drive-through screening. The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, outlined a four-pronged strategy, relevant to England, to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate. \c\cIn March, the UK government imposed a stay-at-home order, dubbed "Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives", banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside ones home (including family and partners), and shutting almost all schools, business, venues, facilities, amenities and places of worship. Those with symptoms, and their households, were told to self-isolate, while those with certain illnesses were told to shield themselves. People were told to keep apart in public. Police were empowered to enforce the measures, and the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave the government emergency powers not used since the Second World War. It was forecast that lengthy restrictions would severely damage the UK economy, worsen mental health and suicide rates, and cause additional deaths due to isolation, delays and falling living standards. \c\cAll four national health services worked to raise hospital capacity and set up temporary critical care hospitals, including the NHS Nightingale Hospitals. By mid-April it was reported that social distancing had "flattened the curve" of the epidemic. In late April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the UK had passed the peak of its outbreak. Daily cases and deaths slowly declined in May and June, and continued at a relatively low level in July and August. The total number of excess deaths in the UK from the start of the outbreak to mid-June was just over 65,000. \c\cCases rose significantly from late August onwards (by a factor of 3.2 from Aug 15 - Sept 15). The government responded with a "tiered" regional lockdown in England, and the devolved governments introduced similar restrictions. These restrictions evolved during late October as more countries in Europe affected by COVID-19 reacted to their high case incidence resulting in actual or potential health system pressure, by announcing national as opposed to regional lock-downs or "circuit breakers".
On 14 November 2020 multiple rockets launched from Ethiopia hit Asmara, the capital city of Eritrea. Two rockets hit Asmara International Airport. \c\cThe same day the Eritrean government confirmed that missiles were launched at the capital but denied the city had been hit, saying that they landed in the countryside. The attack came just hours after the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF) threatened to target Eritrea.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Saskatchewan is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The province of Saskatchewan, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada ranks fifth amongst provinces and territories in terms of overall cases. \c\cChief Medical Officer Saqib Shahab announced the first presumptive case of in the province on March 12, a person in their 60s that had recently returned from Egypt. A provincial state of emergency was declared on March 18, and the province began to institute mandatory closures of non-essential facilities and lines of business over the days that followed. Saskatchewan reported its first deaths from COVID-19 on March 30. By April 6, the number of new recoveries began to regularly equal or exceed the number of new cases, which also began to steadily drop. On April 23, 2020, Premier Scott Moe stated that Saskatchewans caseload was 70% below the national average per-province, and hospitalizations and deaths were 90% below average. \c\cThe provinces first major surge began in late-April, centred upon the remote northwestern community of La Loche. It was traced to an outbreak at the Kearl Oil Sands Project in northern Alberta, with wider community spread attributed to overcrowded living conditions in local First Nations communities. In June and July, a new surge emerged in the western and central regions of the province, centred around communal Hutterite colonies. The province hit a new peak of 332 active cases during the spike, which subsided by late-August. In early-October, the number of new cases in Saskatchewan began to rapidly increase in urban communities, with a gospel outreach in Prince Albert being attributed as a superspreader event, and increasing community spread in Saskatoon — particularly at nightclubs — which prompted restrictions to be introduced on their operating hours. By early-November, the province had reached over 1,000 active cases. \c\cAs of July 14, 2020, COVID-19 testing is available universally to all residents. Schools re-opened in September 2020 with in-person classes available. Saskatchewans post-secondary institutions have suspended in-person classes through at least the Winter 2021 semester.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of November 14, 2020, 251,813 cases have been confirmed, causing 7,994 confirmed deaths. As of November 13, 138,862 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. The state defines recovery as "still alive 30 days after onset of illness".
Presidential elections were held in Moldova on Sunday, 1 November 2020, the fourth direct presidential election since independence in 1991. Voters had the possibility to either elect a new president or reelect the incumbent Igor Dodon. Because no candidate received a majority of votes in the first round, a run-off between the top two candidates, Maia Sandu and Dodon, was held on 15 November. Maia Sandu won with 57.75% of the vote.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Nunavut is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). After two cases were later deemed false positives, Nunavut remained the only province or territory in Canada with no confirmed COVID-19 cases until November 6, 2020. The first false positive case was a resident of Pond Inlet, first announced on April 30; a rapid response team was dispatched to the community. On May 4, it was declared that this case was a false positive. The second false positive case originated from a presumed positive results of a fly-in, fly-out employee in the Mary River Mine on July 2. On July 10, it was subsequently revealed that the test results were negative.
Facebook has been replacing traditional media channels since its founding in 2004. Censorship in the media, especially on Facebook is because of a variety of reasons, since Facebook accepts all kinds of content, with little or no moderation, and displays what people post publicly, this practice can sometimes threaten oppressive governments especially in totalitarian regimes while also propelling fake news, hate speech and misinformation thus undermining the credibility of online platforms and social media. Many countries have banned or temporarily limited access to the social networking website Facebook, including Mainland China, Iran, Syria, and North Korea. Use of the website has also been restricted in various ways in other countries. As of May 2016, the only countries to ban access around the clock to the social networking site are China, Iran, Syria, and North Korea. However, since most North Korean residents have no access to the Internet, China and Iran are the only countries where access to Facebook is actively restricted in a wholesale manner.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Samoa on 19 November 2020.
On November 20th, an active shooting incident occurred at Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, resulting in significant police presence from the area. At least 8 people are injured, as of 4:11 PM CDT. The Milwaukee Medical Examiners have stated that they will not respond to the scene, indicating nobody was killed. However, 6 people were loaded into ambulances.

In early November, the province unveiled a new five-tiered colour-coded level system, abandoning its previous reopening stage system. The "response framework" was created in contradiction to the metrics suggested to political officials by Public Health Ontario and later amended by the province to lower thresholds in each category. Revised projections suggested Ontario could see 2,500 daily lab-confirmed cases with a 3% growth rate or upwards of 6,500 daily lab-confirmed cases by mid-December. Under the projections worst-case scenario, ICU capacity would be exceeded in six weeks.
The 2020 G20 Riyadh summit will be the  fifteenth meeting of Group of Twenty (G20). It will be held on 21–22 November 2020 in Riyadh, the capital city of Saudi Arabia.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Chile is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Chile in March 2020. While initial cases had been imported from South East Asia and Europe, they expanded into a sizeable quantity of untraceable infections, placing the country within phase 4 of the pandemic as defined by the World Health Organization, and surpassing a thousand confirmed cases on 25 March 2020. \c\cThe cases have concentrated in the Santiago metropolitan area, with outbreaks in other regions in the country. No national lockdown was established in Chile, unlike in neighbouring Argentina and Peru, although a night curfew was implemented throughout the country. Quarantines were established locally in different cities and neighborhoods. However, in May 2020, the whole city of Santiago was put under mandatory quarantine due to an increase of cases and similar situations were extended to most of the largest cities in Chile. \c\cConsidering its population, Chile has one of the worst outbreaks in the world, with more than 27,000 cases and 1,000 deaths per million inhabitants. Initially, the number of fatalities reported was lower than other countries in South America, even with less cases. However, in May 2020, the number of cases and deaths increased rapidly, while several sources reported additional numbers of excess deaths which were not counted. By June 2020, the government confirmed thousands of additional deaths due to COVID-19, including suspected cases where PCR tests were not available. The pandemic reached its apparent peak on 13 June with 195 daily confirmed deaths and nearly 7,000 positive cases. By July 2020, the number of deceased surpassed 10,000 people and Chile became the sixth largest number of cases in the world. In the following weeks, the number of daily cases and deaths started to decrease slowly, although some local outbreaks appeared. \c\cThe impact of the pandemic has been great in the South American country. In March 2020, when the first cases of COVID-19 appeared, the country was still facing protests and riots that had begun in October 2019, and the pandemic affected the scheduled 2020 Chilean national plebiscite, which was rescheduled. Partial lockdowns and quarantines were established in the first months, hitting the economy of the country. By April 2020, unemployment had reached 9%, a record-high level in the past 10 years, while the economy had shrunk by 14.1% the first months of the year,. A wave of protests, mainly politically motivated, sparked in late May, mainly in Santiago, due to the appearance of food shortages in certain sectors of the population.
On November 20, 2020, a mass shooting occurred at Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, United States. Eight people were injured but survived. The shooter fled the scene afterwards and remains at large. Police said the shooting was not a random act and had been sparked by an earlier altercation between two groups. Two days later, several people were arrested in connection with the shooting, including a 15-year-old boy.
The presidential transition of Joe Biden is the ongoing transition to the presidency of Joe Biden, the president-elect of the United States. He became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party for president in April 2020, and formally accepted the nomination the following August. Bidens transition team, led by Ted Kaufman, had already been announced on June 20. Further co-chairs joined the team alongside Kaufman in September. \c\cThe 2020 presidential election took place on November 3. Late that evening, incumbent president Donald Trump declared victory based on his initial lead in tabulated in-person votes, a claim which was widely anticipated and quickly discredited. He also demanded all further tabulation of uncounted in-person and mail ballots cease, a demand also ignored. Trump also alleged widespread fraud, corruption and other misconduct, without providing any evidence and which have been almost universally denied. Trump commenced multiple lawsuits in multiple states seeking a halt to counting, rejection of votes, preventing certification of results, besides other remedies, all of which have been dismissed as of November 16. On November 13, for the first time and without any evidence, Trump claimed that 2.7 million votes were "deleted" by the digital voting system used in some states, and said votes were switched from him to Joe Biden. \c\cAfter three and a half days of vote counting, on November 7, at approximately 11:30 a.m. EST, the Associated Press, along with major TV networks including CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, and Fox News, called the race for Joe Biden. Since then, most sources have described him as the president-elect. The GSA Administrator, Emily Murphy, a Trump appointee, has refused to issue the "ascertainment" letter declaring Biden the "apparent winner", on the basis that the election result was disputed by Trump. The declaration would mark the official start of the transition, and withholding it denies funds, office space, and access to agencies to the Biden transition team. The letter was issued on November 23rd. Biden has also been denied daily classified national security briefings. \c\cThe electoral college will meet on December 14, 2020, and formally elect the president and vice president. The results will then be certified by a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021. Bidens transition will end when he is inaugurated at 12:00 p.m. EST on January 20, 2021, at which point his presidency will begin.
Cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were confirmed in the State of Palestine on 5 March 2020. The Palestinian health ministry said the cases had first been detected at a hotel in the Bethlehem area, where a group of Greek tourists had visited the hotel in late February, with two later diagnosed with the virus. \c\cIsrael confiscated tents, some destined for a field hospital for Khirbet Ibzik, in late March, and blocked the construction of another in an early phase of construction on private Palestinian land in Hebron, where the emergency was intense, on the grounds that it lacked an Israeli building permit. The senior United Nations official in the region told the Security Council in a 23 April video conference meeting that Israelis and Palestinians are cooperating in unprecedented ways to deal with the pandemic but that Israel must do more to safeguard the health of all people under its control. \c\cAccording to an analysis by Haaretz on 22 July 2020, there is a concern that a combination of events may cause the situation to spin out of control. Following the severing of security coordination and civilian ties with Israel, Palestinians stopped coordinating on the treatment of patients with Israel and accepting mail and packages through Israeli ports and severed coordination with the IDF as well as the Shin Bet. Supervision of border crossings with Israel also stopped. On top of this, the dispute with Israel over tax revenues is having a serious economic impact. \c\cThe first two cases in Gaza City, Gaza were diagnosed on 21 March. On August 24, 2020, confirmed cases outside of quarantine centers were recorded. On 31 August 2020, according to United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator Jamie McGoldrick, "The deterioration witnessed in recent weeks in the Gaza Strip is of grave concern," Power cuts are severely affecting hospitals as well as critical infrastructure. The Hebron district is currently an epicenter.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cAustralian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March. Social distancing rules were imposed on 21 March, and state governments started to close non-essential services. "Non-essential services" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories. The number of new cases initially grew sharply, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22 March, and started falling at the beginning of April to under 20 cases per day by the end of the month. \c\cA second wave of infections emerged in Victoria during May and June, which was attributed to an outbreak at a Melbourne hotel used for quarantining international arrivals. The second wave was much more widespread and deadlier than the first; at its peak, the state had over 7,000 active cases. The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October. \c\cAs of 23 November 2020, Australia has reported 27,835 cases, 25,344 recoveries, and 907 deaths, with Victoria accounting for nearly 75 percent of cases and 90 percent of fatalities. Compared to other Western countries, notably the United States and European countries, Australias handling has been praised for its effectiveness and fast-forward reactions, although there was some criticism of overconfidence following the second outbreak.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of November 25, 2020, 324,779 cases have been confirmed, causing 8,761 confirmed deaths. As of November 20, 152,267 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. The state defines recovery as "still alive 30 days after onset of illness".
Two consecutive mass shootings occurred at mosques in a terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday Prayer on 15 March 2019. The attack, carried out by a single gunman who entered both mosques, began at the Al Noor Mosque in the suburb of Riccarton at 1:40 pm and continued at Linwood Islamic Centre at 1:52 pm. He killed 51 people and injured 40. \c\cBrenton Harrison Tarrant, a 28-year-old man from Grafton, New South Wales, Australia, was arrested shortly afterward. He was described in media reports as a white supremacist and part of the alt-right. He had live-streamed the first shooting on Facebook, and prior to the attack, had published an online manifesto; both the video and manifesto were subsequently banned in New Zealand. After police investigation, he was charged with 51 murders, 40 attempted murders, and engaging in a terrorist act. He initially pleaded not guilty to all charges, with the trial expected to start on 2 June 2020. On 26 March 2020, he changed his plea to guilty on all charges. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on 27 August 2020. It was the first time a life imprisonment without parole sentence was handed down in New Zealand. \c\cThe attack was linked to an increase in white supremacy and alt-right extremism globally observed since about 2015. Politicians and world leaders condemned it, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described it as "one of New Zealands darkest days". The government established a royal commission of inquiry into its security agencies in the wake of the shootings, which were the deadliest in modern New Zealand history and the worst ever committed by an Australian national. The commission submitted its report to the government on 26 November 2020.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of November 2020, there were more than 12,900,000 confirmed cases and 264,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S., representing nearly one-fifth of the worlds known COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the most cases and deaths of any country. As of November 26, the U.S. death rate had reached 800 per million people, the thirteenth-highest rate globally. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing for the virus. Meanwhile, President Trump downplayed the threat posed by the virus and claimed the outbreak was under control. \c\cThe first known American deaths occurred in February, but were not known to be caused by COVID-19 until April. By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and by November in all inhabited U.S. territories. \c\cOn March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency. The Trump administration largely waited until mid-March to start purchasing large quantities of medical equipment. In late March, the administration started to use the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories. A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states. \c\cState and local responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and the closure of schools. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the U.S. state of Ohio on March 9, 2020, when the states first cases were reported. The first death from Covid-19 in Ohio was reported on March 19. Subsequently, records supported by further testing showed that undetected cases had existed in Ohio since early January, with the first confirmed death on March 17. By April 23, Ohio had 656 confirmed deaths; by May 1, there were 1002 confirmed deaths. Accurate data was difficult to obtain due to limited test availability. By November 2, 221,909 COVID-19 cases had been reported, leading to 5,340 deaths.
Egypt – South Sudan relations refers to the bilateral ties between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Republic of South Sudan.
Australia–China relations, often known as the Sino-Australian relations, refers to the relations between Australia and China. The first Chinese consulate in Australia was established in 1909, and diplomatic relations were established in 1941. Australia continued to recognise the Republic of China (ROC) government after it lost the Chinese Civil War and retreated to Taiwan in 1949, but switched recognition to the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) on 21 December 1972. The relationship between China and Australia has grown considerably over the years. Both countries are actively engaged economically, culturally and politically which spans numerous organizations such as APEC, East Asia Summit and the G20. China is Australias largest trading partner, and has invested in Australian mining companies. \c\cRelations between the two countries began to deteriorate in 2018 due to growing concerns of Chinese political influence in various sectors of Australian society including the Government, universities and media as well as Chinas stance on the South China Sea dispute, all of which were seen as components of Chinas salami slice strategy. The COVID-19 pandemic has created issues and tensions between the countries, especially Australias calls for a separate inquiry into the outbreak of the disease. Subsequent changes to Chinas trade policies have been interpreted as political retaliation against Australia.
The Arecibo Observatory was an observatory in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, also known as the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC). It remains owned by the US National Science Foundation (NSF). \c\cThe main instrument of the observatory was the Arecibo Telescope, a 305 m (1,000 ft) spherical reflector dish built into a natural sinkhole, a cable-mount steerable receiver mounted 150 m (492 ft) above the dish, and several radar transmitters for emitting signals. For more than 50 years, the Arecibo Telescope was the worlds largest single-aperture telescope, surpassed in July 2016 by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China. The Observatory also includes a radio telescope, a Lidar facility, and a visitors center. \c\cThe Arecibo Telescope was primarily used for research in radio astronomy, atmospheric science, and radar astronomy, as well as for programs that search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). Scientists wanting to use the observatory submitted proposals that were evaluated by independent scientific referees. NASA also used the telescope for near-Earth object detection programs. The observatory, funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF) with partial support from NASA, was managed by Cornell University from its completion in 1963 until 2011, after which it was transferred to a partnership led by SRI International. In 2018, a consortium led by the University of Central Florida assumed operation of the facility. \c\cThe telescopes unique and futuristic design led to several appearances in film, gaming and television productions, such as for the climactic fight scene in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. It has been listed on the US National Register of Historic Places since 2008. The center was named an IEEE Milestone in 2001. It has a visitor center that is open part-time. \c\cSince 2006, the NSF has reduced its funding commitment to the observatory, leading academics to push for additional funding support to continue its programs. The telescope was damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and was affected by earthquakes in 2019 and 2020. Two cable breaks, one in August 2020 and a second in November 2020, threatened the structural integrity of the support structure for the suspended platform and damaged the dish. Due to uncertainty over the remaining strength of the other cables supporting the suspended structure, and the risk of collapse due to further failures making repairs dangerous, the NSF announced on November 19, 2020, that it would decommission and dismantle the telescope, with the radio telescope and LIDAR facility remaining operational. \c\cOn December 1st 2020 the entire structure collapsed, and the telescope became inoperational.
On December 1, 2020, a man rammed pedestrians with his car on a street in Trier, Germany, killing two people and wounding about 15 civilians. Terrorism is suspected.
Capital punishment is a legal penalty in Egypt. The state carried out at least 44 executions in 2016, at least 35 in 2017, and at least 43 in 2018. On 8 September, 2020 a court in Egypt sentenced 75 people to death and 47 others to life imprisonment.They were charged with murder, membership in a terrorist group. The British newspaper Independent has reported that Najia Bounaim of Amnesty International Middle East and North Africa described the courts sentence to “disgraceful" and "a mockery of justice.". The method of execution is hanging for civilian convictions, and by firing squad for convictions by commissioned military personnel at the time of duty. \c\cThe Grand Mufti of Egypt Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam, is responsible under Egyptian law for reviewing all death sentences in Egypt. Legally, his opinion is consultative and non-binding to the presiding court that handed down the death sentence.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Vanuatu is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Vanuatu on 11 November 2020.
On April 18–19, 2020, Gabriel Wortman committed multiple shootings and set fires at 16 locations in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, killing 22 people and injuring three others before he was shot and killed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Enfield. \c\cFor part of the thirteen-hour crime spree, Wortman impersonated a police officer by driving a replica police car and wearing a police uniform. An investigation into Wortmans motives is underway. Wortman obtained several firearms illegally without a possession and acquisition licence. On December 4, three people, including Wortmans spouse, were charged with supplying him with ammunition later used in the attacks. \c\cPolice were criticised for not using Alert Ready to warn the public about the attacks, as well as not responding to reports of Wortmans behaviour and previous acts of domestic violence. An investigation into law enforcements response to the rampage, including the decision not to use Alert Ready, is underway. A public inquiry into the law enforcement response was declared on July 28 following escalating criticism of the investigations lack of transparency. \c\cThe attacks are the deadliest rampage in Canadian history, exceeding the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre in Montreal, where fifteen people were killed. On May 1, in the wake of the attacks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, following through on a 2019 campaign promise, announced an immediate ban on some 1,500 makes and models of "military-grade assault-style" weapons, including the types used in the attacks.
In early December 2020, an idiopathic disease broke out in Eluru, a city located in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.  The first case was reported on Saturday, 5 December, with hundreds more falling ill over the weekend and one person dying.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus reached the country in late January 2020. As of 2 November 2020 there have been 1,256,725 confirmed cases and 50,365 deaths, the worlds eighth-highest death rate per hundred thousand population and the highest number overall in Europe. There were 69,803 deaths where the death certificate mentioned COVID-19 by 20 November (see Statistics). More than 90% of those dying had underlying illnesses or were over 60 years old. The infection rate is higher in care homes than in the community. There has been large regional variation in the outbreaks severity. Health care in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each having their own systems of publicly funded healthcare, and accountable to separate governments and parliaments, together with smaller private sector and voluntary provision. \c\cOn 22 February, in Scotland, COVID-19 was made into a "notifiable disease", and a surveillance network involving 41 GP locations was established to submit samples of suspected patients, even if they had no travel history. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for England launched a public health information campaign to help slow the viruss spread, and began posting daily updates in early February. The HSC began testing for COVID-19 during February 2020, as of 19 February there were 35 completed tests all of which returned negative results. Also in February, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, introduced the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 for England, and hospitals set up drive-through screening. The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, outlined a four-pronged strategy, relevant to England, to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate. In Wales, the Chief Medical Officer, Frank Atherton, said that the Government would be taking "all appropriate measures" to reduce the risk of transmission. \c\cIn March, the UK government, with the agreement of the other three governements, imposed a stay-at-home order, dubbed "Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives", banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside ones home (including family and partners), and shutting almost all schools, business, venues, facilities, amenities and places of worship. Those with symptoms, and their households, were told to self-isolate, while those with certain illnesses were told to shield themselves. People were told to keep apart in public. Police were empowered to enforce the measures, and the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave all four governments emergency powers not used since the Second World War. It was forecast by Chancellor Sunak that lengthy restrictions would severely damage the UK economy, worsen mental health and suicide rates, and cause additional deaths due to isolation, delays and falling living standards. \c\cAll four national health services worked to raise hospital capacity and set up temporary critical care hospitals, including the NHS Nightingale Hospitals. By mid-April it was reported that social distancing had "flattened the curve" of the epidemic. In late April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the UK had passed the peak of its outbreak. Daily cases and deaths slowly declined in May and June, and continued at a relatively low level in July and August. The total number of excess deaths in the UK from the start of the outbreak to mid-June was just over 65,000. \c\cCases rose significantly from late August onwards (by a factor of 3.2 from Aug 15 - Sept 15). Preempting a second outbreak, on the 19th October, the Welsh Government announced a national Firebreak. The UK Government followed a few days later with a "tiered" regional lockdown in England, and Northern Ireland and Scotland introduced similar restrictions. These restrictions evolved during late October as more countries in Europe affected by COVID-19 reacted to their high case incidence resulting in actual or potential health system pressure, by announcing national as opposed to regional lockdowns or "circuit breakers".
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of December 2020, there were more than 15,100,000 confirmed cases and 285,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S., representing nearly one-fifth of the worlds known COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the most cases and deaths of any country. As of December 7, the U.S. death rate had reached 860 per million people, the thirteenth-highest rate globally. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing for the virus. Meanwhile, President Trump downplayed the threat posed by the virus and claimed the outbreak was under control. \c\cThe first known American deaths occurred in February, but were not known to be caused by COVID-19 until April. By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and by November in all inhabited U.S. territories. \c\cOn 6 March, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak. On March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency. The Trump administration largely waited until mid-March to start purchasing large quantities of medical equipment. In late March, the administration started to use the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories.

Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of December 10, 2020, 421,137 cases have been confirmed, causing 10,395 confirmed deaths. As of December 4, 197,750 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. The state defines recovery as "still alive 30 days after onset of illness".
Trade negotiation between the UK and the EU is the negotiation after Brexit between the United Kingdom and the European Union for a trade agreement to make trade easier than it would be without such a deal. The deal might cover (or eliminate) both  tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. \c\cDuring the Brexit negotiations in 2017 (of the withdrawal agreement), the two sides agreed that trade negotiation could only start after the UKs withdrawal, because such negotiations could not happen when the UK still has a veto right within the EU. For this and other reasons, a transition period after Brexit day was defined to allow those negotiations. The transition period started on 1 February 2020, in accordance with the withdrawal agreement. The transition period is scheduled to end on 31 December 2020, a deadline which could have been extended for two years, if requested by 30 June 2020. The British government declared that it would not apply for any such extension, and did not do so. In addition, it declared that the only kind of trade deal the UK is interested is in, if any, is a Canadian-style trade deal. \c\cThe United Kingdom will leave the European Single Market and European Union Customs Union on 1 January 2021. A trade deal would facilitate EU-UK trade, which accounts for 49% of international UK trade. A Canadian-style trade deal would offer the UK reduction on most of custom tariffs between the EU and the UK, but without eliminating VAT, customs and phytosanitary checks. The arrangements for its dominant financial services sector are of particular importance to the UK.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of December 9, 2020, 415,200 cases have been confirmed, causing 10,213 confirmed deaths. As of December 4, 197,750 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. The state defines recovery as "still alive 30 days after onset of illness".
Bhutan has diplomatic relations with 53 states and the European Union. \c\cIn 1971, sponsored by India, Bhutan began to develop its foreign relations by joining the United Nations, though it has no diplomatic relations with any of the permanent members on the UN Security Council. In 1981, Bhutan joined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, followed by the World Health Organization and UNESCO in 1982. It is also an active member of SAARC. Bhutan is currently a member of 45 international organizations. \c\cUnder Article 20 of the Constitution of Bhutan enacted in 2008, Bhutans foreign relations fall under the purview of the Druk Gyalpo on the advice of the Executive, namely the Prime Minister and other Ministers of the Lhengye Zhungtshog including the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of December 2020, there have been more than 16,000,000 confirmed cases and 297,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S., the most cases and deaths of any country. As of December 9, the U.S. death rate had reached 874 per million people, the fourteenth-highest rate among nations. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Germany is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 27 January 2020, the first case in Germany was confirmed near Munich, Bavaria. By mid February, the arising cluster of cases had been fully contained. On 25 and 26 February, multiple cases related to the Italian outbreak were detected in Baden-Württemberg. A large cluster linked to a carnival event was formed in Heinsberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, with the first death reported on 9 March 2020. New clusters were introduced in other regions via Heinsberg as well as via people arriving from China, Iran and Italy, from where non-Germans could arrive by plane until 17–18 March. \c\cGerman disease and epidemic control is advised by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) according to a national pandemic plan. The outbreaks were first managed in a containment stage, which attempted to minimise the expansion of clusters. From 13 March, the pandemic has been managed in the protection stage as per the RKI plan, with German states mandating school and kindergarten closures, postponing academic semesters and prohibiting visits to nursing homes to protect the elderly. Two days later, borders to Austria, Denmark, France, Luxembourg and Switzerland were closed. \c\cBy 22 March, curfews were imposed in six German states while other states prohibited physical contact with more than one person from outside ones household. \c\cOn 15 April, Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of "fragile intermediate success" that had been achieved in the fight against the pandemic. Gradually, and not always synchronous due to the federal system, the German states and the federal level eased restrictions and warnings, including on foreign travel. Substantial local outbreaks in meat processing plants drew public attention beyond the epidemiological context to poor working conditions. By late August, infection numbers had returned to the levels of April, and a possible second wave of the pandemic was under debate. By mid October, it was believed by experts to be inevitable. A partial lockdown – in which physical distancing rules were tightened while schools and kindergartens would remain open – was imposed on 2 November, and extended twice – eventually, on 2 December, until 10 January. On 13 December this was toughened to a hard lockdown, to take effect from 15 December, with relaxations of the gathering rules over Christmas. \c\cAs of 13 December 2020, the RKI has officially reported 1,320,716 cases, 21,787 deaths, and approximately 967,900 recoveries. The countrys low fatality rate, compared to fatality rates in Italy and Spain, has generated a discussion and explanations that cite the countrys higher number of tests performed, higher number of available intensive care beds with respiratory support and higher proportion of positive cases among younger people.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of December 2020, there have been more than 16,400,000 confirmed cases and 300,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S., the most cases and deaths of any country.

On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the arrests of 13 suspects accused of plotting to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Governor of Michigan, and otherwise violently overthrow the state government. The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court.
Terrorism in Australia deals with terrorist acts in Australia as well as steps taken by Australian governments to counter the threat of terrorism. In 2004 the Australian government has identified transnational terrorism as also a threat to Australia and to Australian citizens overseas. Australia has experienced acts of modern terrorism since the 1960s, while the federal parliament, since the 1970s, has enacted legislation seeking to target terrorism. \c\cTerrorism is defined as "an action or threat of action where the action causes certain defined forms of harm or interference and the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of advancing a political, religious and ideological or group cause".
Efforts to change government policies on euthanasia of humans in the 20th and 21st centuries have met limited success in Western countries. Human euthanasia policies have also been developed by a variety of NGOs, most notably medical associations and advocacy organizations. As of March 2018, active human euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands,  Belgium, Colombia, Luxembourg, Western Australia and Canada. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, Germany, the Australian state of Victoria and in the U.S. states of Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Hawaii, Vermont, Maine, New Jersey, California, and in the District of Columbia.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reached Northern Ireland on 27 February 2020. According to the Department of Health, 1,183  people have died after testing positive for coronavirus. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency reports 1,594 people have died (see Statistics). (covid fatality rate 1 in 38). Northern Ireland has the lowest recorded coronavirus death rate in the United Kingdom and now a higher rate than the Republic of Ireland. As of 11 December 2020, NISRA recorded 1,567 registered deaths due to Covid-19 which is now at a higher rate per capita than the Republic of Ireland. It is also carrying out more tests per capita than the other countries of the United Kingdom. According to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, the vast majority of deaths linked to COVID-19 were among individuals over the age of 75 years old and almost half were in nursing care homes. \c\cHealth care in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each having their own systems of publicly funded healthcare, funded by devolved block grants via the Barnett formula and accountable to separate governments and parliaments, together with smaller private sector and voluntary provision. As a result of each country having different policies and priorities, a variety of differences now exist between these systems. \c\cAs in the rest of the UK, all "non-essential" travel and contact with people outside ones home (including family and partners) was restricted for the whole population, and almost all businesses, venues, facilities, amenities and places of worship are shut. Major events such as Saint Patricks Day were cancelled. A lengthy lockdown was forecast to severely damage the economy and lead to a large rise in unemployment. \c\cThe health service worked to raise hospital capacity. In mid-April, modeling by the Department of Health indicated that the health service in Northern Ireland could cope with the expected peak in cases. On 21 April, Northern Irelands chief scientific advisor said the curve of new cases had flattened, and evidence had suggested that Northern Ireland had passed the peak of its outbreak, however, restrictions were introduced again in September 2020 following a second uptick in cases.
On December 20, 2020, an off-duty police officer Jonel Nuezca shot two unarmed neighbors following the argument over the boga in Paniqui, Tarlac. The killings sparked condemnation nationwide.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Antarctica is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). \c\cDue to its remoteness, Antarctica was the last continent to have confirmed cases of COVID-19 and was one of the last regions of the world affected directly by the pandemic. The first cases were reported in December 2020, almost a year after the first cases of COVID-19 were detected. Even though no cases reported for months, human activity in Antarctica was indirectly impacted.
Sudan–United States relations are the bilateral relations between Sudan and the United States. The United States government has been critical of Sudans human rights record and has dispatched a strong UN Peacekeeping force to Darfur.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Canada was announced on January 25, 2020, involving a traveler who had recently returned to Toronto from travel in China, including Wuhan.  As of November 10, 2020, Ontario has the second-largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among Canadas provinces and territories, behind only Quebec. \c\cWith increasing transmission province-wide, a state of emergency was declared by Premier Doug Ford on March 17, 2020, including the gradual implementation of restrictions on gatherings and commerce. On April 3, the province released modelling projecting that over the full course of the pandemic with no mitigation measures 100,000 deaths would have occurred, and with the then-current measures 3,000 to 15,000 deaths would occur. Projections for test-confirmed cases by April 30 were 12,500 (best case scenario), 80,000 (expected case scenario), and 300,000 (worst-case scenario). \c\cFrom late spring to early summer, the majority of the deaths were residents of long-term care homes. In late April, one out of five of all long-term care homes in Ontario had an outbreak and 70% to 80% of all COVID-19 deaths had been in retirement and long-term care homes. Following medical assistance and observation by the Canadian Armed Forces, the military released a report detailing "a number of medical, professional and technical issues" amongst for-profit long-term-care homes including neglect and lack of equipment and allegations of elder abuse. \c\cFrom May through August, the province instituted a three-stage plan to lift economic restrictions, subject to the employment of social distancing and other guidelines, and continued restrictions on the sizes of gatherings. A plan was implemented for the return-to-class of public schools, involving more than 2 million children. \c\cIn early-September, the province showed a significant increase in new cases, along with similar spikes in provinces across the country. Throughout the month of October, Ontario began to reintroduce some restrictions, with a focus on controlling spikes in the hotspots of Toronto, Peel Region, York Region and Ottawa. The province later rolled back its reopening in hotspot regions with temporary measures in a modified Stage 2 of the previous economic reopening system. In early November, the province unveiled a new five-tiered colour-coded level system, abandoning its previous reopening stage system. A response framework was created initially in contradiction to the metrics suggested to political officials by Public Health Ontario and later amended by the province to lower thresholds in each category. From late November to mid-December, the province began placing regions in rolling lockdowns, culminating in a province-wide lockdown beginning Christmas Eve. \c\cFollowing Health Canadas approval of the Tozinameran COVID-19 vaccine developed by BioNTech/Pfizer, wide-spread plans for vaccinations began on the week of December 14.
Israeli-Moroccan relations are the official relations between the State of Israel and the Kingdom of Morocco. \c\cWhile Morocco did not recognize Israel as a state, the relationship between the two was secretly maintained after the establishment of Israel in 1948. For many years, Hassan II had facilitated the secret relationship with Israel, and it was considered as instrumental in stabilizing Morocco and beating possible anti-royal threats within the country. The former secret relationship continues to play an important role in growing Israeli–Moroccan ties, despite the lack of formal relations. The Israeli passport is accepted for entry into Morocco with a visa granted on arrival. On 10 December 2020, Israel and Morocco agreed to establish diplomatic relations, becoming the sixth Arab league member to recognise Israel and the fourth in the space of four months, along with Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Sudan.
Legislative elections will be held in Israel to elect the members of the 24th Knesset on 23 March 2021. According to the coalition agreement signed between Likud and Blue and White in 2020, elections should be held 36 months after the swearing-in of the 35th government, making 23 May 2023 the last possible election date. However, if the 2020 state budget is not passed by 23 December, elections could be held as early as 23 March 2021. On 2 December 2020, the Knesset passed the preliminary reading of a bill to dissolve the current government by a vote of 61–54. On 21 December 2020, the Knesset failed to pass a bill to avoid dispersal, triggering fresh elections, that will be held on 23 March 2021, by a vote of 47-49.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Malaysia in late January 2020, when it was detected on travellers from China arriving in Johor via Singapore on 25 January, following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. Reported cases remained relatively low at first and were largely confined to imported cases, until localised clusters began to emerge in March; the largest cluster at that time was linked to a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering held in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur in late February and early March, leading to massive spikes in local cases and an exportation of cases to neighbouring countries. Within a few weeks, Malaysia had recorded the largest cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in Southeast Asia, breaching the 2,000 active cases mark by the end of March, from fewer than 30 cases at the beginning of the month. By 16 March, presence of the virus was reported in every state and federal territory in the country. \c\cThe medical response to the outbreak is overseen by Director-General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah under the Health Ministry of two successive governments. Preparations to stockpile equipment, detect and monitor cases, and treat COVID-19 patients were reported to have been initiated as early as 6 January 2020, following a World Health Organization (WHO) report on a late-December 2019 outbreak of "pneumonia of unknown cause" in the city of Wuhan, Hubei. As jumps in cases began to occur in early March and the Yang di-Pertuan Agong expressed great concern over the escalation of the outbreak, measures to combat the outbreak were later announced by the Prime Minister of Malaysia via live nationwide telecast on 13 March 2020. By 16 March, a nationwide "Movement Control Order" (MCO), intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing, was announced to be in effect between 18 and 31 March. The Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC) also published a federal gazette on 18 March 2020 that restricts individuals from travelling to other states that have been declared as coronavirus-affected areas. On 25 March, the MCO was extended by an addition two weeks, until 14 April, as the rate of new cases per day remained consistently high. The MCO was further announced to be extended until 28 April on 10 April, and to 12 May on 23 April. A gradual easing of restrictions was implemented, first phase after the lockdown is the "Conditional Movement Control Order" (CMCO) on 1 May, which allows most businesses to open on 4 May, followed by a "Recovery Movement Control Order" (RMCO) as the second phase from 10 June. Originally slated to expire on 31 August, the RMCO has been further extended to 31 December 2020, with selected sectors remaining closed and strict travel restrictions from multiple countries remaining in effect due to continued detection of imported cases. With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia as second wave (or third wave according to Ministry of Health), CMCO was reinstated for almost all states from November 9 to December 6, and Sabah was planning to go to the full lockdown mode (CMCO is reinstated instead). However, on 21 November and 6 December 2020, CMCO was terminated for most states except Sabah, Kuala Lumpur, most of Selangor, and part of Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Kelantan and Perak, which extended their CMCO until 20 December 2020. \c\cInitially reporting the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia in March and early-April, daily active cases in Malaysia have declined steadily from a peak of 2,596 in early April to a fluctuation of less than 250 cases by late June. The countrys case count has since been eclipsed by other Southeast Asian countries: the Philippines (on 14 April), Indonesia (on 15 April), and Myanmar (on 28 September). Periodic case spikes from subsequent clusters within local communities, immigrant enclaves, immigration detention centres, workers dormitories, prisons, and health facilities continue to be reported since the initial outbreak. The most serious outbreak since mid-2020 originating from prison populations in Sabah in September 2020, exacerbated by failures to impose adequate restrictions in time. The subsequent wave, significantly more widespread than earlier, elevated the severity of the countrys outbreak above those in other Southeast Asian countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and East Timor. At over 80,000 confirmed cases, over 10,000 active cases, and over 400 deaths, the country ranks fourth in the number of cases and deaths in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 18,000,000 confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 319,000 deaths, the most of any country and the thirteenth-highest on a per capita basis. COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind only heart disease and cancer. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and president Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. Meanwhile, Trump downplayed the threat posed by the virus and claimed the outbreak was under control. \c\cThe first known American deaths occurred in February. On March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak. On March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency. In mid-March, the Trump administration started to purchase large quantities of medical equipment, and in late March, it invoked the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories. By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, and by November in all inhabited U.S. territories. A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states. \c\cState and local responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and the closure of schools. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas.
The first case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed in New York City in March 2020 by a woman who had recently traveled to New York City from Iran, a country already seriously affected by the pandemic at the time. Nearly a month later, the metropolitan area was the worst-affected area in the country. By April, the city had more confirmed coronavirus cases than China, the U.K., or Iran, and by May, had more cases than any country other than the United States. \c\cOn March 20, the governors office issued an executive order closing down non-essential businesses. The citys public transportation system remained open but experienced crowding due to reduced transit service and an increase of homeless persons seeking shelter on the subway. \c\cBy April, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers were out of work with lost tax revenues estimated to run into the billions. Low income jobs in the retail, transportation and restaurant sectors are especially affected. The drop in income, sales tax and tourism revenues including hotel tax revenue may cost the city up to $10 billion. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said the citys unemployment system collapsed following a surge in claims and it will require federal assistance to maintain basic services. \c\cThe ongoing pandemic is the deadliest disaster by death toll in the history of New York City.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. As of December 12, 2020, there have been approximately  448,800 confirmed cases, over 362,200 recoveries and over 13,200 deaths in the country. The Government of Canada has released modelling anticipating 11,000–22,000 deaths over the course of the pandemic, assuming "stronger epidemic control". \c\cMost of those cases are in Canadas two most populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec. Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canadas provinces and territories, with Nunavut reporting its first confirmed case on November 6. Until March, all cases were linked to recent travel to a country with a substantial number of cases. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5. In mid March, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canadas provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented school and daycare closures, prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses, restrictions on entry, and mandatory self-isolation for travellers. Canada severely restricted its border access, barring travellers from all countries with some exceptions. The federal Minister of Health invoked the Quarantine Act for the first time in its legislative history, legally requiring all travellers (excluding essential workers) returning to the country to self-isolate for 14 days. \c\cBy mid to late summer, the country saw a steady decline in active cases. Beginning late summer and through autumn, the country saw a resurgence of cases in most provinces and territories. Prime Minister Trudeau declared that Canada was experiencing a second wave of the virus. New restrictions and reactions from provincial governments were put in place once again as cases increased, including variations of regional lockdowns. In late November there was a disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble, a travel-restricted area of the country set up amongst New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia & Newfoundland and Labrador. The federal government passed legislation to approve further modified economic aid for businesses and individuals. Following Health Canadas approval of the Tozinameran COVID-19 vaccine developed by BioNTech/Pfizer, and later the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna, vaccinations began nation-wide December 14.
The Metekel massacre was a massacre during the 2019–2020 Metekel conflict that took place in the night of 22–23 December 2020, in Bikuji kebele, Metekel Zone, Benishangul-Gumuz Region, Ethiopia. Houses were burned. As of 23 December 2020, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission counted 100 deaths.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 18,600,000 confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 329,000 deaths, the most of any country and the thirteenth-highest on a per capita basis. COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind only heart disease and cancer. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.

On December 25, 2020, a car bomb detonated in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, injuring at least three people and damaging dozens of buildings. The explosion took place on 2nd Avenue between Church Street and Commerce Street at 6:29 a.m local time (CST). Officials have characterized the explosion as an "intentional act," with reports of potentially multiple explosive devices being investigated. The explosion was felt "miles" away from the blast site. The Nashville Fire Department evacuated the downtown riverfront following the bombing. Witnesses reported hearing "gunshots early in the morning and a message coming from an RV parked in the street warning anyone in the area to evacuate." The Federal Bureau of Investigation has taken over the investigation into the bombing.

The COVID-19 pandemic reached the Republic of Ireland on 29 February 2020, and within three weeks, cases had been confirmed in all counties. The pandemic affected many aspects of society. On 12 March, the government shut all schools, colleges, childcare facilities and cultural institutions, and advised cancelling large gatherings. St Patricks Day festivities were called off, and the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, addressed the nation that night. On 24 March, almost all businesses, venues, facilities and amenities were shut; but gatherings of up to four were allowed. Three days later on 27 March, the government imposed a stay-at-home order, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside ones home (including family and partners). The elderly and those with certain health conditions were told to cocoon. People were made to keep apart in public. The Garda Síochána were given power to enforce the measures, which were repeatedly extended until 18 May. \c\cThe lockdown caused a severe recession and an unprecedented rise in unemployment and caused major damage in all sectors. A COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and a Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme were set up. The Leaving Certificate, Junior Certificate and all Irish language summer courses in the Gaeltacht were cancelled. The All-Ireland Senior Football and Senior Hurling championships were postponed indefinitely, the National Football League left uncompleted. The Dublin Horse Show was cancelled for the first time since 1940. Other yearly events cancelled included the Tidy Towns competition (the first time in its 62-year history), the Rose of Tralee (61 years), the National Ploughing Championships, the Ballinasloe Horse Fair and Dublin Pride. \c\cThe Health Service Executive (HSE) launched a recruitment campaign, asking both healthcare and non-healthcare professionals to "be on call for Ireland". The previous government of the 32nd Dáil remained in post during the initial several months of the pandemic until its successor was appointed on 27 June. Dáil Éireann sat with fewer members and moved from its traditional home at Leinster House to the Convention Centre to facilitate social distancing requirements. The Oireachtas passed an emergency act giving the state power to detain people, restrict travel and keep people in their homes to control the viruss spread. Further emergency legislation passed the following week. \c\cBy mid-April, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported that the growth rate of the pandemic had been driven "as low as it needs to be", that the curve had flattened and that there would be no peak coming. Daily cases and deaths slowly declined in June and July, however from August, the reproductive rate of the virus began to increase, causing a significant rise in confirmed cases mainly in meat processing plants, which resulted in a three-week regional lockdown for three counties. In October 2020, lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following a rapid surge in confirmed cases and the introduction of a second wave of COVID-19 in Ireland. The second lockdown resulted in Irelands 14-day incidence rate to be the lowest in the European Union, while restrictions eased in early December. A third wave of COVID-19 arrived in Ireland after restrictions eased. The government acted swiftly and on 24 December (Christmas Eve), lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following another surge in confirmed cases in Ireland. \c\cBy 25 December, the Department of Health had confirmed 84,098 cases and 2,194 deaths. \c\cMore than 90% of those who have died were aged over 65, and most also had underlying illnesses or lived in care homes.
On December 25, 2020, a recreational vehicle (RV) exploded in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, United States, injuring at least three people and damaging dozens of buildings. The explosion, which was deemed to be deliberate, took place at 166 Second Avenue North between Church Street and Commerce Street at 6:30 am. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots, and loudspeakers on the vehicle warned people to evacuate before the detonation. The explosion was felt miles away from the blast site. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is leading the investigation.

The War in Darfur, also nicknamed the Land Cruiser War, is a major armed conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan that began in February 2003 when the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel groups began fighting the government of Sudan, which they accused of oppressing Darfurs non-Arab population. The government responded to attacks by carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Darfurs non-Arabs. This resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the indictment of Sudans president, Omar al-Bashir, for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. \c\cOne side of the conflict is mainly composed of the Sudanese military, police and the Janjaweed, a Sudanese militia group whose members are mostly recruited among Arabized indigenous Africans and a small number of Bedouin of the northern Rizeigat; the majority of other Arab groups in Darfur remained uninvolved. \c\cThe other side is made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit ethnic groups. The African Union and the United Nations also have a joint peacekeeping mission in the region, named UNAMID. Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supported the Janjaweed, evidence supports claims that it provided financial assistance and weapons and coordinated joint attacks, many against civilians. Estimates of the number of human casualties range up to several hundred thousand dead, from either combat or starvation and disease. Mass displacements and coercive migrations forced millions into refugee camps or across the border, creating a humanitarian crisis. Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell described the situation as a genocide or acts of genocide. \c\cThe Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue peace. The JEM has the most to gain from the talks and could see semi-autonomy much like South Sudan. However, talks were disrupted by accusations that the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the Tolu agreement. The JEM, the largest rebel group in Darfur, vowed to boycott negotiations. \c\cThe August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, signed by military and civilian representatives during the Sudanese Revolution, requires that a peace process leading to a peace agreement be made in Darfur and other regions of armed conflict in Sudan within the first six months of the 39-month transition period to democratic civilian government. \c\cA comprehensive peace agreement was signed on 31 August 2020 between the Sudanese authorities and several rebel factions to end armed hostilities.
On December 25, 2020, a recreational vehicle (RV) exploded in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, United States, injuring three people and damaging dozens of buildings. Human remains were also found at the explosion site. The explosion, which was deemed to be deliberate, took place at 166 Second Avenue North between Church Street and Commerce Street at 6:30 am, adjacent to an AT&T network hub, resulting in days-long communication service outages. \c\cWitnesses reported hearing gunshots, and loudspeakers on the vehicle warning people to evacuate before the detonation. The explosion was felt miles away from the blast site. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is leading the investigation, and has identified a "person of interest", whose house has been searched. Authorities said the following day that the attack was likely a suicide bombing.
Operation Barkhane is an ongoing anti-insurgent operation started on August 1, 2014 which is led by the French military against Islamist groups in Africas Sahel region. It consists of a roughly 5,000-strong French force, which is permanently headquartered in N’Djamena, the capital of Chad. The operation is lead in cooperation with five countries, all former French colonies, that span the Sahel: Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. These countries are collectively referred to as the "G5 Sahel". \c\cThe operation is named after a crescent-shaped dune in the Sahara desert. \c\cThe French military initially intervened in Mali in early 2013 as part of Operation Serval which successfully regained the northern half of the country from Islamist groups. Operation Barkhane is intended to act as a follow up to this success and has expanded the French militarys operations over a vast area of the Sahel region. The operation has the stated aim of helping these countries governments to maintain control of their territory while also preventing the region from becoming a safe haven for Islamist terrorist groups planning to attack France and Europe.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Finland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 29 January 2020, the first case in Finland was confirmed, when a Chinese tourist visiting Ivalo from Wuhan tested positive for the virus.
The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, code-named Operation Iron Fist (Azerbaijani: Dəmir Yumruq əməliyyatı) by Azerbaijan, was an armed conflict between Azerbaijan, supported by Turkey, and the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh together with Armenia, in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding territories. It was the latest escalation of an unresolved conflict over the region, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but partially governed by Artsakh, a breakaway state with an Armenian ethnic majority. \c\cClashes began on the morning of 27 September 2020 along the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact, which had been established in the aftermath of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988–1994). In response, Armenia and Artsakh introduced martial law and total mobilization, while Azerbaijan introduced martial law, a curfew and partial mobilization. Turkey provided military support to Azerbaijan, although the extent of this support has been disputed. Turkeys involvement is thought to have been an attempt to extend its sphere of influence, both by increasing the standing of Azerbaijan in the conflict and by marginalizing Russias influence over the region. \c\cInternational analysts believe that fighting likely began with an Azerbaijani offensive, with the primary goal of reclaiming the less mountainous districts of southern Nagorno-Karabakh, which were easier to take than the regions well-fortified interior. The war was marked by the deployment of drones, sensors, long-range heavy artillery and missile strikes, as well as by state propaganda and the use of official social media accounts in online information warfare. Total casualties on both sides may be in the low thousands. Numerous countries and the United Nations strongly condemned the fighting and called on both sides to de-escalate tensions and resume meaningful negotiations without delay. Three ceasefires brokered by Russia, France, and the United States failed to stop the fighting. \c\cFollowing the capture of Shusha, the second-largest settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, ending all hostilities in the area from 00:00, 10 November 2020 Moscow Time. The President of Artsakh, Arayik Harutyunyan, also agreed to end the hostilities. Under the agreement, the warring sides will keep control of their currently held areas within Nagorno-Karabakh, while Armenia will return the surrounding territories it occupied in 1994 to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan will also gain land access to its Nakhchivan exclave bordering Turkey and Iran. Approximately 2,000 Russian soldiers will be deployed as peacekeeping forces along the Lachin corridor between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh for a mandate of at least five years. \c\cAccording to the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, the ceasefire was breached on 26 November, in the village of Sor, and reported that three Azerbaijani servicemen were killed and two were wounded in an Armenian attack. Also, according to the Azerbaijani authorities, on 8 December, one Azerbaijani serviceman was killed and an Azercell employee was seriously injured during the installation of communication facilities and transmission equipment near Hadrut. \c\cThe first major breach of the ceasefire that was confirmed by the Russian peacekeeping forces in the region occurred on 11 December, near Hadrut. Khtsaberd (Çaylaqqala), Hin Tagher (Köhnə Tağlar) villages, as well as the Katarovank monastery had become an Artsakh holdout in the Hadrut Province during the war. Clashes erupted around the Armenian holdout pocket despite the ceasefire agreement, and it has been reported that the Azerbaijani forces seized control of Hin Tagher on 12 December, with some clashes continuing in the area. Later, Artsakh authorities confirmed that six of their servicemen had been injured. Both sides accused each other of reigniting the conflict. The Russian peacekeeping forces requested both sides to respect the ceasefire. On 13 December, the Russian peacekeeping contingent took control of Hin Tagher. However, the next day, the Russian Ministry of Defence released a map showing both villages outside of the borders of the peacekeeping mission, and both came under Azerbaijans control.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Samoa is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Samoa on 18 November 2020. As of 28 November 2020, there were 2 cases of COVID-19 in Samoa, both in Apia.
The COVID-19 pandemic reached the Republic of Ireland on 29 February 2020, within three weeks, cases had been confirmed in all counties. The pandemic affected many aspects of society. On 12 March, the government shut all schools, colleges, childcare facilities and cultural institutions, they advised cancelling large gatherings. St Patricks Day festivities were called off, and the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, addressed the nation that night. On 24 March, almost all businesses, venues, facilities and amenities were shut; but gatherings of up to four people were allowed. Three days later on 27 March, the government imposed a stay-at-home order, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside ones home (including family and partners). The elderly and those with certain health conditions were told to cocoon. People were made keep apart in public. The Garda Síochána were given power to enforce the measures, which were repeatedly extended until 18 May. \c\cThe lockdown caused a severe recession,an unprecedented rise in unemployment and caused major damage to all sectors. A COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and a Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme were set up. The Leaving Certificate, Junior Certificate and all Irish language summer courses in the Gaeltacht were cancelled. The All-Ireland Senior Football and Senior Hurling championships were postponed indefinitely, the National Football League was left uncompleted. The Dublin Horse Show was cancelled for the first time since 1940, other yearly events cancelled included the Tidy Towns competition (for the first time in its 62-year history), the Rose of Tralee (61 years), the National Ploughing Championships, the Ballinasloe Horse Fair and Dublin Pride. \c\cThe Health Service Executive (HSE) launched a recruitment campaign, asking both healthcare and non-healthcare professionals to "be on call for Ireland". The previous government of the 32nd Dáil remained in post during the initial several months of the pandemic until its successor was appointed on 27 June. Dáil Éireann sat with fewer members and moved from its traditional home at Leinster House to the Convention Centre to facilitate social distancing requirements. The Oireachtas passed an emergency act giving the state power to detain people, restrict travel and keep people in their homes to control the viruss spread. Further emergency legislation passed the following week. \c\cBy mid-April, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported that the growth rate of the pandemic had been driven "as low as it needs to be", that the curve had flattened and that there would be no peak coming. Daily cases and deaths slowly declined in June and July, however from August, the reproductive rate of the virus began to increase, causing a significant rise in confirmed cases mainly in meat processing plants, which resulted in a three-week regional lockdown for three counties. In October 2020, lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following a rapid surge in confirmed cases and the introduction of a second wave of COVID-19 in Ireland. The second lockdown resulted in Irelands 14-day incidence rate to be the lowest in the European Union, while restrictions eased in early December. A third wave of COVID-19 arrived in Ireland after restrictions eased. The government acted swiftly and on 24 December (Christmas Eve), lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following another surge in confirmed cases in Ireland. \c\cBy 29 December, the Department of Health had confirmed 88,439 cases and 2,213 deaths. \c\cMore than 90% of those who have died were aged over 65, and most also had underlying illnesses or lived in care homes.
The first case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. state of California was confirmed on January 26, 2020. A state of emergency has been in place in the state since March 4, 2020. A mandatory statewide stay-at-home order was issued on March 19. As of December 7, 2020, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has reported 1,366,435 confirmed cases and 19,935 deaths in the state. \c\cAs of September 28, 2020, California has the highest number of confirmed cases in the United States, and the 25th-highest number of confirmed cases per capita. It has the fourth-highest count of deaths related to the virus, and the 25th-highest count of deaths per capita. \c\cOn August 9, 2020, Dr. Sonia Y. Angell resigned as the CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer. Governor Gavin Newsom indicated Angells resignation was related to data issues with the California Reportable Disease Information Exchange (CalREDIE) system that resulted in nearly 300,000 backlogged COVID-19 test results. On August 10, 2020, Sandra Shewry was appointed as acting director and Dr. Erica Pan, California state epidemiologist, was named acting state public health officer. \c\cOn October 26, 2020, San Francisco and Oakland phased out Googles sister company Verilys COVID-19 testing system following concerns about patients’ data privacy and complaints about its funding, which despite intention to boost testing in low-income Black and Latino neighborhoods was benefiting higher-income residents in other communities. \c\cAs of December 28, 2020, California has administered 300,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses, equivalent to 0.76% of the population.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus reached the country in late January 2020. As of 18 December 2020 there have been 2,004,219 confirmed cases and 67,075 deaths, the worlds eighth-highest death rate per hundred thousand population and the second highest number overall in Europe behind only  Italy. There were 82,778 deaths where the death certificate mentioned COVID-19 by 18 December (see Statistics). More than 90% of those dying had underlying illnesses or were over 60 years old. There has been variation in the outbreaks severity in each of the four nations. Health in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each having their own systems of publicly funded healthcare, separate governments and parliaments, together with smaller private sector and voluntary provision. \c\cOn 22 February, in Scotland, COVID-19 became a "notifiable disease", and a surveillance network involving 41 GP locations was established to submit samples of suspected patients, even if they had no travel history. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for England launched a public health information campaign to help slow the viruss spread, and began posting daily updates in early February. The HSC began testing for COVID-19 during February 2020, as of 19 February there were 35 completed tests all of which returned negative results. Also in February, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, introduced the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 for England, and hospitals set up drive-through screening. The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, outlined a four-pronged strategy, relevant to England, to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate. In Wales, the Chief Medical Officer, Frank Atherton, said that the Government would be taking "all appropriate measures" to reduce the risk of transmission. \c\cIn March, the UK governments imposed a stay-at-home order, dubbed "Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives", banning all non-essential travel and closing most gathering places. Those with symptoms, and their households, were told to self-isolate, while those with certain illnesses were told to shield themselves. People were told to keep apart in public. Police were empowered to enforce the measures, and the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave all four governments emergency powers not used since the Second World War. Chancellor Sunak forecast that lengthy restrictions would severely damage the UK economy, worsen mental health and suicide rates, and cause additional deaths due to isolation, delays and falling living standards. \c\cAll four national health services worked to raise hospital capacity and set up temporary critical care hospitals, including the NHS Nightingale Hospitals. By mid-April it was reported that social distancing had "flattened the curve" of the epidemic. In late April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the UK had passed the peak of its outbreak. Daily cases and deaths slowly declined in May and June, and continued at a relatively low level in July and August. The total number of excess deaths in the UK from the start of the outbreak to mid-June was just over 65,000. \c\cCases rose significantly from late August onwards (by a factor of 3.2 from 15 August to 15 September). From October onwards, varying levels of lockdown were imposed in England, including in many areas a complete ban on households mixing at Christmas, in tandem with the discovery of a variant of concern which was blamed by Hancock for the rise in cases in the South East and precipitated further suspensions of international travel from the UK. A similar system was introduced in Scotland. Circuit breaker lockdowns took place in Wales and Northern Ireland. In December, the UK became the first country to authorise and begin use of the tozinameran vaccine.

The effect of Brexit on Gibraltar concerns the status of Gibraltar after withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 after having voted to leave in the 2016 referendum and formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw in March 2017. Gibraltar is not part of the UK, but contrary to all other British Overseas Territories was a part of the European Union like the UK. It participated in the Brexit referendum and it ceased, by default, to be a part of the EU upon the UKs withdrawal. \c\cGibraltars position during the process of UK withdrawal from the European Union presents specific issues during the negotiations. Gibraltar voted strongly to remain in the European Union during the referendum, and its unique situation could lead to difficulties in Brexit negotiations due to the Spanish claim on Gibraltar, the large contribution of on-line gambling, offshore banking and duty-free shopping to the Gibraltar economy, and the strong likelihood that Gibraltar will cease to be a part of the single market.
Dolal Idd was a 23-year-old Somali-American man who was fatally wounded by Minneapolis police after an exchange of gunfire with officers on the evening on December 30, 2020, during a felony traffic stop in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The incident took place outside a Holiday gas station at the intersection of Cedar Avenue and East 36th Street in the citys Powderhorn Park neighborhood, one mile (1.6 km) from the location where George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020. The manner of Floyds death resulted in prolonged local unrest and worldwide protests. Idds death was the first killing by a Minneapolis police officer since Floyd.
A COVID‐19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against COVID-19. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, work to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus diseases SARS and MERS had established knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses, which accelerated development during early 2020 of varied technology platforms for a COVID‐19 vaccine. \c\cBy mid-December 2020, 57 vaccine candidates were in clinical research, including 40 in Phase I–II trials and 17 in Phase II–III trials.  In Phase III trials, several COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections. National regulatory authorities have approved six vaccines for public use: two RNA vaccines (tozinameran from Pfizer–BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna), two conventional inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV from Sinopharm and CoronaVac from Sinovac), and two viral vector vaccines (Gam-COVID-Vac from the Gamaleya Research Institute and AZD1222 from the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca). \c\cPfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca predicted a manufacturing capacity of 5.3 billion doses in 2021, which could be used to vaccinate about 3 billion people (as the vaccines require two doses for a protective effect against COVID-19). By December, more than 10 billion vaccine doses had been preordered by countries, with about half of the doses purchased by high-income countries comprising only 14% of the worlds population. Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk of complications such as the elderly and those at high risk of exposure and transmission such as healthcare workers.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 20,100,000 confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 347,000 deaths, the most of any country and the fourteenth-highest on a per capita basis. The US has nearly a quarter of the worlds cases and a fifth of all deaths. COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and president Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. Meanwhile, Trump downplayed the threat posed by the virus and claimed the outbreak was under control. \c\cThe first known American deaths occurred in February. On March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak. On March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency. In mid-March, the Trump administration started to purchase large quantities of medical equipment, and in late March, it invoked the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories. By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, and by November in all inhabited U.S. territories. A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states. \c\cState and local responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and the closure of schools. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas.
Starting in May 2020, demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd have been held in the city of Portland, Oregon, concurrent with protests in other cities in the United States and around the world. By July 2020, many of the protests, which had been held virtually every day since May 28, drew more than 1,000 participants. Protests continued into August, September, and October 2020, often drawing hundreds. \c\cThe majority of the protests in Portland have been peaceful, but many demonstrations have involved rioting, heated confrontations with law enforcement and counter-protestors, and use of tear gas and other weapons. There have been numerous instances of arson, looting, vandalism, and injuries during nighttime protests. One person was shot and killed in the aftermath of a clash between protesters and counter-protesters. \c\cIn early July, the federal government deployed law enforcement officers to Portland for the stated purpose of protecting federal property amid the unrest. The deployment was criticized for not clearly identifying officers and for seizing protesters not on or near federal property, including by Portlands mayor and most of the states congressional delegation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection service defended the practice on the grounds of protecting the officers' personal safety. Several lawsuits were filed by and on behalf of journalists and legal observers against local and federal law enforcement, and by the state against several federal agencies. \c\cProtests have continued in Portland in the aftermath of the 2020 United States presidential elections.
The Sinai insurgency is an ongoing insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, commenced by Islamist militants against the Egyptian security forces, which has included attacks on civilians. The insurgency began after the start of the Egyptian Crisis, which saw the overthrow of longtime Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian revolution of 2011. \c\cThe Sinai insurgency initially consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and proclaimed themselves Sinai Province, and a part of ISIL. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with the Sinai Province group and have blamed the porous border and ongoing civil war for the increase in sophisticated weapons available to the Islamist groups. \c\cThe Egyptian authorities have attempted to restore their presence in the Sinai through both political and military measures. Egypt launched two military operations, known as Operation Eagle in mid-2011 and then Operation Sinai in mid-2012. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup détat, which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred. \c\cThe fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share the same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services. Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. In November 2017, more than 300 Sufist worshippers were killed and over 100 injured in a terrorist attack on a mosque west of the city of Al-Arish. \c\cIn his first meeting with a Middle East nation since his confirmation as defense secretary, Mark Esper met with Egypts Minister of Defense Mohammad Zaki and pressed him to use counterinsurgency-style tactics in the effort in the Sinai Peninsula. His Deputy for the Middle East Mick Mulroy said that he spoke to Minister Zaki extensively about their efforts in the Sinai and that it was clear they shared the belief in the importance of a population-centric approach to the counter-terrorism effort, even if it takes longer to be successful. Mulroy said he saw evidence of this during his visit to the Sinai where he spoke to both senior and junior military leaders. The fight in the Sinai forms part of the classified Irregular Warfare Annex to the National Defense Strategy, which calls on the Department of Defense to use foreign internal defense principles, advise and assist tactics, and influence operations.

The 2020 Gjerdrum landslide was a quick clay landslide that occurred south of Ask, Gjerdrum, Norway in the early hours of 30 December 2020, spanning an area of 300 by 700 meters and destroying at least fourteen buildings, most of them houses and apartment buildings. As of 2 January 2021, three people have been confirmed killed by the landslide, while seven remain missing.
The Insurgency in the Maghreb refers to the Islamist insurgency in the Maghreb and Sahel regions of North Africa that followed on from the Algerian Civil War. The Algerian militant group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) allied itself with al-Qaeda to eventually become al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The Algerian and other Maghreb governments fighting the militants have worked with the United States and the United Kingdom since 2007, when Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara began. While the 2011 Arab Spring affected support for the insurgency, it also presented military opportunities for the jihadists. In 2012, AQIM and Islamist allies captured the northern half of Mali, until being fought back less than a year later following a French-led foreign intervention, which was succeeded by the Sahel-wide Operation Barkhane. In Libya, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has been able to control some limited territory in the ongoing civil war since 2014, amid allegations of local collaboration between the rival AQIM and ISIL.

On 3 January 2020, a United States drone strike near Baghdad International Airport targeted and killed Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani while purportedly on his way to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi in Baghdad. Soleimani was commander of the Quds Force, one of five branches of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Five Iraqi nationals and four other Iranian nationals were killed alongside Soleimani, including the deputy chairman of Iraqs Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and commander of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis – a person designated as a terrorist by the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). \c\cThe strike occurred during the 2019–20 Persian Gulf crisis, which began after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, reimposed sanctions, and accused Iranian elements of fomenting a campaign to harass U.S. forces in the region. On 27 December 2019, the K-1 Air Base in Iraq, which hosts Iraqi and U.S. personnel, was attacked, killing an American contractor. The U.S. responded by launching airstrikes across Iraq and Syria, reportedly killing 25 Kataib Hezbollah militiamen. Days later, Shia militiamen and their supporters retaliated by attacking the U.S. embassy in the Green Zone. \c\cU.S. officials justified the Soleimani strike claiming it was necessary to stop an "imminent attack", though later clarifying the legal justification of the action as being taken "in response to an escalating series of attacks...to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks...and to end Irans strategic escalation of attacks..." Some experts, including the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, considered the assassination as a likely violation of international law as well as U.S. domestic laws. Iran called the strike an act of "state terrorism". The Iraqi government said the attack undermined its national sovereignty and considered it a breach of its bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and an act of aggression against its officials. On 5 January 2020, the Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory while, on the same day, Iran took the fifth and last step of reducing commitments to the 2015 international nuclear deal. \c\cSoleimanis killing sharply escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Iranian leaders vowed revenge, while U.S. officials said they would preemptively attack any Iran-backed paramilitary groups in Iraq that they perceived as a threat. Many in the international community reacted with concern and issued statements or declarations urging restraint and diplomacy. Five days after the airstrike, Iran launched a series of missile attacks on U.S. forces based in Iraq, the first direct engagement between Iran and the U.S. since the naval battle precipitating the Vincennes incident on 3 July 1988. Following the shootdown of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 amidst the escalation, no additional actions took place.
The first case of COVID-19 in the U.S. state of New York during the pandemic was confirmed on March 1, 2020, and the state quickly became an epicenter of the pandemic, with a record 12,274 new cases reported on April 4 and approximately 29,000 more deaths reported for the month of April than the same month in 2019. By April 10, New York had more confirmed cases than any other country besides its own, but since then the outbreak has been mostly controlled in the state. As of January 3, 2021, the state has reported 26 million tests, with 1,028,362 positive cases, and 30,648 deaths. \c\cNew York had the highest number of confirmed cases of any state from the start of U.S. outbreak until July 22, when it was first surpassed by California and later by Florida, Texas, and Illinois. Approximately half of the states cases have been in New York City, where nearly half the states population lives. \c\cDespite the high number of cases in March and April, by May 7, New York had reduced the rate of increase of new cases to less than 1 percent per day, and since June 6 to less than 0.25 percent per day. Unlike many other states, New York did not see a spike or "second wave" in the daily new case rate during the summer months.  On June 17, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York has the lowest infection rate in the United States. In late September, New York began to see an uptick in cases, with over 1,000 new cases reported in a single day for the first time since early June on September 26. \c\cAs of December 4, 2020, the state of New York has the fifth-highest number of confirmed cases in the United States, and the 38-highest number of confirmed cases per capita. It has the highest count of deaths related to the virus, and second-highest count per capita, behind New Jersey. \c\cGovernment response to the pandemic in New York began with a full lockdown from March 2020 to April 2020, followed by a four-phase reopening plan by region from April 2020 to July 2020. Additional modifications to the plan have been imposed since July as the state has learned more about the pandemic and due to political pressure. In October 2020, a micro-cluster strategy was announced which shuts down areas of the state to varying degrees by ZIP code when cases increase. \c\cAs of December 30, 2020, New York has administered 203,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses, equivalent to 1.04 percent of the population.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 20,700,000 confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 353,000 deaths, the most of any country and the fourteenth-highest on a per capita basis. The U.S. has nearly a quarter of the worlds cases and a fifth of all deaths. COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and president Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. Meanwhile, Trump downplayed the threat posed by the virus and claimed the outbreak was under control. \c\cThe first known American deaths occurred in February. On March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak. On March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency. In mid-March, the Trump administration started to purchase large quantities of medical equipment, and in late March, it invoked the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories. By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, and by November in all inhabited U.S. territories. A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states. \c\cState and local responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and the closure of schools. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas.
The Qatar diplomatic crisis was a diplomatic incident that began on 5 June 2017 when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and banned Qatar-registered planes and ships from utilising their airspace and sea routes along with Saudi Arabia blocking Qatar’s only land crossing. They were later joined by Jordan and were supported by the Maldives, Mauritania, Senegal, Djibouti, the Comoros, Yemen, and the Tobruk-based government in Libya. \c\cThe Saudi-led coalition cited Qatars alleged support for terrorism as the main reason for their actions, alleging that Qatar had violated a 2014 agreement with the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), of which Qatar is a member. Saudi Arabia and other countries have criticized Al Jazeera and Qatars relations with Iran. Qatar acknowledged that it had provided assistance to some Islamist groups (such as the Muslim Brotherhood), but denied aiding militant groups linked to al-Qaeda or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Qatar also claimed that it had assisted the United States in the War on Terror and the ongoing military intervention against ISIL. \c\cInitial supply disruptions were minimised by additional imports from Iran and Turkey, and Qatar did not agree to any of the Saudi-led coalitions demands.  The demands included reducing diplomatic relations with Iran, stopping military coordination with Turkey, and closing Al-Jazeera. \c\cOn 27 July 2017, Qatari foreign minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, told reporters that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were showing "stubbornness" to Qatar and had not taken any steps to solve the crisis. Al Thani added that the Security Council, the General Assembly and "all the United Nations mechanisms" could play a role in resolving the situation. On 24 August 2017, Qatar announced that it would restore full diplomatic relations with Iran. \c\cOn 4 January 2021, Qatar and Saudi Arabia agreed to resolution of the crisis brokered by Kuwait and United States. Saudi Arabia will reopen its border with Qatar and begin the process for reconciliation. An agreement and final communique signed on 5 January 2021 following a GCC summit at Al-Ula marks the resolution of the crisis, with precise details to be released later.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The 2020–2021 United States election protests are an ongoing series of protests across multiple cities in the United States following the 2020 United States presidential election between incumbent President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The election was held on November 3, 2020, but a high number of mail-in ballots delayed results in swing states. Various media outlets projected Joe Biden the winner after provisional vote counts gave him over 270 electoral votes on November 7. \c\cThe Trump campaign has challenged the legitimacy of the election results by filing lawsuits, demanding recounts, alleging that mail voting is responsible for widespread electoral fraud, and claiming  without evidence that election officials had conspired to help Democrats. Although Trump initially refused to commit to a transfer of power, he acknowledged on November 26 that he must leave office if the Electoral College votes for Biden.
The 2020–2021 United States election protests are an ongoing series of protests across multiple cities in the United States following the 2020 United States presidential election between incumbent President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The election was held on November 3, 2020. Biden won the election, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3%) to Trumps 74.2 million (46.9%) and winning the Electoral College by 306 to 232. Bidens victory became clear on November 7, after the ballots (including mail-in ballots) had been tabulated. The Electoral College voted on December 14, in accordance with the law, formalizing Bidens victory. \c\cBefore and after the election, Trump and his Trump campaign and allies baselessly challenged the legitimacy of the election and falsely claimed widespread electoral fraud. Trump and his allies filed dozens of legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges from across the political spectrum, in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself. The courts found that Trumps claims had no factual or legal basis. Trumps unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials. \c\cPro-Trump groups, with the backing of Trump himself, have engaged in multiple street protests and demonstrations decrying the election results and echoing Trumps false claim of election fraud. These protests have taken place in Washington, D.C., state capitals, and other locations nationwide; they have included pro-Trump Proud Boys protestors. In November and December 2020, there were nighttime clashes and street scuffles in Washington between "Proud Boys" protesters and other Trump supporters who refused to accept the presidents defeat, and antifa (left-wing antifascist) counterprotesters. \c\cOn January 6—the day when Congress formally counts the electoral votes—Trump supporters gathered for the "Save America" rally where attendees heard speeches from Trump and Rudy Giuliani. Before the speeches were over, a mob of protestors marched on Congress and stormed the building. Congress was in session at the time, certifying the Electoral College vote count. Several buildings in the U.S. Capitol complex were evacuated, and protestors broke past security to enter the U.S. Capitol building, including National Statuary Hall. All buildings in the Capitol complex were subsequently locked down. There was reportedly an armed standoff at the doors to the House chambers, and one person was reported to have been shot within the Capitol building. At least two improvised explosive devices have been found. \c\cIn the aftermath of the storming of the US capitol, at least 36 House Democrats, called for Trumps immediate impeachment and removal by Congress. State-level officials including Maryland Lieutenant Governor Boyd Rutherford supported impeachment, and representatives called on Vice President Mike Pence to remove Trump via the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
On January 5, 2021, supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump gathered in Washington, D.C., to protest against the result of the 2020 presidential election and support Trumps demand for Vice President Mike Pence and Congress to reject President-elect Joe Bidens victory. \c\cOn the morning of January 6 (EST), protestors gathered for the "Save America" rally, a planned event on the Ellipse where attendees heard speeches from President Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Rudy Giuliani. The demonstration culminated in a riot, in which the United States Capitol Building was stormed and invaded by Trump supporters. The event occurred after numerous earlier attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn the election results had failed. \c\cDuring his speech Trump instructed his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol to attempt to ensure that the 2020 election was overturned. Subsequently a pro-Trump mob marched on Congress and eventually stormed the building. \c\cCongress was in session at the time, conducting the Electoral College vote count and debating after Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizonas fourth congressional district objected to the Electoral College count of Arizonas votes. Protestors broke past security to enter the Capitol, occupying the evacuated Senate chamber while guards drew handguns to prevent entry to the evacuated House floor. Several buildings in the U.S. Capitol complex were evacuated, and all buildings in the complex were subsequently locked down. \c\cAn armed standoff took place at the doors to the House chambers. A female intruder was shot by law enforcement inside the Capitol, later dying of her injuries. \c\cAt least one improvised explosive device was reported to have been found on Capitol grounds, and two others nearby at a building containing Republican National Committee offices and at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. \c\cIn the early afternoon of January 6, Trump denounced Pence as failing to "do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution", despite Pence having no constitutional power to reject Bidens victory. \c\cAt 4:22 p.m. EST, Trump urged his supporters on Twitter to "go home in peace" while telling the rioters that he "loved" them and reiterating his false allegations of election fraud. That evening, Twitter placed a twelve-hour lock on Trumps Twitter account and removed three of his tweets for violations of their civic integrity policy after he made posts openly condoning supporters who violently stormed Congress. \c\cThe riots and storming of the Capitol have been described as insurrection, sedition, and domestic terrorism. Some sources have labeled it as an attempted coup détat. The incident was the first time the Capitol had been overrun since the 1814 burning of Washington by the British during the War of 1812.

On January 6, 2021, the United States Congress convened to count ballots that were formally cast by the electoral college on December 14, 2020. This certification is considered the final pro forma step in the 2020 United States presidential election, in which Congress will confirm Joe Bidens victory over incumbent President Donald Trump. The Inauguration of Joe Biden is scheduled for January 20, 2021. \c\cThe counting of votes was interrupted by pro-Trump supporters breaching the building, leading to Vice President Mike Pence and other officials being evacuated.
The 2020–21 United States Senate special election in Georgia arose from the resignation of Republican Class III Senator Johnny Isakson, effective December 31, 2019. Governor Brian Kemp appointed Republican Kelly Loeffler to serve as Isaksons interim replacement, effective January 6, 2020, and she will hold the seat until a new senator is chosen in a special election. \c\cIn accordance with Georgia law, a primary election for the special election did not take place; all candidates, regardless of party, were placed on the same ballot (known as a blanket primary), and the election was held on November 3, 2020. Democrat Raphael Warnock received the most votes with 32.9%, and Loeffler came in second with 25.9%. As no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, the top two candidates advanced to a runoff election, which took place on January 5, 2021. The winner of the runoff will hold the Senate seat for the remainder of Isaksons term, which ends on January 3, 2023. \c\cThe regular Class II election for the Georgia U.S. Senate seat held by Republican David Perdue will also be decided in a January 5 runoff. Following the 2020 U.S. Senate elections, Republicans held 50 Senate seats and Democrats 48. If Democrats win both Georgia runoffs on January 5, they will gain control of the Senate, as the resultant 50–50 tie will be broken by Democratic Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. If they lose either of the races, Republicans will retain Senate control. The high political stakes have caused the races to attract significant attention nationwide. \c\cWarnock is projected to win the election. \c\c Many media outlets called the election for Warnock late on January 5, after Decision Desk HQ projected that he would win the election.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Malaysia in late January 2020, when it was detected on travellers from China arriving in Johor via Singapore on 25 January, following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. Reported cases remained relatively low at first and were largely confined to imported cases, until localised clusters began to emerge in March; the largest cluster at that time was linked to a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering held in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur in late February and early March, leading to massive spikes in local cases and an exportation of cases to neighbouring countries. Within a few weeks, Malaysia had recorded the largest cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in Southeast Asia, breaching the 2,000 active cases mark by the end of March, from fewer than 30 cases at the beginning of the month. By 16 March, presence of the virus was reported in every state and federal territory in the country. \c\cThe medical response to the outbreak is overseen by Director-General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah under the Health Ministry of two successive governments. Preparations to stockpile equipment, detect and monitor cases, and treat COVID-19 patients were reported to have been initiated as early as 6 January 2020, following a World Health Organization (WHO) report on a late-December 2019 outbreak of "pneumonia of unknown cause" in the city of Wuhan, Hubei. As jumps in cases began to occur in early March and the Yang di-Pertuan Agong expressed great concern over the escalation of the outbreak, measures to combat the outbreak were later announced by the Prime Minister of Malaysia via live nationwide telecast on 13 March 2020. By 16 March, a nationwide "Movement Control Order" (MCO), intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing, was announced to be in effect between 18 and 31 March. The Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC) also published a federal gazette on 18 March 2020 that restricts individuals from travelling to other states that have been declared as coronavirus-affected areas. On 25 March, the MCO was extended by an addition two weeks, until 14 April, as the rate of new cases per day remained consistently high. The MCO was further announced to be extended until 28 April on 10 April, and to 12 May on 23 April. A gradual easing of restrictions was implemented, first phase after the lockdown is the "Conditional Movement Control Order" (CMCO) on 1 May, which allows most businesses to open on 4 May, followed by a "Recovery Movement Control Order" (RMCO) as the second phase from 10 June. Originally slated to expire on 31 August, the RMCO has been further extended to 31 December 2020 (and has been further extended until 31 March 2021), with selected sectors remaining closed and strict travel restrictions from multiple countries remaining in effect due to continued detection of imported cases. The October Sabah state election resulted in a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia as second wave (or third wave according to Ministry of Health), and CMCO was reinstated for almost all states from November 9 to December 6, and Sabah was planning to go to the full lockdown mode; however, CMCO was reinstated instead. However, on 21 November, 6 December and 28 December 2020, CMCO was terminated for most states except Sabah, Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, and part of Johor, Negeri Sembilan and Penang, which extended their CMCO until 14 January 2021. On New Years Day of 2021, Senior Minister Dato Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the RMCO has been extended to 31 March 2021 as the daily cases are still high. \c\cInitially reporting the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia in March and early-April of 2020, daily active cases in Malaysia have declined steadily from a peak of 2,596 cases in early April to a fluctuation of less than 250 cases by late June. The countrys case count has since been eclipsed by other Southeast Asian countries: the Philippines (on 14 April), Indonesia (on 15 April), and Myanmar (on 28 September). Periodic case spikes from subsequent clusters within local communities, immigrant enclaves, immigration detention centres, workers dormitories, prisons, and health facilities continue to be reported since the initial outbreak. The most serious outbreak since mid-2020 originated from prison populations in Sabah in September 2020, exacerbated by failures to impose adequate restrictions in time. The subsequent wave, significantly more widespread than the earlier wave, elevated the severity of the countrys outbreak above those in other Southeast Asian countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and East Timor. At over 120,000 confirmed cases, over 22,000 active cases, and over 500 deaths, the country ranks fourth in the number of cases and deaths in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar.
The COVID-19 pandemic reached the Republic of Ireland on 29 February 2020, within three weeks, cases had been confirmed in all counties. The pandemic affected many aspects of society. On 12 March, the government shut all schools, colleges, childcare facilities and cultural institutions, they advised cancelling large gatherings. St Patricks Day festivities were called off, and the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, addressed the nation that night. On 24 March, almost all businesses, venues, facilities and amenities were shut; but gatherings of up to four people were allowed. Three days later on 27 March, the government imposed a stay-at-home order, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside ones home (including family and partners). The elderly and those with certain health conditions were told to cocoon. People were made keep apart in public. The Garda Síochána were given power to enforce the measures, which were repeatedly extended until 18 May. \c\cThe restrictions imposed caused a severe recession, an unprecedented rise in unemployment and caused major damage to all sectors. A COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and a Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme were set up. The Leaving Certificate, Junior Certificate and all Irish language summer courses in the Gaeltacht were cancelled. The All-Ireland Senior Football and Senior Hurling championships were postponed indefinitely, the National Football League was left uncompleted. The Dublin Horse Show was cancelled for the first time since 1940, other yearly events cancelled included the Tidy Towns competition (for the first time in its 62-year history), the Rose of Tralee (61 years), the National Ploughing Championships, the Ballinasloe Horse Fair and Dublin Pride. \c\cThe Health Service Executive (HSE) launched a recruitment campaign, asking both healthcare and non-healthcare professionals to "be on call for Ireland". The previous government of the 32nd Dáil remained in post during the initial several months of the pandemic until its successor was appointed on 27 June. Dáil Éireann sat with fewer members and moved from its traditional home at Leinster House to the Convention Centre to facilitate social distancing requirements. The Oireachtas passed an emergency act giving the state power to detain people, restrict travel and keep people in their homes to control the viruss spread. Further emergency legislation passed the following week. \c\cBy mid-April, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported that the growth rate of the pandemic had been driven "as low as it needs to be", that the curve had flattened and that there would be no peak coming. Daily cases and deaths slowly declined in June and July 2020. In August, a three-week regional lockdown was imposed in three counties following a significant rise in confirmed cases mainly in meat processing plants. In October 2020, lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following a rapid surge in confirmed cases and the introduction of a second wave of COVID-19 in Ireland. The second lockdown resulted in Irelands 14-day incidence rate to be the lowest in the European Union, while restrictions eased in early December. A third wave of COVID-19 arrived in Ireland after restrictions eased. The government acted swiftly and on 24 December (Christmas Eve), lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following another surge in confirmed cases in Ireland. On St Stephens Day, the first shipment of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the Republic of Ireland. Vaccinations began three days later on 29 December 2020. \c\cBy 5 January, the Department of Health had confirmed 113,322 cases and 2,282 deaths. More than 90% of those who have died were aged over 65, and most also had underlying illnesses or lived in care homes.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the U.S. state of Pennsylvania in March 2020. As of December 12, 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Health has confirmed 440,538 cases and 12,436 deaths in the state. \c\cAs of December 30, 2020, Pennsylvania has administered 96,045 COVID-19 vaccine doses, equivalent to 0.75% of the population.
On 3 January 2020, a United States drone strike near Baghdad International Airport targeted and killed Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani while purportedly on his way to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi in Baghdad. Soleimani was commander of the Quds Force, one of five branches of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Five Iraqi nationals and four other Iranian nationals were killed alongside Soleimani, including the deputy chairman of Iraqs Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and commander of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis – a person designated as a terrorist by the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). \c\cThe strike occurred during the 2019–20 Persian Gulf crisis, which began after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, reimposed sanctions, and accused Iranian elements of fomenting a campaign to harass U.S. forces in the region. On 27 December 2019, the K-1 Air Base in Iraq, which hosts Iraqi and U.S. personnel, was attacked, killing an American contractor. The U.S. responded by launching airstrikes across Iraq and Syria, reportedly killing 25 Kataib Hezbollah militiamen. Days later, Shia militiamen and their supporters retaliated by attacking the U.S. embassy in the Green Zone. \c\cU.S. officials justified the Soleimani strike claiming it was necessary to stop an "imminent attack", though later clarifying the legal justification of the action as being taken "in response to an escalating series of attacks...to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks...and to end Irans strategic escalation of attacks..." Some experts, including the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, considered the assassination as a likely violation of international law as well as U.S. domestic laws. Iran called the strike an act of "state terrorism". The Iraqi government said the attack undermined its national sovereignty and considered it a breach of its bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and an act of aggression against its officials. On 5 January 2020, the Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory while, on the same day, Iran took the fifth and last step of reducing commitments to the 2015 international nuclear deal. \c\cSoleimanis killing sharply escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Iranian leaders vowed revenge, while U.S. officials said they would preemptively attack any Iran-backed paramilitary groups in Iraq that they perceived as a threat. Many in the international community reacted with concern and issued statements or declarations urging restraint and diplomacy. Five days after the airstrike, Iran launched a series of missile attacks on U.S. forces based in Iraq, the first direct engagement between Iran and the U.S. since the naval battle precipitating the Vincennes incident on 3 July 1988. Following the shootdown of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 amidst the escalation, no additional actions took place.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 21,500,000 confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 365,000 deaths, the most of any country and the fourteenth-highest on a per capita basis. The U.S. has nearly a quarter of the worlds cases and a fifth of all deaths. COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and president Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. Meanwhile, Trump downplayed the threat posed by the virus and claimed the outbreak was under control. \c\cThe first known American deaths occurred in February. On March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak. On March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency. In mid-March, the Trump administration started to purchase large quantities of medical equipment, and in late March, it invoked the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories. By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, and by November in all inhabited U.S. territories. A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states. \c\cState and local responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and the closure of schools. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas.

From January 6–7, 2021, the United States Congress convened in a joint session to count ballots that were formally cast by the electoral college on December 14, 2020. The count is normally considered the final pro forma step in the 2020 United States presidential election, in which Congress confirmed Joe Bidens victory over incumbent President Donald Trump. Bidens inauguration is scheduled for January 20, 2021. \c\cThe counting of votes was interrupted by the storming of the U.S. Capitol. Pro-Trump supporters breached the Capitol building, leading to Vice President Mike Pence, members of the House of Representatives and Senate, and other officials being evacuated. The counting resumed later in the evening and into the following day.
The 2020–21 United States Senate special election in Georgia arose from the resignation of Republican Class III Senator Johnny Isakson, effective December 31, 2019. Governor Brian Kemp appointed Republican Kelly Loeffler to serve as Isaksons interim replacement, effective January 6, 2020, and she has held that seat since. \c\cIn accordance with Georgia law, a primary election for the special election did not take place; all candidates, regardless of party, were placed on the same ballot (known as a blanket primary), and the election was held on November 3, 2020. Democrat Raphael Warnock received the most votes with 32.9%, and Loeffler came in second with 25.9%. As no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, the top two candidates advanced to a runoff election, which took place on January 5. \c\cThe runoff election was held concurrently with the regular Class II election for the Georgia U.S. Senate seat held by Republican David Perdue and challenged by Jon Ossoff, which had also advanced to the runoff stage. Following the 2020 U.S. Senate elections, Republicans held 50 Senate seats and the Democratic caucus held 48. This runoff election, in conjunction with the runoff between Loeffler and Warnock, would have decided the balance of the United States Senate under the incoming Biden administration, because of the tiebreaking vote of Democratic vice president-elect Kamala Harris. The extraordinarily high political stakes caused the races to attract significant attention, both nationwide and globally. \c\cWarnock is projected to win the election. Major media outlets, including Decision Desk HQ, the Associated Press, The New York Times, and NBC News, called the election for Warnock in the early hours of January 6, mere minutes after he apparently declared victory. Loeffler refused to concede initially and vowed to challenge the results after she returned from Washington for the electoral vote certification. Warnock became the first Democrat to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Georgia since Zell Miller in the 2000 special election. He is the first ever African-American senator from Georgia, as well as the first African-American Democrat from the South to be elected to the Senate. She later conceded on January 7. Warnock, as the winner of the runoff, will now hold Isaksons seat for the remainder of his original term, which ends on January 3, 2023.
The COVID-19 pandemic reached the Republic of Ireland on 29 February 2020, within three weeks, cases had been confirmed in all counties. The pandemic affected many aspects of society. On 12 March, the government shut all schools, colleges, childcare facilities and cultural institutions, they advised cancelling large gatherings. St Patricks Day festivities were called off, and the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, addressed the nation that night. On 24 March, almost all businesses, venues, facilities and amenities were shut; but gatherings of up to four people were allowed. Three days later on 27 March, the government imposed a stay-at-home order, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside ones home (including family and partners). The elderly and those with certain health conditions were told to cocoon. People were made keep apart in public. The Garda Síochána were given power to enforce the measures, which were repeatedly extended until 18 May. \c\cThe restrictions imposed caused a severe recession, an unprecedented rise in unemployment and caused major damage to all sectors. A COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and a Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme were set up. The 2020 Leaving Certificate, Junior Certificate and all 2020 Irish language summer courses in the Gaeltacht were cancelled. The Health Service Executive (HSE) launched a recruitment campaign, asking both healthcare and non-healthcare professionals to "be on call for Ireland". The previous government of the 32nd Dáil remained in post during the initial several months of the pandemic until its successor was appointed on 27 June. Dáil Éireann sat with fewer members and moved from its traditional home at Leinster House to the Convention Centre to facilitate social distancing requirements. The Oireachtas passed an emergency act giving the state power to detain people, restrict travel and keep people in their homes to control the viruss spread. Further emergency legislation passed the following week. \c\cBy mid-April, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported that the growth rate of the pandemic had been driven "as low as it needs to be", that the curve had flattened and that there would be no peak coming. Daily cases and deaths slowly declined in June and July 2020. In August, a three-week regional lockdown was imposed in three counties following a significant rise in confirmed cases mainly in meat processing plants. In October 2020, lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following a rapid surge in confirmed cases and the introduction of a second wave of COVID-19 in Ireland. The second lockdown resulted in Irelands 14-day incidence rate to be the lowest in the European Union, while restrictions eased in early December. A third wave of COVID-19 arrived in Ireland after restrictions eased. The government acted swiftly and on 24 December (Christmas Eve), lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following another surge in confirmed cases in Ireland. On St Stephens Day, the first shipment of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the Republic of Ireland. Vaccinations began three days later on 29 December 2020. \c\cBy 8 January, the Department of Health had confirmed 135,884 cases and 2,327 deaths. More than 90% of those who have died were aged over 65, and most also had underlying illnesses or lived in care homes.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Canada was announced on January 25, 2020, involving a traveler who had recently returned to Toronto from travel in China, including Wuhan.  As of November 10, 2020, Ontario has the second-largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among Canadas provinces and territories, behind only Quebec. \c\cWith increasing transmission province-wide, a state of emergency was declared by Premier Doug Ford on March 17, 2020, including the gradual implementation of restrictions on gatherings and commerce. On April 3, 2020, the province released modelling projecting that over the full course of the pandemic with no mitigation measures 100,000 deaths would have occurred, and with the then-current measures 3,000 to 15,000 deaths would occur. Projections for test-confirmed cases by April 30 were 12,500 (best case scenario), 80,000 (expected case scenario), and 300,000 (worst-case scenario). \c\cFrom late spring to early summer, the majority of the deaths were residents of long-term care homes. In late April, 2020, one out of five of all long-term care homes in Ontario had an outbreak and 70% to 80% of all COVID-19 deaths had been in retirement and long-term care homes. Following medical assistance and observation by the Canadian Armed Forces, the military released a report detailing "a number of medical, professional and technical issues" amongst for-profit long-term-care homes including neglect and lack of equipment and allegations of elder abuse. \c\cFrom May through August 2020, the province instituted a three-stage plan to lift economic restrictions, subject to the employment of social distancing and other guidelines, and continued restrictions on the sizes of gatherings. The state of emergency was lifted on July 24, 2020. A plan was implemented for the return-to-class of public schools, involving more than 2 million children. \c\cIn early-September 2020, the province showed a significant increase in new cases, along with similar spikes in provinces across the country. Throughout the month of October, Ontario began to reintroduce some restrictions, with a focus on controlling spikes in the hotspots of Toronto, Peel Region, York Region and Ottawa. The province later rolled back its reopening in hotspot regions with temporary measures in a modified Stage 2 of the previous economic reopening system. In early November, the province unveiled a new five-tiered colour-coded level system, abandoning its previous reopening stage system. A response framework was created initially in contradiction to the metrics suggested to political officials by Public Health Ontario and later amended by the province to lower thresholds in each category. From late November to mid-December, the province began placing regions in rolling lockdowns, culminating in a provincewide shutdown beginning Boxing Day. \c\cFollowing Health Canadas approval of the tozinameran COVID-19 vaccine developed by BioNTech/Pfizer, widespread plans for vaccinations began on the week of December 14, 2020. On December 23, 2020 Health Canada approved the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna for use in Canada as well. Both vaccines require two doses for full inoculation. After a highly-criticized initial rollout of vaccination across Ontario, the province now leads the nation in doses administered. \c\cDue to a post-winter holiday surge of new infections, Premier Ford declared Ontarios second state of emergency on January 12, 2021.
Egypt–Qatar relations were the bilateral relations between the State of Qatar and the Arab Republic of Egypt. They first began in 1972 and ceased in 2017 due to the Qatar diplomatic crisis. On January 12, 2021 Egypt reopened its airspace to Qatari flights as part of a thaw in relations with Qatar.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Switzerland on 25 February 2020 when the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed following a COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. A 70-year-old man in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino which borders Italy, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The man had previously visited Milan. Afterwards, multiple cases related to the Italy clusters were discovered in multiple cantons, including Basel-City, Zürich, and Graubünden. Multiple isolated cases not related to the Italy clusters were also subsequently confirmed. \c\cOn 28 February, the national government, the Federal Council, banned all events with more than 1,000 participants. On 16 March, schools and most shops were closed nationwide, and on 20 March, all gatherings of more than five people in public spaces were banned. Additionally, the government gradually imposed restrictions on border crossings and announced economic support measures worth 40 billion Swiss francs. The measures were gradually removed in several phases beginning in late April until June 2020 but new measures were imposed in October as cases surged again. \c\cOn 23 December 2020, the vaccination campaign started in Switzerland, ahead of that of most European countries. Four days earlier, Swissmedic approved the first COVID-19 vaccine for regular use.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in the Philippines was identified on January 30, 2020 and involved a 38-year-old Chinese woman who was confined at San Lazaro Hospital in Metro Manila. On February 1, a posthumous test result from a 44-year-old Chinese man turned out positive for the virus, making the Philippines the first country outside China to record a confirmed death from the disease. \c\cAfter over a month without recording any cases, the Philippines confirmed its first local transmission on March 7. Since then, the virus has spread with at least one case being recorded in the countrys 81 provinces. Socio-economic status has been associated with the prevalence of COVID-19 cases across the country. Lockdowns, or community quarantines, have been imposed throughout the country since March 15 as a measure to limit the spread of the virus. The largest of these measures was the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon. \c\cAs of January 13, 2021, there have been 492,700 confirmed cases of the disease in the country. Out of these cases, 458,523 recoveries and 9,699 deaths were recorded. It has the 2nd highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia (after Indonesia), and ranks 10th in Asia and 32nd in the world. The largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases was reported on August 10, when the Department of Health (DOH) announced 6,958 new cases. \c\cThe Philippines had a slightly lower testing capacity than its neighbors in Southeast Asia during the first months of the pandemic in the country. COVID-19 tests had to be taken outside the country due to the lack of testing kits. This also has led to a controversy that involved several government officials who were reported to have undergone COVID-19 tests without qualifying to the DOHs triage algorithm. By the end of January 2020, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila began its testing operations and became the countrys first subnational laboratory. Several laboratories have been accredited by the DOH since then. As of January 5, the country has 193 subnational laboratories capable of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has conducted a total of 6,894,425 tests from more than 6,498,651 unique individuals.
The global COVID-19 pandemic struck the U.S. state of Wisconsin in early February 2020.  As of January 12, 2021, Wisconsin public health authorities reported 2,790 new cases of COVID-19, for a cumulative total of 511,136 cases since the start of the pandemic.  One hundred and forth-nine hospitalizations and 49 deaths were reported over the past 24 hours; increasing the statewide death toll to 5,211.  Although Wisconsin has to date experienced 895 deaths per million residents, significantly lower than the national average of 1,172 deaths, COVID-19 was one of the leading causes of death in Wisconsin in 2020.  As of January 12, 2021, 9.48% of Wisconsins residents have been positively diagnosed with COVID-19, the 6th highest per capita case rate among all US states after North and South Dakota, Utah, Tennessee and Rhode Island.  December 22s 120 COVID-19 deaths set a new single day record for Wisconsin. \c\cA steady upward trend of new COVID-19 cases in late June/early July accelerated in mid-July, with several new single day records reported in late July.  In response to Julys rising case and death tolls, Governor Tony Evers issued a face mask mandate for all citizens over age 5 while in any building that is not a private home. A lawsuit challenging the mandate was filed by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty on August 25. According to a poll of registered voters conducted by Marquette University, the majority of registered voters support the mandate.  Columnist Michael Tomasky argues that insisting on the right to infect someone else with a deadly disease is not a conservative principle and is in fact the opposite of freedom for the victim.  "Freedom emphatically does not include the freedom to get someone else sick.". \c\cAs of December 29, 2020, Wisconsin has administered 47,157 COVID-19 vaccine doses, equivalent to 0.81% of the population.
The Flint water crisis  is an ongoing public health crisis that started in 2014, after the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan, was contaminated with lead. In April 2014, Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (sourced from Lake Huron and the Detroit River) to the Flint River. Officials failed to apply corrosion inhibitors to the water. As a result, lead from aging pipes leached into the water supply, leading to extremely elevated levels of the heavy metal neurotoxin and exposing over 100,000 residents to elevated lead levels. A pair of scientific studies proved that lead contamination was present in the water supply. The city switched back to the Detroit water system on October 16, 2015. It later signed a 30-year contract with the new Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) on November 22, 2017. \c\cOn January 5, 2016, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency in Genesee County, of which Flint is the major population center. Shortly thereafter, President Barack Obama declared a federal state of emergency, authorizing additional help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Between 6,000 and 12,000 children were exposed to drinking water with high levels of lead. The water supply change was considered a possible cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the county that killed 12 people and affected another 87, but there is no evidence of a clear link. Four government officials—one from the city of Flint, two from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), and one from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—resigned over the mishandling of the crisis, and one additional MDEQ staff member was fired. Fifteen criminal cases have been filed against local and state officials, but only one minor conviction has been obtained, and all other charges have been dismissed or dropped. \c\cAn extensive lead service pipe replacement effort has been underway since 2016, with innovative techniques such as machine learning used to predict the number and location of lead pipes. In early 2017, some officials asserted that the water quality had returned to acceptable levels, but in January 2019, residents and officials expressed doubt about the cleanliness of the water. There were an estimated 2,500 lead service pipes still in place as of April 2019. \c\cAs of October 2, 2020, 26,232 water service lines had been excavated, resulting in the replacement of 9,769 lead pipes and the confirmation of 16,463 copper pipes. As of December 8, fewer than 500 service lines still need to be inspected. The city hopes to finish doing so by December 31, 2020. On August 20, 2020, the victims of the water crisis were awarded a combined settlement of $600 million, with 80% going to the families of children affected by the crisis. By November, the settlement grew to $641 million. In January 2021, Snyder was among those charged with a misdemeanor in his role in the crisis.
The insurgency in the Maghreb refers to the Islamist insurgency in the Maghreb and Sahel regions of North Africa that followed on from the Algerian Civil War. The Algerian militant group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) allied itself with al-Qaeda to eventually become al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The Algerian and other Maghreb governments fighting the militants have worked with the United States and the United Kingdom since 2007, when Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara began. While the 2011 Arab Spring affected support for the insurgency, it also presented military opportunities for the jihadists. In 2012, AQIM and Islamist allies captured the northern half of Mali, until being fought back less than a year later following a French-led foreign intervention, which was succeeded by the Sahel-wide Operation Barkhane. In Libya, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has been able to control some limited territory in the ongoing civil war since 2014, amid allegations of local collaboration between the rival AQIM and ISIL.
In the aftermath of the 2021 United States Capitol storming, criminal investigations, public health concerns, and various political repercussions have occurred, most notably the second impeachment of Donald Trump. The riot at the Capitol led to the resignation of leading figures within the United States Capitol Police (USCP) as well as the Trump administration. Cabinet officials were pressured by the media and various public figures to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office. \c\cIndividuals identified as rioters at the Capitol have been subjected to criminal investigations, arrests, and placement on the FBIs No Fly List. Per his involvement in inciting the storming of the Capitol, Trump has been suspended from various social media sites, including Twitter, Youtube and Facebook. In response to various posts by Trump supporters on the microblogging site Parler in favor of the riot, insurrection, and attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, its cloud computing services hosted by Amazon Web Services were terminated by Amazon on January 10. \c\cPublic health officials have highlighted the danger of this event in exacerbating the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Security measures have also been drastically increased for the Inauguration of Joe Biden as president. This includes the deployment of the United States National Guard, with a security perimeter erected around Capitol Hill.
The COVID-19 pandemic began in the U.S. state of Utah in early March with travel-related cases. Residents stockpiled goods, large conferences were made remote-only, postponed, or cancelled; a state of emergency was declared, and some public universities and other colleges switched to online-only classes. After the first case of community spread was found on March 14, Utah faced a shortage of testing kits, and public schools were ordered to be closed. Community spread was confirmed in more counties, and the state issued a public health order prohibiting dine-in service in restaurants and gatherings of more than 10 people except in grocery stores. A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck the Wasatch Front on March 18, hampering the pandemic response. \c\cIn late March, the state directed all people to voluntarily stay at home as much as possible. Salt Lake, Davis, Weber, Morgan, Tooele, Summit, and Wasatch counties directed people to stay at home except for essential activities. In April, the state briefly ordered all adults entering the state to fill out an online travel declaration. It established phased guidelines for the public to follow and moved from the "red" phase to the "orange" phase at the start of May, advising people to leave home infrequently, staying six feet away from others and wearing face masks when in public. \c\cIn May, the "yellow" guidelines went into effect in most of the state, advising people to continue to stay six feet away from others when outside the home and to wear face coverings when social distancing was difficult to maintain. The number of cases in the Hispanic community surpassed that of the supermajority white population. Cases sharply spiked in June, driven by outbreaks in work sites. About 1% of the population had antibodies. Independence Day fireworks were cancelled or modified in several cities. Cases continued to increase through July but fell by August and continued downward as schools began to open under a statewide mask requirement. Schools began having multiple outbreaks going into September as cases in the state began to trend upward overall. \c\cAs of December 30, 2020, Utah has administered 23,970 COVID-19 vaccine doses, equivalent to 0.75% of the population.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the U.S. state of Oregon on February 28, 2020. On that day, Governor Kate Brown created a coronavirus response team; on March 8 she declared a state of emergency; and on March 23 she issued a statewide stay-at-home order with class C misdemeanor charges for violators. \c\cIn April, Oregon joined Washington and California in the Western States Pact, an agreement to coordinate the restarting of economic activity while controlling the outbreak. By the end of June 2020, Governor Brown announced that face masks would be required indoors, effective July 1. \c\cEconomic impacts of COVID-19 in Oregon included stock market losses for major companies, reduced airline flights, losses for food and entertainment industries, and closures of libraries and museums. \c\cIn early March, universities and K-12 schools closed statewide, and began providing online instruction. Professional and college sports teams cancelled training, games, and tournaments. \c\cBy May 14, 31 of Oregons 36 counties had met OHA requirements to enter the first phase of a three-phase process to reopen businesses. \c\cAs of December 29, 2020, Oregon has administered 25,972 COVID-19 vaccine doses, equivalent to 0.62% of the population.
General elections were held in Uganda on 14 January 2021 to elect the President and the Parliament. Incumbent President Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled the country since 1986, was re-elected with 58.64% of the vote. Vote turnout was 52%.
Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the United States, currently used by 28 states, American Samoa, the federal government, and the military. Its existence can be traced to the beginning of the American colonies. Along with Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore, the United States is one of four advanced democracies and the only Western nation that applies the death penalty regularly. \c\cIt is one of 35 countries worldwide applying it, and was the first to develop lethal injection as a method of execution, which has since been adopted by five other countries. The Philippines has since abolished executions, and Guatemala has done so for civil offenses, leaving the United States as one of four countries to still use this method (along with China, Thailand, and Vietnam). In Singapore and Japan, executions are carried out by long drop hanging. In Taiwan, the preferred method of execution has long been by fatal gunshot; though never used, lethal injection was considered by authorities in the past and remains an option on the books. It is common practice worldwide for the condemned to be administered sedatives prior to execution, regardless of the method used. \c\cThere were no executions in the United States between 1967 and 1977. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment statutes in Furman v. Georgia, reducing all death sentences pending at the time to life imprisonment. Subsequently, a majority of states passed new death penalty statutes, and the court affirmed the legality of capital punishment in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia. Since then, more than 7,800 defendants have been sentenced to death; of these, more than 1,500 have been executed. A total of 170 who were sentenced to death since 1972 were exonerated. As of December 17, 2019, 2,656 convicts are still on death row. \c\cThe Trump administrations Department of Justice announced its plans to resume executions for federal crimes in 2019. On July 14, 2020, Daniel Lewis Lee became the first inmate executed by the federal government since 2003. There are currently 51 inmates on federal death row. 13 federal death row inmates have been executed since federal executions resumed in July 2020.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Brazil on 25 February 2020, when a man from São Paulo tested positive for the virus. The disease had spread to every state in Brazil by 21 March. On 19 June 2020, the country reported its 1 millionth case; at this time, there had been nearly 49,000 reported deaths. As of September 2020, Brazil has the third-highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world behind India and the United States. On 17 July 2020, the country reported its 2 millionth case. On 8 August 2020, the country reported its 3 millionth case with deaths exceeding up to 100,000. Brazil is one of the worst affected countries in the world. \c\cThe pandemic has triggered a variety of responses from federal, state and local governments, having an impact on politics, education, the environment, and the economy. On 27 March Brazil announced a temporary ban on foreign air travelers and most state governors have imposed quarantines to prevent the spread of the virus.
The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal was a political scandal in the United States involving members of the United States Senate due to multiple Senators allegedly violating the STOCK Act by selling stock at the start of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and just before the coronavirus correction on February 20, 2020, using knowledge given to them at a closed Senate meeting. The Department of Justice initiated a probe into the stock transactions on March 30, 2020, but ended the probe on May 26, 2020, for all senators except Richard Burr, who has since been served multiple search warrants.
A building collapsed after a large explosion on 20 January 2021 on the Calle de Toledo in Madrid, Spain. The blast killed 3 people and wounded 11 others.
The COVID-19 pandemic reached the Republic of Ireland on 29 February 2020, within three weeks, cases had been confirmed in all counties. The pandemic affected many aspects of society. On 12 March, the government shut all schools, colleges, childcare facilities and cultural institutions, they advised cancelling large gatherings. St Patricks Day festivities were called off, and the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, addressed the nation that night. On 24 March, almost all businesses, venues, facilities and amenities were shut; but gatherings of up to four people were allowed. Three days later on 27 March, the government imposed a stay-at-home order, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside ones home (including family and partners). The elderly and those with certain health conditions were told to cocoon. People were made keep apart in public. The Garda Síochána were given power to enforce the measures, which were repeatedly extended until 18 May. \c\cThe restrictions imposed caused a severe recession, an unprecedented rise in unemployment and caused major damage to all sectors. A COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and a Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme were set up. The 2020 Leaving Certificate, Junior Certificate and all 2020 Irish language summer courses in the Gaeltacht were cancelled. The Health Service Executive (HSE) launched a recruitment campaign, asking both healthcare and non-healthcare professionals to "be on call for Ireland". The previous government of the 32nd Dáil remained in post during the initial several months of the pandemic until its successor was appointed on 27 June. Dáil Éireann sat with fewer members and moved from its traditional home at Leinster House to the Convention Centre to facilitate social distancing requirements. The Oireachtas passed an emergency act giving the state power to detain people, restrict travel and keep people in their homes to control the viruss spread. Further emergency legislation passed the following week. \c\cBy mid-April, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported that the growth rate of the pandemic had been driven "as low as it needs to be", that the curve had flattened and that there would be no peak coming. Daily cases and deaths slowly declined in June and July 2020. In August, a three-week regional lockdown was imposed in three counties following a significant rise in confirmed cases mainly in meat processing plants. In October 2020, lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following a rapid surge in confirmed cases and the introduction of a second wave of COVID-19 in Ireland. The second lockdown resulted in Irelands 14-day incidence rate to be the lowest in the European Union, while restrictions eased in early December. A third wave of COVID-19 arrived in Ireland after restrictions eased. The government acted swiftly and on 24 December (Christmas Eve), lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following another surge in confirmed cases in Ireland. On St Stephens Day, the first shipment of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the Republic of Ireland. Vaccinations began three days later on 29 December 2020. \c\cBy 19 January, the Department of Health had confirmed 176,839 cases and 2,708 deaths. More than 90% of those who have died were aged over 65, and most also had underlying illnesses or lived in care homes.
At around 10:30 PM on 21 January 2021, a truck carrying sticks of gelatin exploded at a boulder crushing facility in Abbalagere in Shivamogga district, Karnataka, India. The tremors caused by the explosion were felt in Shivamogga, Chickmagalur and Davanagere districts. Eight people were killed in the explosion. Eyewitnesses reported broken window panes and cracked roads. The tremors were initially mistaken for an earthquake, but geologists ruled out the possibility. \c\cNarendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, condoled the deaths on Twitter, stating he was "pained by the loss of lives".
On 23 October 2019, the bodies of 39 Vietnamese people—29 men, 2 boys, and 8 women—were found in the trailer of an articulated refrigerator lorry in Grays, Essex, United Kingdom. The trailer had been shipped from the port of Zeebrugge, Belgium, to Purfleet, Essex, UK, and the lorry cab and its driver are believed to have originated from Northern Ireland. Investigations are being led by Essex Police, and involve the national authorities of the UK, Belgium, Ireland and Vietnam. Eight people have been convicted of crimes related to the incident, including four men found guilty of manslaughter: several other people were arrested.
The 2021 Russian protests began on 23 January 2021 in support of the arrested opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

The 2021 Italian government crisis is an ongoing political event in Italy that occurred in January 2021. It includes the events that follow the announcement of Matteo Renzi, leader of Italia Viva (IV) and former Prime Minister, that he would revoke IVs support to the government of Giuseppe Conte. However, on 18 and 19 January, Renzis party abstained and the government won the key confidence votes in the Chamber and in the Senate.
As of 13 March 2020, when the number of new cases became greater  than those in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) began to consider Europe the active centre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cases by country across Europe had doubled over periods of typically 3 to 4 days, with some countries (mostly those at earlier stages of detection) showing doubling every 2 days. \c\cAs of 17 March, all countries within Europe had a confirmed case of COVID-19, with Montenegro being the last European country to report at least one case. At least one death has been reported in all European countries, apart from the Vatican City. \c\cAs of 18 March, more than 250 million people were in lockdown in Europe. \c\cAs of 24 May, 68 days since its first recorded case, Montenegro became the first COVID-19-free country in Europe, but this situation lasted only 44 days before a newly imported case was identified there. European countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases are Russia, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy.

Decommunization in Ukraine started after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was formalized in April 2015, when the Ukrainian government approved laws that outlawed communist symbols. \c\cOn 15 May 2015, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a set of laws that started a six-month period for the removal of communist monuments (excluding World War II monuments) and renaming of public places named after communist-related themes. At the time, this meant that 22 cities and 44 villages were set to get a new name. Until 21 November 2015, municipal governments had the authority to implement this; if they failed to do so, the provincial authorities had until 21 May 2016 to change the names. If after that date the settlement had retained its old name, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine would wield authority to assign a new name to the settlement. In 2016, 51,493 streets and 987 cities and villages were renamed, and 1,320 Lenin monuments and 1,069 monuments to other communist figures removed. \c\cViolation of the law carries a penalty of a potential media ban and prison sentences to five years. \c\cOn 24 July 2015, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry stripped the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Communist Party of Ukraine (renewed) and the Communist Party of Workers and Peasants of their right to participate in elections and stated it was continuing the court actions that started in July 2014 to end the registration of Ukraines communist parties. By 16 December 2015, these three parties were banned in Ukraine; however, the Communist Party of Ukraine appealed the ban; this meant the courts decision to ban the party did not come into force. However, the April 2015 decommunization law contains a norm that allows the Ministry of Justice to prohibit the Communist Party from participating in elections.
On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the arrests of 13 men suspected of orchestrating a domestic terror plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Governor of Michigan, and otherwise violently overthrow the state government. The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court.
The Late January 2021 North American storm complex is currently a winter storm impacting the West Coast and is predicted to impact the Midwest and Northeast. It was named "Winter Storm Orlena" by The Weather Channel.
In the aftermath of the 2021 United States Capitol storming, criminal investigations, public health concerns, and various political repercussions have occurred, most notably the second impeachment of Donald Trump. The riot triggered a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrators by federal law enforcement, with arrests and indictments following within days. The incident led to the resignation of leading figures within the United States Capitol Police (USCP) and the Trump administration. Cabinet officials were pressured by the media and various public figures to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office. \c\cPeople identified as rioters at the Capitol have been subjected to criminal investigations and arrests. Per his involvement in inciting the storming of the Capitol, Trump was suspended from various social media sites, including Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. In response to various posts by Trump supporters on the microblogging site Parler in favor of the riot, insurrection, and attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, its cloud computing services hosted by Amazon Web Services were terminated by Amazon on January 10. \c\cPublic health officials have highlighted the danger of this event in exacerbating the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Security measures were also dramatically increased for the inauguration of Joe Biden as president. This includes the deployment of the United States National Guard, with a security perimeter erected around Capitol Hill.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. \c\cThe Government of Canada has released modelling anticipating 11,000–22,000 deaths over the course of the pandemic, assuming "stronger epidemic control". \c\cMost cases over the course of the pandemic have been in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta. Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canadas provinces and territories, with Nunavut reporting its first confirmed case on November 6. Until March, all cases were linked to recent travel to a country with a substantial number of cases. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5. In mid-March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canadas provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented school and daycare closures, prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses, restrictions on entry, and mandatory self-isolation for travellers. Canada severely restricted its border access, barring travellers from all countries with some exceptions. The federal Minister of Health invoked the Quarantine Act for the first time in its legislative history, legally requiring all travellers (excluding essential workers) returning to the country to self-isolate for 14 days. \c\cBy mid to late summer of 2020, the country saw a steady decline in active cases. Beginning late summer and through autumn, the country saw a resurgence of cases in all provinces and territories. Prime Minister Trudeau declared that Canada was experiencing a second wave of the virus. New restrictions and reactions from provincial governments were put in place once again as cases increased, including variations of regional lockdowns. In late November there was a disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble, a travel-restricted area of the country set up amongst New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia & Newfoundland and Labrador. The federal government passed legislation to approve further modified economic aid for businesses and individuals. \c\cFollowing Health Canadas approval of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and later the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna, vaccinations began nation-wide December 14, 2020. \c\cNation-wide cases, hospitalizations and deaths spiked preceding and following the Christmas and holiday season in December 2020 and January 2021. Alarmed by hospital capacity issues, fatalities and new cases, heavy restrictions (such as lockdowns and curfews) were put in place in affected areas (primarily Ontario, Quebec and Alberta) and across the country, which has resulted in active cases beginning to steadily decline.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic has had a smaller impact in Taiwan than in most other industrialized countries, with a total of eight deaths as of 30 January 2021. The number of active cases peaked on 6 April 2020 at 307 cases, the overwhelming majority of which were imported. \c\cThe virus was confirmed to have spread to Taiwan on 21 January 2020, with the first case being a 50-year-old woman who had been teaching in Wuhan, China. The Taiwanese government integrated data from the national health care system, immigration, and customs authorities to aid in the identification and response to the virus. Government efforts are coordinated through the National Health Command Center (NHCC) of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, established to aid in disaster management for epidemics following the 2004 SARS outbreak. \c\cThe Journal of the American Medical Association says Taiwan engaged in 124 discrete action items to prevent the spread of the disease, including early screening of flights from Mainland China and the tracking of individual cases. \c\cTaiwans handling of the outbreak alongside its regional neighbours such as Singapore and South Korea has received international praise for its effectiveness in quarantining people and widespread testing. As of 30 January, 341,689 tests had been conducted in Taiwan, with the vast majority not confirming a COVID-19 diagnosis. \c\cStarting 19 March, foreign nationals were barred from entering Taiwan, with some exceptions, such as those carrying out the remainder of business contracts, and those holding valid Alien Resident Certificates, diplomatic credentials, or other official documentation and special permits. Restrictions have since been relaxed for foreign university students and those seeking medical treatment in Taiwan, subject to prior government approval. All who are admitted into the country must complete a fourteen-day quarantine upon arrival, except for business travelers from countries determined to be at low or moderate risk, who are subject to five- or seven-day quarantines and must submit to a COVID-19 test. \c\cHowever, in response to a worldwide spike in cases in October and November 2020, Taiwan announced that from 1 December 2020 to 28 February 2021, all travelers to and through Taiwan, regardless of nationality, origin, or purpose, must submit a negative COVID-19 test performed within three working days of arrival. Exceptions are granted to travelers responding to family emergencies or arriving from countries where on-demand or self-paid tests are unavailable, who must be seated apart from other passengers and take a self-paid test immediately on arrival in Taiwan.
Protests began in Russia on 23 January 2021 in support of the arrested opposition leader Alexei Navalny and following the release of the film Palace for Putin, which revolves around the connection between President Vladimir Putin and a palace allegedly being built for him. According to the BBC Russian Service, protests were held in 198 towns and cities in Russia.
The COVID-19 pandemic in San Marino is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached San Marino in February 2020. \c\cAs of 4 January 2021, with 2,493 confirmed cases out of a population of 33,640 (as of 2020), it was the country with the fourth-highest percentage of confirmed cases per capita at 5.75% – 1 confirmed case per 20 inhabitants. Also, with 62 confirmed deaths, the country has the highest rate of confirmed deaths per capita at 0,151% of the total population – 1 death per 659 inhabitants. The crude fatality rate is 2.63%. It was once declared "Covid-free" on 26 June 2020, although on 9 July it had another case who had recovered by the end of the month.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Saskatchewan is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The province of Saskatchewan, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada ranks sixth amongst provinces and territories in terms of overall cases. \c\cChief Medical Officer Saqib Shahab announced the first presumptive case of in the province on March 12, a person in their 60s that had recently returned from Egypt. A provincial state of emergency was declared on March 18, and the province began to institute mandatory closures of non-essential facilities and lines of business over the days that followed. Saskatchewan reported its first deaths from COVID-19 on March 30. By April 6, the number of new recoveries began to regularly equal or exceed the number of new cases, which also began to steadily drop. On April 23, 2020, Premier Scott Moe stated that Saskatchewans caseload was 70% below the national average per-province, and hospitalizations and deaths were 90% below average. \c\cThe provinces first major surge began in late-April, centred upon the remote northwestern community of La Loche. It was traced to an outbreak at the Kearl Oil Sands Project in northern Alberta, with wider community spread attributed to overcrowded living conditions in local First Nations communities. In June and July, a new surge emerged in the western and central regions of the province, centred around communal Hutterite colonies. The province hit a new peak of 332 active cases during the spike, which subsided by late-August. In early-October, the number of new cases in Saskatchewan began to rapidly increase in urban communities, with a gospel outreach in Prince Albert being attributed as a superspreader event, and increasing community spread in Saskatoon — particularly at nightclubs — which prompted restrictions to be introduced on their operating hours. \c\cBy early-December, the province reached over 4,000 active cases, and were increases in deaths tied to long-term care facilities. COVID-19-related deaths to-date in Saskatchewan roughly doubled during January 2021, and the SHA announced on February 2, 2021 that it had detected cases of the "UK variant" in the province.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The medical response to the outbreak in Malaysia is overseen by Director-General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah under the Health Ministry of two successive governments. Preparations to stockpile equipment, detect and monitor cases, and treat COVID-19 patients were reported to have been initiated as early as 6 January 2020, following a World Health Organization (WHO) report on a late-December 2019 outbreak of "pneumonia of unknown cause" in the city of Wuhan in Hubei, China. \c\cThe virus was confirmed to have reached Malaysia in late January 2020, when it was detected on travellers from China arriving in Johor via Singapore on 25 January, following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei. Reported cases remained relatively low at first and were largely confined to imported cases until localised clusters emerged in March 2020; the largest cluster at the time was linked to a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering held in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur in late February and early March, leading to massive spikes in local cases and exportation of cases to neighbouring countries. Within a few weeks, Malaysia had recorded the largest cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in Southeast Asia, breaching the 2,000 active cases mark by the end of March, from fewer than 30 cases at the beginning of the month. By 16 March, presence of the virus was reported in every state and federal territory in the country. \c\cAs jumps in cases began to occur in early March and the Yang di-Pertuan Agong expressed great concern over the escalation of the outbreak, measures to combat the outbreak were later announced by Malaysias Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin via live nationwide telecast on 13 March 2020. By 16 March, a nationwide "Movement Control Order" (MCO), intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing, was announced to be in effect between 18 and 31 March. The Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC) also published a federal gazette on 18 March 2020 that restricts individuals from travelling to other states that have been declared as coronavirus-affected areas. On 25 March, the MCO was extended by an additional two weeks, until 14 April, as the rate of new cases per day remained consistently high. The MCO was further announced to be extended until 28 April on 10 April, and to 12 May on 23 April. A gradual easing of restrictions was implemented, the first phase after the lockdown is the "Conditional Movement Control Order" (CMCO) on 1 May, which allows most businesses to open on 4 May under strict SOPs, followed by a "Recovery Movement Control Order" (RMCO) as the second phase from 10 June. Originally slated to expire on 31 August, the RMCO has been further extended to 31 December 2020, with selected sectors remaining closed and strict travel restrictions from multiple countries remaining in effect due to continued detection of imported cases. \c\cA third wave of COVID-19 infections occurs after the Sabah state election in September 2020, and the government decided to reinstate CMCO for almost all states from November 9 to December 6; Sabah was to enter a strict MCO, but it proceeded with CMCO instead. Since 21 November 2020, the government gradually reimposed relaxed RMCO restrictions for most states except for some which extended their CMCO until 14 January 2021. On New Year’s Day of 2021, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the government has extended RMCO to 31 March 2021 as the daily fresh cases remain high. Because of concerns over the worsening of COVID-19 outbreak in the country, together with the fact that the nation’s healthcare has reached its breaking point, on 11 January 2021, the government announced that they would reintroduce MCO restrictions to the states of Malacca, Johor, Penang, Selangor, Sabah and the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Labuan between 13 and 26 January 2021. Finally, the government coordinated MCO throughout the country except for Sarawak (which implemented CMCO except for Sibu), from 22 January to 4 February 2021. A nationwide state of emergency was also declared on 12 January 2021 by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to curb COVID-19 spread, hence suspending Parliament and State Legislative assemblies and granting the Muhyiddin government emergency powers until 1 August 2021. \c\cInitially reporting the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia in March and early April 2020, daily active cases in Malaysia have declined steadily from a peak of 2,596 cases in early April to a fluctuation of fewer than 250 cases by late June. The countrys case count has since been eclipsed by other Southeast Asian countries: the Philippines (on 14 April 2020), and Indonesia (on 15 April 2020). Periodic case spikes from subsequent clusters within local communities, immigrant enclaves, immigration detention centres, workers’ dormitories, prisons, and health facilities continue to be reported since the initial outbreak. The most serious outbreak since mid-2020 originated from prison populations in Sabah in September 2020, exacerbated by its recent state election and the governments failures to impose adequate restrictions in time. The subsequent wave, significantly more widespread than the earlier wave, elevated the severity of the countrys outbreak above those in other Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and East Timor. At over 210,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, over 48,000 active cases, and over 760 deaths, the country ranks third in the number of cases behind Indonesia, and the Philippines and fourth in the number of deaths in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar.
The 2021 Wooroloo bushfire is a fast moving bushfire that started on 1 February in Wooroloo 45km north-east of the Perth central business district, in the Shire of Mundaring, Western Australia. By 2 February, the bushfire emergency had spread to Shires of Chittering, Northam, and the City of Swan in the Perth Hills.  It is also being reported as the fire in Perths north-east.
The insurgency in the Maghreb refers to the Islamist insurgency in the Maghreb and Sahel regions of North Africa that followed on from the Algerian Civil War. The Algerian militant group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) allied itself with al-Qaeda to eventually become al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The Algerian and other Maghreb governments fighting the militants have worked with the United States and the United Kingdom since 2007, when Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara began. While the 2011 Arab Spring affected support for the insurgency, it also presented military opportunities for the jihadists. In 2012, AQIM and Islamist allies captured the northern half of Mali, until being fought back less than a year later following a French-led foreign intervention, which was succeeded by the Sahel-wide Operation Barkhane. In Libya, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has been able to control some limited territory in the ongoing civil war since 2014, amid allegations of local collaboration between the rival AQIM and ISIL.
The 2021 Wooroloo bushfire is a fast moving bushfire that started on 1 February in Wooroloo, 45 kilometres (28 mi) north-east of the Perth central business district, in the Shire of Mundaring, Western Australia. By 2 February, the bushfire emergency had spread to Shires of Chittering and Northam, and the City of Swan. It has destroyed at least 71 houses and 2 fire trucks. The fire coincided with a five day lockdown of the Perth metropolitan region that started at 6pm on 31 January, due to a case of COVID-19 outside of hotel quarantine.
Facebook has been replacing traditional media channels since its founding in 2004. Censorship in the media, especially on Facebook is because of a variety of reasons, since Facebook accepts all kinds of content, with little or no moderation, and displays what people post publicly, this practice can sometimes threaten oppressive governments especially in totalitarian regimes while also propelling fake news, hate speech and misinformation thus undermining the credibility of online platforms and social media. Many countries have banned or temporarily limited access to the social networking website Facebook, including Mainland China, Iran, Syria, and North Korea. Use of the website has also been restricted in various ways in other countries. As of May 2016, the only countries to ban access around the clock to the social networking site are China, Iran, Syria, and North Korea. However, since most North Korean residents have no access to the Internet, China and Iran are the only countries where access to Facebook is actively restricted in a wholesale manner.
General elections were held in Liechtenstein on 7 February 2021 to elect the 25 members of the Landtag.
The 2009–present phase of the Somali Civil War is concentrated in southern and central Somalia and portions of north eastern Kenya. It began in early February 2009 with the conflict between the forces of the Federal Government of Somalia, assisted by African Union peacekeeping troops, and various militant groups and factions. The violence has displaced thousands of people in the southern part of the country. The conflict has also seen fighting between the Sufi Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a and Al-Shabaab. \c\cOn 16 October 2011, the Kenyan Army crossed the border into Somalia in Operation Linda Nchi against Al-Shabaab. It aimed to seize Kismayo and set up a buffer zone against Al-Shabaab. In 2012, Kismayo was captured. \c\cIn August 2014, the Somali government-led Operation Indian Ocean was launched to clean up the remaining insurgent-held pockets in the countryside. \c\cIn 2017, the 14 October and 28 October Mogadishu bombings were responsible for the deaths of over 500 individuals and injured more than 400.
The Venezuelan migration and refugee crisis (also known as the Bolivarian diaspora), the largest recorded refugee crisis in the Americas, refers to the emigration of millions of Venezuelans from their native country during the presidencies of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro because of the Bolivarian Revolution. The revolution was an attempt by Chávez and later Maduro to establish a cultural and political hegemony, which culminated in the crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela. The resulting refugee crisis has been compared to those faced by Cuban exiles, Syrian refugees and those affected by the European migrant crisis. The Bolivarian government has denied any migratory crisis, stating that the United Nations and others are attempting to justify foreign intervention within Venezuela. \c\cNewsweek described the "Bolivarian diaspora" as "a reversal of fortune on a massive scale", where the "reversal" is a comparison with Venezuelas high immigration rate during the 20th century. Initially, upper class Venezuelans and scholars emigrated during Chávezs presidency, but middle- and lower-class Venezuelans began to leave as conditions worsened in the country. It has caused a brain drain that affected the nation, due to the large number of emigrants who are educated or skilled. After disappointment with opposition politics in the country, Venezuelans opposed to President Maduro also left the country, resulting with increased support for the Maduro government. \c\cDuring the crisis, Venezuelans have often been asked about their desire to leave their native country, and over 30 percent of those asked in a December 2015 survey said that they planned to permanently leave Venezuela. The percentage nearly doubled the following September as, according to Datincorp, 57 percent of respondents wanted to leave the country. By mid-2019, over four million Venezuelans, around 13 percent of the countrys population, had emigrated since the revolution began in 1999. The United Nations predicted that by the end of 2019, there would have been over 5 million recorded emigrants during the Venezuelan crisis, over 15% of the population. A late-2018 study by the Brookings Institution suggested that emigration would reach 6 million – approximately 20% of Venezuelas 2017 population – by the end of 2019, with a mid-2019 poll by Consultares 21 estimating that up to 6 million Venezuelans had fled the country by this point; estimates going into 2020 suggested that the number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees was overtaking the 6 million figure. Six million was at this time the number of refugees from the Syrian Civil War, which started years before the recorded Venezuelan crisis and was considered the worst humanitarian disaster in the world at the time.
Protests in Russia began on 23 January 2021 in support of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny after his arrest and the release of the film Putins Palace, which revolves around the connection between President Vladimir Putin and a palace allegedly being built for him. On the first day, protests were held in 198 towns and cities across Russia in what were one of the largest anti-government demonstrations since the 2011–2013 Russian protests. \c\cOn 2 February, Navalnys suspended sentence of three and a half years was replaced with a prison sentence, meaning he would spend over two and a half years at a penal colony. \c\cOn 4 February, Leonid Volkov, Navalnys chief of staff, stated that they did not plan to hold further protests until the spring or summer to focus on the upcoming parliamentary elections later in the year. He also said that Navalnys team would use "foreign policy methods" to pressure the government into releasing Navalny.
On Sunday, January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76B helicopter crashed in the city of Calabasas, California, around 30 miles (48 kilometres) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, while en route from John Wayne Airport to Camarillo Airport. Nine people were on board: retired professional basketball player Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, baseball coach John Altobelli, five other passengers, and the pilot. Everyone on board was killed on impact. \c\cInvestigative updates published by the National Transportation Safety Board during the accident investigation state that:. \c\cThe helicopter was not fitted with a flight data recorder (FDR) or cockpit voice recorder (CVR) nor was it required to be. \c\cFAA toxicology reports revealed no evidence of drug or alcohol use. \c\cViewable sections of the engines showed no evidence of an uncontained or catastrophic internal failure. \c\cThe death of Bryant sparked numerous remembrances and tributes, including those of then-U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Germany is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 27 January 2020, the first case in Germany was confirmed near Munich, Bavaria. By mid February, the arising cluster of cases had been fully contained. On 25 and 26 February, multiple cases related to the Italian outbreak were detected in Baden-Württemberg. A large cluster linked to a carnival event was formed in Heinsberg, North Rhine-Westphalia; on 9 March 2020, the first two deaths in Germany were reported from Essen and Heinsberg. New clusters were introduced in other regions via Heinsberg as well as via people arriving from China, Iran and Italy, from where non-Germans could arrive by plane until 17–18 March. \c\cGerman disease and epidemic control is advised by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) according to a national pandemic plan. The outbreaks were first managed in a containment stage, which attempted to minimise the expansion of clusters. From 13 March, the pandemic has been managed in the protection stage as per the RKI plan, with German states mandating school and kindergarten closures, postponing academic semesters and prohibiting visits to nursing homes to protect the elderly. Two days later, borders to Austria, Denmark, France, Luxembourg and Switzerland were closed. \c\cBy 22 March, curfews were imposed in six German states while other states prohibited physical contact with more than one person from outside ones household. \c\cOn 15 April, Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of "fragile intermediate success" that had been achieved in the fight against the pandemic. The same day, a first loosening of restrictions was announced, continued in early May, and eventually, holiday travels were allowed in cooperation with other European countries. A number of state premiers pressed for faster relaxation of restrictions, putting them at odds with Merkel, who favoured a more cautious approach. Substantial local outbreaks in meat processing plants drew public attention beyond the epidemiological context to poor working conditions. By late August, infection numbers had returned to the levels of April, and a possible second wave of the pandemic was under debate. By mid October, it was believed by experts to be inevitable. A partial lockdown from 2 November, in which physical distancing rules were tightened while schools and kindergartens remained open, only temporarily halted the rise in case numbers; the total number of reported infections since the start of the pandemic crossed one million on 27 November. In spite of a hard lockdown imposed from 15 December until 10 January 2021, infection numbers remained high and, eventually, coronavirus-related deaths also rose sharply. This situation and the uncertainties associated with the appearance of a particularly infectious strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the United Kingdom prompted two further extensions of the lockdown until 31 January and then 14 February. Besides re-introducing physical distancing measures similar to those of March 2020, movement out of hard-hit districts beyond a radius of 15 kilometres from the place of residence without good reason was prohibited, while in the second extension the wearing of surgical masks or FFP2 masks on public transport and in shops was made mandatory; also, employers were to allow their employees, wherever possible, to work from home (popularly known in Germany as the pseudo-anglicism "Homeoffice"). A slight decline in the infection rate ensued, but a substantial loosening of restrictions remained a remote prospect given the ongoing fear of mutations of the virus. High death rates in intensive care and nursing homes persisted into early February. On 10 February, the lockdown was extended until 7 March; a gradual reopening of schools and daycare centers was agreed and, again in view of the threats posed by the mutations, further relaxations of pandemic measures were made subject to the so-called seven-day-incidence (the average number of infected per 100,000 population, considered over the previous seven days) to fall below 35, rather than the former value of 50. \c\cAs of 8 February 2021, the RKI has officially reported 2,288,545 cases, 61,675 deaths, and approximately 2,041,300 recoveries. The countrys low fatality rate in the first and the onset of the second wave of the pandemic, compared to fatality rates in Italy and Spain, has generated a discussion and explanations that cite the countrys higher number of tests performed, higher number of available intensive care beds with respiratory support and higher proportion of positive cases among younger people. The serious worsening of infection and death numbers in November and December 2020, which largely failed to raise a sense of alarm in the public, and frequent breaches of physical distancing rules led to a perception that Germanys status as a worldwide role model in fighting the pandemic had diminished. \c\cVaccinations with the BioNTech–Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine began on 26 December 2020. To criticism about slow procurement of this and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the Health Ministry responded by pointing to the advantages of having ordered the vaccines through the European Union. It expected that a total of 13 million doses from the two suppliers would be available in the first quarter of 2021. \c\cUp to and including 7 February 2021, a total of 3,277,135 administered vaccination doses have been reported to the RKI. \c\cBy 10 February, the number of second vaccinations – two vaccinations being necessary for all the three vaccines approved as of that date – had risen to above 1,1 million, comprising about 1,32 per cent of the population. Difficulties with vaccine delivery had prompted authorities to retain vaccines for use in the second vaccination and consequently, a decrease in the daily number of first vaccinations.
The 2021 Italian government crisis is an ongoing political event in Italy that occurred in January 2021. It includes the events that follow the announcement of Matteo Renzi, leader of Italia Viva (IV) and former Prime Minister, that he would revoke IVs support to the government of Giuseppe Conte. \c\cOn 18 and 19 January, Renzis party abstained and the government won the key confidence votes in the Chamber and in the Senate, but it failed in reaching the absolute majority in the Senate. On 26 January, Prime Minister Conte resigned from his office, prompting President Sergio Mattarella to start new consultations for the formation of a new government.
Operation Claw-Eagle 2 (Turkish: Pençe Kartal-2 Harekatı) was an air and ground operation launched by the Turkish Armed Forces against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the Duhok Governorate of the Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq. According to Turkey, it was launched to secure the border between Turkey and Iraq and to eliminate the PKK in the area and to rescue Turkish prisoners held by the PKK.
The 2021 NASCAR Cup Series is the 73rd season for NASCAR professional stock car racing in the United States and the 50th season for the modern era Cup Series. The season will start at the Daytona International Speedway with the Busch Clash non-points event. It will be the first year the race is run on the road course, and the second NASCAR race run on the tracks road course layout. The race will be followed by the Bluegreen Vacations Duel qualifying races, and the 63rd running of the Daytona 500.
The Philippine presidential and vice presidential elections of 2016 were held on Monday, May 9, 2016, as part of the 2016 general election. This was the 16th presidential election in the Philippines since 1935 and the sixth sextennial presidential election since 1986. \c\cIncumbent president Benigno Aquino III was ineligible for re-election, pursuant to the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Therefore, this election determined the 16th president. The position of president and vice president are elected separately, thus the two winning candidates could come from different political parties. \c\cRodrigo Duterte led the preliminary count with 38.5% of the vote. The Congress met in late May to canvass the results and issued an official result with Rodrigo Duterte and Leni Robredo emerging as the winners of the presidential and vice presidential races, respectively. They were proclaimed on May 30 in the House of Representatives.

A gradual easing of restrictions was implemented, the first phase after the lockdown is the "Conditional Movement Control Order" (CMCO) or simply called Phase One (Safe Reopening) on 1 May, which allowed most businesses to open on 4 May under strict SOPs, followed by Phase 2 (Safe Transition) in June. The government wanted to move to Phase Three of the reopening (Safe Nation) but because of the third wave of COVID-19 infections, measures were reversed. \c\cA third wave of COVID-19 infections occurs after the Sabah state election in September 2020, and the government reversed all measures by going back to Phase 1 from Phase 2, for almost all states from November 9 to December 6; Sabah was to enter a strict MCO, but it proceeded with Phase One (CMCO) instead. Since 21 November 2020, the government gradually reimposed relaxed RMCO restrictions for most states except for some which extended their CMCO until 14 January 2021.

Finally, the government coordinated MCO throughout the country except for Sarawak (which implemented CMCO except for Sibu), from 22 January until 18 February 2021. A nationwide state of emergency was also declared on 12 January 2021 by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to curb COVID-19 spread, hence suspending Parliament and State Legislative assemblies and granting the Muhyiddin government emergency powers until 1 August 2021. On 16 February 2021, the government extended the MCO for Selangor, Johor, Penang and Kuala Lumpur until 4 March 2021. Meanwhile, the remaining states and federal territories transitioned back into the CMCO starting on 18 February 2021; only Perlis transitioned back into the RMCO. \c\cInitially reporting the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia in March and early April 2020, daily active cases in Malaysia have declined steadily from a peak of 2,596 cases in early April to a fluctuation of fewer than 250 cases by late June. The countrys case count has since been eclipsed by other Southeast Asian countries: the Philippines (on 14 April 2020), and Indonesia (on 15 April 2020).

At over 270,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, over 41,000 active cases, and over 1,000 deaths, the country ranks third in the number of cases behind Indonesia, and the Philippines and fourth in the number of deaths in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, China, tested positive for the virus. \c\cAustralian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March, and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March. Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020. Social distancing rules were imposed on 21 March, and state governments started to close "non-essential" services. "Non-essential services" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories. The number of new cases initially grew sharply, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22 March, and started falling at the beginning of April to under 20 cases per day by the end of the month. \c\cA second wave of infections emerged in Victoria during May and June, which was attributed to an outbreak at a Melbourne quarantine hotel. The second wave, though largely localised to Melbourne, was much more widespread and deadlier than the first; at its peak, the state had over 7,000 active cases. Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown which eventually lasted almost four months. The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October. \c\cAs of 16 February 2021, Australia has reported 28,905 cases, 25,486 recoveries, and 909 deaths, with Victorias second wave accounting for nearly 75 percent of cases and 90 percent of fatalities. The stated goal of the National Cabinet is "zero community transmission", in contrast to the mitigation strategies implemented by most other nations. Compared to other Western countries, notably the United States and European countries, Australias handling has been praised for its effectiveness.
An exoplanet (extrasolar planet) is a planet located outside the Solar System. The first evidence of an exoplanet was noted as early as 1917, but was not recognized as such until 2016. No planet discovery has yet come from that evidence. However, the first scientific detection of an exoplanet began in 1988. Afterwards, the first confirmed detection came in 1992, with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. The first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star was made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby star 51 Pegasi. Some exoplanets have been imaged directly by telescopes, but the vast majority have been detected through indirect methods, such as the transit method and the radial-velocity method. As of 1 April 2022, there are 4,984 confirmed exoplanets in 3,673 planetary systems, with 815 systems having more than one planet. This is a list of the most notable discoveries.
The News Media Bargaining Code (or News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code) is a proposed law designed to have large technology platforms that operate in Australia subsidise local news publishers for the news content made available or linked on their platforms. The laws definition of news is very broad, including "content that reports, investigates or explains .. current issues or events of public significance for Australians at a local, regional or national level." Originating in April 2020, when the Australian Government asked the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) to begin drafting it, it achieved broad support in parliament but staunch opposition from central stakeholders Facebook and Google.
The COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in New Zealand was reported on 28 February 2020. As of 18 February 2021, the country has had a total of 2,344 cases (1,988 confirmed and 356 probable). 26 people have died from the virus, with cases recorded in all twenty district health board (DHB) areas. The pandemic peaked in early April, with 89 new cases recorded per day and 929 active cases. \c\cAll borders and entry ports of New Zealand were closed to all non-residents on 19 March 2020, with returning citizens and residents being required to self-isolate. Since 10 April, all New Zealanders returning from overseas must go into two weeks of managed isolation. \c\cA four-level alert level system was introduced on 21 March to manage the outbreak within New Zealand. The alert level was initially set at level 2, but was subsequently raised to level 3 on the afternoon of 23 March. Beginning on 25 March, the alert level was moved to level 4, putting the country into a nationwide lockdown. The alert level was moved back down to level 3 on 27 April, partially lifting some lockdown restrictions, and down to level 2 on 13 May, lifting the rest of the lockdown restrictions while maintaining physical distancing and gathering size limits. The country moved down to level 1 on 8 June, removing all remaining restrictions except border controls. \c\cOn 11 August, four cases of COVID-19 from an unknown source were reported in Auckland, the first from an unknown source in 102 days. At noon the following day, the Auckland Region moved up to alert level 3, while the rest of the country was moved to level 2. On 30 August at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to "alert level 2.5", a modified version of alert level 2 with limitation on public gatherings, funerals, and weddings. On 23 September at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to alert level 2, after the rest of New Zealand moved to alert level 1 on 21 September at 11:59pm. On 7 October, Auckland also moved down to level 1. \c\cOn 14 February 2021, three community cases of COVID-19 were detected in Auckland. On the same day, at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved up to level 3 while the rest of New Zealand moved to level 2. On 17 February at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to level 2 while the rest of New Zealand to level 1. \c\cNew Zealands approach to the pandemic has been widely praised internationally for its quick and tough action over the virus, having completed 1,030,115 tests as of 18 October 2020.
Equatorial Guinea–Israel relations are the bilateral relations between the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and the State of Israel. The Israeli embassy in Yaounde, Cameroon, is accredited to Equatorial Guinea. Equatorial Guinea has a resident embassy in Israel, which opened in 2019 and located in Herzliya.
The 2021 Australian Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park, on 8–21 February 2021. It was the 109th edition of the Australian Open, the 53rd in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. It was originally scheduled for 18–31 January 2021, but was postponed by three weeks to February due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event is part of the 2021 ATP Tour and the 2021 WTA Tour. \c\cThe tournament consists of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Wheelchair players will compete in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournaments main sponsor is Kia. \c\cNovak Djokovic successfully defended the mens singles title as he claimed his 18th Grand Slam title, defeating Daniil Medvedev in straight sets. Heading into the tournament, Sofia Kenin was the defending Womens Singles champion but she lost to Kaia Kanepi in the second round. In the final, it was Naomi Osaka who claimed her fourth Grand Slam title as she defeated Jennifer Brady (who was competing in her maiden Grand Slam final) in straight sets.
Canada–China relations, or Sino-Canadian relations, officially dates back to 1942, when Canada sent an ambassador to China. Before then, Canada had been represented by the British ambassador. The Communist victory (1949) in the Chinese Civil War caused a break in relations that lasted until 1970, when Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau became one of the first Western leaders to recognize the Peoples Republic of China. Canada is home to a large Chinese diaspora, which affects diplomatic and other dimensions. Since 1997, Hong Kong has been an official part of China, and relations have been aggravated of late by the tensions between the Communist Party of China and the protestors in that city. \c\cChina was one of Canadas largest trading partners in Asia for a few years, including 2017; it was Canadas top export market and it was Canadas top import supplier in Asia. On the other hand, Canada had a significant trade imbalance, importing CA$44.235 billion more from China than the value of its exports to that country in 2016, for example.
Since 2014, the Chinese government, under the direction of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the administration of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, has pursued a policy leading to more than one million Muslims (the majority of them Uyghurs) being held in secretive detention camps without any legal process in what has become the largest-scale detention of ethnic and religious minorities since the Second World War. Critics of the policy have described it as the Sinicization of Xinjiang and have called it an ethnocide or cultural genocide, while some activists, independent NGOs, human rights experts, academics, government officials, and the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile have called it a genocide. \c\cIn particular, critics have highlighted the concentration of Uyghurs in state-sponsored internment camps, suppression of Uyghur religious practices, political indoctrination, severe ill-treatment, and testimonials of alleged human rights abuses including forced sterilization and contraception. Chinese government statistics show that from 2015 to 2018, birth rates in the mostly Uyghur regions of Hotan and Kashgar plunged by more than 60%. In the same period, the birth rate of the whole country decreased by 9.69%, from 12.07 to 10.9 per 1,000 people. Chinese authorities acknowledged that birth rates dropped by almost a third in 2018 in Xinjiang, but denied reports of forced sterilization and genocide. Birth rates have continued to plummet in Xinjiang, falling nearly 24% in 2019 alone when compared to just 4.2% nationwide. \c\cInternational reactions have been mixed, with 54 United Nations (UN) member states supporting Chinas policies in Xinjiang, which decreased to 45 in October 2020, and 39 countries condemning Chinas human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In July and August 2020, human rights groups have called on the International Criminal Court (ICC) and United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate Chinese officials over allegations of crimes against humanity and genocide. The United States is the only country to have declared the human rights abuses a genocide, a decision made January 19, 2021, by then President Donald Trump despite reservations by the U.S. State Department. \c\cIn December 2020, the ICC declined to take investigative action against China, on the basis that it did not have jurisdiction over China with respect to the majority of the alleged crimes. The ICC also ruled in a separate assessment that transfers of Uyghurs to China from Cambodia and Tajikistan, both ICC members, did not constitute the crime against humanity of deportation.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 28,100,000 confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 500,000 deaths, the most of any country and the eighth-highest per capita. The U.S. has nearly a quarter of the worlds cases and a fifth of all deaths. More Americans have died from COVID-19 than during World War II. COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. U.S. life expectancy dropped from 78.8 years in 2019 to 77.8 years in the first half of 2020. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and then-President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. Meanwhile, Trump remained optimistic on the future of the coronavirus in the United States. \c\cThe first known American deaths occurred in February. On March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak. On March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency. In mid-March, the Trump administration started to purchase large quantities of medical equipment, and in late March, it invoked the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories. By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, and by November in all inhabited U.S. territories. A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states. \c\cState and local responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and school closures. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas.
Law 52/2007 That recognises and broadens the rights and establishes measures in favour of those who suffered persecution or violence during the Civil War and the Dictatorship (in Spanish: Ley 52/2007 por la que se reconocen y amplían derechos y se establecen medidas en favor de quienes padecieron persecución o violencia durante la Guerra Civil y la Dictadura), commonly known as Historical Memory Law (Sp: Ley de Memoria Histórica), is a Spanish law passed by the Congress of Deputies on 31 October 2007. It was based on a bill proposed by the Spanish Socialist Workers Party government of Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. The Historical Memory Law principally recognizes the victims on both sides of the Spanish Civil War, gives rights to the victims and the descendants of victims of the Civil War and the subsequent dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, and formally condemns the Franco Regime. \c\cThe conservative Popular Party and the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) both voted against passage of the law but for different reasons. For its no vote the Popular Party accused the Socialist Party government of weakening the political consensus of the transition to democracy and "using the Civil War as an argument for political propaganda", while the Republican Left of Catalonia rejected the law on the basis it did not go far enough.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Saskatchewan is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The province of Saskatchewan, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada ranks sixth amongst provinces and territories in terms of overall cases. \c\cChief Medical Officer Saqib Shahab announced the first presumptive case of in the province on March 12, a person in their 60s that had recently returned from Egypt. A provincial state of emergency was declared on March 18, and the province began to institute mandatory closures of non-essential facilities and lines of business over the days that followed. Saskatchewan reported its first deaths from COVID-19 on March 30. By April 6, the number of new recoveries began to regularly equal or exceed the number of new cases, which also began to steadily drop. On April 23, 2020, Premier Scott Moe stated that Saskatchewans caseload was 70% below the national average per-province, and hospitalizations and deaths were 90% below average. \c\cThe provinces first major surge began in late-April, centred upon the remote northwestern community of La Loche. It was traced to an outbreak at the Kearl Oil Sands Project in northern Alberta, with wider community spread attributed to overcrowded living conditions in local First Nations communities. In June and July, a new surge emerged in the western and central regions of the province, centred around communal Hutterite colonies. The province hit a new peak of 332 active cases during the spike, which subsided by late-August. In early-October, the number of new cases in Saskatchewan began to rapidly increase in urban communities, with a gospel outreach in Prince Albert being attributed as a superspreader event, and increasing community spread in Saskatoon — particularly at nightclubs — which prompted restrictions to be introduced on their operating hours. \c\cNew restrictions on gatherings were introduced in mid-November, including a prohibition of all group sports activities. By early-December, the province reached over 4,000 active cases, and there were increases in deaths tied to long-term care facilities. COVID-19-related deaths to-date in Saskatchewan roughly doubled during January 2021, and the SHA announced on February 2, 2021 that it had detected cases of Variant of Concern 202012/01 in the province.
The 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis is an ongoing intensification of military tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and their allies and the United States of America and their allies in the Persian Gulf region. Starting in early May 2019, the U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to deter an alleged planned campaign by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. This followed a rise in political tensions between the two countries during the Trump administration, which included the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the imposition of new sanctions against Iran, and the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. In response, Iran designated the United States Central Command as a terrorist organization. \c\cSeveral merchant ships in the Persian Gulf were damaged in two incidents in May and June 2019. Western nations blamed Iran, while Iran denied involvement. In June 2019, Iran shot down an American RQ-4A surveillance drone flying over the Strait of Hormuz, sharply increasing tensions and nearly resulting in an armed confrontation. In July 2019, an Iranian oil tanker was seized by Britain in the Strait of Gibraltar on the grounds that it was shipping oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Iran later captured a British oil tanker and its crew members in the Persian Gulf. Both Iran and the UK later released the ships. Meanwhile, the U.S. created the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), which sought to increase "overall surveillance and security in key waterways in the Middle East", according to the United States Department of Defense. \c\cThe crisis escalated in late 2019 and early 2020 when alleged members of the Kataib Hezbollah militia, part of Iraqs Popular Mobilization Forces, killed an American contractor in an attack on an Iraqi base hosting U.S. personnel. In retaliation, the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Kataib Hezbollahs facilities in Iraq and Syria, killing 25 militiamen. Kataib Hezbollah responded with an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, which prompted the U.S. to deploy hundreds of new troops to the Middle East and announce that it would preemptively target Irans "proxies" in Iraq. Days later, the commander of IRGCs Quds Force Qasem Soleimani and PMF commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were both killed in a U.S. drone strike, resulting in Irans Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei pledging to exact revenge on U.S. forces. The U.S. deployed nearly 4,000 troops in response to the tensions, and Israel heightened its security levels. On 5 January 2020, Iran ended its commitments to the nuclear deal, and the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory. \c\cThe U.S. and Iran nearly entered into an open conflict on 8 January 2020 when the IRGC launched ballistic missile attacks against two military bases in Iraq housing U.S. soldiers in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani, a rare direct Iran–U.S. confrontation and the closest to the brink of war between the two nations in decades. Upon initial assessments of no U.S. casualties, the Trump administration curtailed tensions by temporarily ruling out a direct military response but announcing new sanctions. It was later revealed that more than a hundred U.S. troops sustained injuries during the attacks. During the crisis, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down after departing from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport, and Western officials said the plane had been brought down by an Iranian SA-15 surface-to-air missile. On 11 January 2020, the Iranian military admitted in a statement that they had mistakenly shot down the plane due to human error.
China – Netherlands relations officially began in November 1954.  In May 1972, diplomatic mission was increased to ambassadorial level.
On 13 February 2021, the Fukushima-ken Oki (Fukushima Prefecture Offshore) earthquake (Japanese: 福島県沖地震, Hepburn: Fukushima-ken'Oki Jishin) with a magnitude of 7.1 earthquake struck offshore east of Tōhoku, Japan. The earthquake occurred on a Saturday night at 23:07 JST (14:07 UTC). It had a maximum JMA intensity of Shindo 6+. It was followed by multiple aftershocks within less than an hour, with the strongest being a magnitude 5.3. The earthquake has been considered an aftershock of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake which occurred almost ten years before this earthquake. \c\cAs of February 25, one person was confirmed dead, with more than 180 people injured. The earthquake also inflicted significant damage across the Tōhoku and Kanto regions. In addition, a non-destructive, 20 cm tsunami was observed at a port in Miyagi Prefecture in the early morning of February 14.
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Malaysia face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Sodomy is a crime in the country, with laws strictly enforced, and social attitudes towards the LGBT community are shaped by Islam, the official state religion of Malaysia. Breaking the law is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and authorities will also bring the person to corporal punishment. \c\cHuman Rights Watch states that "Discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is pervasive in Malaysia."
India-Pakistan relations (Hindi: भारत-पाकिस्तान संबंध; Urdu: بھارت پاکستان تعلقات) are the bilateral relations between India and Pakistan. The relations between the two countries have been complex and largely hostile due to a number of historical and political events. Relations between the two states have been defined by the violent partition of British India in 1947 which started the Kashmir conflict, and the numerous military conflicts fought between the two nations. Consequently, their relationship has been plagued by hostility and suspicion. Northern India and Pakistan somewhat overlap in certain demographics and shared lingua francas (mainly Punjabi, Sindhi, and Hindustani). \c\cAfter the dissolution of the British Raj in 1947, two new sovereign nations were formed—the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. The subsequent partition of the former British India displaced up to 12.5 million people, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to 1 million. India emerged as a secular nation with a Hindu majority population and a large Muslim minority, while Pakistan, with a Muslim majority population and a large Hindu minority, later became an Islamic Republic, although its constitution guaranteed freedom of religion to people of all faiths. It later lost most of its Hindu minority due to migration and the separation of East Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War. \c\cSoon after gaining their independence, India and Pakistan established diplomatic relations, but the violent partition and reciprocal territorial claims quickly overshadowed their relationship. Since their independence, the two countries have fought three major wars, as well as one undeclared war, and have been involved in numerous armed skirmishes and military standoffs. The Kashmir conflict is the main centre-point of all of these conflicts with the exception of the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 and the Bangladesh Liberation War, which resulted in the secession of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). \c\cThere have been numerous attempts to improve the relationship, notably the Shimla summit, the Agra summit, and the Lahore summit. Since the early 1980s, relations between the two nations have grown increasingly sour, particularly after the Siachen conflict, intensification of the Kashmir insurgency in 1989, Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests in 1998, and the 1999 Kargil War. Certain confidence-building measures, such as the 2003 ceasefire agreement and the Delhi–Lahore Bus service, have been successful in de-escalating tensions. However, these efforts have been impeded by periodic terrorist attacks. The 2001 Indian Parliament attack brought the two nations to the brink of a nuclear war. The 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings, which killed 68 civilians (most of whom were Pakistani), was also a crucial turning point in relations. Additionally, the 2008 Mumbai attacks carried out by Pakistani militants resulted in a severe blow to the ongoing India–Pakistan peace talks. \c\cAfter a brief thaw following the election of new governments in both nations, bilateral discussions again stalled after the 2016 Pathankot attack. In September 2016, a terrorist attack on an Indian military base in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 19 Indian Army soldiers, the deadliest such attack in years. Indias claim that the attack had been orchestrated by a Pakistan-supported jihadist group was denied by Pakistan, which claimed the attack had been a local reaction to unrest in the region due to excessive force by Indian security personnel. The attack sparked a military confrontation across the Line of Control, with an escalation in ceasefire violations and further militant attacks on Indian security forces. Since 2016, the ongoing confrontation, continued terrorist attacks, and an increase in nationalist rhetoric on both sides has resulted in the collapse of bilateral relations, with little expectation that they will recover. Notably, following the 2019 Pulwama attack, the Indian government revoked Pakistans most favoured nation trade status, which it had granted to Pakistan in 1996. India also increased the custom duty to 200% which affected the trade of Pakistani apparel and cement. \c\cSince the election of new governments in both India and Pakistan in the early 2010s, some attempts have been made to improve relations, in particular the development of a consensus on the agreement of Non-Discriminatory Market Access on Reciprocal Basis (NDMARB) status for each other, which will liberalise trade. Both India and Pakistan are members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and its South Asian Free Trade Area. Pakistan used to host a pavilion at the annual India International Trade Fair which drew huge crowds. Deteriorating relations between the two nations resulted in a boycott of Pakistani traders at the trade fair. \c\cIn November 2015, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif agreed to the resumption of bilateral talks; the following month, Modi made a brief, unscheduled visit to Pakistan while en route to India, becoming the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Pakistan since 2004. Despite those efforts, relations between the countries have remained frigid, following repeated acts of cross-border terrorism. According to a 2017 BBC World Service poll, only 5% of Indians view Pakistans influence positively, with 85% expressing a negative view, while 11% of Pakistanis view Indias influence positively, with 62% expressing a negative view. \c\cIn August 2019, following the approval of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, which revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, further tension was brought between the two countries, with Pakistan downgrading their diplomatic ties, closing its airspace, and suspending bilateral trade with India.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The virus reached the country on 29 February 2020 and within three weeks, cases had been confirmed in all counties. The pandemic affected many aspects of society. On 12 March, the government shut all schools, colleges, childcare facilities and cultural institutions, and advised cancelling large gatherings. St Patricks Day festivities were called off, and the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, addressed the nation that night. On 24 March, almost all businesses, venues, facilities and amenities were shut; but gatherings of up to four people were allowed. Three days later on 27 March, the government imposed a stay-at-home order, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside ones home (including family and partners). The elderly and those with certain health conditions were told to cocoon. People were made keep apart in public. The Garda Síochána were given power to enforce the measures, which were repeatedly extended until 18 May. \c\cThe restrictions imposed caused a severe recession, an unprecedented rise in unemployment and caused major damage to all sectors. A COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and a Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme were set up. The 2020 Leaving Certificate, Junior Certificate and all 2020 Irish language summer courses in the Gaeltacht were cancelled. The Health Service Executive (HSE) launched a recruitment campaign, asking both healthcare and non-healthcare professionals to "be on call for Ireland". The previous government of the 32nd Dáil remained in post during the initial several months of the pandemic until its successor was appointed on 27 June. Dáil Éireann sat with fewer members and moved from its traditional home at Leinster House to the Convention Centre to facilitate social distancing requirements. The Oireachtas passed an emergency act giving the state power to detain people, restrict travel and keep people in their homes to control the viruss spread. Further emergency legislation passed the following week. \c\cBy mid-April, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported that the growth rate of the pandemic had been driven "as low as it needs to be", that the curve had flattened and that there would be no peak coming. Daily cases and deaths slowly declined in June and July 2020. In August, a three-week regional lockdown was imposed in three counties following a significant rise in confirmed cases mainly in meat processing plants. In October 2020, lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following a rapid surge in confirmed cases and the introduction of a second wave of COVID-19 in Ireland. The second lockdown resulted in Irelands 14-day incidence rate to be the lowest in the European Union, while restrictions eased in early December. A third wave of COVID-19 arrived in Ireland after restrictions eased. The government acted swiftly and on 24 December (Christmas Eve), lockdown restrictions were reimplemented nationwide following another surge in confirmed cases in Ireland. On St Stephens Day, the first shipment of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the Republic of Ireland. Vaccinations began three days later on 29 December 2020. \c\cBy 25 February 2021, the Department of Health had confirmed 217,478 cases and 4,271 deaths. More than 90% of those who have died were aged over 65, and most also had underlying illnesses or lived in care homes. As of 22 February 2021, 226,291 people had received the first dose of a vaccine and 133,325 people had received their second dose.
Brian David Sicknick (July 30, 1978 – January 7, 2021) was an American officer of the United States Capitol Police who died of an unknown cause a day after the 2021 storming of the Capitol. He lay in honor in the Capitol rotunda and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. A native of South River, New Jersey, Sicknick served in the New Jersey Air National Guard from 1997 through 2003. He was deployed to Operation Southern Watch in 1999 and Operation Enduring Freedom in 2003. Sicknick later moved to Springfield, Virginia, and joined the Capitol Police in 2008.
The assassination of Jamal Khashoggi—a Saudi dissident, journalist, columnist for The Washington Post, former editor of Al-Watan and former general manager and editor-in-chief of the Al-Arab News Channel—occurred on 2 October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, and was perpetrated by agents of the Saudi government. Lured to the consulate building on the pretext of providing him papers for his upcoming wedding, Khashoggi was ambushed, suffocated, and dismembered by a 15-member squad of Saudi assassins. Khashoggis final moments are captured in audio recordings, transcripts of which were subsequently made public. The Turkish investigation concluded that Khashoggi had been strangled as soon as he entered the consulate building, and that his body was dismembered and disposed of. Turkish investigators, as well as investigations by The New York Times, concluded that some of the 15 members of the Saudi hit team were closely connected to Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and that the team had traveled to Istanbul specifically to commit the murder. \c\cThe Saudi government engaged in an extensive effort to cover-up the killing, including destroying evidence. After repeatedly shifting its account of what happened to Khashoggi in the days following the killing, the Saudi government admitted that Khashoggi had been killed in a premeditated murder, but denied that the killing took place on the orders of bin Salman, who said he accepted responsibility for the killing "because it happened under my watch" but asserted that he did not order it. Turkish officials released an audio recording of Khashoggis killing that they alleged contained evidence that Khashoggi had been assassinated on the orders of  Mohammed bin Salman. By November 2018, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, based on multiple sources of intelligence, had concluded that bin Salman had ordered Khashoggis assassination. In the same month, the United States sanctioned 17 Saudi individuals under the Magnitsky Act over the Khashoggi murder, including former bin Salman advisor Saud Al-Qahtani, but did not sanction bin Salman himself. U.S. President Donald Trump disputed the CIA assessment, expressed support for bin Salman, and stated that the investigation into Khashoggis death had to continue. \c\cThe murder prompted intense global scrutiny and criticism of the Saudi government. A June 2019 report issued by Agnès Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, concluded that Khashoggis murder was "a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated." Callamard determined that responsibility for Khashoggis killing, and the elaborate campaign to cover it up, rests with the highest officials of the Saudi royal court and that "credible evidence" called for the "investigation of high-level Saudi officials individual liability, including the crown princes." Callamards report also detailed the role of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul in coordinating the killing, undercutting the claim that the murder was an unauthorized act by rogue operatives. The special rapporteur called for a criminal investigation to be undertaken by the UN and, because Khashoggi was a resident of the United States, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. \c\cIn January 2019, the Saudi government began trials against 11 Saudis accused of involvement in Khashoggis murder. In December 2019, following proceedings shrouded in secrecy, a Saudi court acquitted three defendants; sentenced five defendants to death; and sentenced three defendants to prison terms. The acquitted defendants, Saud al-Qahtani and Ahmed al-Asiri, were high-level Saudi security officials, while the five men sentenced to death were "essentially foot soldiers in the killing" and were eventually legally pardoned in May 2020 by Khashoggis children. Saudi prosecutors rejected the findings of the UN investigation and asserted that the killing "was not premeditated" but the decision to commit it was instead  "taken at the spur of the moment." UN special rapporteur Callamard said the Saudi verdict was a "mockery" because "the masterminds not only walk free, they have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial." Human rights group Amnesty International called the verdict a "whitewash" and the Turkish government said that the trials had fallen far short of "justice being served and accountability."
The Allied Democratic Forces insurgency is an ongoing conflict waged by the Allied Democratic Forces in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, against the governments of those two countries. The insurgency began in 1995, intensifying in 2013, resulting in hundreds of deaths. The ADF is known to currently control a number of hidden camps which are home to about 2,000 people; in these camps, the ADF operates as proto-state with "an internal security service, a prison, health clinics, and an orphanage" as well as schools for boys and girls.
The COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in New Zealand was reported on 28 February 2020. As of 28 February 2021, the country has had a total of 2,376 cases (2,020 confirmed and 356 probable). 26 people have died from the virus, with cases recorded in all twenty district health board (DHB) areas. The pandemic peaked in early April, with 89 new cases recorded per day and 929 active cases. \c\cAll borders and entry ports of New Zealand were closed to all non-residents on 19 March 2020, with returning citizens and residents being required to self-isolate. Since 10 April, all New Zealanders returning from overseas must go into two weeks of managed isolation. \c\cA four-level alert level system was introduced on 21 March to manage the outbreak within New Zealand. The alert level was initially set at level 2, but was subsequently raised to level 3 on the afternoon of 23 March. Beginning on 25 March, the alert level was moved to level 4, putting the country into a nationwide lockdown. The alert level was moved back down to level 3 on 27 April, partially lifting some lockdown restrictions, and down to level 2 on 13 May, lifting the rest of the lockdown restrictions while maintaining physical distancing and gathering size limits. The country moved down to level 1 on 8 June, removing all remaining restrictions except border controls. \c\cOn 11 August, four cases of COVID-19 from an unknown source were reported in Auckland, the first from an unknown source in 102 days. At noon the following day, the Auckland Region moved up to alert level 3, while the rest of the country was moved to level 2. On 30 August at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to "alert level 2.5", a modified version of alert level 2 with limitation on public gatherings, funerals, and weddings. On 23 September at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to alert level 2, after the rest of New Zealand moved to alert level 1 on 21 September at 11:59pm. On 7 October, Auckland also moved down to level 1. \c\cOn 14 February 2021, three community cases of COVID-19 were detected in Auckland. On the same day, at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved up to level 3 while the rest of New Zealand moved to level 2. On 17 February at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to level 2 while the rest of New Zealand to level 1. On 22 February at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to level 1. On 28 February at 6:00 am, Auckland up to level 3 while the rest of New Zealand moved to level 2. \c\cNew Zealands approach to the pandemic has been widely praised internationally for its quick and tough action over the virus, having completed 1,030,115 tests as of 18 October 2020.
Operation Madago Raya (Indonesian: Operasi Madago Raya), previously known as Operation Tinombala, is a joint-military operation conducted by the Indonesian National Police and the Indonesian Armed Forces to capture and/or eliminate members of Mujahidin Indonesia Timur (MIT), an Indonesian terrorist group which supports ISIL and was commanded by Santoso. Recently, the Indonesian military and police succeeded in killing Santoso, but General Tito Karnavian continued the operation to ensure the regions safety from the remaining eleven members of the group. Central Sulawesi governor Longki Djanggola praised the operation for its relatively humane methods, since several leaders of the group were successfully captured alive.
The Nicolas Sarkozy corruption trial was a trial in France into allegations that former president Nicolas Sarkozy bribed a judge with a retirement package in return for information on an investigation into alleged campaign finance violations due to payments he is said to have received from heiress Liliane Bettencourt. The trial opened on 24 November 2020. Prosecutors have asked for a four-year jail sentence for Sarkozy, the judge (Gilbert Azibert) as well as Sarkozys lawyer, Thierry Herzog, of which two years would be suspended. On 4 December 2020, Ziad Takieddine, a Lebanese businessman who allegedly helped finance Sarkozys 2007 campaign with help from former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, was detained in Lebanon. but was allowed a condition prison a few days later after agreeing to abide by a travel ban. The defendants deny the accusations. The trial concluded on 10 December; the verdict was carried out on 1 March 2021. On that date, Sarkozy was found guilty and sentenced to three years in jail for corruption.
The 2009–present phase of the Somali Civil War is concentrated in southern and central Somalia and portions of north eastern Kenya. It began in early February 2009 with the conflict between the forces of the Federal Government of Somalia, assisted by African Union peacekeeping troops, and various militant groups and factions. The violence has displaced thousands of people in the southern part of the country. The conflict has also seen fighting between the Sufi Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a and Al-Shabaab. \c\cOn 16 October 2011, the Kenyan Army crossed the border into Somalia in Operation Linda Nchi against Al-Shabaab. It aimed to seize Kismayo and set up a buffer zone against Al-Shabaab. In 2012, Kismayo was captured. \c\cIn August 2014, the Somali government-led Operation Indian Ocean was launched to clean up the remaining insurgent-held pockets in the countryside. \c\cIn 2017, the 14 October and 28 October Mogadishu bombings were responsible for the deaths of over 500 individuals and injured more than 400.
The Zamfara kidnapping (or Jangebe kidnapping) was a mass kidnapping of female students in Jangebe (also rendered Dengebe), Zamfara, Nigeria. On 26 February 2021, 279 girls aged 12–17 years old were kidnapped by armed bandits, who raided the Government Girls Science Secondary School, a boarding school. The students were later released. \c\cIt is the second school kidnapping in Nigeria during 2021, occurring nine days after the Kagara kidnapping, in which over 40 people were abducted in a raid on a state school in the state of Niger, and the third in less than three months.
The 2020–2021 Indian farmers protest is an ongoing protest against three farm acts which were passed by the Parliament of India in September 2020. \c\cFarmer unions and their representatives have demanded that the laws be repealed and have stated that they will not accept a compromise. Farmer leaders have welcomed the Supreme Court of India stay order on the implementation of the farm laws but rejected the committee appointed by the Supreme Court. Farmer leaders have also rejected a government proposal, dated 21 January 2021, of suspending the laws for 18 months. Eleven rounds of talks have taken place between the central government and farmers represented by the farm unions between 14 October 2020 and 22 January 2021; all were inconclusive. On 3 February, farmer leaders warned of escalating the protest to overthrowing the government if the farm laws were not repealed. However, the stay order on the implementation of the farm laws remains in effect as of 29 January, and the Supreme Court appointed committee continues with its tasks related to the farm laws and have asked for suggestions from the public before 20 February 2021. \c\cThe acts, often called the Farm Bills, have been described as "anti-farmer laws" by many farmer unions, and politicians from the opposition also say it would leave farmers at the "mercy of corporates". The farmers have also demanded the creation of an Minimum Support Price (MSP) bill, to ensure that corporates cannot control the prices. The government, however, maintains that the laws will make it effortless for farmers to sell their produce directly to big buyers, and stated that the protests are based on misinformation. \c\cSoon after the acts were introduced, unions began holding local protests, mostly in Punjab. After two months of protests, farmer unions—notably from Punjab and Haryana—began a movement named Dilhi Chalo (transl. Lets go to Delhi), in which tens of thousands of farming union members marched towards the nations capital. The Indian government ordered the police and law enforcement of various states to attack the protesters using water cannons, batons, and tear gas to prevent the farmer unions from entering into Haryana first and then Delhi. On 26 November 2020, a nationwide general strike of 250 million people, as per trade unions claim, took place in support of the farmer unions. On 30 November, an estimated crowd of  200,000 and 300,000 farmers was converging at various border points on the way to Delhi. \c\cWhile a section of farmer unions have been protesting, the Indian Government claims some unions have come out in support of the farm laws. Transport unions representing over 14 million truck drivers have come out in support of the farmer unions, threatening to halt movement of supplies in certain states. After the government rejected the farmer unions demands during talks on 4 December, the unions planned to escalate the action to another India-wide strike on 8 December 2020. The government offered some amendments in laws, but unions demanded a complete repeal the laws. From 12 December, farmer unions took over highway toll plazas in Haryana and allowed free movement of vehicles. \c\cBy mid December, the Supreme Court of India had received a batch of petitions asking for removal blockades created by the protesters around Delhi. The court also asked the government to put the laws on hold, which they refused. On 4 January 2021 the court registered the first plea filed in favour of the protesting farmers. Farmers have said they will not listen to the courts if told to back off. Their leaders have also said that staying the farm laws is not a solution. \c\cOn 30 December, the Indian Government agreed to two of the farmers demands; excluding farmers from laws curbing stubble burning and dropping amendments to the new Electricity Ordinance. \c\cOn 26 January, tens of thousands of the farmers protesting against the agricultural reforms held a farmers parade with a large convoy of tractors and drove into Delhi. The protesters deviated from the pre-sanctioned routes permitted by the Delhi Police. The tractor rally turned into a violent protest at certain points as the protesting farmers drove through the barricades and clashed with the police. Later protesters reached Red Fort and installed farmer union flags and religious flags on the mast on the rampart of the Red Fort.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. \c\cThe Government of Canada released modelling in early April, 2020 anticipating 11,000–22,000 deaths over the course of the pandemic, assuming "stronger epidemic control". \c\cMost cases over the course of the pandemic have been in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta. Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canadas provinces and territories, with Nunavut reporting its first confirmed case on November 6. Until March, all cases were linked to recent travel to a country with a substantial number of cases. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5. In mid-March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canadas provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented school and daycare closures, prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses, restrictions on entry, and mandatory self-isolation for travellers. Canada severely restricted its border access, barring travellers from all countries with some exceptions. The federal Minister of Health invoked the Quarantine Act for the first time in its legislative history, legally requiring all travellers (excluding essential workers) returning to the country to self-isolate for 14 days. \c\cBy mid to late summer of 2020, the country saw a steady decline in active cases. Beginning late summer and through autumn, the country saw a resurgence of cases in all provinces and territories. Prime Minister Trudeau declared that Canada was experiencing a second wave of the virus. New restrictions and reactions from provincial governments were put in place once again as cases increased, including variations of regional lockdowns. In late November there was a disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble, a travel-restricted area of the country set up amongst New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia & Newfoundland and Labrador. The federal government passed legislation to approve further modified economic aid for businesses and individuals. \c\cFollowing Health Canadas approval of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and later the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna, vaccinations began nation-wide December 14, 2020. On February 26, 2021 Health Canada approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for use and on March 5, 2021 additionally approved the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for a total of four approved vaccines in the nation. \c\cNation-wide cases, hospitalizations and deaths spiked preceding and following the Christmas and holiday season in December 2020 and January 2021. Alarmed by hospital capacity issues, fatalities and new cases, heavy restrictions (such as lockdowns and curfews) were put in place in affected areas (primarily Ontario, Quebec and Alberta) and across the country, which has resulted in active cases beginning to steadily decline.
During the afternoon of 7 March 2021, a series of four explosions occurred at a military barracks in the Nkoantoma district of Bata, the largest city and former capital of Equatorial Guinea.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of March 8, 2021, 598,014 cases have been confirmed, causing 15,670 confirmed deaths. As of March 5, 2021, 549,881 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. The state defines recovery as "still alive 30 days after onset of illness". \c\cAs of March 8, 2021, Michigan has administered 2,765,577 COVID-19 vaccine doses. As of that date, 17.9% of the states population has received the first dose while 10% has received the second dose.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the U.S. state of Alaska on March 12, 2020. \c\cOn March 11, Governor Mike Dunleavys office declared a state of emergency to ensure all entities have the necessary response resources. The next day, the first case, a foreign national in Anchorage, was announced to the public. \c\cAs of December 29, 2020, Alaska has administered 13,271 COVID-19 vaccine doses, equivalent to 1.81% of the population. It is leading the U.S. in the percentage of state residents to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
The 2021 Myanmar coup d'état began on the early morning of 1 February 2021 when democratically elected members of Myanmars ruling party, the National League for Democracy, were deposed by the Tatmadaw—Myanmars military—which vested power in a stratocracy. The Tatmadaw proclaimed a year-long state of emergency and declared power had been vested in Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing. It declared the results of the November 2020 general election invalid and stated its intent to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency even though most of Myanmars population are satisfied with the results of the election. The coup d'état occurred the day before the Parliament of Myanmar was due to swear in the members elected at the 2020 election, thereby preventing this coup from occurring. President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi were detained, along with ministers, their deputies and members of Parliament. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, Win Myint was charged with breaching campaign guidelines and COVID-19 pandemic restrictions under section 25 of the Natural Disaster Management Law. Aung San Suu Kyi was charged with breaching emergency COVID-19 laws and for illegally importing and using radio and communication devices, specifically six ICOM devices from her security team and a walkie-talkie, which are restricted in Myanmar and need clearance from military-related agencies before acquisition. Both were remanded in custody for two weeks. Suu Kyi received an additional criminal charge for violating the National Disaster Act on 16 February,  and two additional charges for violating communications laws and an intent to incite public unrest on 1 March. \c\cAs of 4 March, at least 50 people have been killed in anti-military protests, and at least 1700 arbitrarily detained, since the coup took place.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Tanzania in March 2020. \c\cAuthorities stopped reporting case numbers in May 2020 after President John Magufuli alleged that the national laboratory was returning false positives. Since then, Tanzania has become one of the few countries in the world that does not release COVID-19 infection data, the others being North Korea and Turkmenistan.
Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women. He has denied all allegations and subsequently apologized for his comments being interpreted as sexual. On February 28, 2021, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that she would hire and deputize a law firm to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations. On March 11, the New York State Assembly authorized an impeachment investigation into the allegations.
The COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Brian David Sicknick (July 30, 1978 – January 7, 2021) was an American officer of the United States Capitol Police who died of an unknown cause a day after the 2021 storming of the Capitol. He lay in honor in the Capitol rotunda and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. A native of South River, New Jersey, Sicknick served in the New Jersey Air National Guard from 1997 through 2003. He was deployed to Operation Southern Watch in 1999 and Operation Enduring Freedom in 2003. Sicknick later moved to Springfield, Virginia, and joined the Capitol Police in 2008.
Brexit (/ˈbrɛksɪt, ˈbrɛɡzɪt/; a portmanteau of "British exit") was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) at the end of 31 January 2020 CET. To date, the UK is the first and only country formally to leave the EU, after 47 years of being a member state within the bloc, after having first joined its predecessor, the European Communities (EC), on 1 January 1973. It continued to participate in the European Union Customs Union and European Single Market during a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 at 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET). \c\cThe European Union and its institutions have developed gradually since their establishment, including 47 years of British membership, and grew to be of significant importance to the UK. Throughout that time Eurosceptic groups had existed, opposing aspects of the Union and its predecessors. Prime Minister Harold Wilson’s pro-Europe government held a referendum on continued EC membership in 1975 in which voters chose to stay within the bloc with 67.2% of the vote share, but no further referendums were held as the project grew and became "ever-closer" in the subsequent Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. Facing pressure from Eurosceptic groups, Prime Minister David Camerons pro-Europe government held a second referendum on continued EU membership in 2016 in which voters chose to leave the EU with 51.9% of the vote share. This led to his resignation, replacement by Theresa May, and four years of negotiations with the EU on the terms of departure and future relations. This process was both politically challenging and deeply divisive within the UK, with one deal rejected by the British parliament, general elections held in 2017 and 2019, and two new Prime Ministers in that time, both Conservative. Under Boris Johnsons government, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 CET; trade deal negotiations continued to within days of the scheduled end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 CET. \c\cThe effects of Brexit will in part be determined by the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was agreed on 24 December 2020 and ratified by the UK Parliament on 30 December 2020 and was "provisionally" applied by the EU from 31 December 2020. The broad consensus among economists is that Brexit will likely harm the UKs economy and reduce its real per capita income in the long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy. Brexit is likely to reduce immigration from European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the UK, and poses challenges for British higher education, academic research and security; the Turing scheme was announced as a new global student exchange programme in early 2021 to combat this. Following Brexit, EU law and the EU Court of Justice no longer have supremacy over British laws or its Supreme Court. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which the UK could then amend or repeal.
On March 16, 2021, a string of mass shootings occurred at massage parlors in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. At least eight people were killed in incidents at three different massage parlor locations, and another person was wounded. Authorities have not linked the shootings.
The Mali War is an ongoing armed conflict that started in January 2012 between the northern and southern parts of Mali in Africa. On 16 January 2012, several insurgent groups began fighting a campaign against the Malian government for independence or greater autonomy for northern Mali, which they called Azawad. The National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), an organization fighting to make this area of Mali an independent homeland for the Tuareg people, had taken control of the region by April 2012. \c\cOn 22 March 2012, President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted in a coup d'état over his handling of the crisis, a month before a presidential election was to have taken place. Mutinous soldiers, calling themselves the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDR), took control and suspended the constitution of Mali. As a consequence of the instability following the coup, Malis three largest northern cities—Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu—were overrun by the rebels on three consecutive days. On 5 April 2012, after the capture of Douentza, the MNLA said that it had accomplished its goals and called off its offensive. The following day, it proclaimed the independence of northern Mali from the rest of the country, renaming it Azawad. \c\cThe MNLA were initially backed by the Islamist group Ansar Dine. After the Malian military was driven from northern Mali, Ansar Dine and a number of smaller Islamist groups began imposing strict Sharia law. The MNLA and Islamists struggled to reconcile their conflicting visions for an intended new state. Afterwards, the MNLA began fighting against Ansar Dine and other Islamist groups, including Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA/MUJAO), a splinter group of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. By 17 July 2012, the MNLA had lost control of most of northern Malis cities to the Islamists. \c\cThe government of Mali asked for foreign military help to re-take the north. On 11 January 2013, the French military began operations against the Islamists. Forces from other African Union states were deployed shortly after. By 8 February, the Islamist-held territory had been re-taken by the Malian military, with help from the international coalition. Tuareg separatists have continued to fight the Islamists as well, although the MNLA has also been accused of carrying out attacks against the Malian military. \c\cA peace deal between the government and Tuareg rebels was signed on 18 June 2013, however on 26 September 2013 the rebels pulled out of the peace agreement and claimed that the government had not respected its commitments to the truce. Fighting is still ongoing even though French forces are scheduled for withdrawal.  A ceasefire agreement was signed on 19 February 2015 in Algiers, Algeria, but sporadic terrorist attacks still occur. \c\cDespite the signing of a peace accord in the capital on 15 April 2015, low-level fighting continues.
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread to the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar in March 2020. The first death in Gibraltar occurred on 11 November 2020. As of 29 January 2021, there are 4,082 confirmed cases, 3,530 recoveries, and 73 deaths.
The Houthi–Saudi Arabian conflict is an ongoing armed conflict between the Royal Saudi Armed Forces and Yemeni Houthi forces that has been taking place in the Arabian Peninsula, including the southern Saudi regions of Asir, Jizan, and Najran, and northern Yemeni governorates of Saada, AL-Jawf, and Hajjah, since the onset of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in 2015. \c\cOver the course of the conflict the Houthis have carried out attacks on military bases and outposts in Saudi Arabia.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in the Philippines was identified on January 30, 2020 and involved a 38-year-old Chinese woman who was confined at San Lazaro Hospital in Metro Manila. On February 1, a posthumous test result from a 44-year-old Chinese man turned out positive for the virus, making the Philippines the first country outside China to record a confirmed death from the disease. \c\cAfter over a month without recording any cases, the Philippines confirmed its first local transmission on March 7, 2020. Since then, the virus has spread with at least one case being recorded in the countrys 81 provinces. Socio-economic status has been associated with the prevalence of COVID-19 cases across the country. Lockdowns, or community quarantines, have been imposed throughout the country since March 15, 2020 as a measure to limit the spread of the virus. The largest of these measures was the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon. \c\cAs of March 19, 2021, there have been 648,066 confirmed cases of the disease in the country. Out of these cases, 561,902 recoveries and 12,900 deaths were recorded. It has the 2nd highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia (after Indonesia), and ranks 8th in Asia, and 30th in the world. The largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases was reported on March 19, 2021, when the Department of Health (DOH) announced 7,103 new cases. \c\cThe Philippines had a slightly lower testing capacity than its neighbors in Southeast Asia during the first months of the pandemic in the country. COVID-19 tests had to be taken outside the country due to the lack of testing kits. This also has led to a controversy that involved several government officials who were reported to have undergone COVID-19 tests without qualifying to the DOHs triage algorithm. By the end of January 2020, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila began its testing operations and became the countrys first subnational laboratory. Several laboratories have been accredited by the DOH since then. As of March 10, the country has 228 subnational laboratories capable of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has conducted a total of 9,098,642 tests from more than 8,570,730 unique individuals.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Pakistan on 26 February 2020, when two cases were recorded (a student in Karachi who had just returned from Iran and another person in the Islamabad Capital Territory). On 18 March 2020, cases had been registered in all four provinces, the two autonomous territories, and Islamabad Capital Territory, and by 17 June, each district in Pakistan had recorded at least one confirmed case of COVID-19. \c\cPakistan currently has the 2nd-highest number of confirmed cases in South Asia (after India); the 9th-highest number of confirmed cases in Asia; and the 31st highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 15 June, daily new confirmed case numbers reached their peak, with 6,825 new cases recorded, but since then, new daily cases and the percentage of people testing positive have trended downwards. In late June, the number of active cases in Pakistan stabilized, and beginning in July, started showing a significant decrease. On 2 July, recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time as 8,929 recoveries were recorded, meaning that 51% of all confirmed cases in the country to date had recovered. While Pakistan has the worlds 31st highest case count, it only has the worlds 29th highest death count. \c\cThe province of Sindh has recorded the most cases at about 134,000, and has also recorded the most deaths due to COVID-19, about 2,500 to date. The country was put under a nation-wide lockdown from April 1 and extended twice until 9 May. Upon its end, the lockdown was eased in phases. \c\cThe distribution of COVID-19 in Pakistan is heavily concentrated in a few key areas. The city of Karachi (as of 5 September 2020) has recorded about 84,000 confirmed cases, making up about 28% of all cases of COVID-19 in Pakistan. Meanwhile, Lahore, the countrys second-largest city, has recorded (as of 5 September 2020) 49,000 cases of COVID-19, making up about 16% of the countrys cases. Islamabad Capital Territory and Peshawar District have also both recorded over 10,000 cases. Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar account for about 163,000 cases, which make up nearly 55% of the countrys total confirmed cases.
The 2021 Tillabéri attacks are an ongoing series of attacks by militants on civilians and soldiers in the Tillabéri region of western Niger that have left 230 dead and at least 78 injured.
The 2021 Niger attacks are an ongoing series of attacks by militants on civilians in Niger, mainly in the western region of Tillabéri. The attacks have left at least 307 people dead and 78 others injured.
The insurgency in the Maghreb refers to the Islamist insurgency in the Maghreb and Sahel regions of North Africa that followed on from the Algerian Civil War. The Algerian militant group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) allied itself with al-Qaeda to eventually become al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The Algerian and other Maghreb governments fighting the militants have worked with the United States and the United Kingdom since 2007, when Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara began. While the 2011 Arab Spring affected support for the insurgency, it also presented military opportunities for the jihadists. In 2012, AQIM and Islamist allies captured the northern half of Mali, until being fought back less than a year later following a French-led foreign intervention, which was succeeded by the Sahel-wide Operation Barkhane. In Libya, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has been able to control some limited territory in the ongoing civil war since 2014, amid allegations of local collaboration between the rival AQIM and ISIL.
The Zogg Fire was a wildfire that burned in the towns of Igo and Ono in southwestern Shasta County, California and northwestern Tehama County in the United States. The fire burned 56,338 acres, with four deaths and 204 buildings destroyed.
The legality of corporal punishment of children varies by country. Corporal punishment of minor children by parents or adult guardians, which is intended to cause physical pain, has been traditionally legal in nearly all countries unless explicitly outlawed. According to a 2014 estimate by Human Rights Watch, "Ninety percent of the worlds children live in countries where corporal punishment and other physical violence against children is still legal". Many countries laws provide for a defence of "reasonable chastisement" against charges of assault and other crimes for parents using corporal punishment. This defence is ultimately derived from English law.
Legislative elections will be held in Israel on 23 March 2021 to elect the 120 members of the 24th Knesset.
A coup d'état in Myanmar began on the morning of 1 February 2021, when democratically elected members of Myanmars ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed by the Tatmadaw—Myanmars military—which vested power in a stratocracy. The Tatmadaw proclaimed a year-long state of emergency and declared power had been vested in Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing. It declared the results of the November 2020 general election invalid and stated its intent to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency even though most of Myanmars people are satisfied with the results of the election. The coup d'état occurred the day before the Parliament of Myanmar was due to swear in the members elected at the 2020 election, thereby preventing this coup from occurring. President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi were detained, along with ministers, their deputies and members of Parliament. \c\cOn 3 February 2021, Win Myint was charged with breaching campaign guidelines and COVID-19 pandemic restrictions under section 25 of the Natural Disaster Management Law. Aung San Suu Kyi was charged with breaching emergency COVID-19 laws and for illegally importing and using radio and communication devices, specifically six ICOM devices from her security team and a walkie-talkie, which are restricted in Myanmar and need clearance from military-related agencies before acquisition. Both were remanded in custody for two weeks. Aung San Suu Kyi received an additional criminal charge for violating the National Disaster Act on 16 February,  and two additional charges for violating communications laws and an intent to incite public unrest on 1 March. \c\cAs of 16 March, at least 184 people have been killed in subsequent protests against the coup, and at least 1,700 have been arbitrarily detained. Three prominent NLD members also died while in police custody in March 2021.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 30 million confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 545,000 deaths, the most of any country, and the tenth-highest per capita worldwide. The U.S. has nearly a quarter of the worlds cases, and a fifth of all deaths. More Americans have died from COVID-19 than died during World War II. COVID-19 became the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. U.S. life expectancy dropped from 78.8 years in 2019 to 77.8 years in the first half of 2020. \c\cOn December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. Meanwhile, Trump remained optimistic on the future of the coronavirus in the United States. \c\cThe first known American deaths occurred in February. On March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak. On March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency. In mid-March, the Trump administration started to purchase large quantities of medical equipment, and in late March, it invoked the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories. By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, and by November in all inhabited U.S. territories. A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states, leading to daily cases surpassing 60,000. A third rise in infections began around mid-October, leading to daily cases reaching over 100,000 by the end of the month. \c\cState and local responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and school closures. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas.
Capital punishment was abolished in Virginia on March 24, 2021, when Governor Ralph Northam signed the bill into law. The law will take effect on July 1, 2021, but no executions will take place before that date. Virginia is the 23rd state to abolish the death penalty, and the first Southern state to do so. \c\cThe first execution in what would become the United States was carried out in Jamestown, Virginia in 1608 when Captain George Kendall was executed in Jamestown for spying. Since then, Virginia has executed more than 1,300 people, the most of any other state.  In the modern, post-Gregg era, Virginia conducted 113 executions, the second most in the country, behind only Texas. \c\cThe last execution in the state was in July 2017, when William Morva was executed via lethal injection for murder.
Capital punishment, also called the death penalty, is a legal penalty in the United States, with it being a legal punishment in 27 states, American Samoa, the federal government, and the military. Although it is a legal penalty in 27 states, only 20 states have the ability to execute death sentences, with the other 7 being subject to different types of moratoria. Its existence can be traced to the beginning of the American colonies. Along with Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore, the United States is one of four advanced democracies and the only Western nation that applies the death penalty regularly. \c\cIt is one of 48 countries worldwide applying it, and was the first to develop lethal injection as a method of execution, which has since been adopted by five other countries. The Philippines has since abolished executions, and Guatemala has done so for civil offenses, leaving the United States as one of four countries to still use this method (along with China, Thailand, and Vietnam). In Singapore and Japan, executions are carried out by long drop hanging. In Taiwan, the preferred method of execution has long been by fatal gunshot; though never used, lethal injection was considered by authorities in the past and remains an option on the books. It is common practice worldwide for the condemned to be administered sedatives prior to execution, regardless of the method used. \c\cThere were no executions in the United States between 1967 and 1977. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment statutes in Furman v. Georgia, reducing all death sentences pending at the time to life imprisonment. Subsequently, a majority of states enacted new death penalty statutes, and the court affirmed the legality of capital punishment in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia. Since then, more than 7,800 defendants have been sentenced to death; of these, more than 1,500 have been executed. A total of at least 185 people who were sentenced to death since 1972 have since been exonerated. As of December 16, 2020, 2,591 convicts are still on death row. \c\cThe Trump administrations Department of Justice announced its plans to resume executions for federal crimes in 2019. On July 14, 2020, Daniel Lewis Lee became the first inmate executed by the federal government since 2003. There are currently 49 inmates on federal death row. 13 federal death row inmates have been executed since federal executions resumed in July 2020. The last and most recent federal execution was of Dustin Higgs, who was executed on January 16, 2021. Higgs' execution was also the last under the presidency of Donald Trump. It is currently unknown if federal executions will continue during the presidency of Joe Biden, although Biden does oppose capital punishment in the United States.

The 2020–2021 Belarusian protests are a series of ongoing political demonstrations and protests against the Belarusian government and President Alexander Lukashenko. The largest anti-government protests in the history of Belarus, the demonstrations began in the lead-up to and during the 2020 presidential election, in which Lukashenko sought his sixth term in office. In response to the demonstrations, a number of relatively small pro-government rallies were held. \c\cInitially modest, the protests intensified nationwide after official election results were announced on the night of 10 August, in which Lukashenko was declared the winner. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opponent of Lukashenko, rejected these results as falsified and claimed instead to have received 60–70% of the votes. On 14 August, she announced the creation of the Coordination Council, with membership applications open to all Belarusians who also agreed that the official election had been falsified. On 12 October, the Coordination Council issued Lukashenko an ultimatum to cease all repression, free detainees and step down from the presidency by 25 October. After Lukashenko failed to comply, nationwide strikes began on 26 October. \c\cOn 23 September, Belarusian state media announced that Lukashenko had been inaugurated for another five-year term in a brief ceremony which was held privately. The following day, the EU published a statement which rejected the legitimacy of the election, called for new elections, and condemned the repression and violence against the protesters. On 2 October, the EU introduced sanctions against 40 Belarusian officials accused of political repression and vote rigging. Lukashenko himself was not included on the list. The Belarusian government responded by imposing symmetrical sanctions against an undisclosed list of EU officials. Moreover, Lukashenko accused the EU and other "Western organizations" of trying to "harm Belarus" by destabilizing the current regime while supporting the opposition. \c\cThe protesters have faced violent persecution by the authorities. A statement by the United Nations Human Rights Office on 1 September cited more than 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, as well as reports of sexual abuse and rape. At the end of 2020, the Viasna Human Rights Centre documented 1,000 testimonies of torture victims.
The COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in the Philippines was identified on January 30, 2020 and involved a 38-year-old Chinese woman who was confined at San Lazaro Hospital in Metro Manila. On February 1, a posthumous test result from a 44-year-old Chinese man turned out positive for the virus, making the Philippines the first country outside China to record a confirmed death from the disease. \c\cAfter over a month without recording any cases, the Philippines confirmed its first local transmission on March 7, 2020. Since then, the virus has spread with at least one case being recorded in the countrys 81 provinces. Socio-economic status has been associated with the prevalence of COVID-19 cases across the country. Lockdowns, or community quarantines, have been imposed throughout the country since March 15, 2020 as a measure to limit the spread of the virus. The largest of these measures was the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon. \c\cAs of March 25, 2021, the Philippines has reported 693,048 cases of the disease. Out of these cases, 580,062 recoveries and 13,095 deaths have been recorded. It has the 2nd highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia (after Indonesia), and ranks 8th in Asia, and 30th in the world. The largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases was reported on March 25, 2021, when the Department of Health (DOH) announced 8,773 new cases. \c\cThe Philippines had a slightly lower testing capacity than its neighbors in Southeast Asia during the first months of the pandemic in the country. COVID-19 tests had to be taken outside the country due to the lack of testing kits. This also has led to a controversy that involved several government officials who were reported to have undergone COVID-19 tests without qualifying to the DOHs triage algorithm. By the end of January 2020, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila began its testing operations and became the countrys first subnational laboratory. Several laboratories have been accredited by the DOH since then. As of March 19, the country has 228 subnational laboratories capable of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has conducted a total of 9,587,966 tests from more than 9,027,008 unique individuals.
The Battle of Palma is an ongoing battle over control of Palma in Mozambique, between Mozambican security forces and Islamist rebels. The siege if part of the Insurgency in Cabo Delgado, which started in 2017 and resulted in the death of thousands of people, mainly local civilians.
China–Iran relations (Chinese: 中国–伊朗关系, Persian: روابط ایران و چین) refer to the economic, political, and social relations between China and Iran from the 1979 Iranian Revolution to the present. Official relations began in 1937. The two civilizations have had a history of cultural, political, and economic exchanges along the Silk Road since at least 200 BC, and possibly earlier. To this day, China and Iran have developed a friendly economic and strategic partnership. \c\cIn March 2021, Iran and China signed a 25-year cooperation agreement that will strengthen the relations between the two countries and that will include “political, strategic and economic” components.
The Palma siege is an ongoing siege in Palma, a city in the region of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, that started on 24 March 2021. The siege if part of the Insurgency in Cabo Delgado, which started in 2017 and resulted in the death of thousands of people, mainly local civilians. The conflict is lead by Islamic State-linked militants, who are attempting to take control of the region and eventually of the entire country. Since the conflict began, other cities and towns were under siege, but those were repelled, marking the Palma siege as the longest and deadliest siege in the country since 2017.
The Battle of Palma is an ongoing battle over control of Palma in Mozambique. Fought between Mozambican security forces and Islamist rebels, it is part of the wider Insurgency in Cabo Delgado.
The Insurgency in Cabo Delgado is an ongoing conflict in Cabo Delgado Province, Mozambique, mainly fought between Islamist militants attempting to establish an Islamic state in the region, and Mozambican security forces. Civilians have been the main targets of attacks by Islamist militants. The main insurgent faction is Ansar al-Sunna, a native extremist faction with tenuous international connections. From mid-2018, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has allegedly become active in northern Mozambique as well, and claimed its first attack against Mozambican security forces in June 2019. In addition, bandits have exploited the rebellion to carry out raids. The insurgency is thought to be intensifying, as in the first half of 2020 there were nearly as many attacks carried out as in the whole of 2019. \c\cAnsar al-Sunna (English: Supporters of the tradition) is similar to the name of an Iraqi Sunni insurgent group that fought against US troops between 2003 and 2007. Locals call them "al-Shabaab" but they are a separate organization from Somali Al-Shabaab. The militants are known to speak Portuguese, the official language of Mozambique, Kimwane, the local language, and Swahili, the lingua franca language spoken in the Great Lakes region. Reports also state that members are mostly Mozambicans from Mocimboa da Praia, Palma and Macomia districts, but also include foreign nationals from Tanzania and Somalia.
The enhanced community quarantine in Luzon is a series of stay-at-home orders and cordon sanitaire measures implemented by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) on the island of Luzon and its associated islands. It is part of the COVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines, a larger scale of COVID-19 containment measures with varying degrees of strictness. The "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ) is the strictest of these measures and is effectively a total lockdown. \c\cThere were three instances of the ECQ being implemented in Luzon. The first was implemented between March 17 and May 31, 2020. This was announced on March 16, two days after the government of the Philippines under Rodrigo Duterte placed Metro Manila under a "community quarantine" on March 14. It was implemented throughout Luzon from March 17 until April 30, and remained in areas with a high risk of infection until May 31. New degrees such as "modified enhanced community quarantine" (MECQ) and "general community quarantine" (GCQ) were introduced by the IATF-EID during the month of May as easing restrictions commenced, until all restrictions under ECQ and MECQ were downgraded to GCQ and "modified general community quarantine" (MGCQ) on June 1. \c\cAfter two months of a relaxed GCQ status, a second MECQ was reimplemented in Metro Manila and its immediate surrounding provinces on August 4 and was lifted on August 18. Finally, on January 24, 2021, a third ECQ was restored in Tabuk while an MECQ was raised in four more municipalities in Kalinga. It was lifted on February 15. \c\cThe ECQ affected around 57 million people in Luzon during its peak. It also resulted in the mobilization of the national and local governments, with the  Bayanihan to Heal as One Act passed to combat the epidemic. The effectiveness of the ECQ implementation was noted by a study made by the University of the Philippines, although there were also several documented cases of violations of ECQ regulations. Authorities then pushed for stricter enforcement, which in turn raised concerns of human rights violations.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Mexico in February 2020. However, the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) reported two cases of COVID-19 in mid-January 2020 in the states of Nayarit and Tabasco, one case per state.  The Secretariat of Health, though the "Programa Centinela" (Spanish for "Sentinel Program"), estimated in mid-July 2020 that there were more than 2,875,734 cases in Mexico because they were considering the total number of cases confirmed as just a statistical sample.
On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the arrests of 13 men suspected of orchestrating a domestic terror plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Governor of Michigan, and otherwise violently overthrow the state government. The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court.

On 3 January 2021, Islamic extremists confronted a wedding in a village in Mopti Region, central Mali, ordering the attendees to separate by gender. An airstrike then killed at least 20 people, according to witnesses. The French Army said they killed "dozens" of Islamist militants in the area on that day, but that a connection between the strike and a wedding party "does not correspond to information collected prior to the airstrike". \c\cOn 30 March 2021, the MINUSMA United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali said their probe concluded that the French strike on a wedding attended by about 100 civilians and five armed men, presumably members of a group affiliated with al-Qaeda, killed 19 unarmed civilians and three armed men.
On 31 March 2021, at around 16:30 Western Indonesia Time (UTC+7), a shooting occurred at the Indonesian National Police headquarters in Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta, Indonesia. A female assailant attacked police headquarters with a handgun and was shot dead after firing several rounds. The shooting happened just three days after the cathedral bombing in Makassar.
On March 31, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at an office complex in Orange, California, United States. Four people were killed, including a child, and a fifth person was critically wounded. The suspect was critically injured following a shootout with responding police officers and taken into custody. \c\cAccording to police, the shooting was the worst in the city since December 1997, when a gunman killed four people and wounded at least three others at a California Department of Transportation maintenance yard.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10, 2020. As of April 1, 2021, 678,295 cases have been confirmed, causing 16,141 confirmed deaths. As of March 26, 2021, 569,460 people in the state have recovered from COVID-19. The state defines recovery as "still alive 30 days after onset of illness". \c\cAs of April 1, 2021, Michigan has administered 4,514,072 COVID-19 vaccine doses. As of that date, 29.2% of the states population has received the first dose while 17.4% has received the second dose. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has announced all residents age 16 years and over will be eligible for the vaccine by April 5, 2021 in accordance with President Joe Bidens order directing states to make it available to all adults by May 1, 2021.
Far-right terrorism in Spain surged after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975 and continued until the early 1980s. The term (Spanish: terrorismo tardofranquista, lit. late Francoist terrorism) refers to the actions undertaken by fascist and far-right groups who were against the changes taking place during the transition to democracy, and essentially dedicated to street violence against persons of other ideologies. \c\cAs a result of their actions, between 66, 77  and 95 people died. Their actions ranged from assassination of individuals to mass murder, and were centered against leftists, although they also murdered citizens with no relation to politics. They used various names, such as Batallón Vasco Español (Basque Spanish Battalion), Guerrilleros de Cristo Rey (Warriors of Christ the King) and Alianza Apostólica Anticomunista (Apostolic Anticommunist Alliance), abbreviated Triple A or AAA, although it has been commonly stated that there were only a few terrorism networks and they created different names as needed.
On April 2, 2021, a car rammed the north barricade outside the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., along Constitution Avenue, killing a Capitol Police officer and injuring another. In response, the Capitol complex was locked down. \c\cThe incident occurred around three months after rioters stormed the Capitol building. Congress was in spring recess, so only few members of Congress were present in the building during the attack.
On April 2, 2021, the Taroko Express train service operated by the Taiwan Railways Administration derailed in Taiwans Hualien County, killing at least 36 people and injuring many others. At the time of the accident, the train was carrying nearly 350 passengers. The eight-carriage train derailed in a tunnel north of Hualien city when a construction truck tumbled down a slope and smashed into the cockpit just as the it entered the tunnel.
COVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines are series of stay-at-home orders and cordon sanitaire measures implemented by the government of the Philippines through its Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). \c\cThe strictest of these community quarantines is the "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ), which effectively is a total lockdown.
The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States is an ongoing mass immunization campaign to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Following the FDAs approval of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 10, 2020, mass vaccinations began on December 14, 2020. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was later approved for use on December 17, 2020, and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was approved for use on February 27, 2021. \c\cThe campaign was initiated by the American government under the presidency of Donald Trump, and transitioned to Joe Biden, who became the new President of the United States on January 20, 2021. He began his term with an immediate goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office, signing an executive order which included increasing supplies for vaccination. This goal was met on March 19, 2021. On March 25, 2021, President Biden announced he would set a new COVID-19 vaccine goal of 200 million shots being given within his first 100 days in office.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Canada was announced on January 25, 2020, involving a traveler who had recently returned to Toronto from travel in China, including Wuhan.  As of November 10, 2020, Ontario has the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among Canadas provinces and territories. \c\cWith increasing transmission province-wide, a state of emergency was declared by Premier Doug Ford on March 17, 2020, including the gradual implementation of restrictions on gatherings and commerce. On April 3, 2020, the province released modelling projecting that over the full course of the pandemic, 100,000 deaths would occur in Ontario with no public health measures and 3,000-15,000 deaths would likely occur with public health measures. \c\cFrom late spring to early summer, the majority of the deaths were residents of long-term care homes. In late April 2020, one out of five of all long-term care homes in Ontario had an outbreak and 70% to 80% of all COVID-19 deaths had been in retirement and long-term care homes. Following medical assistance and observation by the Canadian Armed Forces, the military released a report detailing "a number of medical, professional and technical issues" amongst for-profit long-term-care homes including neglect, lack of equipment and allegations of elder abuse. \c\cFrom May through August 2020, the province instituted a three-stage plan to lift economic restrictions, subject to the employment of social distancing and other guidelines, and continued restrictions on the sizes of gatherings. The state of emergency was lifted on July 24, 2020. A plan was implemented for the return-to-class of public schools, involving more than 2 million children. \c\cIn early September 2020, the province showed a significant increase in new cases, along with similar spikes in provinces across the country. Throughout the month of October, Ontario began to reintroduce some restrictions, with a focus on controlling spikes in the hotspots of Toronto, Peel Region, York Region and Ottawa. The province later rolled back its lifting of restrictions in hotspot regions with temporary measures, referred to as a modified Stage 2. In early November, the province unveiled a new five-tiered colour-coded response framework. The framework was created initially in contradiction to the metrics suggested to political officials by Public Health Ontario and later amended by the province to lower thresholds in each category. From late November to mid-December, the province began placing regions in rolling lockdowns, culminating in a province-wide shutdown beginning Boxing Day. Due to the post-winter holiday surge of new infections, Premier Ford declared Ontarios second state of emergency on January 12, 2021, which was lifted February 10, and a stay-at-home order effective January 14, which was phased out regionally between February 10 and March 8. Regions then returned to individual categories in the response framework. \c\cFollowing Health Canadas approval of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna, widespread plans for vaccinations began during the week of December 14, 2020. Early vaccination efforts were highly criticized. However, the province now leads the nation in doses administered. Due to a shortage of both approved vaccines in late January and early February, vaccinations slowed significantly for a number of weeks. In late February 2021, shipments of the two approved vaccines at the time increased significantly, and on February 26, 2021, Health Canada approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for use and on March 5, 2021 approved the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for a total of four approved vaccines. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines began to be administered in pharmacies and family health practices March 10, 2021. \c\cIn mid-March 2021, the Ontario Hospital Association, Ontario’s COVID-19 scientific advisory table and Ontarios Chief Medical Officer of Health declared the province was experiencing a third wave of the virus. Following the third wave surge, ICU numbers in late March climbed to their highest numbers since the beginning of the pandemic. On April 1, 2021 the government announced a second province wide shutdown beginning April 3.
Tropical Cyclone Seroja is a currently active tropical cyclone that is responsible for a series of large and disastrous flash floods and landslides in Southern Indonesia. The twenty-second tropical low and seventh tropical cyclone of the 2020–21 Australian region cyclone season, the precursor of Seroja formed off the south coast of Timor island as Tropical Low 22U at 18:00 UTC on 3 April. The tropical low moved very slowly near the island, while the systems thunderstorms slowly increased in organization. The low intensified into Tropical Cyclone Seroja by 4 April, while it was passing north of Rote Island, continuing its slow strengthening. \c\cAs of 5 April 2021, it is estimated that more than 97 people have died in both Indonesia and East Timor as a result of the storm, and dozens remain missing, while thousands of people have been displaced. The cyclone damaged or destroyed 77 units of houses and five bridges in Indonesias East Nusa Tenggara province. The scale of the damage in East Timor is currently unknown.
The Battle of Palma was a conflict over control of the city of Palma in Mozambique, between the Mozambique Defence Armed Forces, other Mozambican security forces and private military contractors, and Islamist rebels reportedly associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The battle is part of the insurgency in Cabo Delgado, which started in 2017 and has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, mainly local civilians.
The War in Darfur, also nicknamed the Land Cruiser War, is a major armed conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan that began in February 2003 when the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel groups began fighting the government of Sudan, which they accused of oppressing Darfurs non-Arab population. The government responded to attacks by carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Darfurs non-Arabs. This resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the indictment of Sudans president, Omar al-Bashir, for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. \c\cOne side of the conflict is mainly composed of the Sudanese military, police and the Janjaweed, a Sudanese militia group whose members are mostly recruited among Arabized indigenous Africans and a small number of Bedouin of the northern Rizeigat; the majority of other Arab groups in Darfur remained uninvolved. \c\cThe other side is made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit ethnic groups. The African Union and the United Nations also have a joint peacekeeping mission in the region, named UNAMID. Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supported the Janjaweed, evidence supports claims that it provided financial assistance and weapons and coordinated joint attacks, many against civilians. Estimates of the number of human casualties range up to several hundred thousand dead, from either combat or starvation and disease. Mass displacements and coercive migrations forced millions into refugee camps or across the border, creating a humanitarian crisis. Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell described the situation as a genocide or acts of genocide. \c\cThe Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue peace. The JEM has the most to gain from the talks and could see semi-autonomy much like South Sudan. However, talks were disrupted by accusations that the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the Tolu agreement. The JEM, the largest rebel group in Darfur, vowed to boycott negotiations. \c\cThe August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, signed by military and civilian representatives during the Sudanese Revolution, requires that a peace process leading to a peace agreement be made in Darfur and other regions of armed conflict in Sudan within the first six months of the 39-month transition period to democratic civilian government. \c\cA comprehensive peace agreement was signed on 31 August 2020 between the Sudanese authorities and several rebel factions to end armed hostilities.
The 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis is an ongoing intensification of military tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and its allies and the United States of America and its allies in the Persian Gulf region. Starting in early May 2019, the U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to deter an alleged planned campaign by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. This followed a rise in political tensions between the two countries during the Trump administration, which included the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the imposition of new sanctions against Iran, and the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. In response, Iran designated the United States Central Command as a terrorist organization. \c\cSeveral merchant ships in the Persian Gulf were damaged in two incidents in May and June 2019. Western nations blamed Iran, while Iran denied involvement. In June 2019, Iran shot down an American RQ-4A surveillance drone flying over the Strait of Hormuz, sharply increasing tensions and nearly resulting in an armed confrontation. In July 2019, an Iranian oil tanker was seized by Britain in the Strait of Gibraltar on the grounds that it was shipping oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Iran later captured a British oil tanker and its crew members in the Persian Gulf. Both Iran and the UK later released the ships. Meanwhile, the U.S. created the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), which sought to increase "overall surveillance and security in key waterways in the Middle East", according to the United States Department of Defense. \c\cThe crisis escalated in late 2019 and early 2020 when alleged members of the Kataib Hezbollah militia, part of Iraqs Popular Mobilization Forces, killed an American contractor in an attack on an Iraqi base hosting U.S. personnel. In retaliation, the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Kataib Hezbollahs facilities in Iraq and Syria, killing 25 militiamen. Kataib Hezbollah responded with an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, which prompted the U.S. to deploy hundreds of new troops to the Middle East and announce that it would preemptively target Irans "proxies" in Iraq. Days later, the commander of IRGCs Quds Force Qasem Soleimani and PMF commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were both killed in a U.S. drone strike, resulting in Irans Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei pledging to exact revenge on U.S. forces. The U.S. deployed nearly 4,000 troops in response to the tensions, and Israel heightened its security levels. On 5 January 2020, Iran ended its commitments to the nuclear deal, and the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory. \c\cThe U.S. and Iran nearly entered into an open conflict on 8 January 2020 when the IRGC launched ballistic missile attacks against two military bases in Iraq housing U.S. soldiers in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani, a rare direct Iran–U.S. confrontation and the closest to the brink of war between the two nations in decades. Upon initial assessments of no U.S. casualties, the Trump administration curtailed tensions by temporarily ruling out a direct military response but announcing new sanctions. It was later revealed that more than a hundred U.S. troops sustained injuries during the attacks. During the crisis, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down after departing from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport, and Western officials said the plane had been brought down by an Iranian SA-15 surface-to-air missile. On 11 January 2020, the Iranian military admitted in a statement that they had mistakenly shot down the plane due to human error.
The 2020 Summer Olympics (Japanese: 2020年夏季オリンピック, Hepburn: Nisen Nijū Nijū-ichi-nen Kaki Orinpikku), officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad (Japanese: 第三十二回オリンピック競技大会, Hepburn: Dai Sanjūni-kai Orinpikku Kyōgi Taikai), and also known as. \c\cTokyo 2020 (Japanese: 東京2020, Hepburn: Tōkyō ni-zero-ni-zero), is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to be held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. Originally due to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and will not allow spectators from overseas. Despite being rescheduled for 2021, the event retains the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes. This is the first time that the Olympic Games have been postponed and rescheduled, rather than cancelled. \c\cTokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013. The 2020 Games will mark the second time that Japan—and specifically Tokyo—has hosted the Summer Olympic Games, the first being in 1964, making it the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice. Overall, these will be the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, which also hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972 (Sapporo) and 1998 (Nagano). The 2020 Games will also be the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, the first being in Pyeongchang County, South Korea in 2018, and the next in Beijing, China in 2022. \c\cThe 2020 Games will see the introduction of new competitions including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and madison cycling, as well as further mixed events. Under new IOC policies, which allow the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic programme to augment the permanent core events, these Games will see karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding make their Olympic debuts, as well as the return of baseball and softball for the first time since 2008.
The 2021 Northern Ireland riots are an ongoing series of riots in loyalist areas of Northern Ireland which began in Waterside, Derry on 30 March 2021. After four nights of rioting in loyalist areas of Derry, disturbances spread to south Belfast on 2 April. A loyalist protest developed into a riot involving iron bars, bricks, masonry and petrol bombs. Following this, civil unrest spread to Newtownabbey on 3 April, where cars were hijacked and burnt, with petrol bombs also being used against police. Carrickfergus in southern County Antrim also saw serious civil unrest on the night of 4 April and morning of 5 April, where Ulster loyalists created roadblocks to keep police out of local estates and threw petrol bombs and other incendiary devices at police vehicles.
On April 7, 2021, six people, including two children, were shot at a house in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Phillip Adams, a former National Football League player, has been named as the perpetrator. Five of the shooting victims died, while a sixth remains in critical condition in hospital with serious gunshot wounds. \c\cOn April 8, 2021, the York County Sheriffs Office said in a press conference that the perpetrator was Adams, confirmed by his father Alonzo Adams. A spokesperson for the York County Sheriff’s Office said that the perpetrator had been identified and they are currently in the process of searching his home. Police also say they believe no other perpetrators were involved. According to the coroners' office, Phillip Adams subsequently took his own life by shooting himself with a .45-caliber handgun.
A magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck Indonesia on 10 April 2021, at a depth of 82. km. The earthquake left at least 7 people dead.
The 2021 Grand National (officially known as the Randox 2021 Grand National) was run at 5:15 pm BST on 10 April 2021. It was the 173rd annual running of the Grand National horse race, taking place at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool, England. The event was once again sponsored by Randox Health, although the sponsorship name on the race from this year onwards was shortened to just Randox. \c\cThe race was won by Minella Times, trained by Henry de Bromhead and ridden by Rachael Blackmore, who became the first female jockey to win the Grand National. De Bromhead, who won the race as a trainer for the first time, also trained the second placed finisher Balko des Flos. The winner was owned by J. P. McManus, who had previously won the race as an owner in 2010 with Don't Push It. The Long Mile was euthanized after fracturing a hind leg. \c\cDue to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the race, and the accompanying festival meeting, took place behind closed doors for the first time in its history. Despite speculations and calls from some leading figures in racing for the meeting to be pushed back in the calendar so that it could possibly take place when betting shops are open, it was confirmed the race would retain its original date. \c\cThe meeting was also overshadowed by the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, which was announced shortly before the second day of the meeting began. The meeting continued as scheduled, with tributes including a two-minute silence before racing, jockeys wearing black armbands on their silks as a mark of respect and the Union Jack on the Queen Mother Stand being lowered to half-mast.
On April 11, 2021, in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old African-American man, was shot by police officer Kimberly Potter during a traffic stop. \c\cAccording to Brooklyn Center police, Potter shot him accidentally; she allegedly intended to use her taser but discharged her firearm instead, striking Wright with one shot. After being shot, he drove several blocks before crashing his vehicle into another and hitting a cement barrier. He was pronounced dead at the scene. A medical examiner determined the manner of death to be homicide. \c\cThe shooting sparked protests and demonstrations in Brooklyn Center, leading to a citywide curfew on April 11. Riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and other munitions into crowds of protestors. Demonstrations have also occurred in Minneapolis-St. Paul and in cities across the United States.
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, husband of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, and the longest-serving royal consort in British history, died at the age of 99 on the morning of 9 April 2021, two months before his 100th birthday. The cause of death has not been disclosed by the royal family, though an official statement said he "died peacefully". His funeral is scheduled to take place on 17 April 2021. \c\cThe death of the Duke sets in motion Operation Forth Bridge, a detailed plan covering dissemination of information, national mourning, and his funeral. Though the Duke had indicated wishes for a smaller funeral, amendments were still made to the plan to bring his service in line with COVID-19 regulations, including quarantine for grandson Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex upon his return from the United States. \c\cRepresentatives of nations and groups around the world sent condolences to the Queen, the British people, and citizens of the Commonwealth.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the Marshall Islands is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached the Marshall Islands on 28 October 2020. It is the first country in the Pacific to start its COVID-19 vaccinations in December 2020.
The Daunte Wright riots are an ongoing series of riots and police brutality protests that began in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota in the United States on April 11, 2021. The civil unrest began following the killing of Daunte Wright,  a 20-year-old African-American man who was fatally shot by police officer Kim Potter during a traffic stop. Local protests began in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota before spreading to cities across the United States, including New York City, Los Angeles, Portland, and Seattle.
The Afghan peace process comprises the proposals and negotiations in a bid to end the ongoing war in Afghanistan. Although sporadic efforts have taken place since the war began in 2001, negotiations and the peace movement intensified in 2018 amid talks between the Taliban, which is the main insurgent group fighting against the Afghan government and American troops; and the United States, of which thousands of soldiers maintain a presence within the country to support the Afghan government. Besides the United States, regional powers such as India, China and Russia, as well as NATO play a part in facilitating the peace process. \c\cAs part of the peace process, two peace treaties have been signed so far. On September 22, 2016, the first treaty was signed between the Afghan government and the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin militant group. The second peace treaty was signed between the U.S. and the Taliban on February 29, 2020, which called for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan within 14 months if the Taliban upheld the terms of the agreement. \c\cAfter the agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban, there was a surge in insurgent attacks against Afghan security forces. Peace talks between officials from the Afghan state and the Taliban started in September 2020 in Doha, Qatar, but there has been a rise in civilian casualties in Afghanistan since then. In November 2020, the number of civilian casualties was the highest of any year that month since the United Nations began systematically documenting Afghan casualties in 2009.
On the morning of 23 March 2021, the Suez Canal was blocked after the grounding of Ever Given, a 20,000 TEU container ship. The 400-metre-long (1,300 ft) vessel was buffeted by strong winds, and ended up wedging itself across the waterway, bow and stern stuck in the canal bank, which prevented other vessels from passing through that part of the Suez Canal. The vessel was finally freed six days later. Egyptian authorities said "there may have been technical or human errors" also involved. The obstruction was south of the section of the canal that has two channels, so there was no way for other ships to bypass Ever Given. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) engaged Boskalis through its subsidiary Smit International to manage marine salvage operations. \c\cThe canal is one of the worlds busiest trade routes, and the obstruction had a significant negative impact on trade between Europe and Asia and the Middle East. On 28 March, at least 369 ships were queuing to pass through the canal. This prevented an estimated $9.6 billion worth of trade. On 29 March, Ever Given was partially re-floated and moved by about 80% in the correct direction, although the bow remained stuck until the ship was finally freed by Egyptian, Dutch, and Italian tugs at 15:05 EGY (13:05 UTC) and started moving, under tow, towards the Great Bitter Lake, for technical inspection. The canal was checked for damage, and after being found to be sound, the SCA allowed shipping to resume from 19:00 EGY (17:00 UTC). The vessel was impounded by the Egyptian government on 13 April 2021 for refusing to pay a reported $900 Million in fees demanded by the government.
The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States is an ongoing mass immunization campaign to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Following the FDAs approval of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 10, 2020, mass vaccinations began on December 14, 2020. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was later approved for use on December 17, 2020, and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was approved for use on February 27, 2021. \c\cThe campaign was initiated by the U.S. government under the presidency of Donald Trump, and transitioned to Joe Biden, who became the new President of the United States on January 20, 2021. He began his term with an immediate goal of a hundred million shots in his first hundred days in office, signing an executive order which included increasing supplies for vaccination. This goal was met on March 19, 2021. On March 25, 2021, President Joe Biden announced he would set a new COVID-19 vaccine goal of two hundred million shots being given within his first 100 days in office.
